The respondents completed a questionnaire based on Kellert's (1996) attitude typology toward animals. The results showed that the humanistic attitude type ranked first, followed by the moralistic, ecologistic, naturalistic, negativistic, dominionistic, and utilitarian attitude types. Gender differences appeared on the moralistic and negativistic (girls highest), and the naturalistic, dominionistic, and utilitarian (boys highest) sub-scales. Scores on the ecologistic, naturalistic, and dominionistic sub-scales decreased with increasing age. Urban respondents had higher moralistic, and rural respondents had higher dominionistic sub-scale scores. Respondents who owned a pet had higher humanistic, moralistic, and lower utilitarian sub-scale scores than had non-owners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aattitudes and opinions 3aboys 3achildren 3agender differences 3agirls 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3arural areas 3aNorway1 aØdegårdstuen, Toril S.1 aKaltenborn, Bjørn P.0 tAnthrozoös.g1998 June 1, v. 11, no. 2 p.79-86dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/0892793987870007423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009900165300001100264500001400275520183500289592002802124596005302152596004902205650002502254650002302279650001502302650001202317650000902329650001602338650001502354650001602369650001102385650001102396650001602407650002202423650001702445650001402462650001402476650001202490650001602502650001002518700001802528700002302546700005702569773010502626856008202731852000902813655001202822IND60712664620221118214417.0210210e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071266462DNAL7 a10.1186/s13007-020-0562-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartusch, Kai10aCut and paste: temperature-enhanced cotyledon micrografting for Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings  ap. 12.  aNAL-light  aBACKGROUND: Cotyledon micrografting represents a useful tool for studying the central role of cotyledons during early plant development, especially their interplay with other plant organs with regard to long distance transport. While hypocotyl micrografting methods are well-established, cotyledon micrografting is still inefficient. By optimizing cotyledon micrografting, we aim for higher success rates and increased throughput in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS: We established a cut and paste cotyledon surgery procedure on a flat and solid but moist surface which improved handling of small seedlings. By applying a specific cutting and joining pattern, throughput was increased up to 40 seedlings per hour. The combination of short-day photoperiods and low light intensities for germination and long days plus high light intensities, elevated temperature and vertical plate positioning after grafting significantly increased ‘ligation’ efficiency. In particular high temperatures affected success rates favorably. Altogether, we achieved up to 92% grafting success in A. thaliana. Reconnection of vasculature was demonstrated by transport of a vasculature-specific dye across the grafting site. Phloem and xylem reconnection were completed 3–4 and 4–6 days after grafting, respectively, in a temperature-dependent manner. We observed that plants with grafted cotyledons match plants with intact cotyledons in biomass production and rosette development. CONCLUSIONS: This cut and paste cotyledon-to-petiole micrografting protocol simplifies the handling of plant seedlings in surgery, increases the number of grafted plants per hour and greatly improves success rates for A. thaliana seedlings. The developed cotyledon micrografting method is also suitable for other plant species of comparable size.  aPublisher supplied data  aQu 141/3-2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DE)  aKAW 2016.0274cWallenberg Academy Fellowship 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiomass production 3acotyledons 3acutting 3adyes 3agermination 3ahypocotyls 3amethodology 3amodels 3aphloem 3aphotoperiod 3aplant development 3aplant organs 3aprotocols 3aseedlings 3asurgery 3atemperature 3axylem1 aTrenner, Jana1 aMelnyk, Charles W.1 aQuint, Marcel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2935-40830 tPlant methods.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.12-12dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-020-0562-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01432naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010500161500002200266520053300288592002800821650002100849650001800870650001700888650001100905650002600916700002000942773008900962856008201051852000901133655001201142IND60684727020221122061901.0200221e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068472702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2020.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei10aSame Concept Different Outcomes: Sugars Determine Circadian Clock Protein Fate in Animals and Plants  aPre-press version  aThe circadian clocks of plants and animals are recruiting similar cellular systems to regulate PTMs of circadian clock proteins, but distinctions remain. Circadian clocks in both autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms can be refined by PTM cascades, but the same PTMs can have different functional outcomes. The role of protein glycosylation is a clear example of this dichotomy, where circadian clock transcription factors in plants and animals are modified by sugars but this results in opposite effects on protein stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircadian clocks 3aglycosylation 3aheterotrophs 3asugars 3atranscription factors1 aGendron, Joshua0 tMolecular plant.g2020 Feb. 20, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2020.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008600170300001600256520105100272592002801323650001201351650002701363650001001390650002301400650000901423650001501432650001901447650001501466650001501481650001101496650001401507650002301521653000901544653000801553653001001561653001001571653000901581653000901590653002101599653001201620653002301632653003201655700002801687773010001715856008701815852000901902655001201911IND60526030420221119204059.0190402e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052603042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.12.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotsiou, Kali10aMonitoring the phenolic compounds of Greek extra-virgin olive oils during storage  ap. 255-262.  aExtra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples, of five Greek olive varieties, were stored in dark glass bottles (headspace 0.5%) in a basement without central heating for 24months. Quantitative variations of the phenolic compounds and their degradation products were monitored over time. The differences observed in the initial total phenolic compounds concentration (ranging between 250.77 and 925.75mg/kg) were attributed to extraction system, olive variety, and maturity stage. Even after 24months, the degree of reduction in total phenolic compounds did not exceed 31%. The reduction was more pronounced in dialdehydic forms of oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones (DAFOA and DAFLA), indicating a more active participation in the hydrolysis and oxidation processes of the more polar secoiridoids. The initial total phenolic content was the main factor correlated to the degradation rate of the phenolic compounds. The decrease in secoiridoid derivatives, gave rise to hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol content and to the formation of four oxidized products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottles 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3aglass 3aheadspace analysis 3aheat 3ahydrolysis 3amaturity stage 3amonitoring 3aoleuropein 3aolives 3aoxidation 3aphenolic compounds 0aEVOO 0aVOO 0aDAFOA 0aDAFLA 0aAFOA 0aAFLA 0aVirgin olive oil 0aStorage 0aPhenolic compounds 0aPhenolic oxidation products1 aTasioula-Margari, Maria0 tFood chemistry.g2016 June 01, v. 200 p.255-262dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.12.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011800163520150100281592002801782650002701810650002801837650002301865650003101888650001001919650001801929650001301947650001101960650001001971650002201981650001402003650002202017650001802039650002002057650001602077650001402093653001002107653000902117653000802126653002702134653001302161653001802174653002202192653001002214700001902224700001402243700001602257700001802273700001702291700002002308773012002328856008202448852000902530655001202539IND60684727120221122053013.0200913e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068472712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbd.2020.1006752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaolu10aTranscriptome analysis of phototransduction-related genes in tentacles of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus  aThe sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka)is a typical nocturnal echinoderm, which is believed to be almost completely dependent on light intensity for the regulation of endogenous rhythms. Under conditions of high light intensity, this species shows clear evidence of light avoidance behavior, seeking out shaded areas of reef in which to reside. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis to examine the tentacle transcriptome of A. japonicus specimens that had been subjected to dark and light (5 min and 1 h) conditions. We specifically focused on detecting genes involved in opsin-based light perception, including opsins and members of phototransduction-related pathways. On the basis of comparisons with both vertebrate and invertebrate phototransduction pathways, we determined that components of two of the main metazoan phototransduction pathways were altered in response to illumination. Among the key phototransduction-related genes in tentacles, we identified retinol dehydrogenase, members of the dehydrogenase/reductase family, and myosin III, and also detected a pair of visual pigment-like receptors, peropsin and peropsin-like, the homologous genes of which are believed to have the same function but show opposite expression patterns in response to different light environments. In general, the up-regulation of key genes in sea cucumber exposed to illumination indicated that the tentacles can respond to differences in the light environment at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3aavoidance behavior 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainvertebrates 3alighting 3amyosin 3aopsin 3aphototransduction 3areceptors 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3avertebrates 3avitamin A 0aGAPDH 0aqPCR 0aSRA 0aApostichopus japonicus 0aTentacle 0aTranscriptome 0aPhototransduction 0aOpsin1 aLin, Chenggang1 aSun, Lina1 aLiu, Shilin1 aSun, Jingchun1 aZhang, Libin1 aYang, Hongsheng0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2020 June, v. 34 p.100675-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2020.1006753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245011700182300001600299520060000315592002800915650002500943650002900968650001600997650003701013650002001050650001401070650002001084651001601104653004401120653001301164653001501177653001601192700002701208700002301235773011701258856008801375852000901463655001201472IND60540126520221120142541.0190318e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054012652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraghi, Peyman Eghtesadi10aDistribution and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the surface sediments of Gorgan Bay, Caspian Sea  ap. 494-498.  aThe level and source of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated in the surface sediments from the Gorgan Bay, Caspian Sea.

Since the gene MONOCULM 1 (MOC 1) was first characterized as a key regulator in controlling rice tillering and branching, great progress has been achieved in identifying important genes associated with grain yield, elucidating the genetic basis of yield-related traits. Some of these important genes were shown to be applicable for molecular breeding of high-yielding rice. This review focuses on recent advances, with emphasis on rice tillering and panicle branching genes, and their regulatory networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abranching 3abreeding 3afood crops 3agenes 3agrain yield 3ainflorescences 3arice 3astaple foods 3atillering 0aQTLs 0aMOC 1 0aLS/LAS 0aAMs 0atad1 0ate 0aAPC/C 0alax 0aSPA 0aTB1 0aMAX 0aD14 0aSL 0aFC1 0aBRs 0aBIN2 0aIPA1 0aWFP 0aOsSPL14 0aDEP 0aUFO 0aAPO1 0aSNB 0aIDS1 0asp1 0aLRR 0aRice 0aTillering gene 0aPanicle branching gene 0aRegulation1 aShang, Fei1 aLin, Qun-ting1 aLou, Chen1 aZhang, Jing0 tGene.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 537 p.1-5dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245019800205300001600403506007600419520150100495592002801996506003702024650000802061650001802069650000802087650001602095650001702111650001902128650002202147650004202169650001102211650001302222650001502235650002302250650001502273650001402288650003502302700001902337700001902356700001802375700001902393700002302412773010402435856007302539852000902612655001202621IND60691294520221207074656.0200428e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069129452DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.293042doi7 aPMC41799562pmcid7 a249224822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurchinovich, Andrey10aCapture and Amplification by Tailing and Switching (CATS)bAn ultrasensitive ligation-independent method for generation of DNA libraries for deep sequencing from picogram amounts of DNA and RNA  ap. 817-828.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMassive parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies have paved the way into new areas of research including individualized medicine. However, sequencing of trace amounts of DNA or RNA still remains a major challenge, especially for degraded nucleic acids like circulating DNA. This together with high cost and time requirements impedes many important applications of MPS in medicine and fundamental science. We have established a fast, cheap and highly efficient protocol called ‘Capture and Amplification by Tailing and Switching’ (CATS) to directly generate ready-to-sequence libraries for MPS from nanogram and picogram quantities of both DNA and RNA. Furthermore, those DNA libraries are strand-specific, can be prepared within 2–3 h and do not require preliminary sample amplification steps. To exemplify the capacity of the technique, we have generated and sequenced DNA libraries from hundred-picogram amounts of circulating nucleic acids isolated from human blood plasma, one nanogram of mRNA-enriched total RNA from cultured cells and few nanograms of bisulfite-converted DNA. The approach for DNA library preparation from minimal and fragmented input described here will find broad application in diverse research areas such as translational medicine including therapy monitoring, prediction, prognosis and early detection of various human disorders and will permit high-throughput DNA sequencing from previously inaccessible material such as minute forensic and archeological samples.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA libraries 3aRNA 3aarchaeology 3ablood plasma 3acultured cells 3aforensic sciences 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3amedicine 3amonitoring 3aprecision medicine 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3atranslational medical research1 aSurowy, Harald1 aServa, Andrius1 aZapatka, Marc1 aLichter, Peter1 aBurwinkel, Barbara0 tRNA biology.g2014 July 1, v. 11, no. 7 p.817-828dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.293043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001200169245009500181300001600276500001500292520130000307592002801607650002201635650001201657650001101669650001401680650001301694650001601707650001801723650001001741650001201751650002201763650000801785650001801793650002401811650001201835650001801847650002501865650002201890650002801912650001401940650002101954650004401975650002302019650003602042651001002078651001002088653001102098653001702109653002402126653002202150700001602172700001702188700001202205700001802217700001902235700001502254773011502269856008502384852000902469655001202478IND60099515120221122132155.0190412e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009951512DNAL7 a234539872pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2013.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hui10aGenetic diversity and molecular evolution of the rabies virus matrix protein gene in China  ap. 248-253.  a2019-12-06  aTo investigate the diversity of rabies virus (RABV) matrix protein (M) gene in the current Chinese rabies epidemic, we fully examined M gene of 63 street RABVs (Virus isolated from naturally infected animals), and performed phylogenetic and mutational analysis. Our results indicate that the Chinese RABV M gene is well conserved with 90.6% to 100% amino acid similarity. Analysis of the mutations indicates that the sequences can be divided into four groups with each group defined by distinct substitutions. The PPxY motif and residue E58, which are essential for efficient virus production and pathogenicity, were completely conserved. The estimated mean rate of nucleotide substitution was 4.6×10−4 substitutions per site per year, and the estimated average time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was 265years ago based on the M gene of Chinese street RABVs, which are similar to previously reported values for the glycoprotein (G) and nucleoprotein (N) gene. This indicates that the genomic RNA of RABVs circulating worldwide is stable; G, N and M genes are evolving at a similar rate. This study showed that although the Chinese RABV strains could be divided into distinct clades based on the phylogenetic analysis, their functional domains of M proteins were highly conserved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRabies lyssavirus 3aanimals 3arabies 3aphylogeny 3amutation 3aamino acids 3apathogenicity 3agenes 3aviruses 3agenetic variation 3aRNA 3aglycoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRabiesxvirology 2aRabies virusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aViral Matrix Proteinsxgenetics 3aChina 0aChina 0aM gene 0aRabies virus 0aMolecular evolution 0aGenetic diversity1 aWang, Lihua1 aTao, Xiaoyan1 aLi, Hao1 aRayner, Simon1 aLiang, Guodong1 aTang, Qing0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2013 June, v. 16 p.248-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010200156300001400258520145900272592002801731650002801759650002901787650002401816650001101840650001401851650001701865650001101882650001301893650002101906650001901927650000701946650002001953650003301973650001402006650002502020650002302045700001602068700001402084700001302098700001902111773012402130856007402254852000902328655001202337IND60132287120221120173530.0150505e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013228712DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.122052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhijian10aEffect of Lactobacillus Plantarum DM616 on Dough Fermentation and Chinese Steamed Bread Quality  ap. 30-37.  aThis study investigated the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum DM616 on dough fermentation for making Chinese steamed bread. Dough fermentation was carried out via inoculation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae as monoculture, or in combination with L. plantarum DM616 as co‐culture. The presence of L. plantarum DM616 caused faster depletion of reducing sugars and had little effect on the maximum specific growth rate (μₘₐₓ) and final cfu/g sourdough of S. cerevisiae. In co‐culture, the pH of the dough varied from 3.2 to 3.5 and the total titratable acids developed to 9.2 after 24 h of fermentation. L. plantarum DM616 did not significantly suppressed the leavening capacity of the S. cerevisiae. Scanning electron microscopy results showed that the microstructure of the co‐culture fermented dough presented a more continuous gluten network structure, as compared with the monoculture sample. A positive effect of L. plantarum DM616 on the hardness and whiteness of steamed bread was observed after 16 h of fermentation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Lactobacillus plantarum DM616 isolated from traditional leavening agents can be used for dough fermentation for making Chinese steamed bread. Application of DM616 could improve the hardness and whiteness properties of steamed bread. The research provided useful information for the suitability of co‐culture in sourdough fermentation for production of steamed bread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3acoculture 3afermentation 3agluten 3ahardness 3aleavening agents 3amicrostructure 3apH 3areducing sugars 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asourdough 3aspecific growth rate 3atitratable acidity1 aLi, Haifeng1 aDeng, Cui1 aBian, Ke1 aLiu, Changhong0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2015 Feb., v. 39, no. 1 p.30-37dFood & Nutrition Press.x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.122053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04273naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011400170300001300284520262000297592002802917650001302945650000802958650001702966650002502983650001103008650001903019650002503038650002003063650001103083650001703094650002303111650002303134650001903157650001303176650002103189650000903210650000903219650002003228650001503248650002103263650001803284650001903302650002103321650001203342653002303354653002103377653002303398653001803421653001403439653002203453700001303475700001303488773007503501856008603576852000903662655001203671IND60539367020221116165225.0160815e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053936702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMordhorst, A.10aInfluence of mechanical loading on static and dynamic CO2 efflux on differently textured and managed Luvisols  ap. 1-13.  aMechanical disturbance of soil structure is commonly related to altered physical changes in pore systems, which control CO2 effluxes e.g. by changes in gas transport properties and in microbial activity. Soil compaction mostly leads to reduced CO2 fluxes. In contrast, structured soils can also release physically entrapped CO2 or give access to protected carbon sources inside aggregates due to aggregate breakdown by disruptive forces. In this study it was investigated how far arable soil management affects structure- and compaction-related CO2-releases using incubation experiments and CO2 gas analysis under standard matric potentials (−6kPa). CO2 efflux was analyzed before, during and after mechanical loading using the alkali trap method (static efflux) and a gas flow compaction device (GaFloCoD, dynamic efflux). Intact soil cores (236 and 471cm3) were collected from a Stagnic Luvisol with loamy sand (conservation and conventional tillage systems) and a Haplic Luvisol with clayey silt (under different fodder crops) from the topsoil (10–15cm) and subsoil (35–45cm). Mechanical stability was reflected by the pre-compression stress value (Pc) and by the tensile strength of aggregates (12–20mm). Changes in pore systems were described by air conductivity as well as air capacity and total porosity. While CO2-releases varied highly during the compaction process (GaFloCoD) for different stress magnitudes, soil depths and management systems, basal respiration rates were generally reduced after mechanical loading by almost half of the initial rates irrespective of soil management. For both methods (dynamic and static efflux) restriction in gas transport functionality was proved to have major influence on inhibition of CO2 efflux due to mechanical loading. GaFloCoD experiments demonstrated that decreases in CO2 efflux were linked to structural degradation of pore systems by exceeding internal soil strength (Pc). Otherwise, re-equilibrating matric potentials to −6kPa and re-incubating offset inhibition of soil respiration suggest a re-enhancement of microbial activity. At this state, physical influences were apparently overlapped by biological effects due to higher energy supply to microbes, which could be offered by spatial distribution changes of microorganisms and organic substrates within a given soil structure. This implies the susceptibility of physical protection mechanism for carbon by disruption of soil structure. In future, special focus should be given on a clear distinction between physical and microbiological effects controlling CO2 fluxes in structured soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3aair 3aarable soils 3abioactive properties 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aconventional tillage 3adisturbed soils 3aenergy 3aforage crops 3amanagement systems 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3aporosity 3arespiratory rate 3asand 3asilt 3asoil compaction 3asoil depth 3asoil respiration 3asoil strength 3asoil structure 3atensile strength 3atopsoil 0aDynamic CO2 efflux 0aSoil respiration 0aMechanical loading 0aSoil strength 0aPre-crops 0aTillage intensity1 aPeth, S.1 aHorn, R.0 tGeoderma.g2014 May, v. 219-220 p.1-13dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003500152245018000187300001600367520115500383592002801538650001501566650001301581650001301594650001201607650001301619650001701632650001301649650001201662650002601674650001001700650001801710650001901728650001201747650001501759651000901774653001601783653002601799653002001825653002001845700002201865700001701887700001601904700002901920773007801949856008602027852000902113655001202122IND60539367120221116165330.0160815e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053936712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarimi Nezhad, Mohammad Tahsin10aCadmium and mercury in topsoils of Babagorogor watershed, western Iran: Distribution, relationship with soil characteristics and multivariate analysis of contamination sources  ap. 177-185.  aThe main objectives of this study were to identify spatial variability and main sources of cadmium and mercury in rural soils of Babagorgor watershed. A total of 87 composite soil samples were collected in an area of about 1352km2. The average concentrations of the analyzed elements in topsoil were 3.289mgCd/kg and 0.632mgHg/kg. To identify the sources of heavy metals, we used: (a) the relationship between the heavy metal content in soils and the origin of the parent material; (b) the comparison of heavy metal in soils among different land uses; and (c) the heavy metal distribution in the study area. The results indicated that land use had no significant effect on Cd and Hg concentrations, and that the concentrations of Cd and Hg were primarily controlled by the parent materials of soils. High Cd concentrations in soils can be explained by occurrence of the magmatic rocks in the area. Mercury concentrations were associated with areas characterized geomorphologically as alluvial deposits at the lowest altitudes within the region. In fact, high adsorption of Hg with silt fraction allowed for its migration towards the drainage network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalluvium 3aaltitude 3acadmium 3adrainage 3aheavy metals 3aland use 3amercury 3amultivariate analysis 3arocks 3asilt fraction 3asoil pollution 3atopsoil 3awatersheds 3aIran 0aHeavy metal 0aMultivariate analysis 0aParent material 0aSoil properties1 aMohammadi, Khosro1 aGholami, Ali1 aHani, Abbas1 aShariati, Mohammad Sediq0 tGeoderma.g2014 May, v. 219-220 p.177-185dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008500169300001600254520070500270592002800975650001301003650001401016650002801030650000901058650001701067650002501084650001301109650001201122700002001134773010501154856004801259852000901307655001201316IND4475805820221117083758.0121003e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447580582DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-010-9357-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Andres N.10aDevelopment of fifty-one novel EST-SSR loci for use in rockfish (genus Sebastes)  ap. 335-340.  aWe mined expressed sequence tag libraries from three species of rockfish (Sebastes caurinus, S. goodei, and S. rastrelliger) for microsatellites.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SW and SWB were applied at four N-based amendment levels, namely control (0 mg N kg⁻¹), low (1.1 mg N kg⁻¹), medium (2.2 mg N kg⁻¹), and high (4.4 mg N kg⁻¹). Twenty-five milliliters of C₂H₂ gas were injected into each storage bottle to inhibit autotrophic nitrification in soil. At the end of the preincubation period, 160 mg kg⁻¹ ¹⁵N-glycine were added to each storage bottle to stimulate heterotrophic nitrification in soil. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results showed that SW increased the NH₄⁺-N content by 3.5 to 17.5 mg kg⁻¹ in both soils, while SWB decreased it by 0.1 to 4.7 mg kg⁻¹ compared to control group, regardless of whether autotrophic nitrification was inhibited. Both SW and SWB enhanced NO₃⁻-N accumulation in the two soils compared to control group when autotrophic nitrification was not inhibited; however, NO₃⁻-N concentration in the soil with SWB was up to 24% lower than that with the same level of SW addition. NH₃ volatilization rates were elevated at all the SW and SWB amendment levels, although only SW led to higher N₂O emission rates. Compared with SW, high level of SWB significantly decreased N₂O emissions by 78 to 84% in the loam and clay loam soils. The increase in NH₃ volatilization, soil NO₃⁻-N accumulation, and autotrophic nitrification rate were greater with SW than with SWB. Higher rates of soil heterotrophic nitrification were observed in SWB-amended soils than in SW-amended soils with a high (4.4 mg N kg⁻¹) amendment level. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SWB is less likely to increase NO₃⁻-N accumulation in soil and contributes more to the lower soil autotrophic nitrification rate compared with SW. Although SWB can promote heterotrophic nitrification, it generally inhibits the autotrophic nitrification process and slows the increment pace of the gross nitrification in paddy soils.  aPublisher supplied data  aLY18D010007cZhejiang Province Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project  a2014ZX07101-012cNational Foundation for Science and Technology Development  a2018ZX07208009cMajor Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment 3aacetylene 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochar 3aclay loam soils 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apaddy soils 3apig manure 3astable isotopes 3avolatilization1 aLiang, Xinqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3521-97611 aHe, Shuang1 aLi, Meiru1 aCao, Yucheng1 aZhang, Jin1 aTian, Guangming0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2020 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.629-640dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02445-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002900186245009000215300001300305500001500318506007600333520168800409592002802097506003702125650001702162650001802179650001102197650001702208650002902225650001902254650003002273650001202303653001002315700002202325700001902347773010602366856007902472852000902551655001202560IND60119557220221207115252.0141214e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011955722DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2006-7-9-r862doi7 aPMC17945412pmcid7 a170050472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan de Lagemaat, Louie N10aMultiple effects govern endogenous retrovirus survival patterns in human gene introns  ap. 1354.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs) have a significant antisense bias when located in gene introns, suggesting strong negative selective pressure on such elements oriented in the same transcriptional direction as the enclosing gene. It has been assumed that this bias reflects the presence of strong transcriptional regulatory signals within LTRs but little work has been done to investigate this phenomenon further. RESULTS: In the analysis reported here, we found significant differences between individual human ERV families in their prevalence within genes and degree of antisense bias and show that, regardless of orientation, ERVs of most families are less likely to be found in introns than in intergenic regions. Examination of density profiles of ERVs across transcriptional units and the transcription signals present in the consensus ERVs suggests the importance of splice acceptor sites, in conjunction with splice donor and polyadenylation signals, as the major targets for selection against most families of ERVs/LTRs. Furthermore, analysis of annotated human mRNA splicing events involving ERV sequence revealed that the relatively young human ERVs (HERVs), HERV9 and HERV-K (HML-2), are involved in no human mRNA splicing events at all when oriented antisense to gene transcription, while elements in the sense direction in transcribed regions show considerable bias for use of strong splice sites. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest suppression of splicing among young intronic ERVs oriented antisense to gene transcription, which may account for their reduced mutagenicity and higher fixation rate in gene introns.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRetroviridae 3amessenger RNA 3ahumans 3amutagenicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3aintergenic DNA 3aterminal repeat sequences 3aintrons 0agenes1 aMedstrand, Patrik1 aMager, Dixie L0 tGenome biology.g2006 Sept., v. 7, no. 9 p.1354-1354dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-9-r863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009700163300001600260520172800276592002802004596004502032596004502077650003502122650001202157650002302169650001902192650001202211650001702223650001802240650001502258650001302273650001802286650002902304650002402333650002502357650001302382700001702395700001902412700001502431700005602446773013602502856008202638852000902720655001202729IND60683949720221122053151.0200214e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068394972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-019-02442-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chaoyu10aGrowth of comammox Nitrospira is inhibited by nitrification inhibitors in agricultural soils  ap. 621-628.  aPURPOSE: The discovery of comammox Nitrospira being capable of complete oxidising ammonia to nitrate radically challenged the conventional concept of two-step nitrification. However, the response of comammox Nitrospira to nitrification inhibitors (NIs) and their role in soil nitrification remain largely unknown, which has hindered our ability to predict the efficiency of NIs in agroecosystems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the effect of four NIs, 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine (nitrapyrin), 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), allylthiourea (ATU) and dicyandiamide (DCD) on the growth of comammox Nitrospira, ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) in two pasture and arable soils. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The amendment of nitrogen fertiliser significantly increased soil nitrate concentrations over time, indicating a sustaining nitrification activity in both soils. The addition of all the four NIs effectively reduced the production of nitrate in both soils, but to varying degrees during incubation. The abundances of comammox Nitrospira clade A were significantly increased by addition of nitrogen fertilisers and significantly impeded by the four NIs in the pasture soil, but their abundances were only remarkably hindered by nitrapyrin in the arable soil. All the four NIs obviously inhibited the AOB abundances in both soils. Except for DMPP, the other three NIs effectively suppressed the AOA abundances in both soils. CONCLUSIONS: We provided new evidence that growth of comammox Nitrospira clade A can be stimulated by nitrogen fertilisers and inhibited by various nitrification inhibitors, suggesting their potential role in nitrification of agricultural soils.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP160101028cAustralian Research Council  aLP160101134cAustralian Research Council 3a3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate 3aArchaea 3aagricultural soils 3aagroecosystems 3aammonia 3aarable soils 3adicyandiamide 3anitrapyrin 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apastures1 aHu, Hang-Wei1 aChen, Qing-Lin1 aChen, Deli1 aHe, Ji-Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9169-80580 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2020 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.621-628dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02442-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003600140245008700176300001400263520142800277592002801705650001301733650001401746650002101760650001001781650001501791650000901806650001401815650001801829650001301847650000901860650000701869650001201876650001101888650002301899650002201922650000901944650002201953650001201975650001601987650002302003650002502026650001902051700002402070700003002094700003002124700002602154773012402180856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60132287620221120153748.0150505e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013228762DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.122092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves de Oliveira, Emanuel Neto10aPhysicochemical Stability of Diet Umbu‐Caja Jams Stored under Ambient Conditions  ap. 70-79.  aThe aim of this study was to develop and assess the physicochemical stability of umbu‐caja diet jams during storage under ambient conditions. Five jam formulations were prepared, with varying concentrations of aspartame (0.055, 0.065 and 0.075%) and low methoxyl pectin (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5%). In addition to umbu‐caja pulp, edulcorant and pectin, calcium chloride and potassium sorbate were used. The formulations were concentrated in an open saucepan until reaching total soluble solids (TSS) of 12.5°Brix, transferred to glass containers and stored at mean temperature and relative humidity of 23.25C and 81%, respectively, with physicochemical analyses at day 0 and every 30 days of storage up to 180 days. It was found that storage did not cause significant alterations in the relative humidity, total solids, water activity, TSS and extrusion. Data related to total soluble solids/total titratable acidity (TSS/TTA), pH and hardness increased significantly, whereas TTA and color parameters were reduced. Moreover, the jams were considerably darkened at the end of storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This paper presents an alternative for conservation of umbu‐caja fruit (Spondias spp.), through the development of energy‐reduced jams. This preservation method makes it possible to provide a new product in the food industry, especially geared for people with restrictions on sucrose or those who want to do diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpondias 3aaspartame 3acalcium chloride 3acolor 3acontainers 3adiet 3aextrusion 3afood industry 3ahardness 3ajams 3apH 3apectins 3apeople 3apotassium chloride 3apotassium sorbate 3apulp 3arelative humidity 3asucrose 3atemperature 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3awater activity1 aCosta Santos, Dyego1 aGomes, Josivanda Palmeira1 aRocha, Ana Paula Trindade1 aSilva, Wilton Pereira0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2015 Feb., v. 39, no. 1 p.70-79dFood & Nutrition Press.x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.122093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010600169520090700275592002801182650002001210650002401230650001401254650002201268650002401290650002201314650001701336650001301353650001801366650001801384653001801402653000901420653002701429653001601456653003301472700001801505700001701523700001601540700001601556700001701572700001601589773010801605856008601713852000901799655001201808IND60758849820221119161541.0220531e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075884982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1189462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Junchai10aRoom temperature preparation of cellulose nanocrystals with high yield via a new ZnCl2 solvent system  aHere, a facile method to fabricate cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with high yield from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) at room temperature (RT) is achieved by using a new solvent system of zinc chloride (ZnCl₂) and a little amount of hydrochloric acid (HCl). Compared with sulphuric acid hydrolysis process, about one-fifth mole of acid is used for per gram of CNCs in our protocol. CNCs with rod-like morphology are regenerated with a maximum yield of 35.2% and high crystallinity of 73.8%. Moreover, with an additional 2 h of ball-milling, the yield of CNCs could significantly increase to 66.9% at RT. The possible formation mechanism for CNCs prepared by the solvent system of ZnCl₂/HCl is proposed. As the first example of isolation of CNCs with high yield at RT using ZnCl₂, this work provides a facile, energy-saving, and practical strategy for the preparation of cellulose nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3aambient temperature 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aenergy conservation 3ahydrochloric acid 3ananocrystals 3asolvents 3asulfuric acid 3azinc chloride 0aZinc chloride 0aAcid 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aDissolution 0aRoom temperature preparation1 aDeng, Mengwei1 aLi, Shuaiyao1 aGuan, Zheng1 aXia, Yixuan1 aYang, Jinhui1 aLin, Xiaobo0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 278 p.118946-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1189463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170300001800284500001900302520092800321536010401249592002801353596001301381650001301394650001101407650001601418653002301434653001301457653003201470653001801502653001601520700002501536773013401561856008501695852000901780655001201789IND60706937820221119124433.0200811e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070693782DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2019.16458932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowater, David13aAn open-source web service for creating quadrilateral grids based on the rHEALPix Discrete Global Grid System  ap. 1055-1071.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe foundation of modern Digital Earth frameworks is the Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS). To standardize the DGGS model, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) recently created the DGGS Abstract Specification, which also aims to increase usability and interoperability between DGGSs. To support these demands and aid future research, open implementations are necessary. However, several OGC conformant DGGSs are not available for researchers to use. This has motivated us to develop an open-source web service that allows users to create quadrilateral grids based on the rHEALPix DGGS. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the web service, including issues and limitations, and demonstrate how discrete global grids and regional grids can be created. Lastly, we present examples that show how vector data sets can be modeled and integrated at different levels of resolution – a key benefit of the DGGS model.  aThis work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC-DG).  aPublisher supplied data  aNSERC-DG 3aInternet 3amodels 3avector data 0aQuadrilateral grid 0arHEALPix 0aDiscrete Global Grid System 0aDigital Earth 0aweb service1 aStefanakis, Emmanuel0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2020 Sept. 1, v. 13, no. 9 p.1055-1071dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2019.16458933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010400167300001400271520082400285592002801109650003901137650001701176650002601193650001801219650001001237650002201247650002101269650002801290651001501318653002601333653002901359653002501388653001501413700002101428700001801449700002201467773014701489856008001636852000901716655001201725IND60562060420221121040320.0180621e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056206042DNAL7 a10.1515/vjbsd-2016-00092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaujanov, Azizbek10aCost-Benefit Analysis of Conservation Agriculture Implementation in Syrdarya Province of Uzbekistan  ap. 48-52.  aMost irrigated lands of Central Asia suffer from land degradation, and unsustainable agricultural practices are one of the factors contributing to land degradation. Conservation agriculture (CA) is seen as a way to mitigate land degradation and rationalize resource use. The aim of this article is to investigate the efficiency of CA implementation in the Syrdarya province of Uzbekistan, Central Asia by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The CBA was conducted for a hypothetical situation where the farm decides to switch from conventional agriculture to CA. Unlike the previous studies, this study investigates complete crop rotation cycle in the long-term period. The study outcomes suggest that investment in CA implementation results in positive incremental benefit if the advantages of CA are monetized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural conservation practice 3abioeconomics 3acost benefit analysis 3acrop rotation 3afarms 3airrigated farming 3aland degradation 3asustainable development 3aUzbekistan 0acost-benefit analysis 0aconservation agriculture 0apermanent bed system 0aUzbekistan1 aGroeneveld, Rolf1 aPulatov, Alim1 aHeijman, Wim J.M.0 tVisegrad journal on bioeconomy and sustainable development.g2016 Nov. 1, v. 5, no. 2 p.48-52dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21371x1339-33677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/vjbsd-2016-00093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245015000159300001600309520109300325592002801418650001101446650002201457650001401479650002301493650002001516650002101536650002201557650001301579650002201592650001801614650001801632650001701650653001801667653003301685653002201718653000901740653003401749700001601783700001301799700001201812700001301824700001201837700001301849773009601862856008201958852000902040655001202049IND60553499320221120124902.0170502e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055349932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.07.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Na10aHighly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of alpha fetoprotein based on PdNi nanoparticles and N-doped graphene nanoribbons  ap. 786-791.  aAn ultrasensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was designed for the quantitative detection of alpha fetoprotein (AFP). The β-cyclodextrins functionalized graphene sheets (CD-GS) were used as the sensing matrix for immobilizing adamantine-1-carboxylic acid functionalized primary anti-AFP (ADA–Ab1) and enhanced the electron transfer. PdNi alloy nanoparticles decorated N-doped graphene nanoribbons (PdNi/N-GNRs) were used as labels of secondary anti-AFP (Ab2), and PdNi alloy nanoparticles (PdNi NPs) exhibited high catalytic performance towards the reduction of H2O2. Meanwhile, with good dispersion, large specific surface area and good catalytic performance, N-doped graphene nanoribbons (N-GNRs) significantly amplified the electrochemical signal. Under the optimal conditions, the electrochemical immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range of 0.0001–16ng/mL with a low detection limit of 0.03pg/mL. Additionally, the proposed immunosensor showed high specificity, good reproducibility and long-term stability, which have promising application in bioassay analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abioassays 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunosensors 3ananoparticles 3asurface area 0aSandwich-type 0aElectrochemical immunosensor 0aAlpha fetoprotein 0aPdNi 0aN-doped graphene nanoribbons.1 aMa, Hongmin1 aCao, Wei1 aWu, Dan1 aYan, Tao1 aDu, Bin1 aWei, Qin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 74 p.786-791dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.07.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03572naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010500177300001400282520200800296592002802304650002202332650001102354650002502365650002002390650002602410650000902436650001602445650002302461650001902484650001302503650001902516650001102535650000902546650001502555650001302570650002002583650001102603650001502614650001302629650001802642653002002660653001402680653002502694653002002719653002502739653001302764653001902777700001702796700002002813773007802833856008602911852000902997655001203006IND60539367620221116165027.0160815e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053936762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleimeier, Christian10aSuitability of degraded peat for constructed wetlands — Hydraulic properties and nutrient flushing  ap. 25-32.  aNitrate removal from runoff from agricultural land is in general required to reach a “good chemical status” of surface and groundwater bodies according to the European Water Framework Directive. Removing nitrates via heterotrophic denitrification is highly effective but requires stable anoxic environmental conditions as well as available organic carbon as electron donator. Constructed wetlands (CWs), established on peat soils, through which the nitrate-loaded water is routed, may provide denitrification favorable conditions. To study nitrate turnover, hydraulic properties and possible negative side effects of CWs on formerly drained fens, we developed a mesocosm experiment with vertical flow and an open water surface. The first flushing of nitrate during the exchange of the initial pore volume was quantified with 0.58g NO3–Nkg−1 organic substance. Both nitrate and sulfate were released faster and in higher concentrations than DOC and with a ratio corresponding to the composition of the peat. Redox potential measurements revealed that denitrifying conditions established in certain soil depths after roughly 40days of continuous flux. Transport properties were obtained from analyzing tracer breakthrough curves. It could be demonstrated that the degraded peat had a dual porosity structure. Subjected to nitrate enriched water for two years, the immobile pore water fraction increased from 40 to 80% probably because of physical consolidation processes and microbial activity and subsequent clogging of pores. This was not considered as negative since denitrification processes are believed to preferably operate in immobile, oxygen depleted water regions. We concluded that the first flushing of mineralized nitrate upon rewetting after onset of flux may compromise any positive clean up and nitrate removal effects occurring during long-term operation of peat-wetlands. It is thus advisable to recycle the water during early stages of the establishment of constructed wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acarbon 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental factors 3afens 3agroundwater 3amicrobial activity 3amineralization 3anitrates 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apeat 3apeat soils 3aporosity 3aredox potential 3arunoff 3asoil depth 3asulfates 3asurface water 0aNitrate removal 0aPeat soil 0aConstructed wetlands 0aRedox potential 0aAgricultural run off 0aMesocosm 0aImmobile Water1 aKarsten, Ulf1 aLennartz, Bernd0 tGeoderma.g2014 Sept., v. 228-229 p.25-32dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018800160300001400348520181700362592002802179650002902207650001802236650003202254650000702286650001502293650002802308650002202336650001802358650002002376650001002396650001102406700001702417700001902434773012402453856007402577852000902651655001202660IND60132287820221120163450.0150505e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013228782DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.122082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Yeoh Tow10aInfluence of Chemical Preservatives on Survival and Growth of Zygosaccharomyces Rouxii YSa40 in Glycerol‐Based Pineapple Model Systems and Intermediate Moisture Pineapple Products  ap. 56-69.  aThis study investigates the growth and survival of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (a xerotolerant yeast) in the glycerol‐based intermediate moisture food (IMF) pineapple model systems (0.87 aw/pH 4.1 GLY/CPB/BM and 0.87 aw/pH 4.5 GLY/CPB/BM) containing various levels of chemical preservatives (sodium benzoate, potassium metabisulphite and potassium sorbate) used singly or in combination. Comparing the two different levels used singly, the three preservatives were more effective in inhibiting yeast growth at a higher 0.1% (w/w) than at a lower 0.01% (w/w) level of the preservative, with potassium metabisulphite showing most inhibitory effect at 0.1% (w/w) level. When the combinations of two to three preservatives at 0.01% (w/w) level were evaluated, a synergistic growth inhibitory effect was achieved. Combination of three preservatives was more effective compared to a combination of any of the two preservatives. At different pH values, preservatives used singly or in combination were shown to be more effective in inhibiting growth at lower pH value of 4.1 than at a higher pH value of 4.5. Taste evaluation of six formulated acidified 0.87 aw/pH 3.7 glycerol‐based IMF pineapple products showed all formulations to be acceptable. However, microbial challenge studies showed that of all the six taste‐acceptable glycerol‐based IMF pineapple products, only the product that contained 0.1 % (w/w) potassium metabisulphite was shelf‐stable up to 6 months of storage at 30C and may be commercially viable. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of this study will benefit the food industry wherein preservation of intermediate moisture pineapple‐based products or other intermediate moisture products is required to overcome contamination problems, especially from xerotolerant yeasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZygosaccharomyces rouxii 3afood industry 3aintermediate moisture foods 3apH 3apineapples 3apotassium metabisulfite 3apotassium sorbate 3apreservatives 3asodium benzoate 3ataste 3ayeasts1 aBhat, Rajeev1 aDavies, Roland0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2015 Feb., v. 39, no. 1 p.56-69dFood & Nutrition Press.x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.122083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009400173300001800267520099800285592002801283650002601311650001501337650001401352650001401366650001401380650003601394650004001430650001001470650003701480650001701517650000901534650002401543650003601567650003201603700002101635700002601656700001901682700002301701700002401724700002201748700003301770700002701803773009801830856008401928852000902012655001202021IND60113818320221119155554.0141112e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011381832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2011.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngaramo, Paola I.10aTumor necrosis factor alpha pathways develops liver apoptosis in type 1 diabetes mellitus  ap. 1397-1407.  aWe analyzed the contribution of TNF-α intracellular pathway in the development of apoptosis in the liver of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In liver tissue, diabetes promoted a significant increase of TNF-α/TNF-R1, and led to the activation of caspase-8, of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), and JNK signaling pathways. The activation of NFκB led to an induction of iNOS and consequent increase in NO production. As a consequence of such changes a significant increase of caspase-3 activity and of apoptotic index were observed in the liver of diabetic animals. Importantly, the treatment in vivo of diabetic rats with etanercept (TNF-α blocking antibody) or aminoguanidine (selective iNOS inhibitor) significantly attenuated the induction of apoptosis by reduction of caspase-3 activity. Overall, we demonstrated that in the diabetes enhances TNF-α in the liver, which may be a fundamental key leading to apoptotic cell death, through activation of caspase-8, NFκB and JNK pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aliver 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aRonco, María T.1 aFrancés, Daniel E.A.1 aMonti, Juan A.1 aPisani, Gerardo B.1 aCeballos, María P.1 aGalleano, Mónica1 aCarrillo, M.

To understand the regulation of CXCL-10, we investigated the role of PI3K/AKT pathway in regulating virus induced CXCL-10 production. Previously we have shown that wild type (WT) influenza A virus infection activates PI3K/AKT pathway, whereas PR8-SH3-mf-1 mutant virus is unable to activate this pathway. Here we report that WT influenza A virus infection induced CXCL-10 production in A549 cells. PR8-SH3-mf-1 mutant virus infection led to reduced level of CXCL-10 mRNA transcription and protein expression. To define the transcriptional regulation factors that are important in this process, we performed studies using several mutant CXCL-10 promoter–luciferase constructs. Mutation of either of four Forkhead binding sites and two NF-κB response elements in CXCL-10 promoter did not alter promoter activity induced by WT virus. However, mutation of ISRE binding site markedly reduced luciferase activity. Our data suggested that PI3K/AKT pathway contributes to influenza A virus induced CXCL-10 production. This process is involved in binding of IRF3 to the ISRE binding site in CXCL-10 promoter region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3abinding sites 3aepithelial cells 3agamma chemokines 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3amutation 3apromoter regions 3aprotein synthesis 3aresponse elements 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aviruses1 aMasic, Aleksandar1 aLiu, Qiang1 aZhou, Yan0 tMolecular immunology.g2011 July, v. 48, no. 12-13 p.1417-1423dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2011.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007300163300001600236520050100252592002800753650001700781650001600798650001300814650001800827650002100845651001200866653001800878653002100896653001200917773009300929856007801022852000901100655001201109IND60562060820221121040855.0170125e20161108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056206082DNAL7 a10.1515/vzoo-2016-00362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatsyuk, M.

However, the role of overgrazing in regulating the relationship between soil biodiversity and nitrogen availability remains largely unexplored. We performed long‐term grazing exclusion experiments across eight sites along precipitation gradient covering three major types of grassland in northern China to compare the linkage between soil microbial diversity and N availability in overgrazed versus non‐grazed conditions. We found a significantly positive association between fungal diversity and soil available N in non‐grazed grasslands. However, the positive association was absent in overgrazed environments. Bacterial diversity is not related to soil available N in either non‐grazed or overgrazed grasslands. Moreover, in bacterial community, we found a positive link between the relative abundance of Actinobacteria with soil available N in non‐grazed, but not overgrazed, grasslands. Instead we found the links between relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria with soil available N in overgrazed grasslands, but not non‐grazed, grasslands. Synthesis. Our work provides evidence that the relationships between microbial diversity and ecosystem functions are context‐dependent, and so microbial community diversity is likely not the major driver of soil N mineralization in overgrazed grasslands. Our study suggests that high intensity anthropogenic activities in grasslands restrains the capacity of diverse soil microbial communities to sustain ecosystem function, and more broadly the capacity of entire ecosystems to maintain important ecosystem processes such as plant production. Our study also indicates that the fundamental microbial communities associated with N availability change with differing land management strategies (e.g. livestock grazing).

Therefore, comprehensive understanding the effects of SFT on aggregate stability in orchards during winter and spring is crucial to develop appropriate management strategies that can effectively alleviate the degradation of soil quality to ensure sustainable development of orchard ecosystems. To determine the mechanism of degradation in orchard soil quality, the effects of SFT on the stability of water-stable aggregates were examined in apple-pear orchards (Pyrus ussuriensis var. ovoidea) of four different ages (11, 25, 40, and 63 yr) on 0 to 5% slopes before freezing and after thawing from October 2015 to June 2016 in Longjing City, Yanbian Prefecture, Northeast China, involving a comparison of planted versus adjacent uncultivated lands (control). Soil samples were collected to investigate water-stable aggregate stability in three incremental soil layers (0–20, 20–40 and 40–60 cm). In the same samples, iron oxide, organic matter, and clay contents of the soil were also determined. Results showed that the destructive influences of SFT on water-stable aggregates were more pronounced with the increased orchards ages, and SFT exerted severe effects on water-stable aggregates of older orchards (40 and 63 yr) than juvenile orchards. Undergoing SFT, the soil instability index and the percentage of aggregate destruction increased by mean 0.15 mm and 1.86%, the degree of aggregation decreased by mean 1.32%, and the erosion resistance weakened, which consequently led to aggregate stability decreased. In addition, soil free, amorphous, and crystal-line iron oxide as well as soil organic matter and clay contents are all important factors affecting the stability of water-stable aggregates, and their changes in their contents were consistent with those in the stability of water-stable aggregates. The results of this study suggest that long-term planting fruit trees can exacerbate the damaging effects of SFT on aggregate stability and further soil erosion increases and nutrient losses in an orchard, which hider sustainable use of soil and the productivity orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrus ussuriensis 3aaggregate stability 3aclay 3acold 3afruits 3airon oxides 3ajuveniles 3aland use 3aorchard soils 3aorchards 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3aspring 3asustainable development 3awinter 3aChina1 aDeng, Xu1 aSong, Tao1 aChen, Guoshuang1 aWang, Yuemei1 aZhang, Qing1 aLu, Xinrui0 tChinese geographical science.g2021 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.234-247dScience PresswJournal:J000001700x1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-021-1187-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012700171300001800298500001400316520173100330592002802061650002202089650001702111650001502128650001302143650002502156650001302181650001802194650000902212650001202221650001402233650001102247650001202258650001302270700002502283700002602308700005902334700005902393773011702452856008302569852000902652655001202661IND60697187920221120204312.0200602e20200505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069718792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b010852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForbes, Dianna L.14aThe 3-His Metal Coordination Site Promotes the Coupling of Oxygen Activation to Cysteine Oxidation in Cysteine Dioxygenase  ap. 2022-2031.  aNAL-light  aCysteine dioxygenase (CDO) structurally resembles cupin enzymes that use a 3-His/1-Glu coordination scheme. However, the glutamate ligand is substituted with a cysteine (Cys93) residue, which forms a thioether bond with tyrosine (Tyr157) under physiological conditions. The reversion variant, C93E CDO, was generated in order to reestablish the more common 3-His/1-Glu metal ligands of the cupin superfamily. This variant provides a framework for testing the structural and functional significance of Cys93 and the cross-link in CDO. Although dioxygen consumption was observed with C93E CDO, it was not coupled with l-cysteine oxidation. Substrate analogues (d-cysteine, cysteamine, and 3-mercaptopropionate) were not viable substrates for the C93E CDO variant, although they showed variable coordinations to the iron center. The structures of C93E and cross-linked and non-cross-linked wild-type CDO were solved by X-ray crystallography to 1.91, 2.49, and 2.30 Å, respectively. The C93E CDO variant had similar overall structural properties compared to cross-linked CDO; however, the iron was coordinated by a 3-His/1-Glu geometry, leaving only two coordination sites available for dioxygen and bidentate l-cysteine binding. The hydroxyl group of Tyr157 shifted in both non-cross-linked and C93E CDO, and this displacement prevented the residue from participating in substrate stabilization. Based on these results, the divergence of the metal center of cysteine dioxygenase from the 3-His/1-Glu geometry seen with many cupin enzymes was essential for effective substrate binding. The substitution of Glu with Cys in CDO allows for a third coordination site on the iron for bidentate cysteine and monodentate oxygen binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrosslinking 3acysteamine 3acysteine 3acysteine dioxygenase 3ageometry 3aglutamic acid 3airon 3aligands 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atesting 3atyrosine1 aMeneely, Kathleen M.1 aChilton, Annemarie S.1 aLamb, Audrey L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2352-21301 aEllis, Holly R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0521-422X0 tBiochemistry.g2020 May 05, v. 59, no. 21 p.2022-2031dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b010853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100002000172245004300192300001600235500002000251520096800271592002801239650002201267650001201289650002901301650001901330650001701349650001201366650004101378650000901419650002801428650003301456650003801489650004701527700001701574700001901591700001301610700001701623773013401640852000901774856009101783655001201874IND2168182920221121024738.0211130e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216818292DNAL7 a96739042pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.1998.tb03651.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHickford, F.

They walked with a stiff, stilted gait, with the stiffness reducing during exercise. Startling of the kittens resulted in hyperextension of the limbs and falling to lateral recumbency, or spasm of the orbicularis oculi muscle, prolonged prolapse of the nictitating membranes and flattening of the ears. One kitten was intermittently dysphonic. Endotracheal intubation of the anaesthetised kittens was difficult due to an inability to open the mouth to a wide angle, and narrowing of the glottis due to muscle spasm. A diagnosis of congenital myotonia was made based on the clinical signs, the kittens' ages, typical myotonic discharges on electromyography, and the histopathological and histochemical findings in muscle. This is the first report of congenital myotonia in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease diagnosis 3akittens 3acongenital abnormalities 3ahistopathology 3acase studies 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxcongenitalxdiagnosis. 2aCats 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aElectromyographyxveterinary 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiopathology 2aMyotonia Congenitaxdiagnosisxveterinary.1 aJones, B.

P residence time has been studied at the leaf or canopy level but seldom at the whole‐tree level. Whereas P residence time at the leaf or canopy level is largely determined by leaf longevity and the resorption of P before leaf abscission, P residence time at the whole‐tree level will also be influenced by differences in P allocation to different plant parts because leaves and woody organs have distinct longevities. We estimated the residence time of P in above‐ground tree biomass (AGB) as the ratio of P mass (i.e. leaves plus wood) to the annual flux of P via litterfall (i.e. fine litter plus coarse woody debris) for seven tropical rain forests with different soil P availabilities on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. We analysed the effects of P allocation to and resorption from leaves on P residence time along a soil P gradient. P residence time (2.7–9.8 years) was approximately one‐fifth of biomass residence time (AGB/annual litterfall mass; 19.8–48.8 years). This was due to a disproportionately greater relative allocation of P to leaves (P mass in leaves/P mass in AGB; 0.11–0.46), which had a smaller fraction of biomass (leaf biomass/AGB; 0.02–0.05) but a shorter longevity (1.0–1.8 years). The relative allocation of P to leaves was often high on low‐P soils, and P residence time was expected to be short. By contrast, the resorption rate of P from leaves was also high on low‐P soils, which extended P residence time with P deficiency. Consequently, P residence time was nearly constant across the forests. The short residence time of P relative to biomass indicates that P residence time depends largely on relative P allocation among plant organs. Similar P residence times among sites were maintained because greater P allocation to leaves on low‐P soils was effectively offset by higher P‐resorption efficiency.

To date, several studies have investigated the direct antimicrobial activity of liquid essential oils. However, this study investigated the antimicrobial properties of the volatile substances present in various essential oils. METHODS: A modified zone of inhibition protocol was developed using agar petri dishes with a center glass vial to allow evaporation and aerosolization of the potential active constituents from essential oils. In total, nineteen essential oils were tested against five Gram positive bacterial species, five Gram negative bacterial species and one fungi. RESULTS: This study found potent antimicrobial activity from the volatile constituents of several essential oils. Rosemary, tea tree, and cassia volatiles were found to be the best broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, whereas clove volatiles had almost no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the anecdotal historical evidence of the antimicrobial activity of the volatile constituents essential oils. Modern medical implications for this work may be related to the use of aromatic essential oils for respiratory or dermatological infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aagar 3aalternative medicine 3aantimicrobial properties 3adistillation 3aevaporation 3aglass 3alipophilicity 3aliquids 3arosemary 3asecondary metabolites 3atea 3atrees1 aSchroeder, Sydney1 aGoelz, Linna1 aSulser, Adrienne1 aSt. Rose, Tiffany1 aPuchalski, Keely1 aLangland, Jeffrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3653-88440 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.124-124dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03285-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04033naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245019600209300001800405520238800423592002802811596006802839596005202907650002502959650001702984650001103001650001103012650001103023650001103034650002403045650001403069650001703083650001203100650001803112650002303130650002203153651001803175651001803193700002503211700002303236700002203259700002103281700002003302773013803322856008203460852000903542655001203551IND60683950620221120112507.0200214e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068395062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-019-02447-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellier, Virginie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7338-802110aInvestigating the use of fallout and geogenic radionuclides as potential tracing properties to quantify the sources of suspended sediment in a mining catchment in New Caledonia, South Pacific  ap. 1112-1128.  aPURPOSE: New Caledonia, a French island located in the south-west Pacific Ocean, has vast nickel resources. Open-cast mining has strongly increased soil erosion and the subsequent downstream transfer of sediments in river systems resulting in fundamental morphological changes (e.g., hyper-sedimentation, over-burden). Understanding the sediment source contributions from mining activities is therefore important to guide the implementation of effective management measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot sediment tracing study was conducted in the Thio River (400 km²) catchment draining the island’s first mine. Sediment deposited during the February 25, 2015, and April 10, 2017, flood events was collected with a tributary tracing design, including main stem (n = 19) and tributary (n = 24) samples. The tributaries were classified into two source types: sub-catchments draining mining sites and sub-catchments devoid of mining activities. Three sets of potential tracing parameters (i.e., fallout radionuclides, geogenic radionuclides, and elemental geochemistry) were examined for their potential to model the contributions of sediment from mining versus non-mining tributaries to sediment collected on the Thio River. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The very low fallout radionuclide activities (¹³⁷Cs and ²¹⁰Pbₓₛ) found in the source and sediment samples demonstrate that most material transiting the river network is derived from subsoil sources. Geogenic radionuclides and elemental geochemistry were therefore utilized in the tributary tracing approach. Accordingly, U and K were selected as the optimal tracers of the two main lithological regions supplying sediment to the main stem of the Thio River. Model results demonstrated that tributaries with mining activity dominated the sediment supply to the Thio River with mean sediment contributions of 68% (SD 28%) for the 2015 flood and 86% (SD 7%) for the 2017 event. CONCLUSIONS: Geogenic radionuclides and elemental geochemistry were more effective at discriminating between tributaries with and without mines than fallout radionuclides. The similarity of the model results from tracing with geogenic radionuclides and elemental geochemistry illustrates their potential to investigate sediment source contributions in similar catchments across the South Pacific Islands affected by mining activities.  aPublisher supplied data  an°10PS2013-CNRT.UNC/IMMILAcNational Technical Research Center  aPhD fellowshipcFrench Atomic Energy Commission 3acesium radioisotopes 3ageochemistry 3amining 3amodels 3anickel 3arivers 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3asubsoil 3asubwatersheds 3asuspended sediment 3atracer techniques 3aNew Caledonia 3aPacific Ocean1 aNavrátil, Oldřich,1 aLaceby, J.

These annotation tools use a variety of methods and data sources. In the recent ENCODE genome annotation assessment project (EGASP), some of the most commonly used and recently developed gene-prediction programs were systematically evaluated and compared on test data from the human genome. AUGUSTUS was among the tools that were tested in this project. RESULTS: AUGUSTUS can be used as an ab initio program, that is, as a program that uses only one single genomic sequence as input information. In addition, it is able to combine information from the genomic sequence under study with external hints from various sources of information. For EGASP, we used genomic sequence alignments as well as alignments to expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and protein sequences as additional sources of information. Within the category of ab initio programs AUGUSTUS predicted significantly more genes correctly than any other ab initio program. At the same time it predicted the smallest number of false positive genes and the smallest number of false positive exons among all ab initio programs. The accuracy of AUGUSTUS could be further improved when additional extrinsic data, such as alignments to EST, protein and/or genomic sequences, was taken into account. CONCLUSION: AUGUSTUS turned out to be the most accurate ab initio gene finder among the tested tools. Moreover it is very flexible because it can take information from several sources simultaneously into consideration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahumans 3asequence alignment 3ainformation sources 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aamino acid sequences 3aexons 3aprediction 0agenes1 aTzvetkova, Ana1 aMorgenstern, Burkhard0 tGenome biology.g2006 Aug., v. 7, no.

To better understand contemporary management practices involving oral step-down in GN-BSI, we conducted an international survey of infectious diseases (ID) specialists. We developed and disseminated an online survey to ID specialists to assess practice patterns involving oral step-down in GN-BSIs, including providers from six continents and 28 countries. χ² tests and generalised estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with oral step-down. In total, 277 ID specialists completed the survey (64% physicians, 31% pharmacists). Relative to a line source, oral step-down was more common in abdominal [OR = 1.96 (95% CI 1.48–2.61); P < 0.001], pneumonia [2.24 (1.67–2.99); P < 0.001], skin [7.26 (4.71–11.20); P < 0.001] and urinary [9.15 (5.73–14.60); P < 0.001] sources of GN-BSI. US providers were more likely to practice oral step-down than non-US providers (OR = 4.35, 95% CI 2.57–7.36; P < 0.001). Moreover, 40% of providers practice oral step-down for some, but not all, sources of GN-BSI. Among all providers, 23–53% (depending on GN-BSI source) recommend extended (≥5 days) intravenous (IV) therapy before oral step-down or ongoing IV therapy. Most respondents (76% of all providers; 80% of ID physicians) expressed interest in enrolling patients in a trial of full IV versus early oral step-down for GN-BSI. There is extensive heterogeneity in oral step-down practices for GN-BSI. The optimal role of oral step-down in managing GN-BSIs warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3ablood flow 3aintravenous injection 3apneumonia 3asurveys 0aGram-negative 0aBacteraemia 0aBloodstream infection 0aOral step-down1 aTamma, Pranita D.1 aDoi, Yohei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9620-25251 aDaneman, Nick2 aAntibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG)eauthor0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2021 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.106451-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1064513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010100165300001200266520190400278592002802182650002502210650001402235650001802249650001302267650000902280650001002289650002002299650002202319700001702341773012902358856008302487852000902570655001202579IND60734459620221121111818.0220517e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073445962DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-021-03297-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMah, Jasmine10aOral magnesium supplementation for insomnia in older adults: a Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis  ap. 125.  aBACKGROUND: Magnesium supplementation is often purported to improve sleep; however, as both an over-the-counter sleep aid and a complementary and alternative medicine, there is limited evidence to support this assertion. The aim was to assess the effectiveness and safety of magnesium supplementation for older adults with insomnia. METHODS: A search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, clinicaltrials.gov and two grey literature databases comparing magnesium supplementation to placebo or no treatment. Outcomes were sleep quality, quantity, and adverse events. Risk of bias and quality of evidence assessments were carried out using the RoB 2.0 and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approaches. Data was pooled and treatment effects were quantified using mean differences. For remaining outcomes, a modified effects direction plot was used for data synthesis. RESULTS: Three randomized control trials (RCT) were identified comparing oral magnesium to placebo in 151 older adults in three countries. Pooled analysis showed that post-intervention sleep onset latency time was 17.36 min less after magnesium supplementation compared to placebo (95% CI − 27.27 to − 7.44, p = 0.0006). Total sleep time improved by 16.06 min in the magnesium supplementation group but was statistically insignificant. All trials were at moderate-to-high risk of bias and outcomes were supported by low to very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSION: This review confirms that the quality of literature is substandard for physicians to make well-informed recommendations on usage of oral magnesium for older adults with insomnia. However, given that oral magnesium is very cheap and widely available, RCT evidence may support oral magnesium supplements (less than 1 g quantities given up to three times a day) for insomnia symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative medicine 3amagnesium 3ameta-analysis 3aplacebos 3arisk 3asleep 3asleep disorders 3asystematic review1 aPitre, Tyler0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.125-125dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03297-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245010000192300001600292520096800308592002801276650003101304650001001335650001001345650001301355650003501368650003301403650002501436650002101461650003001482650001101512650003301523650004101556650003601597650003101633653001701664653001901681653002001700700002001720700001901740700001801759700003001777773011501807856008501922852000902007655001202016IND60099516420221121042213.0190412e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009951642DNAL7 a234997102pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2013.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Lago, Laura10aGenetic features shared by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains involved in microevolution events  ap. 326-329.  aMicroevolved Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) clonal variants from a parental strain can emerge within a single patient infection and during transmission events. Genotypic rearrangements may involve functional changes conferring advantages to favor strain adaptation to the host. In the present study, we analyzed in depth some genotypic characteristics of a strain with a high tendency to microevolve that generated 6 clonal variants during transmission of sequential hosts. In order to identify genetic features potentially associated to microevolution in MTB, we analyzed 56 3R genes and the IS6110 insertion sites from this strain and identified an SNP in alkA and an IS6110 copy located upstream of a transposase (Rv0755A). These markers could be involved in mechanisms leading to genotypic variation. Both features were shared by strains from our collection that were also involved in microevolution, suggesting their putative association with these events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3agenes 3ahosts 3apatients 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMethyltransferasesxgenetics 2aMycobacterium tuberculosisxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aTuberculosisxmicrobiology 0aTuberculosis 0aMicroevolution 0aClonal variants1 aNavarro, Yurena1 aHerranz, Marta1 aBouza, Emilio1 aGarcía-de-Viedma, Darío0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2013 June, v. 16 p.326-329dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013800171300001600309520115400325592002801479650001201507650001501519650001001534650001201544650001101556653001901567653004201586653002901628653001301657653002801670653003201698700001901730700002201749773008901771856008501860852000901945655001201954IND60607791020221122155148.0180830e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060779102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Byung Chul10aCharacteristics of outwardly propagating spherical flames of R134a(C2H2F4)/CH4/O2/N2 mixtures in a constant volume combustion chamber  ap. 517-527.  aThe characteristics of the outwardly propagating premixed flames of stoichiometric mixtures of R134a/CH4/O2/N2 have been experimentally investigated in a constant volume combustion chamber. Three regimes of the expanding flames were categorized based on the flame behavior. In the typical regime, a conventional outwardly propagating spherical flame was observed. The laminar burning velocity was correlated reasonably well as a function of the concentrations of oxygen and methane. When the concentration of R134a was relatively high, the buoyancy-induced regime, where the flame rises vertically while propagating outwardly, was observed. Phenomenological analysis in which the Richardson number and the Froude number were used to characterize the rising flames confirmed that the main cause of this phenomenon was buoyancy resulting from the difference between the densities of unburned and burned gases. The dimensionless velocity, which is based on the concept of the Damköhler number, explained the mechanism controlling the characteristic of the flame behavior. In addition, an intermediate transition regime existed between the two regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acombustion 3agases 3amethane 3aoxygen 0aPremixed flame 0aOutwardly propagating spherical flame 0aLaminar burning velocity 0aBuoyancy 0aNear-flammability limit 0aR134a(C2H2F4)/methane fuels1 aPark, June S.,1 aGhoniem, Ahmed F.0 tEnergy.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 95 p.517-527dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245009100206300001600297506007600313520083500389592002801224506003701252650002201289650000801311650001601319650001401335650001101349650001201360650001901372650002401391650001201415653003101427653001801458653002301476653001901499700002901518700002501547700002601572700002101598700002401619773010401643856007301747852000901820655001201829IND60691296020221207084923.0200428e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069129602DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.297302doi7 aPMC41799672pmcid7 a251809402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGultyaev, Alexander P10aRNA structural constraints in the evolution of the influenza A virus genome NP segment  ap. 942-952.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConserved RNA secondary structures were predicted in the nucleoprotein (NP) segment of the influenza A virus genome using comparative sequence and structure analysis. A number of structural elements exhibiting nucleotide covariations were identified over the whole segment length, including protein-coding regions. Calculations of mutual information values at the paired nucleotide positions demonstrate that these structures impose considerable constraints on the virus genome evolution. Functional importance of a pseudoknot structure, predicted in the NP packaging signal region, was confirmed by plaque assays of the mutant viruses with disrupted structure and those with restored folding using compensatory substitutions. Possible functions of the conserved RNA folding patterns in the influenza A virus genome are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA 3aRNA folding 3aevolution 3agenome 3amutants 3anucleoproteins 3aopen reading frames 3aviruses 0anegative-sense RNA viruses 0aRNA structure 0amutual information 0aRNA pseudoknot1 aTsyganov-Bodounov, Anton1 aSpronken, Monique IJ1 avan der Kooij, Sander1 aFouchier, Ron AM1 aOlsthoorn, René CL0 tRNA biology.g2014 July 1, v. 11, no. 7 p.942-952dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.297303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008400166300001600250520112700266592002801393650003601421650002101457650002201478650002401500650001201524650002001536650002401556650001901580650001301599650001901612650000901631650001401640650003301654650003301687650001101720653003601731653002401767653002101791700001601812700001901828700003001847773014401877856008602021852000902107655001202116IND60114114620221122232419.0190415e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011411462DNAL7 a10.1016/S1672-6308(13)60128-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Ying,10aScreening of Rice Genes Interacting with p5b of Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus  ap. 185-190.  aRice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) is a recognized member of the genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae. Its genome has ten double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments (S1–S10), in which the fifth genome segment (S5) contains two open reading frames (ORFs) with a partially overlapping region. The second ORF of RBSDV S5 encodes a viral nonstructural protein named p5b with unknown function. To reveal the function of p5b, its gene was ligated into the bait plasmid pGBKT7 and an expression library containing rice cDNAs was constructed using plasmid pGADT7 for yeast two-hybrid assay. The bait protein p5b was detected in yeast by western blot, and the result of an auto-activation test showed that p5b could not autonomously activate the expression of reporter genes in yeast. Then the bait protein p5b was used for screening the cDNA expression libraries of rice. Gene fragments of some pivotal enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration and other important metabolic processes, were identified to interact with p5b in yeast, suggesting that these interactions may play roles in symptom development in infected plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRice black streaked dwarf virus 3aWestern blotting 3acomplementary DNA 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3aopen reading frames 3aphotosynthesis 3aplasmids 3areporter genes 3arice 3ascreening 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3ayeasts 0arice black-streaked dwarf virus 0ainteraction protein 0ayeast two-hybrid1 aYang, Jian,1 aZHANG, Heng-mu1 aChen, J.

However, its main chain structure hinders the formation of wide ion-transport networks, limiting the further improvement of its performance. Herein, we introduce both hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains into the poly(aryl piperidinium) backbone to promote the aggregation of ionic clusters and the formation of microphase-separated structures. The AEMs are designed by introducing 1-(6-bromohexyl)-N-methyl piperidinium bromide (hydrophilic) and 1-bromohexane (hydrophobic) into the poly(m-terphenyl piperidinium) backbone. After grafting hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains, the resulted membrane (m-PTP–32P8C) exhibits outstanding conductivity (112 mS cm–¹ at 80 °C) and dimensional stability. Meanwhile, under the alkaline condition of 1 mol L–¹ NaOH at 80 °C, the conductivity is still maintained above 80% after 1200 h of immersion. When used in the water electrolysis cell with a nonplatinum group metal anode, the m-PTP–32P8C membrane presents a high current density of 0.752 A cm–² at 2.2 V with the electrolyte of 1 mol L–¹ KOH at 60 °C. Compared with those grafted with only hydrophilic or hydrophobic side chains, m-PTP–32P8C exhibits better physicochemical properties and conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data  a11705126cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aSKL-ChE-20B02cState Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineeringdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100011308 3aanion exchange 3aanodes 3adimensional stability 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aprocess design1 aWang, Huimin1 aMin, Luofu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2438-151X1 aXu, Wei1 aWang, Yuxin1 aZhang, Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6118-31360 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 61, no. 38 p.14232-14241dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c017223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013700172300001600309520124800325592002801573650001701601650002101618650001101639650002401650650002301674650002101697650002301718650002101741653001501762653001901777653003501796653002201831653001901853653002101872700002501893700002801918773009701946856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60687952920221119025327.0200607e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068795292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVakalis, Stergios14aThe water-energy-climate nexus concept of “Hydrobattery”: Storing excess Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) at the Canyon Ferry Dam  ap. 547-554.  aHydropower is the renewable energy with the highest power production worldwide. At the same time the output flow of the water that is being used for hydroelectric power production can fluctuate significantly. The ability to “recharge” the dams with water from excess variable renewable energy technologies (VRE) can be used for storage and as a buffer for smoothing the production peaks of VRE. This study presented the idea of the “Hydrobattery” scheme which combines the concepts of “open-loop” and “closed-loop” pumped storage technologies along with the concept of energy storage and water recirculation. The Canyon Ferry Dam was used as a case study and water was modelled to be recirculating back to the Dam from the Helena Valley reservoir. The hydropower production from the Canyon Ferry Dam is below the nominal value of 50 MW and has fluctuated from 34.74 MW up to 41.46 MW for the period between 2014 and 2018. The application of “Hydrobattery” would be able to increase the power output by 2.39–3.39 MW of additional power, and an increase of power production between 5.7% and 9.7%. Also, the concept of “Hydrobattery” can be used as a potential water management system for connected water reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adams (hydrology) 3aenergy 3ahydroelectric power 3amanagement systems 3apower generation 3astorage technology 3awater reservoirs 0aHydropower 0aPumped storage 0aVarious renewable energy (VRE) 0aEnergy efficiency 0aClimate change 0aWater management1 aKaffas, Konstantinos1 aMoustakas, Konstantinos0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 155 p.547-554dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245016600165500001900331506002800350506003200378520215600410592002802566596008002594596004502674506003702719650001802756650002002774650000902794650001802803650001802821650001802839650003402857650001102891650001902902650002702921650001402948650002202962650001102984650001202995650001503007650002403022650001603046700002803062700002103090700002203111700001703133700002203150700002403172773012203196856007403318903002203392961001303414852000903427655001203436IND60732178920221207081039.0210326e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073217892DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130309972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawicki, Caleigh  M.10aComparison of Indices of Carbohydrate Quality and Food Sources of Dietary Fiber on Longitudinal Changes in Waist Circumference in the Framingham Offspring Cohort  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aThe long-term impact of carbohydrate quality on abdominal weight gain is not fully understood. We aimed to examine the prospective relation of a carbohydrate quality index (CQI; defined by four criteria: dietary fiber, glycemic index, whole grain-to-total grain ratio, and solid-to-total carbohydrate ratio), total, cereal grain, vegetable, and fruit fiber, carbohydrate-to-total fiber ratio, and carbohydrate-to-cereal fiber ratio with changes in waist circumference (WC). Subjects were middle-aged to older, mostly white, participants in the Framingham Offspring cohort (n = 3101 subjects), with mean baseline age 54.9 ± 0.2 years (mean ± SE) and body mass index (BMI) 27.2 ± 0.1 kg/m². Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), health, and lifestyle data were collected approximately every four years over a median total follow-up of 18 years. Repeated measure mixed models were used to estimate adjusted mean change in WC per four-year interval across quartiles of carbohydrate variables. In the most adjusted model, a higher CQI was marginally associated with a smaller increase in WC (2.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.4 ± 0.1 cm in highest vs. lowest quartile, p-trend = 0.04). Higher ratios of carbohydrate-to-fiber and carbohydrate-to-cereal fiber were associated with greater increases in WC per four-year interval (2.6 ± 0.1 vs. 2.0 ± 0.1 cm, p-trend < 0.001, and 2.5 ± 0.1 vs. 2.1 ± 0.1 cm in highest versus lowest categories, p-trend = 0.007, respectively); whereas higher intake of total fiber (1.8 ± 0.1 vs. 2.7 ± 0.1 cm, p-trend < 0.001), cereal fiber (2.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.5 ± 0.1 cm, p-trend = 0.001), and fruit fiber (2.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.7 ± 0.1 cm, p-trend < 0.001) were associated with smaller increases in WC compared to lower intakes. There was a significant interaction between total fiber and total carbohydrate (as % of total energy intake). After stratification, the association between fiber intake and change in WC was not maintained in the context of a high carbohydrate diet. Better carbohydrate quality, primarily higher fiber intake and lower carbohydrate-to-fiber ratios, may help attenuate increases in abdominal adiposity over time.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Heart Lung and Blood Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000050  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabdominal fat 3abody mass index 3abran 3acarbohydrates 3adietary fiber 3aenergy intake 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afruits 3aglycemic index 3ahigh carbohydrate diet 3alifestyle 3along term effects 3amodels 3aprogeny 3avegetables 3awaist circumference 3aweight gain1 aLichtenstein, Alice H.,1 aRogers, Gail  T.1 aJacques, Paul  F.1 aMa, Jiantao 1 aSaltzman, Edward 1 aMcKeown, Nicola  M.0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130309973Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010200170300001600272520171100288592002801999650002102027650002502048650001902073650002502092650001402117650000902131650002802140650001302168650002702181650001502208650001302223650001602236650005202252650002402304650002102328650002402349650001302373650002602386653000802412653000802420653000802428653001002436653001002446653000902456653000902465653000802474653000802482653000802490653001002498653001102508653000902519653000902528653000702537653000802544653001102552653001402563653001402577653001502591653000902606653001102615653000802626653001302634653001102647653001102658700003402669773007402703856008202777852000902859655001202868IND60552363720221120202149.0161021e20140210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055236372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDīn, Muḥammad,10aProfiling microRNAs and their targets in an important fleshy fruit: Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)  ap. 198-203.  aTomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is an important and the most useful plant based diet. It is widely used for its antioxidant property. Presently, only two digits, tomato microRNAs (miRNAs) are reported in miRBase: a miRNA database. This study is aimed to profile and characterize more miRNAs and their targets in tomato. A comprehensive comparative genomic approach is applied and a total of 109 new miRNAs belonging to 106 families are identified and characterized from the tomato expressed sequence tags (ESTs). All these potential miRNAs are profiled for the first time in tomato. The profiled miRNAs are also observed with stable stem-loop structures (Precursor-miRNAs), whose length ranges from 45to 329 nucleotides (nt) with an average of 125 nt. The mature miRNAs are found in the stem of pre-miRNAs and their length ranges from 19 to 24 nt with an average of 21 nt. Furthermore, twelve miRNAs are randomly selected and experimentally validated through RT-PCR. A total of 406 putative targets are also predicted for the newly 109 tomato miRNAs. These targets are involved in structural protein, metabolism, transcription factor, growth & development, stress related, signaling pathways, storage proteins and other vital processes. Some important proteins like; 9-cisepoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), transcription factor MYB, ATP-binding cassette transporters, terpen synthase, 14-3-3 and TIR-NBS proteins are also predicted as putative targets for tomato miRNAs. These findings improve a baseline data of miRNAs and their targets in tomato. This baseline data can be utilized to fine tune this important fleshy fruit for nutritional & antioxidant properties and also under biotic & abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidant activity 3adatabases 3adiet 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agenomics 3agrowth and development 3ametabolism 3amicroRNA 3anucleotides 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astorage proteins 3astructural proteins 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 0aaly 0aath 0abdi 0aBLAST 0adbEST 0aDCL1 0aESTs 0agma 0aMFE 0aMIR 0amiRNA 0amiRNA* 0amRNA 0aNCBI 0ant 0aosa 0aPol II 0aPre-miRNA 0aPri-miRNA 0aRefseq_rna 0aRISC 0aRT-PCR 0aEST 0aMicroRNA 0aRT-PCR 0aTomato1 aBarozai, Muhammad Younas Khan0 tGene.g2014 Feb. 10, v. 535 p.198-203dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245011500203300002000318520175200338592002802090650001502118650000802133650001802141650000902159650001102168650001602179650002102195650001402216650001202230650001902242650000902261650001602270700001802286700001202304773017402316856008102490852000902571655001202580IND60794817120221119072027.0220929e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079481712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c018902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBae, Jun-Seok1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1518-339110aEnrichment of Low-Quality Methane by Various Combinations of Vacuum and Temperature Swing Adsorption Processes  ap. 14298-14304.  aAs an endeavor to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while harnessing an energy source, this paper applied various combinations of adsorption-based swing processes to enrich a wide range (3–30%) of low-quality coal mine methane (CMM) in air to a level that a direct utilization can be made by gas engine technology. Having honeycomb monolithic carbon fiber composites tuned for CMM enrichment, at least 5.3 and 3.5% CH₄ were found to be required by one- and two-stage vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) processes, respectively, to obtain more than 9.0% CH₄ in the product. As VSA alone, however, can give rise to a safety risk that the CH₄ concentrations in the product are still in the explosive range, a one-stage vacuum, temperature, and vacuum swing adsorption (VTVSA) process was applied, enriching 3.0–8.6% CH₄ up to 18.2–50.7% CH₄ in the product and thus eliminating the safety concern. As a reference for other applications, 10.3–30.1% CMM streams can be enriched up to 57.5–86.9% through the one-stage VTVSA process. To minimize energy consumption with two fixed columns, VSA and VTVSA processes in the first and second columns, respectively, were applied, enriching 3.1 and 4.1% CH₄ up to 31.6 and 37.3% CH₄ in the product, respectively. In this paper, various adsorption-based technology options are provided for mine operators to enrich low-quality CMM and can be applied for other applications such as methane capture from abandoned landfill sites. Due to the explosive nature of the low-quality CH₄ in air, this paper is the first to cover the enrichment of a wide range of low-quality CMM below 30% with an explosion-proof enrichment unit being capable of various vacuum and temperature swing adsorption processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3acarbon fibers 3acoal 3aenergy 3agas engines 3agreenhouse gases 3alandfills 3amethane 3aprocess design 3arisk 3atemperature1 aYu, Xin Xiang1 aSu, Shi0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 61, no. 38 p.14298-14304dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c018903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012700164300001800291520141500309592002801724650001501752650001101767650000901778650001801787650000901805650000901814700001901823700002201842700002101864700002001885773009901905856004802004852000902052655001202061IND4475628820221119013036.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447562882DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293111100442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinkina, T.

The adsorption of metals by soils and the strength of their fixation on the surface of soil particles under both mono- and polyelement contamination decreased with the decreasing proportion of fine fractions in the soil. The adsorption capacity of the Lower Don chernozems for Cu2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ depending on the particle-size distribution decreased in the following sequence: clay loamy ordinary chernozem ∼ clay loamy southern chernozem > loamy southern chernozem > loamy sandy southern chernozem. According to the parameters of the adsorption by the different particle-size fractions (C max and k), the heavy metal cations form a sequence analogous to that obtained for the entire soils: Cu2+ ≥ Pb2+ > Zn2+. The parameters of the heavy metal adsorption by similar particle-size fractions separated from different soils decreased in the following order: clay loamy chernozem > loamy chernozem > loamy sandy chernozem. The analysis of the changes in the parameters of the Cu2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ adsorption by soils and their particlesize fractions showed that the extensive adsorption characteristic, namely, the maximum adsorption (C max), was a less sensitive parameter characterizing the soil than the intensive characteristic of the process—the adsorption equilibrium constant (k).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acopper 3alead 3aparticle size 3asoil 3azinc1 aPinskii, D.

OsAFP1, a defensin identified from Oryza sativa (rice), exhibits antimicrobial activity against rice pathogens. Intriguingly, OsAFP1 was also shown to demonstrate potent antifungal activity against the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans by inducing apoptosis in target cells, suggesting that OsAFP1 represents a potential new antibiotic candidate; however, further analyses, particularly at the structural level, are required to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of OsAFP1 antifungal activity. Here, we determined the three-dimensional structure of OsAFP1 using X-ray crystallography. OsAFP1 features the cysteine-stabilized αβ structure highly conserved in plant defensins and presents a dimeric structure that appears necessary for antifungal activity. Superimposition of the OsAFP1 structure with that of Nicotiana alata NaD1 complexed with phosphatidic acid indicated that the target molecule is likely trapped between the S2–S3 loops of each OsAFP1 dimer. In lipid-binding analyses performed using nitrocellulose membranes immobilized with various membrane lipid components, OsAFP1 was found to bind to phosphatidylinositols (PIPs) harboring phosphate groups, particularly PI(3)P. These results indicate that OsAFP1 exerts antifungal activity by binding to PI(3)P contained in the C. albicans cell membrane, thereby applying cellular stress and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, the OsAFP1 structure and site-specific-mutation analyses revealed that Arg1, His2, Leu4, Arg9, and Phe10 play critical roles in OsAFP1 dimer formation. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the antifungal mechanism of OsAFP1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aNicotiana alata 3aOryza sativa 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3aantibiotics 3aantifungal properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aapoptosis 3acell membranes 3acrystal structure 3ainnate immunity 3aphosphates 3aphosphatidylinositols 3arice 0aDefensin 0aOsAFP1 0aCrystal structure 0aOryza sativa 0aCandida albicans 0aAntifungal activity 0aPhosphatidylinositol binding1 aOgawa, Kodai1 aFukuda, Minami1 aSuzuki, Masami1 aIto, Kosuke1 aTanaka, Takaaki1 aSagehashi, Yoshiyuki1 aTaniguchi, Masayuki0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2020 July, v. 130, no. 1 p.6-13dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2020.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008100173300001600254520128000270592002801550650001501578650002401593650002101617650001301638650001301651650001701664653002101681653002001702653001501722653001301737653001501750700002101765773011201786856008601898852000901984655001201993IND60531744120221118204340.0180831e20160520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053174412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoldsworth, Sarah10aFrom praxis to delivery: a Higher Education Learning Design Framework (HELD)  ap. 176-185.  aUniversities and colleges have many global and local imperatives that attend the design of courses. These include industry-linked curriculum, institution wide graduate attributes, learning-focused approaches, professional accreditation requirements and increasingly, the need for work-ready graduates who are able to become lifelong learners on their exit from formal studies. Approaches to the design of study units in higher education has been the subject of considerable scrutiny over recent decades. This paper presents a framework which seeks to capture the ‘lived experience’ and practice wisdom of educational design. It situates the framework for contemporary learning design in the context of the various imperatives within higher education, offering some points of entry by which educators may draw together the many, sometimes competing, requirements and syntheses these with good practice in curriculum and pedagogy. It is envisaged that the use of this framework, by academic in the development, renewal and delivery of their higher education course and programs, will result in learning design and delivery that will build the confidence needed not just in our graduates but in our institutions and their profound and crucial role in the contemporary world.  aPublisher supplied data 3acurriculum 3aexperimental design 3ahigher education 3alearning 3ateachers 3auniversities 0aHigher education 0aLearning design 0aSkill sets 0aPedagogy 0aCurriculum1 aHegarty, Kathryn0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 May 20, v. 122 p.176-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013100160300001600291520122400307592002801531650002101559650001801580650003001598650003001628650001501658650001301673650001901686650001301705650002201718650001701740653000901757653000801766653000801774653000801782653000801790653001301798653001801811653001901829653000901848700001901857700001501876700001401891700001701905700001601922700001401938700001801952773007401970856008202044852000902126655001202135IND60552363820221120202159.0161021e20140210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055236382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fei10aUpregulated microRNA-301a in breast cancer promotes tumor metastasis by targeting PTEN and activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling  ap. 191-197.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are strongly implicated in many cancers, including breast cancer. Recently, microRNA-301a (miR-301a) has been proved to play a substantial role in gastric cancer, but its functions in the context of breast cancer remain unknown. Here we report that miR-301a was markedly upregulated in primary tumor samples from patients with distant metastases and pro-metastatic breast cancer cell lines. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that ectopic overexpression of miR-301a promoted breast cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was hyperactivated in metastatic breast cancer cells that express miR-301a, and mediated miR-301a-induced invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, miR-301a directly targeted and suppressed PTEN, one negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. These results demonstrate that miR-301a maintains constitutively activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling by directly targeting PTEN, which promotes breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Taken together, our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism of miR-301a and suggest that miR-301a might be a potential target in breast cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acell movement 3again-of-function mutation 3aloss-of-function mutation 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3astomach neoplasms 3atherapeutics 0aPTEN 0aUTR 0aORF 0aTCF 0aLEF 0amir-301a 0aBreast cancer 0aWnt/β-catenin 0aPTEN1 aZhang, Jianguo1 aZhong, Lei1 aWang, Lei1 aLiu, Yansong1 aWang, Yimin1 aPeng, Lin1 aGuo, Baoliang0 tGene.g2014 Feb. 10, v. 535 p.191-197dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01529naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245004500162300001600207500002000223520051800243592002800761650001600789650001100805650001800816650001100834650002300845650002700868650001400895651001500909700002500924700001500949773013200964856007401096852000901170655001201179IND60716608820221119104729.0201106e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071660882DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.123432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoyder, David  J.10a951.

Despite its ecological importance, little is known about the relationship between developmental, physiological, and energetic mechanisms underlying SSD. We take an integrative approach to understand the relationship between developmental trajectories, metabolism, and environmental conditions resulting in extreme female-biased SSD in the crab spider Mecaphesa celer (Thomisidae). We tested for sexual differences in growth trajectories, as well as in the energetics of growth, hypothesizing that female M. celer have lower metabolic rates than males or higher energy assimilation. We also hypothesized that the environment in which spiderlings develop influences the degree of SSD of a population. We tracked growth and resting metabolic rates of female and male spiderlings throughout their ontogeny and quantified the adult size of individuals raised in a combination of two diet and two temperature treatments. We show that M. celer’s SSD results from differences in the shape of female and male growth trajectories. While female and male resting metabolic rates did not differ, diet, temperature, and their interaction influenced body size through an interactive effect with sex, with females being more sensitive to the environment than males. We demonstrate that the shape of the growth curve is an important but often overlooked determinant of SSD and that females may achieve larger sizes through a combination of high food ingestion and low activity levels. Our results highlight the need for new models of SSD based on ontogeny, ecology, and behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThomisidae 3aadults 3abody size 3adiet 3aecology 3aecophysiology 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3agrowth curves 3aingestion 3amales 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aontogeny 3asexual dimorphism 3atemperature1 aDelong, John P.1 aHebets, Eileen A.0 tOecologia.g2019 Sept., v. 191, no. 1 p.61-71dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-019-04488-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01272naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009300159300001600252500002000268520028100288592002800569650001400597650002700611650001400638650001000652650001100662650002000673650002300693651001500716773013200731856007400863852000900937655001200946IND60716608920221119104704.0201106e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071660892DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.123542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermans, Johan10aGASTRODIA AGNICELLUS: A new holomycotrophic orchid from southeast Madagascar Orchidaceae  ap. 385-395.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe new orchid, Gastrodia agnicellus from Madagascar is described for the first time and compared with similar species from the region.

Emergy theory and methods although commonly used by environmental scientists, may seem difficult to interpret for policy and decision-makers. Because of this, the possibility of transforming emergy flows and indices into money and area measures is explored in the present paper. Both hydropower plants deliver the same power and rely on practically the same infrastructure but involve very different flooded areas. Indirect areas calculated in terms of emergy show the different spatial distribution of resources. Some realistic alternatives for development were explored from both environmental and economic perspectives by using the emergy investment ratio and taking into account the matching between the enterprises emergy flows and the regional ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aemergy 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3ascientists 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aBrazil 0aEmergy 0aHydropower 0aEmergy investment ratio 0aJupiá 0aPorto Primavera 0aDA 0aED 0aEIR 0aEIRSP 0aELR 0aEmpdR 0aEMR 0aEmR$ 0aESI 0aEYR 0aF 0aHP 0aIj 0aIAF 0aIAN 0aN 0aPP 0aR 0aY1 aBonilla, S.H.1 aAgostinho, F.1 aAlmeida, C.M.V.B.1 aGiannetti, B.F.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 May 20, v. 122 p.78-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010400165300001600269520135900285592002801644650001301672650001701685650001301702650002801715650003101743650001601774650001901790650001901809650002101828650002701849650001801876650002401894650002001918650001601938650003701954653003201991653003202023653001702055653002902072653002602101700001802127700001702145700002002162700001602182700001502198773012502213856008302338852000902421655001202430IND60628902220221121235328.0190326e20190322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062890222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Gaihuan10aNanoemulsion formation by the phase inversion temperature method using polyoxypropylene surfactants  ap. 177-184.  aSurfactants with temperature-sensitive polyoxyethylene (POE) chains are widely used to prepare nanoemulsions by the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method. It is therefore anticipated that surfactants with temperature-sensitive polyoxypropylene (POP) chains could also be used to prepare nanoemulsions by the PIT method.POP surfactants were synthesized through electrostatic interactions between hydrophilic POP diamines and hydrophobic long-chain fatty acids. The synthesized POP surfactants were used as emulsifiers to prepare n-tetradecane-in-water nanoemulsions by the PIT method. Electrical conductivity measurements were used to determine the PITs of the water/POP surfactant/n-tetradecane systems. The effects of surfactant concentration, NaCl concentration, number of POP units, and degree of unsaturation of hydrocarbon chains on the PIT and the nanoemulsion droplet size were investigated. The droplet size and morphology of the nanoemulsions were characterized by dynamic light scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, respectively.Nanoemulsions are formed by the PIT method using POP surfactants when the POP chains are short (∼2.5–6.1 POP units). The formation of nanoemulsions with droplet radii of 20–300 nm and spherical morphology occurs because of the temperature-dependent hydration of the short POP chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiamines 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemulsifiers 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3along chain fatty acids 3ananoemulsions 3apolyethylene glycol 3asodium chloride 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPolyoxypropylene surfactant 0aPhase inversion temperature 0aNanoemulsion 0aPolyoxypropylene diamine 0aLong-chain fatty acid1 aSun, Zhicheng1 aWang, Zengzi1 aZheng, Xiaoyang1 aXu, Zhenghe1 aSun, Dejun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Mar. 22, v. 540 p.177-184dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245006300172300001400235520089400249592002801143650001201171650001001183650001501193650003001208650003701238650001401275650002001289653001901309653003501328653004401363653003701407653003701444700002301481700002201504773011501526856008801641852000901729655001201738IND60540124120221121061939.0190318e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054012412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBigus, Paulina10aHistorical records of organic pollutants in sediment cores  ap. 26-42.  aAnalyses of sediment core samples are primary sources of historical pollution trends in aquatic systems. Determining organic compounds, such as POPs, in the dated sediments enables the estimation of their temporal concentration changes and the identification of the contaminant origin in local regions. Wars, large-scale fires, economical transitions, and bans on certain chemicals are reflected in the sediment organic compound concentrations. The high POP concentrations in surficial sediments suggest that these chemicals, even after being banned, remain in the environment. Furthermore, vertical profiles can help in understanding the sedimentation process and in estimating effective countermeasures against pollution. Moreover, studies published during the period 1991–2013 on PAHs, PCBs, OCPs, dioxins and dioxin-like compound concentrations in sediment core samples are reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adioxins 3afires 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediments 3awater pollution 0aSediment cores 0aHistorical trends of pollution 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 0aOrganochlorine pesticides (OCPs)1 aTobiszewski, Marek1 aNamieśnik, Jacek0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 78, no. 1-2 p.26-42dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011900161500001900280520162800299592002801927650001801955650001401973650001501987650002802002650001402030650002002044650000902064650004302073650001202116650001002128650002602138700002102164700003202185700001902217700003002236700002202266700002302288700003002311700002202341700003302363700001602396700002102412700002302433700002302456700001702479700001902496700005302515773012202568856007402690852000902764655001202773IND60732179520221121230732.0210326e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073217952DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130310022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Marta,10aClinical Usefulness of Anthropometric Indices to Predict the Presence of Prediabetes. Data from the ILERVAS Cohort  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrediabetes is closely related to excess body weight and adipose distribution. For this reason, we aimed to assess and compare the diagnostic usefulness of ten anthropometric adiposity indices to predict prediabetes. Cross-sectional study with 8188 overweight subjects free of type 2 diabetes from the ILERVAS project (NCT03228459). Prediabetes was diagnosed by levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Total body adiposity indices [BMI, Clínica Universidad de Navarra-Body Adiposity Estimator (CUN-BAE) and Deurenberg’s formula] and abdominal adiposity (waist and neck circumferences, conicity index, waist to height ratio, Bonora’s equation, A body shape index, and body roundness index) were calculated. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the best cutoff and the prevalence of prediabetes around this value were calculated for every anthropometric index. All anthropometric indices other than the A body adiposity were higher in men and women with prediabetes compared with controls (p < 0.001 for all). In addition, a slightly positive correlation was found between indices and HbA1c in both sexes (r ≤ 0.182 and p ≤ 0.026 for all). None of the measures achieved acceptable levels of discrimination in ROC analysis (area under the ROC ≤ 0.63 for all). Assessing BMI, the prevalence of prediabetes among men increased from 20.4% to 36.2% around the cutoff of 28.2 kg/m², with similar data among women (from 29.3 to 44.8% with a cutoff of 28.6 kg/m²). No lonely obesity index appears to be the perfect biomarker to use in clinical practice to detect individuals with prediabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aadiposity 3abiomarkers 3across-sectional studies 3aequations 3aglycohemoglobin 3aneck 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3awaist 3awaist-to-height ratio1 aSánchez, Enric,1 aBermúdez-López, Marcelino1 aTorres, Gerard1 aFarràs-Sallés, Cristina1 aPamplona, Reinald1 aCastro-Boqué, Eva1 aValdivielso, José Manuel1 aPurroy, Francisco1 aMartínez-Alonso, Montserrat1 aGodoy, Pere1 aMauricio, Didac,1 aFernández, Elvira1 aHernández, Marta,1 aRius, Ferran1 aLecube, Albert1 aOn Behalf of the ILERVAS Project Collaborators, 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130310023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015000169300001600319520180600335536030802141592002802449596002002477650003302497650001002530650002702540650002402567650002202591650001302613650003202626650001602658650001802674650001402692650002202706650002202728650001302750650001702763650001702780651001002797653001102807653001102818653002002829653000902849653001802858653001402876653002102890700001802911700002302929700001902952773011402971856008603085852000903171655001203180IND60760479920221120105949.0211222e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076047992DNAL7 a10.1080/01652176.2021.19959092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyasi, Shruti10aComplete genome sequencing and assessment of mutation-associated protein dynamics of the first Indian bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) isolate  ap. 308-319.  aBovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is a re-emerging disease caused by bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV). Although it poses a huge economic threat to the livestock sector, complete viral genome information from any South Asian country, including India, lacks. Genome characterization of the first Indian BEFV isolate and to evaluate its genetic diversity by characterizing genomic mutations and their associated protein dynamics. Of the nineteen positive blood samples collected from BEF symptomatic animals during the 2018-19 outbreaks in India, one random sample was used to amplify the entire viral genome by RT-PCR. Utilizing Sanger sequencing and NGS technology, a complete genome was determined. Genome characterization, genetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses were explored by comparing the results with available global isolates. Additionally, unique genomic mutations within the Indian isolate were investigated, followed by in-silico assessment of non-synonymous (NS) mutations impacts on corresponding proteins’ secondary structure, solvent accessibility and dynamics. The complete genome of Indian BEFV has 14,903 nucleotides with 33% GC with considerable genetic diversity. Its sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relatedness to the Middle Eastern lineage. Genome-wide scanning elucidated 30 unique mutations, including 10 NS mutations in the P, L and GNS proteins. The mutational impact evaluation confirmed alterations in protein structure and dynamics, with minimal effect on solvent accessibility. Additionally, alteration in the interatomic interactions was compared against the wild type. These findings extend our understanding of the BEFV epidemiological and pathogenic potential, aiding in developing better therapeutic and preventive interventions.  aThis study was supported by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB: ECR/2016/000130), Govt. of India.

Here, the genomic DNA and cDNA sequences of goose (Anser cygnoides) DRD2 gene were cloned and characterized for the first time. The goose DRD2 cDNA is 1353bp in length and encodes a protein of 450 amino acids. The length of goose DRD2 genomic DNA is 8350bp, including seven exons and six introns. We identified four goose DRD2 variants, which were generated due to alternative splicing. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that all the deduced DRD2 amino acid sequences contain seven putative transmembrane domains and four potential N-glycosylation sites. A phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences displays that the goose DRD2 protein is closely related to those of avian species. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that the DRD2-1, DRD2-2 and DRD2-4 transcripts are differentially expressed in the pituitary, ovary, hypothalamus, as well as in the kidney, whereas the DRD2-3 transcript is widely expressed in all the examined tissues at different levels. Meanwhile, 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4 insert-deletion (indel) variations were identified in the coding region and partial intron region of the goose DRD2 gene. Those findings will help us gain insight into the functions of the DRD2 gene in geese.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroodiness 3asecretion 3abioinformatics 3aphylogeny 3ageese 3ahypothalamus 3adopamine receptors 3aamino acids 3aintrons 3aAnser cygnoides 3aalternative splicing 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3amolecular cloning 3akidneys 3aexons 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aglycosylation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aprolactin 0agenes 0aRT-PCR 0aAlternative splicing 0abp 0aaa 0aindel 0aCDS 0aDifferential expression 0aSNPs 0aDRD1 0aNJ 0aDRD4 0acDNA 0aJTT 0aUTR 0aDRD2 0aDRD3 0aORF 0aDRD5 0aGAPDH 0aCloning1 aLiu, Yi1 aWang, Huiying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1612-42031 aWu, Huali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8731-36881 aGong, Shaoming1 aChen, Weihu1 aHe, Daqian0 tGene.g2014 Feb. 10, v. 535 p.177-183dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007700162500001900239520071700258592002800975650002301003650001401026650001701040650001901057650001201076650001401088650000901102650001701111650001701128700002101145700002201166700002201188700002301210700002301233700001901256700001901275700002001294773012201314856007401436852000901510655001201519IND60732179720221121184131.0210326e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073217972DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130310042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGangitano, Elena 10aKetogenic Diet as a Preventive and Supportive Care for COVID-19 Patients  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSevere obesity is associated with an increased risk of admission to intensive care units and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19. The association of obesity and COVID-19 prognosis may be related to many different factors, such as chronic systemic inflammation, the predisposition to severe respiratory conditions and viral infections. The ketogenic diet is an approach that can be extremely effective in reducing body weight and visceral fat in the short term, preserving the lean mass and reducing systemic inflammation. Therefore, it is a precious preventive measure for severely obese people and may be considered as an adjuvant therapy for patients with respiratory compromise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aadjuvants 3ainflammation 3aketogenic diet 3aobesity 3aprognosis 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3avisceral fat1 aTozzi, Rossella 1 aGandini, Orietta 1 aWatanabe, Mikiko 1 aBasciani, Sabrina 1 aMariani, Stefania 1 aLenzi, Andrea 1 aGnessi, Lucio 1 aLubrano, Carla 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130310043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012800169300001600297520094500313592002801258650002301286650002901309650002601338650002501364650001701389650001301406650002901419650001401448650002501462650001901487650001001506650003201516650000901548650001101557651001001568653002301578653001801601653001801619653002501637700001801662700002101680700002201701700001701723773010101740856008201841852000901923655001201932IND50063666620221118200103.0180621e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006366662DNAL7 a10.2478/s11535-013-0150-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiweli, Abdulhmid10aChemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of essential oil of Thymus algeriensis wild-growing in Libya  ap. 504-511.  aThe composition of essential oil isolated from Thymus algeriensis growing wild in Libya was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The essential oil was characterized with thymol (38.50%) as the major component. The oil was screened for antioxidant activity using DPPH assay, and compared to thymol and carvacrol. Antioxidant activity was high, with the IC50 of 0.299 mg/ml, compared to 0.403 and 0.105 mg/ml for thymol and carvacrol, and 0.0717 mg/ml for BHA. In addition, antimicrobial activity was tested against eight bacteria and eight fungi. T. algeriensis oil showed inhibitory activity against tested bacteria at 0.001–0.05 mg/ml, while bactericidal activity (MBC) was achieved at 0.0025–0.05 mg/ml. For antifungal activity MICs ranged 0.0005–0.025 mg/ml and MFC 0.001–0.05 mg/ml. High antimicrobial activity against the fungi in particular suggests that the essential oil of Thymus algeriensis could have a useful practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThymus algeriensis 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3abutylated hydroxyanisole 3acarvacrol 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3afungi 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aoils 3athymol 3aLibya 0aThymus algeriensis 0aEssential oil 0aAntimicrobial 0aAntioxidant activity1 aDžamić, Ana1 aSoković, Marina1 aRistić, Mihailo,1 aMarin, Petar0 tOpen life sciences.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 8, no. 5 p.504-511dVersitawJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-013-0150-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01162naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007400159300001600233500002000249520021100269592002800480650001300508650002700521650001100548650001600559650002000575650002300595651001500618773013200633856007400765852000900839655001200848IND60716609420221119104735.0201106e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071660942DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.123522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermans, Johan10aCYNORKIS PREHSLERI: A new orchid from northern Madagascar Orchidaceae  ap. 376-384.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA full description and detailed illustration are provided for the new species Cynorkis prehsleri Hermans & Sieder (Fig. 1.) from Northern Madagascar and it is compared with similar Cynorkis from the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynorkis 3abotanical illustration 3abotany 3anew species 3aplants (botany) 3ataxon descriptions 3aMadagascar0 tCurtis's botanical magazine.g2020 Sept., v. 37, no. 3 p.376-384dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867070x1355-49057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/curt.123523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245019500162500001900357520179600376592002802172650001402200650002202214650001702236650002402253650001402277650003702291650001102328650001902339650002302358650001402381650002302395650001902418650002102437650002302458650001202481650001702493650001402510650001902524650000902543650001602552700003302568700003002601700002202631700003202653700002102685700001802706700002902724773012202753856007402875852000902949655001202958IND60732179820221121184114.0210326e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073217982DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130310052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihatsch, Walter 10aBone Mineral Density, Body Composition, and Metabolic Health of Very Low Birth Weight Infants Fed in Hospital Following Current Macronutrient Recommendations during the First 3 Years of Life  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study longitudinally evaluated growth, bone mineral density, body composition, and metabolic health outcome in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants whose in-hospital target nutrient intake was within recent recommendations. From six months to three years, bone mineral density (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), body composition, and metabolic health outcome were compared with a reference group of term infants. The aim was to test whether in-hospital achieved weight gain until 36 weeks of gestation (light or appropriate for term equivalent age; LTEA or ATEA) predicts later growth, bone mineral density (BMD), abdominal obesity, or metabolic health outcomes such as insulin resistance, relative to term infants, during the first three years of life. Target in-hospital energy and protein intake was not achieved. Growth in weight, length and head circumference, mid arm circumference, adiposity, fat free mass (FFM), and bone mineralization in VLBW infants was less than those in term infants and influenced by nutritional status at discharge. Preterm infants had poorer motor and cognitive outcomes. Post-discharge body composition patterns indicate FFM proportional to height but lower fat mass index in LTEA preterm infants than term infants, with no evidence of increased truncal fat in preterm infants. The hypothesis of early BMD catch-up in VLBW infants after discharge was not supported by the present data. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. The data may suggest a reduced obesity risk but an increased osteoporosis risk. Since postnatal growth restriction may have permanent negative health effects, LTEA VLBW infants would especially appear to benefit from targeted preventive interventions. Further follow-up of the infants is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aarm circumference 3abone density 3abone mineralization 3acognition 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aenergy 3afat mass index 3ahead circumference 3ahospitals 3ainsulin resistance 3alean body mass 3alow birth weight 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3aosteoporosis 3apregnancy 3aprotein intake 3arisk 3aweight gain1 aDorronsoro Martín, Izaskun 1 aBarrios-Sabador, Vicente 1 aCouce, María  L.1 aMartos-Moreno, Gabriel  Á.1 aArgente, Jesús,1 aQuero, José 1 aSaenz de Pipaon, Miguel 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130310053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012500173300001600298520102400314592002801338650002301366650001701389650001901406650001801425650001801443650002101461650001601482650001301498650001501511650001401526650003201540650001201572650001301584650002301597650001301620650001501633653001601648653003101664653001601695653003501711653001901746653002701765653003001792653003801822653007701860700007101937700002402008700001602032700002202048700005902070700001602129700002202145700001902167773009902186856008702285852000902372655001202381IND60526028820221117192757.0190402e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052602882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.12.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurante, Miriana10aα-Cyclodextrin encapsulation of supercritical CO2 extracted oleoresins from different plant matrices: A stability study  ap. 684-693.  aHere we describe the encapsulation in α-cyclodextrins (α-CDs) of wheat bran, pumpkin and tomato oleoresins, extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide, to obtain freeze-dried powders useful as ready-to-mix ingredients for novel functional food formulation. The stability of tocochromanols, carotenoids and fatty acids in the oleoresin/α-CD complexes, compared to the corresponding free oleoresins, was also monitored over time in different combinations of storage conditions. Regardless of light, storage at 25°C of free oleoresins determined a rapid decrease in carotenoids, tocochromanols and PUFAs. α-CD encapsulation improved the stability of most bioactive compounds. Storage at 4°C synergized with encapsulation in preventing degradation of bioactives. Unlike all other antioxidants, lycopene in tomato oleoresin/α-CD complex resulted to be more susceptible to oxidation than in free oleoresin, likely due to its selective sequestration from the interaction with other lipophilic molecules of the oleoresin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-cyclodextrin 3aantioxidants 3acarbon dioxide 3aencapsulation 3afreeze drying 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3alycopene 3aoleoresins 3aoxidation 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apowders 3apumpkins 3astorage conditions 3atomatoes 3awheat bran 0aCarotenoids 0aCucurbita moschata (Duch.) 0aFatty acids 0aSupercritical fluid extraction 0aTocochromanols 0aTriticum durum (Desf.) 0aSolanum lycopersicum (L.) 0aDifferential scanning calorimetry 0aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy – attenuated total reflectance1 aLenucci, Marcello Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6493-95491 aMarrese, Pier Paolo1 aRizzi, Vito1 aDe Caroli, Monica1 aPiro, Gabriella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3420-87881 aFini, Paola1 aRusso, Gian Luigi1 aMita, Giovanni0 tFood chemistry.g2016 May 15, v. 199 p.684-693dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.12.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012300177300001600300520105400316592002801370650001501398650001201413650001601425650002801441650001001469650001601479650000901495650001401504650001301518650001801531650001301549651001801562651002701580653001801607653001301625653001801638653001301656653001801669653003201687700005801719700002401777773008901801856008401890852000901974655001201983IND60546069920221119025045.0160903e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054606992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoggarth, Cameron G.J.10aMercury methylation in high and low-sulphate impacted wetland ponds within the prairie pothole region of North America  ap. 269-277.  aUsing enriched stable 201Hg injections into intact sediment cores, we provide the first reported Hg methylation potential rate constants (km) in prairie wetland ponds (0.016–0.17 d−1). Our km values were similar to other freshwater wetlands and did not differ in ponds categorized with high compared to low surface water concentrations of sulphate. Sites with high sulphate had higher proportions of methylmercury (MeHg) in sediment (2.9 ± 1.6% vs. 1.0 ± 0.3%) and higher surface water MeHg concentrations (1.96 ± 1.90 ng L−1vs. 0.56 ± 0.55 ng L−1). Sediment-porewater partitioning coefficients were small, and likely due to high ionic activity. Our work suggests while km measurements are useful for understanding mercury cycling processes, they are less important than surface water MeHg concentrations for assessing MeHg risks to biota. Significant differences in MeHg concentrations between sites with high and low sulphate concentrations may also inform management decisions concerning wetland remediation and creation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3aponds 3aremediation 3arisk 3asediments 3asulfates 3asurface water 3awetlands 3aNorth America 3aPrairie Pothole region 0aMethylmercury 0aSediment 0aSurface water 0aSulphate 0aWetland ponds 0aNorth American Great Plains1 aHall, Britt D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4001-49521 aMitchell, Carl P.J.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2015 Oct., v. 205 p.269-277dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.05.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011100166300001600277520106400293592002801357650004401385650002201429650003701451650001501488650001501503650003401518650002401552650001501576650001801591650001901609650001101628650002001639650003301659650001701692650002101709650001501730653002001745653001301765653001401778653002001792653001801812653001901830700001601849700001801865700001301883700001801896700001401914700001701928700005701945773012502002856008302127852000902210655001202219IND60628902620221121235203.0190326e20190322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062890262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, De Bin10a2D-2D growth of NiFe LDH nanoflakes on montmorillonite for cationic and anionic dye adsorption performance  ap. 398-409.  aNiFe layered double hydroxides nanoflakes decorated montmorillonite (MMT@NiFe LDH) was successfully prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The 2D-2D growth MMT@NiFe LDH was utilized as an effective adsorbent for removal of anionic dye of methyl orange (MO) and cationic dye of methylene blue (MB). The mole ratio of Ni2+/Fe3+ could quite influence the interlayer spacing, surface area per unit charge and the ultrathin hexagonal laminated morphology of NiFe LDH decorated on the surface of MMT. Various characterization techniques were conducted to identify it, such as XRD, FT-IR, TG-DTA, BET, XPS and SEM. Under the optimal conditions, the Langmuir-fitted maximum adsorption capacities for MO and MB are 108.80 mg g−1 and 99.18 mg g−1, respectively. Adsorption kinetics for MO and MB are both verified to be fit in with pseudo-second-order model. This work suggests a facile pathway to synthesize desirable bifunctional adsorbent for cationic and anionic dyes, which provides the potential application for the actual wastewater purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adifferential thermal analysis 3ahot water treatment 3ahydroxides 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3athermogravimetry 3awastewater 0aMontmorillonite 0aNiFe LDH 0aAdsorbent 0aSewage disposal 0aMethyl orange 0aMethylene blue1 aJing, Chuan1 aYuan, Yunsong1 aFeng, Li1 aLiu, Xiaoying1 aDong, Fan1 aDong, Biqing1 aZhang, Yu Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4698-56450 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Mar. 22, v. 540 p.398-409dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005100167300001400218520091400232592002801146650001401174650001601188650001901204650001201223651001801235773009601253856008201349852000901431655001201440IND60691181020200616000000.0200428e19970601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069118102DNAL7 a10.2752/0892793977870011842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Dena M.14aThe Media's Response to Animal Rights Activism  ap. 67-75.  aTwo recently published projects documented a peak in print coverage of animal-related topics in the late 1980s with a subsequent decline in coverage. One of the studies specifically tracked media coverage of activism on behalf of animals and documented a similar trend in the number of stories on the subject. Those observations are confirmed by the findings of a study, reported in this paper, that tracked print coverage of three annual animal rights events in the USA over a period of 13 years. In addition to charting trends in coverage, the study attempted to compare the level of media coverage with the level of activist participation. Differences are also noted between media attention to protest and nonprotest events.

The C and O atoms substituted the sp2 N atom in graphitic carbon nitride (CN). The 1MACN (1 represented that the weight ratio of malonic acid to urea is 1% during the synthesis) with optimal band structure could decompose 15 ppm bisphenol A (BPA) within 150 min, and the mineralization rate reached to 52%. The superior photocatalytic performance of 1MACN was mainly ascribed to electronic band structure together with optical properties. On the one hand, the formation of delocalized big π bonds favored the electrons transfer after the introducing of carbon atoms. On the other hand, a positive charge density existed on the C atoms because of high electronegativity of contiguous O (3.44) that substituted N compared with C (2.55), which could attribute to high activity of MACN catalyst. The study will contribute to the further improvement of visible-light photocatalytic BPA degradation and mineralization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3agraphene 3amalonic acid 3amineralization 3aoptical properties 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3apolymerization 3aurea 0aGraphitic carbon nitride 0aVisible-light photocatalytic 0aBPA mineralization 0aCarbon-oxygen dual-doping1 aChen, Huan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8928-02961 aJiang, Fang1 aWang, Xin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Mar. 22, v. 540 p.97-106dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245007900177300001100256520192100267592002802188596007502216650002302291650001902314650001902333650002402352650001402376650002002390650001302410650001402423651001002437700006302447700002202510700003502532700002602567700002602593700002802619773012702647856008302774852000902857655001202866IND60712661820221118213141.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071266182DNAL7 a10.1186/s13006-020-00324-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLechosa-Muñiz, Carolina10aFactors associated with duration of breastfeeding in Spain: a cohort study  ap. 79.  aBACKGROUND: Factors associated with duration of breastfeeding have been usually studied at specific times after birth. Little is known about how much time is added to breastfeeding by each associated factor. METHODS: A cohort of 969 mother-child dyads was followed-up for twelve months at the Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital, Spain, in 2018. Data on mother characteristics, pregnancy, delivery and children characteristics were obtained from medical records. Length of breastfeeding was reported by the mothers and recorded in paediatric medical record at hospital discharge and 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months of life. Factors associated with duration of breastfeeding were analysed via multivariate Weibull regression parameterized as accelerated time of failure. Results are presented as time ratios. RESULTS: About four out of five children were breastfed at hospital discharge, although this proportion dropped to 65% in children born from smoker women, 70% in preterm children and 68% in neonates weighting less than 2500 g. Mother’s age was associated with longer breastfeeding, adding 2% more breastfeeding time per year (adjusted time ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval 1.00, 1.04). Children born from mothers with university studies were breastfed 53% more time than those born from mothers with primary studies (adjusted time ratio 1.53; 95% confidence interval 1.21, 1.95); smoking in pregnancy decreased length of breastfeeding by 41% (adjusted time ratio 0.59; 95% confidence interval 0.46, 0.76). Other factors associated with longer breastfeeding were single pregnancy and newborn weight over 2500 g. CONCLUSIONS: Analysing factors associated with duration of breastfeeding as time parameters allows us to quantify the amount of time gained or lost by each factor, which could make it easier to evaluate the relevance of programmes directed to promote facilitating breastfeeding factors.  aPublisher supplied data  a19th call for researchcValdecilla Health Research Institute (IDIVAL). 3aWeibull statistics 3abreast feeding 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3ahospitals 3amedical records 3aneonates 3apregnancy 3aSpain1 aPaz-Zulueta, María1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3025-98921 aSota, Sonia Mateo1 ade Adana Herrero, María Sáez1 adel Rio, Elsa Cornejo1 aLlorca, J.q(Javier),1 aCabero-Perez, María J.0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2020 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.79-79dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-020-00324-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008500162300001600247520145500263592002801718650001301746650001301759650001301772650001801785650001901803650002001822650001401842653002001856653001601876653001401892653001601906653001701922700001601939700001701955700001401972700001801986700005802004773012502062856008302187852000902270655001202279IND60628902820221121235235.0190326e20190322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062890282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Qing10aClay-based superamphiphobic coatings with low sliding angles for viscous liquids  ap. 228-236.  aAlthough significant attention has been paid, most of superamphiphobic surfaces suffer from high sliding angles (SA) for liquids with low surface tension and complicated preparation methods. Also, superamphiphobic coatings with high repellency to the liquids with very high viscosity and low surface tension are rare. Here, we report preparation of clay-based superamphiphobic coatings with low SAs for viscous liquids. A homogeneous suspension was prepared by hydrolytic condensation of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane in the existence of attapulgite, a kind of natural clay mineral with nanorods-like microstructure. The superamphiphobic coatings were readily prepared by spray-coating the suspension onto substrates. The effects of attapulgite on microstructure and superamphiphobicity of the coatings were studied. Also, the static and dynamic superamphiphobicity were investigated. The attapulgite concentration has great influences on superamphiphobicity and solid-liquid adhesion force of the coatings, as it determines microstructure of the coatings. The superamphiphobic surfaces feature high contact angles and low SAs for various liquids including those with extremely high viscosity and low surface tension, e.g., hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and the HTPB/Al mixture (1:1, w/w). The coating also shows low solid-liquid adhesion force, high impact resistance and fast rolling of various liquids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaluminum 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3amicrostructure 3asurface tension 3aviscosity 0aSuperoleophobic 0aWettability 0aViscosity 0aAttapulgite 0aPalygorskite1 aLi, Bucheng1 aLi, Shangbin1 aLuo, Guan1 aZheng, Baohui1 aZhang, Junping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3658-58780 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Mar. 22, v. 540 p.228-236dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012200165300001600287520083100303592002801134650001301162650001701175650001401192650002801206650001001234650002101244650001901265650002601284650001501310650001401325650000901339650001101348650001201359650001801371650002701389653001401416653002201430653003001452653000901482653002601491653000901517700001601526773014501542856008601687852000901773655001201782IND60114116020221118161739.0190415e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011411602DNAL7 a10.1016/S1672-6308(13)60148-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBera, S.,10aSoil Physico-Chemical Properties and Microflora as Influenced by Bispyribac Sodium 10% SC in Transplanted Kharif Rice  ap. 298-302.  aThe effects of bispyribac sodium 10% SC and butachlor 50% SC on soil physico-chemical properties and microflora in transplanted kharif rice were investigated over two seasons (2010 and 2011). Effects of the herbicide on bulk density, water holding capacity, moisture content, soil pH, organic matter content, electrical conductivity, as well as total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium contents were analyzed along with microflora population (total bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi). No significant changes in soil physico-chemical properties were observed. Herbicide treatments resulted in decreases in microbial counts initially. With the degradation of applied herbicides within a considerable time, the microflora populations even exceeded the initial count at 60 d after application of the herbicide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abulk density 3abutachlor 3aelectrical conductivity 3afungi 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3apesticide application 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arice 3asodium 3asoil pH 3awater content 3awater holding capacity 0aherbicide 0abispyribac sodium 0aphysico-chemical property 0asoil 0amicroflora population 0arice1 aGHOSH, R.K.0 tRice science.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 4 p.298-302dElsevier B.V.aChina National Rice Research InstitutewJournal:J000000149x1672-63087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1672-6308(13)60148-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245019300169300001600362520111400378592002801492650001201520650002601532650001301558650002201571650001101593650001501604650004401619650001501663650002101678650001501699650001201714650001901726653003901745653005301784653002701837653002001864653001701884700002001901700001801921700001701939700002201956700002301978700002302001773008902024856008402113852000902197655001202206IND60546070020221119171831.0160903e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054607002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJulien, Maxime10aFractionation in position-specific isotope composition during vaporization of environmental pollutants measured with isotope ratio monitoring by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry  ap. 299-306.  aIsotopic fractionation of pollutants in terrestrial or aqueous environments is a well-recognized means by which to track different processes during remediation. As a complement to the common practice of measuring the change in isotope ratio for the whole molecule using isotope ratio monitoring by mass spectrometry (irm-MS), position-specific isotope analysis (PSIA) can provide further information that can be exploited to investigate source and remediation of soil and water pollutants. Position-specific fractionation originates from either degradative or partitioning processes. We show that isotope ratio monitoring by 13C NMR (irm-13C NMR) spectrometry can be effectively applied to methyl tert-butylether, toluene, ethanol and trichloroethene to obtain this position-specific data for partitioning. It is found that each compound exhibits characteristic position-specific isotope fractionation patterns, and that these are modulated by the type of evaporative process occurring. Such data should help refine models of how remediation is taking place, hence back-tracking to identify pollutant sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethanol 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apollutants 3asoil remediation 3asoil water 3atoluene 3avolatilization 0aPosition-specific isotope analysis 0aIsotope ratio monitoring by 13C NMR spectrometry 0aMethyl tert-butylether 0aTrichloroethene 0aVaporization1 aParinet, Julien1 aNun, Pierrick1 aBayle, Kevin1 aHöhener, Patrick1 aRobins, Richard J.1 aRemaud, Gérald S.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2015 Oct., v. 205 p.299-306dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014400160500001900304520148900323592002801812650002301840650002401863650002401887650001301911650003101924650001401955650002501969650001601994650001502010650002402025650001702049650001002066650003102076650003002107650002802137650001802165650002802183650002202211650001402233700001502247700001702262700001602279700001402295700001402309700001902323700001902342700002002361773012202381856007402503852000902577655001202586IND60732180120221119095851.0210326e20210321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073218012DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130310082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Xiao-Qian 10aInfluence of Short-Term Consumption of Hericium erinaceus on Serum Biochemical Markers and the Changes of the Gut Microbiota: A Pilot Study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHericium erinaceus (H. erinaceus) is widely studied as a medicinal and edible fungus. Recent studies have shown that H. erinaceus has protective effects for diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer, which are related to gut microbiota. To investigate the benefits of H. erinaceus intake on gut microbiota and blood indices in adulthood, we recruited 13 healthy adults to consume H. erinaceus powder as a dietary supplement. Blood changes due to H. erinaceus consumption were determined by routine hematological examination and characterized by serum biochemical markers. Microbiota composition was profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Results showed that daily H. erinaceus supplementation increased the alpha diversity within the gut microbiota community, upregulated the relative abundance of some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria (Kineothrix alysoides, Gemmiger formicilis, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), and downregulated some pathobionts (Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacteroides caccae, Romboutsia timonensis). Changes within the gut microbiota were correlated with blood chemical indices including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), uric acid (UA), and creatinine (CREA). Thus, we found that the gut microbiota alterations may be part of physiological adaptations to a seven-day H. erinaceus supplementation, potentially influencing beneficial health effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides caccae 3aEubacterium rectale 3aGemmiger formicilis 3aHericium 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aadulthood 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adietary supplements 3aedible fungi 3agenes 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alow density lipoprotein 3aribosomal RNA 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aspecies diversity 3auric acid1 aGeng, Yan 1 aGuan, Qijie 1 aRen, Yilin 1 aGuo, Lin 1 aLv, Qiqi 1 aLu, Zhen-Ming 1 aShi, Jin-Song 1 aXu, Zheng-Hong 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 21, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130310083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245011400211300001600325520114100341592002801482650001501510650002501525650002201550650001801572650001901590650002501609650002901634650001501663650001201678653001901690653002601709653001001735653002901745653004001774653002901814700002001843773011201863856008601975852000902061655001202070IND60531745320221118205954.0180831e20160520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053174532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassetti, Emilio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2703-833810aEco-efficiency measurement and the influence of organisational factors: evidence from large Italian companies  ap. 228-239.  aThis paper investigates the use of the eco-efficiency measurement. It also analyses whether environmental planning, business strategies, operational practices, environmental management system certification and environmental management accounting influence eco-efficiency. The five organisational factors express formal elements of the organisational structure. The research design consists of a mixed method approach with a set of information composed of a survey of 65 companies plus 14 interviews. The results show a poor use of eco-efficiency measurement and the positive influence of just environmental planning and environmental management accounting. What stands out is the urgency to encourage companies to have more articulated measurement and evaluation tools for analyse the interplay between environmental and economic performance (i.e. eco-efficiency). The paper extends empirical studies on environment-related management accounting tools. This study also underlines the importance of analysing the organisational dimension which is fundamental for promoting the integration of environmental issues into management control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3abusiness enterprises 3abusiness planning 3acertification 3aeco-efficiency 3aeconomic performance 3aenvironmental management 3ainterviews 3asurveys 0aEco-efficiency 0aOrganisational factor 0aItaly 0aEnvironmental accounting 0aEnvironmental management accounting 0aEnvironmental management1 aTenucci, Andrea0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 May 20, v. 122 p.228-239dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03773naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001800167245017500185300001600360520175300376592002802129650003302157650001302190650002502203650001602228650002002244650002002264650003102284650001002315650001802325650001902343650002002362650001402382650002602396650001402422650005702436650001202493650005602505650004502561650003902606650004302645650000902688650002402697650005302721650002102774650002702795650002402822650004102846700002002887700001802907700001802925700001802943700002102961773008402982856008403066852000903150655001203159IND4477068720221119013014.0141111e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447706872DNAL7 a220616602pmid7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2011.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Do-yeon,10aGinsenoside Rd stimulates the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells by activating AMP-activated protein kinase via the BMP-2 signaling pathway  ap. 215-222.  aAs part of our search for biologically active anti-osteoporotic agents that enhance the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, we identified the ginsenoside Rd as the most active compound among ginsenosides. In this study, we showed that Rd stimulates osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization, manifested by the up-regulation of differentiation markers (alkaline phosphatase and osteogenic genes) and von Kossa/Alizarin Red staining, respectively. Rd induces the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and the secretion of the corresponding protein into media in a concentration-dependent manner. The mRNA expression and enzyme activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were suppressed when MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to noggin, a BMP-2 antagonist. The level of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) protein was also up-regulated by Rd in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Rd-induced ALP activity, mineralization, and BMP-2 production were all inhibited by either Ara-A (AMPK inhibitor) or siRNA targeting AMPK. In addition, we investigated whether Rd-induced BMP-2 transduces signals through the Smad signaling pathways. Rd induced a significant level of phosphorylation of Smad1/5, and this effect was blocked when the cells were transfected with siRNA targeting Smad4, indicating that Smad1/5 must form complex with Smad4 to translocate into the nucleus and regulate the transcription of osteogenic genes. In summary, these results indicate that Rd induces the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells through the activation of the AMPK/BMP-2/Smad signaling pathways. These findings provide a molecular basis for the osteogenic effect of Rd in MC3T3-E1 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aalizarin 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantagonists 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amineralization 3aphosphorylation 3asecretion 3asmall interfering RNA 2a3T3 Cells 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBone Morphogenetic Protein 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCalcification, Physiologicxdrug effects 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aGinsenosidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMice 2aMolecular Structure 2aOsteoblastsxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Small Interfering 2aSignal Transduction 2aSmad Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aPark, Young Guk1 aQuan, Hai-Yan1 aKim, Su-jung,1 aJung, Mi Song1 aChung, Sung Hyun0 tFitoterapia.g2012 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.215-222dElsevier B.V.x0367-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2011.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245017600206300001800382500001900400506007600419520083900495592002801334596006701362596006401429506003701493650002101530650002401551650001001575650001501585650001601600650002501616650001401641650001601655650001201671650001301683650001201696651001001708700001701718700001701735700001501752700001901767700005101786700001501837700001601852773011601868856008201984852000902066655001202075IND60663946120221207113628.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066394612DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-019-04324-82doi7 aPMC70872282pmcid7 a312706062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Sunjian10aComplete genome sequence and analysis of a new lethal arterivirus, Trionyx sinensis hemorrhagic syndrome virus (TSHSV), amplified from an infected Chinese softshell turtle  ap. 2593-2597.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTrionyx sinensis hemorrhagic syndrome virus (TSHSV) is a newly discovered lethal arterivirus that causes serious disease in Trionyx sinensis in China. In this study, the complete genome sequence of TSHSV was determined by RACE cloning, and the functions of the predicted proteins were predicted. The complete genome of TSHSV was found to be 17,875 bp in length, and a 3’-end poly(A) tail was detected. Eight TSHSV hypothetical proteins (TSHSV-HPs) were predicted by gene model identification. TSHSV-HP2, 3 and 4 were associated with replicase activity, since papain-like protease (PLPs), serine-type endopeptidase, P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, and EndoU-like endoribonuclease motifs were detected.

The World Health Organization recommends starting breastfeeding within the first hour of birth, yet many women in sub-Saharan Africa do not observe this recommendation. To date, there is limited evidence of timely initiation of breastfeeding for Zimbabwe. Therefore, we undertook this study with the aim of calculating the trend in timely initiation of breastfeeding and to explore the correlates. METHODS: We used five rounds of Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey data conducted between 1999 and 2015. Participants were 15,923 mothers currently breastfeeding or who had a childbirth within five years preceding the surveys. Outcome variable was self-reported timing of timely breastfeeding for singleton births which was categorized as early (< 60 min), late (≥ 60 min to < 2 4 h) and very late (≥ 24 h). RESULTS: Prevalence of timely initiation of breastfeeding was 60.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 57.44, 63.02) in 1999, 66.9% (95% CI 64.32, 69.4) in 2006, 65.8% (95% CI 63.7, 67.8) in 2011 and 58.3% (95% CI 56.3, 60.4) in 2015. It increased by 27 and 22% in 2006 and 2011 compared with that of the 1999 level respectively. We found no socio-economic and gender-based differentials in the prevalence of timely initiation of breastfeeding. Compared with women aged 15–19 years old, women 25–29 and 30–34 years old had higher odds of practicing timely initiation of breastfeeding. The odds of practicing timely initiation of breastfeeding among Muslim women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.07, 1.36) was 20% higher when compared with Christian mothers. Women who wanted to have their last child later (aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.97) had 11% lower odd of practicing timely initiation of breastfeeding when compared with women who wanted children then. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of timely initiation of breastfeeding in Zimbabwe was 58.3% in 2015, well over the 50% target recommended by WHO for all countries to attain by 2025.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMuslims 3aWorld Health Organization 3abreast feeding 3achildbirth 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3ahealth surveys 3ainfant mortality 3aodds ratio 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 3aZimbabwe1 aBishwajit, Ghose1 aShibre, Gebretsadik1 aBuh, Amos0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2020 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.10-10dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-020-00255-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166520136500305592002801670650001301698650001501711650001701726650001001743650001901753650001901772650001901791650001501810650001901825650001401844650001301858653001201871653002101883653001901904653001401923653002501937653003601962700001601998700002002014700002202034700002202056773008702078856008402165852000902249655001202258IND60687954520221119025450.0200405e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068795452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2020.1028632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUslu, Fatma10aImage-analysis based readout method for biochip: Automated quantification of immunomagnetic beads, micropads and patient leukemia cell  aFor diagnosing and monitoring the progress of cancer, detection and quantification of tumor cells is utmost important. Beside standard bench top instruments, several biochip-based methods have been developed for this purpose. Our biochip design incorporates micron size immunomagnetic beads together with micropad arrays, thus requires automated detection and quantification of not only cells but also the micropads and the immunomagnetic beads. The main purpose of the biochip is to capture target cells having different antigens simultaneously. In this proposed study, a digital image processing-based method to quantify the leukemia cells, immunomagnetic beads and micropads was developed as a readout method for the biochip. Color, size-based object detection and object segmentation methods were implemented to detect structures in the images acquired from the biochip by a bright field optical microscope. It has been shown that manual counting and flow cytometry results are in good agreement with the developed automated counting. Average precision is 85 % and average error rate is 13 % for all images of patient samples, average precision is 99 % and average error rate is 1% for cell culture images. With the optimized micropad size, proposed method can reach up to 95 % precision rate for patient samples with an execution time of 90 s per image.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aautomation 3acell culture 3acolor 3adigital images 3aflow cytometry 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apatients 0aBiochip 0aImage processing 0aLeukemia cells 0aMicropads 0aImmunomagnetic beads 0aBright-field optical microscope1 aIcoz, Kutay1 aTasdemir, Kasim1 aDoğan, Refika S.1 aYılmaz, Bülent,0 tMicron.g2020 June, v. 133 p.102863-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2020.1028633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04662naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006400153245014400217300001400361520276700375592002803142650005003170650001503220650002503235650001303260650001103273650001103284650002003295650001703315650001603332650001903348650001303367650001903380650001103399650001503410650001803425650001203443650001803455650001803473650001103491650000903502650000903511650001403520650002403534650001203558650001303570650002203583650001803605650001003623651001803633653001103651653002003662653003903682653003503721653001703756700002103773700002303794773009803817856008803915852000904003655001204012IND60585885020221119071345.0200607e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058588502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStackelberg, Paul E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1818-355X10aRadium mobility and the age of groundwater in public-drinking-water supplies from the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer system, north-central USA  ap. 34-48.  aHigh radium (Ra) concentrations in potable portions of the Cambrian-Ordovician (C-O) aquifer system were investigated using water-quality data and environmental tracers (³H, ³Heₜᵣᵢₜ, SF₆, ¹⁴C and ⁴Heᵣₐd) of groundwater age from 80 public-supply wells (PSWs). Groundwater ages were estimated by calibration of tracers to lumped parameter models and ranged from modern (<50 yr) in upgradient, regionally unconfined areas to ancient (>1 Myr) in the most downgradient, confined portions of the potable system. More than 80 and 40 percent of mean groundwater ages were older than 1000 and 50,000 yr, respectively. Anoxic, Fe-reducing conditions and increased mineralization develop with time in the aquifer system and mobilize Ra into solution resulting in the frequent occurrence of combined Ra (Rac = ²²⁶Ra + ²²⁸Ra) at concentrations exceeding the USEPA MCL of 185 mBq/L (5 pCi/L). The distribution of the three Ra isotopes comprising total Ra (Raₜ = ²²⁴Ra + ²²⁶Ra + ²²⁸Ra) differed across the aquifer system. The concentrations of ²²⁴Ra and ²²⁸Ra were strongly correlated and comprised a larger proportion of the Raₜ concentration in samples from the regionally unconfined area, where arkosic sandstones provide an enhanced source for progeny from the ²³²Th decay series. ²²⁶Ra comprised a larger proportion of the Raₜ concentration in samples from downgradient confined regions. Concentrations of Raₜ were significantly greater in samples from the regionally confined area of the aquifer system because of the increase in ²²⁶Ra concentrations there as compared to the regionally unconfined area. ²²⁶Ra distribution coefficients decreased substantially with anoxic conditions and increasing ionic strength of groundwater (mineralization), indicating that Ra is mobilized to solution from solid phases of the aquifer as adsorption capacity is diminished. The amount of ²²⁶Ra released from solid phases by alpha-recoil mechanisms and retained in solution increases relative to the amount of Ra sequestered by adsorption processes or co-precipitation with barite as adsorption capacity and the concentration of Ba decreases. Although ²²⁶Ra occurred at concentrations greater than ²²⁴Ra or ²²⁸Ra, the ingestion exposure risk was greater for ²²⁸Ra owing to its greater toxicity. In addition, ²²⁴Ra added substantial alpha-particle radioactivity to potable samples from the C-O aquifer system. Thus, monitoring for Ra isotopes and gross-alpha-activity (GAA) is important in upgradient, regionally unconfined areas as downgradient, and GAA measurements made within 72 h of sample collection would best capture alpha-particle radiation from the short-lived ²²⁴Ra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aadsorption 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaquifers 3abarite 3abarium 3acoprecipitation 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3aionic strength 3aisotopes 3amineralization 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoral exposure 3aprogeny 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3aradium 3arats 3arisk 3asandstone 3asulfur hexafluoride 3athorium 3atoxicity 3atracer techniques 3awater quality 3awells 3aUnited States 0aRadium 0aGroundwater age 0aCambrian-Ordovician aquifer system 0a226Ra distribution coefficient 0aAlpha recoil1 aSzabó, Zoltán,1 aJurgens, Bryant C.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2018 Feb., v. 89 p.34-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010900166300001400275500001500289520158800304592002801892650002901920650002501949650001601974650001301990650001802003650001102021650001502032650000702047650001602054650001502070650001702085650001202102650001302114650001502127653001502142653001902157653002202176653001102198653001002209700001802219700001502237700001602252773007802268856008602346852000902432655001202441IND60539365620221116165119.0160815e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053936562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanke, A.10aDoes anoxic processing of dissolved organic matter affect organic–mineral interactions in paddy soils?  ap. 62-66.  a2019-12-06  aAdsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil relates closely to hydrous Fe oxides, being one of the most important adsorbents. In paddy soils, reductive dissolution of hydrous Fe oxides may reduce the capacity of topsoils to retain organic matter. Dissolved organic matter produced and processed under anoxic conditions in the topsoils, thus, is leached into deeper soil horizons that still have considerable amounts of hydrous Fe oxides. Yet, the effect of the anoxic processing on adsorption of the leached DOM in oxic subsoil horizons is not known. We tested the adsorption of DOM from oxic and anoxic solution to minerals typical for paddy subsoils (goethite, ferrihydrite, ferruginous smectite). Adsorption of organic carbon (OC) to hydrous Fe oxides was up to five times larger for oxic than anoxic solutions. Ferruginous smectite adsorbed less OC than hydrous Fe oxides and differences between oxic and anoxic solutions were less pronounced than for the hydrous Fe oxides. Phosphate contained in the DOM test solution adsorbed strongly to the Fe oxide surfaces, while little to no phosphate was adsorbed by the smectite. Phosphate adsorption to hydrous Fe oxides was not affected by redox conditions. That finding is in line with the largely invariable equilibrium pH, suggesting no changes in number and reactivity of sorption sites at the hydrous oxides' surfaces. Also, we found no indications of reductive dissolution of minerals during the experiments. The reduction in DOM sorption, thus, seems to be due to compositional changes of DOM during anoxic processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved organic matter 3aanaerobic conditions 3airon oxides 3agoethite 3asoil horizons 3acarbon 3aadsorbents 3apH 3apaddy soils 3aphosphates 3aferrihydrite 3apaddies 3asmectite 3aadsorption 0aAdsorption 0aOrganic matter 0aHydrous Fe oxides 0aoxides 0aRedox1 aSauerwein, M.1 aKaiser, K.1 aKalbitz, K.0 tGeoderma.g2014 Sept., v. 228-229 p.62-66dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100003000169245008000199300001400279520110700293592002801400650002001428650002701448650001501475650001301490650001001503650001301513650001501526650001001541650002701551650001301578650001601591650001701607650003301624650001301657650001101670650002701681650005401708650001401762650003101776650002701807651001301834651002801847653002701875653003801902653002601940653002201966653001301988700002302001700002302024700002602047700001802073700002002091700001602111700001802127700001802145700002602163773011302189856008502302852000902387655001202396IND60099513520221120220310.0190412e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009951352DNAL7 a217121032pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2011.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWongprompitak, Patimaporn10aBroad-coverage molecular epidemiology of Orientia tsutsugamushi in Thailand  ap. 53-58.  aOrientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium closely related to the genus Rickettsia, is the causative agent of scrub typhus, a major cause of febrile illness in rural areas of Asia–Pacific region. Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of infected mites of the genus Leptotrombidium. The region of the 56-kDa TSA gene spanning from variable domain I (VDI) to variable domain IV (VDIV) was sequenced and used for genotyping 77 O. tsutsugamushi samples from human patients confirmed with scrub typhus from 2001 to 2003 and 2009 to 2010 in different regions of Thailand. These sequences were also compared to previously published 56-kDa TSA sequences. Only 4 genotypes out of 8 previously reported in Thailand were identified, i.e. Karp, JG-v, TA763 and Kato, respectively. Two strains were not associated with known genotypes but were closely related to Taiwanese strains. The Karp genotype was confirmed as the predominant clade. The JG-v and TA763 genotypes, in contrast to other studies, also were found. The genotype TA716 was not found, except for one strain previously described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptotrombidium 3aOrientia tsutsugamushi 3aRickettsia 3abacteria 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amites 3amolecular epidemiology 3apatients 3arural areas 3ascrub typhus 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aOrientia tsutsugamushixclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aScrub Typhusxepidemiology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aThailand 0aThailandxepidemiology. 0aOrientia tsutsugamushi 0a56-kDa type specific antigen gene 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aGenetic diversity 0aThailand1 aAnukool, Wichittra1 aWongsawat, Ekkarat1 aSilpasakorn, Saowalak1 aDuong, Veasna1 aBuchy, Philippe1 aMorand, S.,1 aFrutos, Roger1 aEkpo, Pattama1 aSuputtamongkol, Yupin0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2013 Apr., v. 15 p.53-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010000170520143600270592002801706650002701734650002301761650002701784650002501811650002801836650001901864650001101883650002801894650001401922650002501936653001901961653003501980653001402015653002302029700001502052700001202067700001902079700001702098773011902115856008802234852000902322655001202331IND60688333120221118061219.0200824e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068833312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1384772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Shixiang10aClassification of pathogens by Raman spectroscopy combined with generative adversarial networks  aRapid identification of marine pathogens is very important in marine ecology. Artificial intelligence combined with Raman spectroscopy is a promising choice for identifying marine pathogens due to its rapidity and efficiency. However, considering the cost of sample collection and the challenging nature of the experimental environment, only limited spectra are typically available to build a classification model, which hinders qualitative analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to classify marine pathogens by means of Raman spectroscopy combined with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Three marine strains, namely, Staphylococcus hominis, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Bacillus licheniformis, were cultured. Using Raman spectroscopy, we acquired 100 spectra of each strain, and we fitted them into GAN models for training. After 30,000 training iterations, the spectra generated by G were similar to the actual spectra, and D was used to test the accuracy of the spectra. Our results demonstrate that our method not only improves the accuracy of machine learning classification but also solves the problem of requiring a large amount of training data. Moreover, we have attempted to find potential identifying regions in the Raman spectra that can be used for reference in subsequent related work in this field. Therefore, this method has tremendous potential to be developed as a tool for pathogen identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus hominis 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aartificial intelligence 3amarine science 3amodels 3apathogen identification 3apathogens 3aqualitative analysis 0aClassification 0aGenerative adversarial network 0aPathogens 0aRaman spectroscopy1 aLi, Hanfei1 aLi, Xin1 aFu, Yu Vincent1 aLiu, Fanghua0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 15, v. 726 p.138477-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1384773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245017500174300001800349500001900367520220000386592002802586650002502614650001102639650002002650650001502670700001402685700002402699700005402723700002902777700002702806700002502833700002702858700002402885700003002909700006102939700006103000773012803061856008403189852000903273655001203282IND60697185420221120044446.0200602e20200508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069718542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c013972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollerbach, Adam L.10aUltra-High-Resolution Ion Mobility Separations Over Extended Path Lengths and Mobility Ranges Achieved using a Multilevel Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations Module  ap. 7972-7979.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOver the past few years, structures for lossless ion manipulations (SLIM) have used traveling waves (TWs) to move ions over long serpentine paths that can be further lengthened by routing the ions through multiple passages of the same path. Such SLIM “multipass” separations provide unprecedentedly high ion mobility resolving powers but are ultimately limited in their ion mobility range because of the range of mobilities spanned in a single pass; that is, higher mobility ions ultimately “overtake” and “lap” lower mobility ions that have experienced fewer passes, convoluting their arrival time distribution at the detector. To achieve ultrahigh resolution separations over broader mobility ranges, we have developed a new multilevel SLIM possessing multiple stacked serpentine paths. Ions are transferred between SLIM levels through apertures (or ion escalators) in the SLIM surfaces. The initial multilevel SLIM module incorporates four levels and three interlevel ion escalator passages, providing a total path length of 43.2 m. Using the full path length and helium buffer gas, high resolution separations were achieved for Agilent tuning mixture phosphazene ions over a broad mobility range (K₀ ≈ 3.0 to 1.2 cm²/(V*s)). High sensitivity was achieved using “in-SLIM” ion accumulation over an extended trapping region of the first SLIM level. High transmission efficiency of ions over a broad mobility range (e.g., K₀ ≈ 3.0 to 1.67 cm²/(V*s)) was achieved, with transmission efficiency rolling off for the lower mobility ions (e.g., K₀ ≈ 1.2 cm²/(V*s)). Resolving powers of up to ∼560 were achieved using all four ion levels to separate reverse peptides (SDGRG¹⁺ and GRGDS¹⁺). A complex mixture of phosphopeptides showed similar coverage could be achieved using one or all four SLIM levels, and doubly charged phosphosite isomers not significantly separated using one SLIM level were well resolved when four levels were used. The new multilevel SLIM technology thus enables wider mobility range ultrahigh-resolution ion mobility separations and expands on the ability of SLIM to obtain improved separations of complex mixtures with high sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ahelium 3aphosphopeptides 3aserpentine1 aLi, Ailin1 aPrabhakaran, Aneesh1 aNagy, Gabe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9007-44221 aHarrilal, Christopher P.1 aConant, Christopher R.1 aNorheim, Randolph V.1 aSchimelfenig, Colby E.1 aAnderson, Gordon A.1 aGarimella, Sandilya V.

This study aims to investigate the antioxidant potency and antibacterial activity of methanolic extracts of BAU Kul using Soxhlet extraction followed by complete evaporation of residual methanol. BAU Kul is a very good source of phenolics, flavonoids, ascorbic acid and tannins. The reducing sugar and protein content of BAU Kul were 1.68 and 0.81% by weight, respectively. BAU Kul was very active in 1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐ picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (527.28 ± 9.2 [μM Fe (II)]/100 g), thus confirming its high antioxidant potential. Antibacterial activities were measured using the agar well‐diffusion method. BAU Kul was most toxic to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed (in order) by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella paratyphi, Escherichia coli and Chromobacterium violaceum. In conclusion, BAU Kul is a nutritious fruit that provides good antioxidant and antibacterial activities (in particular toward P. aeruginosa) and a cheap source of vitamins. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: BAU Kul is a new and sweet seasonal fruit which is very popular to the consumers of Bangladesh. This fruit can be a good source of nutrients as well as the antioxidants applicable in different types of diseases caused by oxidative stresses. BAU Kul can also be used as traditional medicine for different types for infectious diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aZiziphus mauritiana 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acultivars 3aevaporation 3aflavonoids 3ainfectious diseases 3airon 3amethanol 3anutrients 3aplums 3aprotein content 3areducing sugars 3atannins 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3aBangladesh1 aAfroz, Rizwana1 aKarim, Nurul1 aAbdul Mottalib, Md.,1 aHossain, Md.

The examination of food combinations provides a scope to deal with the complexity and unpredictability of the diet and aims to overcome the limitations of the study of nutrients and foods in isolation. This article aims to demonstrate the usability of supervised data mining methods to extract the food groups related to BC. In order to derive key food groups associated with BC risk, we applied the data mining technique C5.0 with 10-fold cross-validation in the BLadder cancer Epidemiology and Nutritional Determinants study, including data from eighteen case–control and one nested case–cohort study, compromising 8320 BC cases out of 31 551 participants. Dietary data, on the eleven main food groups of the Eurocode 2 Core classification codebook, and relevant non-diet data (i.e. sex, age and smoking status) were available. Primarily, five key food groups were extracted; in order of importance, beverages (non-milk); grains and grain products; vegetables and vegetable products; fats, oils and their products; meats and meat products were associated with BC risk. Since these food groups are corresponded with previously proposed BC-related dietary factors, data mining seems to be a promising technique in the field of nutritional epidemiology and deserves further examination.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aepidemiology 3ameat 3arisk 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 3avegetables 0aBladder cancer 0aData mining 0aFood groups 0aEpidemiological studies1 aWesselius, Anke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4474-96651 aSinhart, Christoph1 aWolk, Alicja1 aStern, Mariana Carla1 aJiang, Xuejuan1 aTang, Li1 aMarshall, James1 aKellen, Eliane1 avan den Brandt, Piet1 aLu, Zhiming,1 aPohlabeln, Hermann1 aSteineck, Gunnar1 aAllam, Mohamed Farouk1 aKaragas, Margaret R.1 aLa Vecchia, Carlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1441-897X1 aPorru, Stefano1 aCarta, Angela1 aGolka, Klaus1 aJohnson, Kenneth C.1 aBenhamou, Simone1 aZhang, Zuo-Feng1 aBosetti, Cristina1 aTaylor, Jack A.1 aWeiderpass, Elisabete1 aGrant, Eric J.1 aWhite, Emily1 aPolesel, Jerry1 aZeegers, Maurice P.

Carbon dioxide at high flow rates (up to 4.0 mL/min) is delivered into gas chromatography (GC) open-tubular columns (OTC, 0.18 mm i.d., 20 m long, ∼0.2 μm stationary film thickness) to establish turbulent flow at Reynolds numbers (Re) as high as 9000. Postcolumn dispersion is eliminated by using a modified UV detector that takes measurements directly on column. Upon crossing the laminar-to-turbulent flow transition regime, a significant reduction in plate height is observed resulting in a nearly 3-fold increase in peak capacity from the laminar regime. This is explained by the massive reduction of the mass transfer resistance in the mobile phase due to a flatter flow profile and faster analyte dispersion across the open-tubular column (OTC) i.d.. Demonstrated in this work is a 9 s separation of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) over a 2.2 s separation window using a poly(dimethylsiloxane-co-methylphenylsiloxane) coated OTC. Additionally, three chiral compounds and three chiral cyclodextrin-incorporated OTCs were evaluated at high temperatures (90–120 °C) and CO₂ flow rates (3.3–3.7 mL/min) to demonstrate column stability and application of this method for rapid screening. Turbulent SFC provides a separation method for users desiring to achieve separation speeds above what is currently available with very high-pressure LC systems and do so without the resolution loss commonly observed at maximum allowable speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3agas chromatography 3amass transfer 3asupercritical fluid chromatography 3aturbulent flow1 aPeulon-Agasse, Valérie1 aCardinael, Pascal1 aFogwill, Michael O.1 aBesner, Sebastien1 aGritti, Fabrice G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1023-90500 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 May 07, v. 92, no. 11 p.7409-7412dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c015783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245010700181520153900288592002801827650001301855650001701868650001301885650001701898650001201915650001101927650002901938650001401967650001601981650001001997651002202007653002602029653002902055653004202084653001602126653002502142653002702167700002302194700002002217700002602237700001902263773011902282856008802401852000902489655001202498IND60688333320221118061216.0210519e20200710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068833332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1384802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Rincón, Jonás10aLaser-induced fluorescence logging as a high-resolution characterisation tool to assess LNAPL mobility  aHigh-resolution characterisation tools such as Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) logging represent a step forward towards a more effective management of sites contaminated by light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) petroleum hydrocarbons. In this paper, the applicability of LIF response as an indicator of LNAPL mobility at one site with an unconsolidated aquifer was investigated. LIF profiles were logged adjacent to twin coring locations and wells with LNAPL transmissivity (Tₙ) measurements in a heterogeneous gasoline contaminated site in Western Australia. LIF response was correlated to Tₙ to a greater extent than LNAPL saturation (Sₙ) measurements from coring. In particular, LIF signal maxima were a better indicator of Tₙ than the integral LIF signal. Furthermore, LIF allowed rapid identification of areas with long-term near-immobile LNAPL (entrapped and residual) because of the multi-wavelength waveforms associated with distinct subsurface characteristics. It was also demonstrated that the delineation of presumably less-mobile intervals could be enhanced by using the relative LIF response in the 350 nm wavelength channel. Thus, this work gave evidence that LIF logging provides valuable information about LNAPL distribution and mobility in commonly found subsurface settings, despite generally poor correlations with Sₙ measurements. LIF probes can be successfully used to guide the installation and application of more costly conventional methods in addition to the development of existing site models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3afluorescence 3agasoline 3ahydrocarbons 3alogging 3amodels 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3apetroleum 3awavelengths 3awells 3aWestern Australia 0aConceptual site model 0aEnvironmental geophysics 0aHigh-resolution site characterisation 0aLIF logging 0aLNAPL transmissivity 0aPetroleum hydrocarbons1 aGatsios, Evangelos1 aRayner, John L.1 aMcLaughlan, Robert G.1 aDavis, Greg B.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 10, v. 725 p.138480-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1384803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245013400176506010400310506007600414520107800490592002801568506003701596650002501633650001701658650001301675650002101688650001601709650001901725650002301744650002601767650001401793650001701807650001401824650001301838650001301851650002101864653001301885653002601898653001401924653001601938653001701954653001201971653002001983653000802003653000702011653000802018700002702026700003702053700002002090700002902110773010002139856008702239852000902326655001202335IND60788682020221207141013.0220929e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078868202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1339342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakubowska, Ewelina10aDevelopment and characterization of active packaging films based on chitosan, plasticizer, and quercetin for repassed oil storage  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNovel chitosan (Ch) films containing choline chloride and citric acid mixture as plasticizer (deep eutectic solvent, DES) and different amounts of quercetin (QUE) as antioxidant additive were prepared. Physicochemical and mechanical characteristics of the developed Ch/DES/QUE films were studied using FTIR, SEM, and AFM techniques. FTIR spectra revealed the possible interactions between all the components. The surface of the films was dense and rough. The addition of quercetin caused an increase in the tensile strength (TS) and Young's modulus, but significantly decreased the elongation at break. The films containing quercetin showed improved antioxidant activity in relation to Ch/DES film. Finally, the oxidation phenomena of rapeseed oils with and without chitosan films were evaluated as amounts of primary and secondary oxidation products and total oxidation index.

Reactions to terrorism (as with any other threat) involve emotional and cognitive components, and the degree to which they reciprocally interact is not well understood. Furthermore, much of the literature on the public response to terrorism is based on the construct of “risk perception,” whose precise definition and correlates are still ambiguous. This study aimed to more clearly disentangle the various emotional and cognitive facets that predict individuals’ response to the terrorism threat in the United States. We employed a longitudinal survey from a representative U.S. sample (n = 1057) and measured attitudinal and cognitive reactions to the threat of terrorism at both time points. An autoregressive latent variable model was used to assess the stability of such variables over time, as well as their reciprocal effects on one another. Participants’ emotional and cognitive reactions to the threat of terrorism evolved independently over time, contrary to the predictions of some prior risk perception literature. Furthermore, measurements of risk perception depended mostly on prior estimates of attack likelihood, emphasizing the importance of individuals’ assessments of hazard probability in the risk judgment process.  aPublisher supplied data  a1624296cNational Science Foundation (US) 3acognition 3aenvironment 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3arisk perception 3aterrorism1 aJohn, Richard S.1 aBurns, William1 aPortney, Kent E.1 aMumpower, Jeryl L.0 tEnvironment systems & decisions.g2021 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.227-235dSpringer USwJournal:12167x2194-54037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10669-020-09789-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017200160300001600332520149600348592002801844650002201872650002701894650003101921650001701952650002001969650001601989650001302005650001202018650001502030650002402045650001602069650002002085650001002105650004102115650001902156650003002175650001002205650001002215650001802225650004302243650000902286650001702295650002502312700002002337773011002357856007402467852000902541655001202550IND60132285920221120132408.0150505e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013228592DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.121152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeshk, Walaa A.10aImpact of Chicory‐Supplemented Diet on HMG‐CoA Reductase, Acetyl‐CoA Carboxylase, Visfatin and Anti‐Oxidant Status in Triton WR‐1339‐Induced Hyperlipidemia  ap. 164-172.  aHyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential role of chicory (Cichorium intybus Linn.) against hyperlipidemia and its subsequent effect in rats. Sixty male albino rats were randomly and equally divided into four groups. Hyperlipidemia was induced via intraperitoneal injection of Triton WR‐1339 at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight three times a week for 2 weeks. Chicory‐supplemented diet (10 g/100 g diet) was given for 4 weeks to group II and group IV. Chicory caused significant improvement in lipid profile and decreased the liver and heart acetyl‐CoA carboxylase activity, atherogenic indices, hepatic 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG‐CoA) reductase mRNA level and visfatin level. Meanwhile, significant increase in paraoxonase‐1, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was recorded. In conclusion, chicory has the potential role of being hypolipidemic, anti‐lipotoxic, anti‐oxidant and anti‐atherogenic factor. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Herbal treatments for hyperlipidemia are relatively cheap and locally available. The results showed that chicory (Cichorium intybus) has the potential of being hypolipidemic, anti‐oxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and decreased the atherogenic risk indices and anti‐steatotic. Thus, it may represent a new source of natural food supplement aimed at preventing dyslipidemic risk for atherosclerosis, cardiac and hepatic steatosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium intybus 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aatherosclerosis 3abody weight 3acatalase 3achicory 3acoenzyme A 3adietary supplements 3afatty liver 3agene expression 3aheart 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3ahyperlipidemia 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aliver 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3anicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase 3arats 3arisk factors 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aNoeman, Saad A.0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2015 Apr., v. 39, no. 2 p.164-172dFood & Nutrition Pressx0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.121153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001300172245007000185300001400255500002000269500001500289520015000304592002800454650001600482650000900498650001400507650001700521650002900538650001200567650006900579650002300648650001700671650000900688650001600697650000900713650006200722650002700784650002600811700001600837700001800853700001300871773013200884852000901016856009101025655001201116IND2163613820221121043448.0211130e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216361382DNAL7 a95138932pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.1998.tb03603.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayr, B.10aReciprocal translocation in a case of canine basal cell carcinoma  ap. 96-97.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aA case of basal cell carcinoma in a 10‐year‐old spaniel dog was analysed cytogenetically.

The measurement of electrical conductivity in saturated paste extracts (ECe) is the standard to which other salinity estimation methods are referenced. Since this method is laborious, the preparation of saturated pastes subject to bias, and salinity estimates by electrical conductivity (EC) subject to chemical artifact, numerous other methods have been proposed. These include EC measurements in diluted saturated paste extracts (ECed), direct measurement of EC in soil pastes (“Bureau of Soils Cup” method, ECcup), and EC based on electromagnetic induction (ECH25ECe). The main objective of this paper is to compare these four saturated paste-related methods of estimating salinity with respect to specific soil management goals. Comparison of the methods across six soil depths and three textural groups demonstrates that estimates of salinity are significantly influenced by the method, depth of sampling, and soil texture. Whereas ECe and ECcup estimates differed significantly from each other and from those of the other methods, ECH25ECe and ECed estimates were similar. In addition, high correlations between estimates of salinity by ECH25ECe and ECe indicate their similarity and suggest the suitability of the ECH25ECe method as a reference parameter for monitoring salinity. Thus, the suitability of the ECH25ECe method is drawn from its similarity to 1) the superior ECed method, which corrects for salinity underestimation due to ion pair formation, and 2) the ECe method, which is the standard method against which other salinity estimates are traditionally compared. This finding was consistent across all depths, the three texture groups, and the combinations of method and depth or texture groups. The high coefficient of variation in ECe and ECcup highlights the subjectivity of these methods and raises questions about the choice of ECe as standard for salinity estimates. These results therefore suggest that the ECH25ECe method (which requires few collocated but representative ECe measurements) be used to rapidly and reliably monitor salinity in calcareous soils of arid and semiarid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid soils 3acalcareous soils 3aelectrical conductivity 3airrigation 3amonitoring 3apastes 3asalinity 3asemiarid zones 3asoil depth 3asoil salinization 3asoil texture 3atexture 3aWestern United States 0aEC 0aECe 0aECed 0aECcup 0aECa 0aECH25ECe 0aElectrical conductivity 0aSaturated paste extract 0aBureau of Soils Cup 0aElectromagnetic induction 0aMethod comparison 0aRepeated measure ANOVA1 aJacobson, Astrid R.1 aCardon, Grant E.1 aHawks, Austin0 tGeoderma.g2014 May, v. 219-220 p.32-39dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04633naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002500181245016300206300001600369506007600385520188000461592002802341506003702369650000802406650002402414650000802438650002102446650002502467650002902492650002602521650001602547650002702563650001902590650001402609650002402623650002002647650002202667650001202689650002402701650001302725650004302738650002502781650001202806650008402818650009402902650002202996650004503018650003103063650003703094650004103131650002103172650001603193650005703209650007703266650003203343650002503375650007803400650002003478650003103498650004103529700001703570700002303587700002403610700002203634773013003656856008003786852000903866655001203875IND4488237020221207064743.0120320e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448823702DNAL7 a220645412pmid7 aPMC32560182pmcid7 a10.1128/AAC.00689-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakobongo, Morris O.14aThe Oligo-Acyl Lysyl Antimicrobial Peptide C12K-2β12 Exhibits a Dual Mechanism of Action and Demonstrates Strong In Vivo Efficacy against Helicobacter pylori  ap. 378-390.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHelicobacter pylori has developed antimicrobial resistance to virtually all current antibiotics. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop new anti-H. pylori therapies. We recently described a novel oligo-acyl-lysyl (OAK) antimicrobial peptidomimetic, C12K-2β12, that shows potent in vitro bactericidal activity against H. pylori. Herein, we define the mechanism of action and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of C12K-2β12 against H. pylori after experimental infection of Mongolian gerbils. We demonstrate using a 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (fluorescent probe) uptake assay and electron microscopy that C12K-2β12 rapidly permeabilizes the bacterial membrane and creates pores that cause bacterial cell lysis. Furthermore, using nucleic acid binding assays, Western blots, and confocal microscopy, we show that C12K-2β12 can cross the bacterial membranes into the cytoplasm and tightly bind to bacterial DNA, RNA, and proteins, a property that may result in inhibition of enzymatic activities and macromolecule synthesis. To define the in vivo efficacy of C12K-2β12, H. pylori-infected gerbils were orogastrically treated with increasing doses and concentrations of C12K-2β12 1 day or 1 week postinfection. The efficacy of C12K-2β12 was strongest in animals that received the largest number of doses at the highest concentration, indicating dose-dependent activity of the peptide (P < 0.001 by analysis of variance [ANOVA]) regardless of the timing of the treatment with C12K-2β12. Overall, our results demonstrate a dual mode of action of C12K-2β12 against the H. pylori membrane and cytoplasmic components. Moreover, and consistent with the previously reported in vitro efficacy, C12K-2β12 shows significant in vivo efficacy against H. pylori when used as monotherapy. Therefore, OAK peptides may be a valuable resource for therapeutic treatment of H. pylori infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aanalysis of variance 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acell membranes 3acytoplasm 3aelectron microscopy 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3agerbils 3amechanism of action 3aproteins 2a1-Naphthylaminexanalogs & derivatives 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexchemical synthesisxmetabolism. 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxadministration & dosagexchemical synthesisxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Membrane Permeabilityxdrug effects 2aDNA, Bacterialxmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aGerbillinae 2aHelicobacter Infectionsxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aHelicobacter pylorixdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aPeptidomimeticsxadministration & dosagexchemical synthesisxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aRNA, Bacterialxmetabolism 2aStomachxdrug effectsxmicrobiology.1 aGancz, Hanan1 aCarpenter, Beth M.1 aMcDaniel, Dennis P.1 aMerrell, D.

Conventional methods to analyze pesticide residues are not applied to resource-limited areas because of their high cost, complexity, and requirements for expensive instruments (such as GC/MS and LC/MS). To address these challenges, herein we fabricated colorimetric nanozyme sensor arrays based on heteroatom-doped graphene for detection of aromatic pesticides. The active sites of nanozymes could be differentially masked when different pesticides were adsorbed on the graphene, which in turn resulted in the decrease of their peroxidase-mimicking activities. On the basis of this principle, five pesticides (i.e., lactofen, fluoroxypyr-meptyl, bensulfuron-methyl, fomesafen, and diafenthiuron) from 5 to 500 μM were successfully discriminated by the sensor arrays. In addition, discrimination for different concentrations of each pesticide and different ratios of two mixed pesticides were also demonstrated. The practical application of the sensor arrays was further validated by successfully discriminating the pesticides in soil samples. This work not only provides a facile and cost-effective method to detect pesticides but also makes a positive contribution to food safety and environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abensulfuron-methyl 3acolorimetry 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental protection 3afomesafen 3afood safety 3agraphene 3ahuman health 3alactofen 3apest control 3aplant growth 3asoil1 aWu, Jiangjiexing1 aHan, Lijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6415-56561 aWang, Xiaoyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8641-24301 aLi, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3016-77281 aGuo, Hongchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-42831 aWei, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0870-71420 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 May 04, v. 92, no. 11 p.7444-7452dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b051103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245016200165300001400327520091900341592002801260650001401288650001601302650001401318650002101332650001501353650002401368650002601392650001401418651001701432653002401449653002401473653001401497700002201511700002301533773015101556856007901707852000901786655001201795IND60562058920221121062005.0170125e20161230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056205892DNAL7 a10.1515/trser-2015-00762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalchev, Roumen10aTrophic Relationships and Status of Reservoirs with and without Occurrence of Dreissena ssp.

Previous studies have shown that the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is associated with sarcopenia, a condition of reduced skeletal muscle mass. Here, we investigated the effect of preoperative sarcopenia on postoperative disease activity.This retrospective study included 56 patients with CD with medical records who met our inclusion criteria. Sarcopenia was diagnosed based on the psoas muscle mass index derived from computed tomography images, with predetermined cutoff values of <6.36 cm²/m² for men and <3.92 cm²/m² for women. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors associated with sarcopenia.Of the 56 participants, nine (16%) had sarcopenia. The rate of preoperative treatment with biological drugs was significantly lower in the sarcopenia group than the non-sarcopenia group. In addition, the operation time was significantly longer, and hemorrhage occurred more often, in the sarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenia group. Postoperatively, the CD activity index at 6 mo had significantly decreased in the non-sarcopenia group (P = 0.01) but not in the sarcopenia group (P = 0.20). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that a low total serum protein level was significantly associated with sarcopenia.Our results suggest that to maximize the effect of surgical treatment for CD, an appropriate nutritional intervention should be performed before surgery, or surgery should be postponed until after the patient recovers from sarcopenia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3ablood proteins 3acomputed tomography 3ahemorrhage 3anutrition 3anutritional intervention 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aprotein content 3aremission 3aretrospective studies 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 3asurgery 0aIBD 0aCrohn's disease 0aCDAI1 aSekido, Yuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4281-00471 aTakeda, Takashi1 aOgino, Takayuki1 aMiyoshi, Norikatsu1 aTakahashi, Hidekazu1 aUemura, Mamoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6285-56191 aDoki, Yuichiro1 aEguchi, Hidetoshi1 aMizushima, Tsunekazu0 tNutrition.g2022 Feb., v. 94 p.111526-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.1115263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011800169300001600287520107600303592002801379650002901407650001401436650001201450650001501462650002001477650001101497650001101508650001301519650001101532650001301543650002401556650002501580650001501605653001401620653002001634653002101654653001301675653003201688700001401720700002701734700002001761700002301781773008901804856008501893852000901978655001201987IND60607788520221119205126.0180830e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060778852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaolei10aUltrasonication aided biodiesel production from one-step and two-step transesterification of sludge derived lipid  ap. 401-408.  aTrichosporon oleaginosus was grown in wastewater sludge to produce lipid. The obtained biomass was employed to study ultrasonication effect on lipid extraction and in-situ transesterification.

Chloroform and methanol gave the best performance. However, due to the adverse environmental concern related to the utilization of chloroform, in-situ transesterification (single step lipid extraction and transesterification to obtain biodiesel) was investigated.In case of in-situ transesterification, biodiesel yield of 95% (w/w) was obtained in 60 min with the assistance of ultrasonication; whereas, 24 h was required to achieve similar yield without ultrasonication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichosporon oleaginosus 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3achloroform 3afuel production 3ahexane 3alipids 3amethanol 3asludge 3asolvents 3atransesterification 3aultrasonic treatment 3awastewater 0aBiodiesel 0aUltrasonication 0aLipid extraction 0aSolvents 0aIn-situ transesterification1 aYan, Song1 aTyagi, Rajeshwar Dayal1 aDrogui, Patrick1 aSurampalli, Rao Y.0 tEnergy.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 94 p.401-408dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013400163300001600297520131000313592002801623650001501651650001501666650001301681650001801694650002001712650001801732650001901750650001801769650001901787650002801806650002101834653001401855653000801869653001501877653003601892653003201928700001201960700001501972700001801987700001602005700001502021700001302036700001202049773009602061856008202157852000902239655001202248IND60553497820221120101051.0170502e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055349782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Dawei13aAn ultrasensitive label-free immunosensor based on CdS sensitized Fe–TiO2 with high visible-light photoelectrochemical activity  ap. 843-848.  aAn ultrasensitive label-free immunosensor was developed for the detection of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) based on CdS sensitized Fe–TiO2 nanocomposites with high visible-light photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity. In this protocol, ascorbic acid was used as an efficient electron donor for scavenging photogenerated holes. The Fe-doped TiO2 improved the absorption of TiO2 in the visible light region and promoted the photocurrent production distinctly. Especially, 0.1% Fe–TiO2 showed the highest photocurrent, which was 7.4 times that of pure TiO2. Carboxyl functionalized CdS nanoparticles (CdS NPs) were bonded onto Fe–TiO2 composite through interactions between carboxyl groups and TiO2, which further enhanced the PEC signal strength by approximately 2.9 fold compared with 0.1% Fe–TiO2. The specific binding between SCCA and antibody resulted in a decrease in photocurrent intensity and the intensity decreased linearly with the logarithm of SCCA concentration in the range of 0.001–75ngmL−1 with a detection limit of 0.22pgmL−1. The developed CdS enhanced Fe–TiO2 PEC immunosensor exhibited high sensitivity, good reproducibility, and low cost, which may have potential applications in clinical diagnosis of cancers, aptasensors, photocatalysis, and other related fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aascorbic acid 3adetection limit 3aimmunosensors 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atitanium dioxide 0aFe–TiO2 0aCdS 0aLabel-free 0aSquamous cell carcinoma antigen 0aPhotoelectrochemical sensor1 aWu, Dan1 aCui, Jiali1 aChen, Yucheng1 aMa, Hongmin1 aLiu, Yixin1 aWei, Qin1 aDu, Bin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 74 p.843-848dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245011300205500001900318520126600337592002801603650001801631650001101649650001001660650001501670650001801685650001101703650002301714650001401737650001901751650001001770653003001780653002801810653001001838653004301848653002701891700005301918700001801971700005401989700001702043700001602060700006202076700006102138773010702199856008102306852000902387655001202396IND60706936120221119124221.0200811e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070693612DNAL7 a10.1017/S0022149X200006192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortez A, M.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2071-941310aSeroepidemiological evidence for Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in three Venezuelan rural communities  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTaenia solium is the most common parasite infection of the brain, causing neurocysticercosis and typically found in rural communities with free-ranging pigs. Identification of transmission in rural areas is essential for its control. Risk factors and transmission of the parasite were evaluated in three rural Venezuelan communities (Valle del Rio and Potrero Largo, Cojedes state; and Palmarito, Portuguesa state) by a questionnaire (112 households) and coprological (492 samples) and serological (433 human and 230 porcine sera) analysis, respectively. Typical risk factors were found in all three communities: free-foraging pig husbandry, deficient sanitary conditions, high open defecation and ignorance of the parasite life cycle. Coprological examinations revealed a high level of soil-transmitted parasites. Importantly, two T. solium adult worm carriers were identified in each of the three communities. Anti-metacestode antibodies and the HP10 secreted metacestode glycoprotein were detected at significant levels in human and porcine sera in Valle del Rio, Potrero Largo and Palmarito. In conclusion, these communities may be considered to be endemic for taeniasis/cysticercosis, and the instigation of an appropriate control programme is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaenia solium 3aadults 3abrain 3adefecation 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aneurocysticercosis 3aparasites 3aquestionnaires 3aswine 0aAnti-metacestode antibody 0ataeniasis/cysticercosis 0aELISA 0aHP10 secreted metacestode glycoprotein 0aVenezuelan communities1 aRojas, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3256-47701 aAguilar, C.M.1 aFerrer, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4173-66421 aAlviarez, Y.1 aMéndez, C.1 aMedina-Freites, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7613-73271 aParkhouse, R.M.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5967-32910 tJournal of helminthology.g, v. 94 p.e179-dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X200006193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001600186245012200202300001300324506007600337520176800413592002802181506003702209650001602246650001602262650001102278650002202289650002002311650001602331650002302347650003102370650002202401650001602423650001202439650001702451650002402468650002402492650002002516700001902536700002302555700001902578700002002597700002302617700001602640773010502656856007902761852000902840655001202849IND60119555720221207115257.0141214e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011955572DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2006-7-8-r762doi7 aPMC17795932pmcid7 a169164432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibon, Yves10aIntegration of metabolite with transcript and enzyme activity profiling during diurnal cycles in Arabidopsis rosettes  ap. 1344.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Genome-wide transcript profiling and analyses of enzyme activities from central carbon and nitrogen metabolism show that transcript levels undergo marked and rapid changes during diurnal cycles and after transfer to darkness, whereas changes in activities are smaller and delayed. In the starchless pgm mutant, where sugars are depleted every night, there are accentuated diurnal changes in transcript levels. Enzyme activities in this mutant do not show larger diurnal changes; instead, they shift towards the levels found in the wild type after several days of darkness. This indicates that enzyme activities change slowly, integrating the changes in transcript levels over several diurnal cycles. RESULTS: To generalize this conclusion, 137 metabolites were profiled using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy. The amplitudes of the diurnal changes in metabolite levels in pgm were (with the exception of sugars) similar or smaller than in the wild type. The average levels shifted towards those found after several days of darkness in the wild type. Examples include increased levels of amino acids due to protein degradation, decreased levels of fatty acids, increased tocopherol and decreased myo-inositol. Many metabolite-transcript correlations were found and the proportion of transcripts correlated with sugars increased dramatically in the starchless mutant. CONCLUSION: Rapid diurnal changes in transcript levels are integrated over time to generate quasi-stable changes across large sectors of metabolism. This implies that correlations between metabolites and transcripts are due to regulation of gene expression by metabolites, rather than metabolites being changed as a consequence of a change in gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aamino acids 3acarbon 3adiurnal variation 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography 3agene expression regulation 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amutants 3amyo-inositol 3anitrogen metabolism 3aprotein degradation 3atranscriptomics1 aUsadel, Bjoern1 aBlaesing, Oliver E1 aKamlage, Beate1 aHoehne, Melanie1 aTrethewey, Richard1 aStitt, Mark0 tGenome biology.g2006 Aug., v. 7, no. 8 p.1344-1344dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-8-r763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010900173300001600282520159800298592002801896650001201924650000901936650002101945650001001966650001301976650001101989700002302000700002002023700001802043700001902061700001802080773009402098856008502192852000902277655001202286IND60084125820221119031133.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrchalová, Marie12aA model of gillnet catch in relation to the catchable biomass, saturation, soak time and sampling period  ap. 201-209.  aWe developed a new approach for evaluating gillnet catches. A model of a gillnet catch was built to differentiate the effects of gillnet saturation, fish activity and fish escapement from the gillnet catch. The corrected gillnet catch, termed the catchable biomass rate in the text, is the weight of fish that can be caught within an hour by an empty gillnet during a period of unitary fish activity. We also observed the effects of soak time (2, 5, 8, 11 and 13h) and sampling period (August vs. September) on the catch. Our results show that saturation and fish escapement from gillnets are important events occurring during each use, thus violating the assumption of a linear relationship between gillnet catch and fish density. The maximal capacity of a standardized benthic gillnet (45m² area, 12 mesh sizes that range from 5 to 55mm) was assessed to be 11kg, i.e., 245kg 1000m⁻² of gillnet. Sampling time had only a negligible effect on the gillnet catch. We recommend using the catchable biomass rate instead of uncorrected gillnet catches in interpretation of obtained data, especially when the catches are above 3kg per standardized gillnet (i.e., 67kg 1000m⁻²). We created a conversion table and a slide rule, from which the catchable biomass rates can be determined. We also developed a method for the conversion of catches based on different soak times. Our findings help to better understand the processes underlying gillnet catches and improve the interpretability and reliability of this method in comparing different gears used and assessing fish communities in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3afish 3afish communities 3agears 3agillnets 3amodels1 aMrkvička, Tomáš1 aPeterka, Jiří1 aČech, Martin1 aBerec, Luděk,1 aKubečka, Jan0 tFisheries research.g2011 Jan., v. 107, no. 1-3 p.201-209dElsevier B.V.x0165-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245003900163300001600202500001900218520063800237592002800875650001000903650002100913650001000934650000900944650001000953650002200963650001200985650001100997650000901008650001301017653001701030653002101047653001701068653002401085700001601109700001501125700001801140700001601158700002001174773012701194856008001321852000901401655001201410IND60729879920221123041817.0210303e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072987992DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI15654-202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Dingmeng10a‘Xiang He’ Flowering Crabapple  ap. 389-391.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCrabapples are ornamental apples that belong to genus Malus of the Rosaceae family (International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, 2003).

Conotoxin-Ac1 is linear peptide that contain 15 amino acids. In the present study, we synthesized and structurally and functionally characterized conotoxin-Ac1 as well as 19 variants. Electrophysiological results showed that conotoxin-Ac1 inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.22 &plusmn; 0.022 &mu;M. Further structure-activity studies of conotoxin-Ac demonstrated that polar amino acid residues were important for modulating its active, and the replacement of N1, O9, E10, and S12 by Ala resulted in a significant decrease in potency to NR2B. &deg;Furthermore, conotoxin-Ac1 and conotoxin-Ac1-O6P were tested in hot-plate and tail-flick assays to measure the potential analgesic activity to an acute thermal stimulus in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequently, the analgesic activity of conotoxin-Ac1 mutants was analyzed by the hot-plate method. The results show that N1, Y2, Y3, E10, N11, S12, and T15 play an important role in the analgesic activity of conotoxin-Ac1. N1 and S12 have significant effects on conotoxin-Ac1 in inhibiting NR2B and analgesic activity. In conclusion, we have discovered that conotoxin-Ac1 is an inhibitor of NMDAR and displays antinociceptive activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConus 3aamino acids 3aanalgesic effect 3aconotoxins 3adose response 3aelectrophysiology 3apeptides 3aChina1 aYao, Ge 1 aWang, Kang 1 aLiu, Yanli 1 aWan, Xiukun 1 aJiang, Hui 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 18, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180301353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245009200202300002000294506007600314520140300390592002801793506003701821650002101858650001701879650002001896650001301916650001101929700002401940700001801964700002001982773017602002856008302178852000902261655001202270IND4481617320221207053232.0120502e20111011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448161732DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11101111082doi7 aPMC31932182pmcid7 a219695672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Koushik12aA molecular mechanism of direction switching in the flagellar motor of Escherichia coli  ap. 17171-17176.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe direction of flagellar rotation is regulated by a rotor-mounted protein assembly, termed the "switch complex," formed from multiple copies of the proteins FliG, FliM, and FliN. The structures of major parts of these proteins are known, and the overall organization of proteins in the complex has been elucidated previously using a combination of protein-binding, mutational, and cross-linking approaches. In Escherichia coli, the switch from counterclockwise to clockwise rotation is triggered by the signaling protein phospho-CheY, which binds to the lower part of the switch complex and induces small movements of FliM and FliN subunits relative to each other. Direction switching also must produce movements in the upper part of the complex, particularly in the C-terminal domain of FliG (FliGC), which interacts with the stator to generate the torque for flagellar rotation. In the present study, protein movements in the middle and upper parts of the switch complex have been probed by means of targeted cross-linking and mutational analysis. Switching induces a tilting movement of the FliM domains that form the middle part of the switch and a consequent rotation of the affixed FliGC domains that reorients the stator interaction sites by about 90°. In a recently proposed hypothesis for the motor mechanism, such a reorientation of FliGC would reverse the direction of motor rotation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3acrosslinking 3aprotein binding 3aproteins 3atorque1 aBrunstetter, Duncan1 aTiten, Sienna1 aBlair, David F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Oct. 11, v. 108, no. 41 p.17171-17176dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11101111083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011600166300001400282520152800296592002801824650001901852650001801871650001501889650001701904650002901921650001001950650001101960650001701971650001901988651001002007653001702017653003502034653001602069700001502085700001802100700001402118700001902132700002002151700001902171700001902190700001702209700001902226700005602245773011902301856008202420852000902502655001202511IND60623003920221122183524.0190325e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062300392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2018.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xiangguang10aComparison of mixing layer height inversion algorithms using lidar and a pollution case study in Baoding, China  ap. 81-90.  aBeijing–Tianjin–Hebei area is suffering from atmospheric pollution from a long time. The understanding of the air pollution mechanism is of great importance for officials to design strategies for the environmental governance. Mixing layer height (MLH) is a key factor influencing the diffusion of air pollutants. It plays an important role on the evolution of heavy pollution events. Light detection and ranging (lidar), is an effective remote-sensing tool, which can retrieve high spatial and temporal evolution process within mixing layer (ML), especially the variation of MLH. There are many methods to retrieve MLH, but each method has its own applicable limitations. The Mie-lidar data in Beijing was firstly used to compare three different algorithms which are widely used under different pollution levels. We find that the multi-layer structure near surface may cause errors in the detection of mixing layer. The MLH retrieved based on image edge detection was better than another two methods especially under heavy polluted episode. Then we applied this method to investigate the evolution of the mixing layer height during a pollution episode in December 2016. MLH at Gucheng county showed the positive correlation with the concentration of particulate matters during the start of this pollution episode. The elevated pollution level in Gucheng was not associated with MLH's decrease, and the significantly increased particulate matters raised the boundary layer, which trapped the pollutants near the surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aenvironmental governance 3alidar 3amixing 3aparticulates 3aremote sensing 3aChina 0aMixing layer 0aBeijing–Tianjin–Hebei area 0aSevere haze1 aLiu, Cheng1 aXie, Zhouqing1 aHu, Qihou1 aDong, Yunsheng1 aFan, Guangqiang1 aZhang, Tianshu1 aXing, Chengzhi1 aWang, Zhuang1 aJaved, Zeeshan1 aLiu, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7051-42720 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 May, v. 79 p.81-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2018.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245017200160300001400332500001900346520151500365592002801880650001901908650002801927650001701955650001601972650002401988650001302012650002402025650002402049650002002073650001702093650001102110650001902121650001902140650002902159653002902188653002002217653000902237700001402246700001502260700002002275700001902295700001802314773017602332856007802508852000902586655001202595IND60729880120221122232327.0210303e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072988012DNAL7 a10.21273/JASHS04933-202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qiannan10aStrigolactone and Ethylene Inhibitor Suppressing Dark-induced Leaf Senescence in Perennial Ryegrass Involving Transcriptional Downregulation of Chlorophyll Degradation  ap. 79-86.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAccelerated or premature leaf senescence induced by dark conditions could be associated with chlorophyll degradation and regulated by hormones. To study the effects of strigolactone (SL) on dark-induced leaf senescence and to examine the interaction effects of SL and ethylene on regulating dark-induced leaf senescence, plants of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) exposed to darkness for 8 days were treated with a synthetic SL analogue (GR24), aminoethoxyvinyl glycine [AVG (an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor)], or SL and AVG by foliar spray. Chlorophyll content, photochemical efficiency, electrolyte leakage, and ethylene production were measured. Expressions of genes associated with leaf senescence, SL biosynthesis and signaling, ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, and chlorophyll biosynthesis and degradation were determined. Foliar application of GR24 promoted leaf senescence in perennial ryegrass grown in darkness, and the intensity of action increased with the GR24 concentration. SL-accelerated leaf senescence was associated with the downregulation of four chlorophyll biosynthesis-associated genes and upregulation of four chlorophyll degradation-associated genes. AVG had functions counteractive to SL, suppressing dark-induced leaf senescence by downregulating chlorophyll degradation genes and SL synthesis genes. Our results suggested that SL and ethylene interactively regulated leaf senescence, mainly by controlling chlorophyll degradation induced by darkness in perennial ryegrass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aaminoethoxyvinylglycine 3abiosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3aelectrolyte leakage 3aethylene 3aethylene inhibitors 3aethylene production 3afoliar spraying 3ahorticulture 3aleaves 3aphotochemistry 3astrigolactones 3atranscription (genetics) 0aaminoethoxyvinyl glycine 0agene expression 0aGR241 aDing, Fei1 aLi, Mingna1 aZhang, Xiaxiang1 aZhang, Shuoxin1 aHuang, Bingru0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2021 Mar., v. 146, no. 2 p.79-86dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x2327-97887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS04933-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010900170300001400279520175600293592002802049650001202077650001302089650001102102650002602113650001302139700003002152773009202182856008502274852000902359655001202368IND60084126020221119031016.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCope, Jason M.10aReconciling stock assessment and management scales under conditions of spatially varying catch histories  ap. 22-38.  aSpatial homogeneity is the exception, not the rule, for many marine populations. Data limitations or biological knowledge gaps, though, often drive the assumption of limited stock structuring; the subsequent mismatch of model spatial scale and biological stock structure may compromise management goals. Spatial considerations thus remain a major challenge in providing managers with the best information for responsible and responsive management. This study uses simulation testing to offer a quantitative evaluation of spatial stock structure assumptions on the performance of stock assessments relative to management scales. Catch histories, not biological differences, are used to create stock structure. Simulation testing is based on an operating model of ‘true’ population states of nature that vary only in catch history across 9 regions. Stock assessments under various data scenarios are then performed on regions either as one aggregated assessment, or at finer area scales defined by zonal catch differences. The median absolute relative error of the terminal spawning biomass depletion is used as a performance statistic. One area stock assessments demonstrated low bias and high precision under all catch scenarios when stock structure is ignored, but perform poorly when applied to areas with differing regional catch histories. Separate area assessments grouped by zonal catch differences performed best under these circumstances, despite lower data quality, indicating the importance of identifying stock structure for management purposes. We suggest a focus on explicitly defining management units prior to conducting stock assessments with a concomitant resolve to increase data provisions at the resolution of management needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3amanagers 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3aspawning1 aPunt, A.

Reducing the sophistication liability of luxury brands  ap. 1366-1376.  aPast research suggests that consumers may negatively evaluate luxury brands that engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) because they do not perceive a consistency between luxury and ethical consumption (sophistication liability). As luxury is an increasingly relevant industry, it is important to understand how to promote ethical luxury consumption and cleaner production practices in luxury. This article extends previous findings and provides a framework that shows the conditions under which luxury and ethical consumption can be compatible. In particular, we find that consumers perceive sophisticated brands as less ethical than sincere brands when their social identity goals are salient (i.e., they focus on their social relationships); however, when consumers personal identity goals are salient (i.e., they focus on themselves), they perceive sophisticated brands as equally ethical as sincere brands. Finally, we also show that luxury brands' CSR actions should focus on the firms' own consumers whereas sincere brands’ CSR actions should focus on society in general. This research contributes to the literature on sustainability by demonstrating when and how sophisticated brands can engage in socially responsible practices like CSR and cleaner production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorporate social responsibility 3aethics 3aindustry 3asocial identification 3asociety 0acorporate social responsibility 0aBrand ethicality 0aBrand personality 0aLuxury brands 0aConsumer identity goals1 aHerter, Márcia Maurer1 aGonçalves, Dilney1 aSayin, Eda0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.1366-1376dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010700169300001400276520146700290592002801757650002301785650001501808650001001823650001401833650001701847650001701864650002701881650001501908650002001923650001601943650002601959650000901985650001701994651001002011651001302021651001202034653003102046653002702077653001902104653001502123653001602138700001902154700005502173700001702228700001402245700001502259773009602274856008502370852000902455655001202464IND60541552220221119234112.0190318e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054155222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2013.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaolei10aField evolution of insecticide resistance in the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) in China  ap. 61-66.  aThe brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is one of the most destructive pests of rice crops in Asian countries including China, Vietnam, Thailand, etc. Evolution of resistance in this pest insect to isoprocarb, buprofezin, pymetrozine, imidacloprid and other neonicotinoid insecticides has been reported. In order to investigate the current status of resistance to commonly used insecticides, nine field populations of N. lugens were collected from Central China, East China and South China, and resistance to insecticides was monitored from 2009 to 2012. All the 9 field populations collected in 2012 had developed extremely high resistance to imidacloprid, with resistance ratios (RR) ranging from 209.3 to 616.6. Resistance to imidacloprid was much higher in 2012 than in 2009. The RR of thiamethoxam varied from 17.4 to 47.1, and the RR of nitenpyram varied from 1.4 to 3.7 in 2012. Of the 9 field populations, six populations showed higher resistance to nitenpyram in 2012 than in 2011. RR for buprofezin varied from 110.1 to 221.6 in 2012 whereas resistance was at a medium level (RR 20.4 ∼ 39.4-fold) in 2009. RR for pymetrozine ranged from 34.9 to 46.8 in 2012. As for isoprocarb, RR ranged from 21.7 to 38.1 in 2012. The obvious increase in resistance to widely applied insecticides indicates that insecticide resistance management strategies are urgently needed to prevent or delay further increase of insecticide resistance in N. lugens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNilaparvata lugens 3abuprofezin 3acrops 3aevolution 3aimidacloprid 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3anitenpyram 3apest resistance 3apymetrozine 3aresistance management 3arice 3athiamethoxam 3aChina 3aThailand 3aVietnam 0aNilaparvata lugens (Stål) 0aInsecticide resistance 0aNeonicotinoids 0aBuprofezin 0aPymetrozine1 aLiu, Xiangyang1 aZhu, Fuxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3759-79581 aLi, Jianhong1 aYou, Hong1 aLü, Peng,0 tCrop protection.g2014 Apr., v. 58 p.61-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011900155300001800274520178700292592002802079650000802107650001502115650001202130650001502142650001602157650002002173650001002193650001802203650001302221650001502234650002602249700001202275700001602287700001902303700001702322700001402339700001602353700001702369700001102386773011202397856007502509852000902584655001202593IND60529099220221120144418.0160717e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052909922DNAL7 a10.1021/ac300616z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Yanqin10aDNAzyme-Based Rolling-Circle Amplification DNA Machine for Ultrasensitive Analysis of MicroRNA in Drosophila Larva  ap. 7664-7669.  aWe present a highly sensitive colorimetric method for microRNA (miRNA) detection. This method is based on a rolling-circle amplification (RCA) DNA machine, which integrates RCA, nicking enzyme signal amplification and DNAzyme signal amplification. The DNA machine is triggered by the hybridization of target miRNA with a rational designed padlock DNA template and activated by RCA. The resulting RCA product then autonomously replicates a multiple machinery cutter cycle and generates accumulated amount of products. Specifically, the DNA product in the present work is designed as a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mimicking DNAzyme, which could that catalyze a colorimetric reaction and generate colored product. Through these cascade amplifications, microRNA (miRNA) as low as 2 aM could be detected. As an example of in vivo application, miRNA from single Drosophila larva was successfully analyzed. Drosophila is a model organism that provides a powerful genetic tool to study gene functions. Study of Drosophila miRNAs has brought us knowledge of its biogenesis and biological functions. The analysis of miRNA typically requires a pretreatment process of extracting total RNAs from target cells, followed by quantitative analysis of target miRNA in total RNA samples, which nevertheless suffers from laborious total RNA extraction and time-consuming processes and poor limit of detection. Meanwhile, the tiny size of Drosophila makes it difficult to accurately measure trivial changes of its cellular miRNA levels. The ability to detect ultralow concentration of miRNA of the proposed method enables the analysis the expression of mir-1 in single Drosophila larva. We thus expect that the strategy may open new avenues for in situ miRNA analysis in single cell or living animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3aanimals 3abiogenesis 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3agenes 3ahybridization 3amicroRNA 3aperoxidase 3aquantitative analysis1 aXu, Yan1 aMao, Xiuhai1 aWei, Yingliang1 aSong, Haiyun1 aChen, Nan1 aHuang, Qing1 aFan, Chunhai1 aLi, Di0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 84, no. 18 p.7664-7669dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac300616z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008200169300001600251520157800267592002801845650001601873650002501889650001201914650000901926650002101935650001201956650002101968650001301989650001102002650000702013650001402020650001502034650002002049651001102069700002102080700002102101773009102122856008102213852000902294655001202303IND60573596420221123032623.0170724e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057359642DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617160600352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondarenko, S.

In the present work, the fungi isolated from these soils and capable of growth at high pH are analyzed. The fungi were isolated from acidic sod-podzol and neutral cultivated soils by plating on alkaline agar (pH 10.0–10.5). Their identification was carried out using morphological, cultural, and molecular genetic criteria. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and the rates of linear growth within a broad pH range (4.0–10.4) were determined. The isolates represented a polyphyletic group of ascomycetes (Sordariomycetes), which included members of Plectosphaerellaceae (5 species) and various families of Hypocreales (4 species). The most common species were Gibellulopsis nigrescens, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus, Chordomyces antarcticum, and Plectosphaerella spp. Investigation of fungal growth at different pH values revealed all isolates to be alkalitolerant, with no alkaliphilic fungi isolated from acidic sod-podzol and neutral cultivated soils. Although the group of isolates was polyphyletic and its members originated from different ecological and trophic niches, most alkalitolerant isolates exhibited common morphological traits with acremonium- and verticillium-like conidial spore formation, abundant slime formation, and a tendency for aggregation of their mycelium in bundles. Our research confirmed the presence of fungi with alkalitolerant adaptation to external pH in the sod-podzolic and cultivated soils of the Moscow region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypocreales 3aPlectosphaerellaceae 3aPodzols 3aagar 3aalkali tolerance 3aconidia 3amicrobial growth 3amycelium 3aniches 3apH 3apolyphyly 3asoil fungi 3atemperate zones 3aRussia1 aGeorgieva, M.

The stocks most severely impacted centre on those characterised by high economic value, such as abalone, as well as long lived and slow growing species such as Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Effective management of these stocks as well as assessment of the impacts of IUU fishing on the resources is impeded by the technical difficulties associated with determining the magnitude of the IUU catches. The South African abalone Haliotis midae fishery rates as an extreme example of extraordinarily high levels of illegal and unreported (IU) catch. To assess the level and trends in IU catches, we used a combination of approaches that included collation of confiscation records from law enforcement, development of a novel index (the confiscations per unit policing effort—CPUPE), estimation of illegal catches using a spatial and age-structured assessment model, and cross-checking of model outputs through comparison with trade data on abalone imports in destination countries. The model-predicted 2008 IU estimate was 860tonnes, more than 10 times the total allowable catch (TAC) for that year, and implied that, on average, 14% of all IU catches are confiscated. Associated management responses included the listing of H. midae on Appendix III of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), and a temporary closure of the commercial fishery. We summarise both technical and management lessons to be learnt from this integrated approach to assess and verify the magnitude of IU fishing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species 3aDissostichus eleginoides 3aHaliotis 3aabalone 3aeconomic valuation 3afauna 3afisheries 3aflora 3aimports 3alaw enforcement 3amodels1 aButterworth, Doug1 aBürgener, Markus,0 tFisheries research.g2011 Jan., v. 107, no. 1-3 p.221-232dElsevier B.V.x0165-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014300175300001600318520181000334592002802144650001802172650001302190650002202203650001502225650002502240650001702265650001302282650001902295650001002314650001902324650001402343650001002357650001502367650002002382650001502402653002202417653001902439653001002458653002602468653002402494700002302518700002302541700002202564700002002586700002402606700001902630700002102649700002002670700001802690700001602708773011302724856008602837852000902923655001202932IND60646716920221122034610.0200405e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064671692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnglezos, Vasileios10aMinimizing the environmental impact of cleaning in winemaking industry by using ozone for cleaning-in-place (CIP) of wine bottling machine  ap. 582-589.  aIn winemaking industry, good cleaning and sanitization practices are essential in bottle filling process to preserve quality and avoid subsequent alterations after bottling, when microbes find environment favourable for their development. Devices connected by pipelines, like wine bottling machines, are usually cleaned using Cleaning-in-Place (CIP) method, generally requiring a high consumption of water and the use of chemical cleaning detergents with a negative impact on the environment. Ozone has recently attracted attention due to its efficacy against a broad spectrum of microorganisms and its ability to clean leaving no residues on treated surfaces, protecting the environment and human health. This study aimed to investigate the impact of aqueous (3.5 mg/L for 15 and 30 min of contact time) and gaseous ozone (30 μL/L for 30 and 60 min of contact time) treatments in comparison with usual sanitizing treatment with peracetic acid (1% for 15 min of contact time) on six wine related microorganisms of oenological significance for their potential proliferation in the bottled wine. To this end, an artificially contaminated wine was used to fill rigid and flexible stainless-steel pipes and a bottling machine. The effectiveness of each treatment was evaluated using culture-dependent approach. The microorganisms showed different sensibilities to the treatments, dependent on the sanitization method used. The exposure to aqueous ozone for 30 min was the most effective treatment for pipes cleaning, followed by peracetic acid. On the other hand, when considering the bottling machine, the use of peracetic acid as sanitizing agent led to a complete removal of the cells, while aqueous ozone for a contact of 30 min was able to eliminate all microorganisms except S. cerevisiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottled wines 3abottling 3acleaning in place 3adetergents 3aenvironmental impact 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3amicroorganisms 3aozone 3aperacetic acid 3apipelines 3apipes 3asanitizing 3astainless steel 3awinemaking 0aCleaning-in-place 0aPeracetic acid 0aOzone 0aInnovative sanitizing 0aWine microorganisms1 aRantsiou, Kalliopi1 aCravero, Francesco1 aTorchio, Fabrizio1 aGiacosa, Simone1 aRío Segade, Susana1 aGai, Guglielmo1 aDogliani, Enrico1 aGerbi, Vincenzo1 aCocolin, Luca1 aRolle, Luca0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.582-589dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014700171300001600318520148700334592002801821650001901849650001701868650002901885650003001914650001501944650002601959650001401985650002701999650002302026650001102049650001502060650001602075650001802091650001402109650001302123651002702136700001902163773009402182856008502276852000902361655001202370IND60084126220221119031029.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClelland, G.,10aUse of parasites as tags in delineating stocks of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) from the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Cape Breton Shelf  ap. 233-238.  aParasites were inventoried on and in 470 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) collected from the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, NAFO (North Atlantic Fisheries Organization) division 4T, and Cape Breton Shelf (NAFO subdivision 4Vn) in September of 2004 and 2005, and August 2006, respectively. Forward stepwise discriminant function analysis (DFA) of the 4T samples indicated that the nematodes, Hysterothylacium aduncum, and Pseudoterranova decipiens and the acanthocephalans Echinorhynchus gadi and Corynosoma strumosum were significant in the classification of cod to eastern or western 4T. Cross-validation yielded a classification efficiency of 74% overall, thereby supporting the findings of earlier mark-recapture studies which have indicated that 4T cod are comprised of discrete eastern and western spawning groups. Further analyses indicated that western 4T cod was distinct not only from eastern 4T cod, but also differed from cod from the Smokey Channel and Cape Breton Shelf slopewaters (4Vn), with rates of misclassification ranging from 6% to 9%. Hence, “parasite tags” may prove useful for monitoring the exploitation of cod from western 4T during their annual migration through the Cabot Strait and while over-wintering along the edge of the Cape Breton Shelf where mixing with eastern 4T and 4Vn cod may occur. Similar results could be achieved with migrant cod from eastern 4T through analyses of parasite markers together with host meristic or morphometric parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aGadus morhua 3aHysterothylacium aduncum 3aPseudoterranova decipiens 3acod (fish) 3adiscriminant analysis 3afisheries 3amark-recapture studies 3amigratory behavior 3amixing 3amonitoring 3amorphometry 3aoverwintering 3aparasites 3aspawning 3aGulf of Saint Lawrence1 aMelendy, Jason0 tFisheries research.g2011 Jan., v. 107, no. 1-3 p.233-238dElsevier B.V.x0165-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011200164300001600276520167100292592002801963650000801991650001801999650001202017650001202029650002302041650001402064650002302078650001502101650001202116650002202128650001602150650001302166650001002179650001102189650001502200650002502215650001002240650001302250650001602263650001502279650003102294650001902325651001002344653003102354653002502385653003402410653002202444700001902466700002102485700001702506700001202523700001802535700001302553700001602566700001502582700005402597700001502651773012102666856008202787852000902869655001202878IND60623004020221122221012.0190325e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062300402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2018.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhuobiao14aThe levels, sources and reactivity of volatile organic compounds in a typical urban area of Northeast China  ap. 121-134.  aAir concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were continually measured at a monitoring site in Shenyang from 20 August to 16 September 2017. The average concentrations of alkanes, alkenes, aromatics and carbonyls were 28.54, 6.30, 5.59 and 9.78 ppbv, respectively. Seven sources were identified by the Positive Matrix Factorization model based on the measurement data of VOCs and CO. Vehicle exhaust contributed the most (36.15%) to the total propene-equivalent concentration of the measured VOCs, followed by combustion emission (16.92%), vegetation emission and secondary formation (14.33%), solvent usage (10.59%), petrochemical industry emission (9.89%), petrol evaporation (6.28%), and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) usage (5.84%). Vehicle exhaust, solvent usage and combustion emission were found to be the top three VOC sources for O3 formation potential, accounting for 34.52%, 16.55% and 11.94%, respectively. The diurnal variation of the total VOCs from each source could be well explained by their emission characteristics, e.g., the two peaks of VOC concentrations from LPG usage were in line with the cooking times for breakfast and lunch. Wind rose plots of the VOCs from each source could reveal the possible distribution of the sources around the monitoring site. The O3 pollution episodes during the measurement period were found to be coincident with the elevation of VOCs, which was mainly due to the air parcel from the southeast direction where petrochemical industry emission was found to be dominant, suggesting that the petrochemical industry emission from the southeast was probably a significant cause of O3 pollution in Shenyang.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3aaromatic compounds 3abreakfast 3acarbonyl compounds 3acombustion 3acooking 3adiurnal variation 3aevaporation 3agasoline 3alunch 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoil and gas industry 3aozone 3asolvents 3aurban areas 3avegetation 3avolatile organic compounds 3awind direction 3aChina 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aSource apportionment 0aPhotochemical ozone formation 0aField measurement1 aLiu, Chengtang1 aZhang, Chenglong1 aLiu, Pengfei1 aYe, Can1 aXue, Chaoyang1 aZhao, Di1 aSun, Jichen1 aDu, Yiming1 aChai, Fahe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8796-232X1 aMu, Yujing0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 May, v. 79 p.121-134dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2018.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01545naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245004200159300002000201520066600221592002800887650001100915650002100926650001300947650001800960650001400978700002400992700002001016773012401036856007401160852000901234655001201243IND60655629720221118001811.0190803e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065562972DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra03890f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItoi, Hiroyuki10aConstraint spaces in carbon materials  ap. 22823-22840.  aNano-sized pores in carbon materials are recently known to give certain constraints to the encapsulated materials by keeping them inside, accompanied with some changes in their structure, morphology, stability, etc. Consequently, nano-sized pores endow the constrained materials with improved performances in comparison with those prepared by conventional processes. These pores may be called “constraint spaces” in carbon materials.

The target steady state concentration of propofol in blood is 0.25–10 μg/mL (1–60 μM). Although propofol can be oxidized electrochemically, monitoring its concentration in biological matrixes is very challenging due to (i) low therapeutic concentration, (ii) high concentrations of easily oxidizable interfering compounds in the sample, and (iii) fouling of the working electrode. In this work we report the performance characteristics of an organic film coated glassy carbon (GC) electrode for continuous monitoring of propofol. The organic film (a plasticized PVC membrane) improved the detection limit and the selectivity of the voltammetric sensor due to the large difference in hydrophobicity between the analyte (propofol) and interfering compounds of the sample, e.g., ascorbic acid (AA) or p-acetamidophenol (APAP). Furthermore, the membrane coating prevented electrode fouling and served as a protective barrier against electrode passivation by proteins. Studies revealed that sensitivity and selectivity of the voltammetric method is greatly influenced by the composition of the PVC membrane. The detection limit of the membrane-coated sensor for propofol in PBS is reported as 0.03 ± 0.01 μM. In serum-like electrolyte solutions containing physiologically relevant levels of albumin (5%) and 3 mM AA and 1 mM APAP as interfering agents, the detection limit was 0.5 ± 0.4 μM. Both values are below the target concentrations used clinically during anesthesia or sedation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aalbumins 3aanesthesia 3aanesthetics 3aascorbic acid 3ablood 3acarbon 3acoatings 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3afouling 3ahydrophobicity 3aintravenous injection 3amonitoring 3asedation1 aGaray, Fernando1 aGuo, Jidong1 aChaum, Edward1 aLindner, Ernő,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 84, no. 18 p.7670-7676dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac30068783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013600162300001600298520139100314592002801705650002301733650002201756650001201778650002001790650003101810650001601841650001701857650000701874650002201881650001701903653001701920653003101937653002301968653001701991700001502008700001802023773009202041856008102133852000902214655001202223IND60085824920221120195930.0160901e20130312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008582492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGui, Rijun13aAn improved method for ratiometric fluorescence detection of pH and Cd2+ using fluorescein isothiocyanate–quantum dots conjugates  ap. 134-140.  aIn this study, thioglycolic acid capped-CdTe quantum dots (QDs) were modified by polyethylenimine (PEI), and then combined with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to fabricate FITC–CdTe conjugates. The self-assembly of FITC, CdTe and PEI was ascribed to electrostatic interactions in aqueous solution. The resulting conjugates were developed toward two routes. In route one, ratiometric photoluminescence (PL) intensity of conjugates (IFITC/IQDs) was almost linear toward pH from 5.3 to 8.7, and a ratiometric PL sensor of pH was favorable obtained. In route two, firstly added S2− induced remarkable quenching of QDs PL peak (at the “OFF” state), which was restored due to following addition of Cd2+ (at the “ON” state). In the conjugates, successive introduction of S2− and Cd2+ hardly influenced on FITC PL peaks. According to this PL “OFF-ON” mode, a ratiometric PL method for the detection of Cd2+ was achieved. Experimental results confirmed that the IFITC/IQDs exhibited near linear proportion toward Cd2+ concentration in the range from 0.1 to 15μM, and the limit of detection was 12nM. Interferential experiments adequately testified that the proposed sensors of pH and Cd2+ were practicable in real samples and complex systems. In comparison with conventional analytical techniques, the ratiometric PL method was simple, rapid, economic and highly selective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3adetection limit 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3apH 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum dots 0aQuantum dots 0aFluorescein isothiocyanate 0aRatiometric sensor 0aFluorescence1 aAn, Xueqin1 aHuang, Wenxue0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Mar. 12, v. 767 p.134-140dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006700156300002000223520105700243592002801300650002201328650001501350650001301365650002101378650001701399650001301416650003301429650001701462650001601479650003701495700001201532700001801544700001401562700001501576700001701591700001701608773012401625856007401749852000901823655001201832IND60655629820221118001630.0190803e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065562982DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra03893k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Wangwei10aTop-down synthesis of sponge-like Mn₃O₄ at low temperature  ap. 22772-22778.  aA top-down synthetic method was developed for the fabrication of sponge-like Mn₃O₄ composed of Mn₃O₄ nanocrystals by decomposition of manganese formate at 200 °C. The samples were characterized in terms of their structural and morphological properties by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) studies. TEM and SEM images showed that the morphology of sponge-like Mn₃O₄ structures was mostly retained from the morphology of the manganese formate precursor, which was controlled by the solvothermal process. Large sponge-like Mn₃O₄ structures exhibiting crystallographic symmetry were prepared under solvothermal treatment for a long time. The XRD pattern showed that the Mn₃O₄ exhibit a tetragonal hausmannite structure. The results of N₂ adsorption analysis indicated that the sponge-like Mn₃O₄ nanostructures possess high surface area. The possible formation mechanism of Mn₃O₄ nanostructures has been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aformates 3amanganese oxides 3ananocrystals 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHe, Kay1 aZhao, Gaoling1 aSong, Bin1 aZhou, Jing1 aDong, Weixia1 aHan, Gaorong0 tRSC advances.g2019 July 23, v. 9, no. 40 p.22772-22778dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra03893k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245017700172300001600349520114300365592002801508650001901536650002201555650001901577650001201596650001201608650002001620650001801640650001301658650001501671650001501686650002501701650002201726650000901748650000901757650001401766650002901780650001901809650000701828650001401835650001501849650000901864650001101873650001301884650002001897650000901917653002401926653002001950653002201970653002401992700001902016700001902035700003102054773010602085856008702191852000902278655001202287IND60601549920221123015803.0200717e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060154992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Sarmistha10aVermi-sanitization of toxic silk industry waste employing Eisenia fetida and Eudrilus eugeniae: Substrate compatibility, nutrient enrichment and metal accumulation dynamics  ap. 267-274.  aDetoxification of silk processing effluents and sludge (SPES) through composting approaches is a new idea. This study examined the biodegradation potential of two epigeic earthworms (Eisenia fetida and Eudrilus eugeniae) in different SPES and cow dung (CD) mixtures in comparison with composting. N, P, S, Fe and Mn availability significantly increased upon vermicomposting compared to aerobic composting. The alkaline pH of the feedstocks satisfactorily neutralized under vermicomposting. The Ca-K availability and cation exchange dynamics readily stabilized due to vermicomposting. Interestingly, Eisenia fetida exhibited greater adaptability towards the toxic SPES materials than Eudrilus eugeniae, which was accompanied by 60–70% reduction of Cd, Cr, Zn and Pb levels in Eisenia system, whereas metal accumulation ability of Eudrilus eugeniae was remarkable. Moreover, both the species equally contributed in augmentation of beneficial (N-fixing and P-solubilizing) microorganisms in the feedstocks. Overall, nutrient enrichment and sanitizing potency of vermitechnology was explicitly manifested in SPES + CD (1:1) combination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3aEudrilus eugeniae 3abiodegradation 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3acattle manure 3achromium 3aearthworms 3afeedstocks 3aindustrial effluents 3aindustrial wastes 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3ametabolic detoxification 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3apotassium 3asanitizing 3asilk 3asludge 3atoxicity 3avermicomposting 3azinc 0aSilk industry waste 0aVermitechnology 0aMetal remediation 0aMicrobial diversity1 aDas, Subhasish1 aRaul, Prasanta1 aBhattacharya, Satya Sundar0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Oct., v. 266 p.267-274dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003800150245012300188300001400311520236900325592002802694650002202722650001102744650002102755650001002776650001602786650001602802650001102818650002602829651001102855653002102866653002002887653002102907653001602928653002102944700002202965700003002987700002903017700002703046700002003073700003403093700003303127773009903160856008503259852000903344655001203353IND60597167520221122055836.0200110e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059716752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2018.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Marcus Vinícius Theodoro10aClimatic and geomorphologic cycles in a semiarid distributive fluvial system, Upper Cretaceous, Bauru Group, SE Brazil  ap. 75-95.  aStudies of distributive fluvial systems and their preserved successions envisage the distribution and orientation of architectural elements to be primarily controlled by channels radiating outward from fan apices, in many cases along an elongate basin margin. Conceptual models for such systems account for the downstream dynamics of the fluvial network, but with limited consideration of temporal geomorphic variations, resulting vertical organisation of architectural elements, or of the interplay of factors controlling system dynamics. To understand the external and internal architecture of distributive fluvial systems, and the factors that influence their sequential facies organisation, a sedimentary succession of the proximal portion of an Upper Cretaceous, semiarid, distributive fluvial system, located at the north-eastern margin of the Bauru Basin (Southeast Brazil), has been analysed in detail. Three fining- and thinning-upward fluvial sequences are identified, forming an interval separated at the top and the bottom by two palaeosol profiles. Each sequence is formed of channel and floodplain deposits. Two types of channel deposits are identified. One is composed of stacked sets of small-scale dune deposits, suggesting perennial and steady fluvial regime, associated with more humid climate periods. The other is composed of large-scale sets indicative of flattened dunes associated with unsteady and fast-changing fluvial flow, formed in quasi-supercritical flow regime conditions, associated with drier climate periods. The vertical alternation of these two types of channel deposits records the accumulation of a fluvial succession that responded to high-frequency, climate-induced cyclic change in boundary conditions. Two palaeosol profiles, at the top and at the bottom of the succession, indicate temporary interruptions and cessation of the fluvial sedimentation, likely related to avulsion of the fluvial belt. Thus, the studied succession reveals high-frequency climate-induced allogenic sedimentary cycles that occur within a long-period autogenic geomorphologic-induced sedimentary cycle. This work suggests that the internal architecture of the channel deposits can be used as a climate proxy, and that climate and geomorphology act jointly as notable factors to control the vertical organisation of distributive fluvial systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3abasins 3aclimatic factors 3adunes 3afloodplains 3ahumid zones 3amodels 3apaleosolic soil types 3aBrazil 0aFluvial deposits 0aPalaeohydrology 0aSemiarid climate 0aBauru Basin 0aUpper Cretaceous1 aBasilici, Giorgio1 aDal’ Bó, Patrick Führ1 ada Silva Marinho, Thiago1 aMountney, Nigel Philip1 aColombera, Luca1 ade Oliveira, Emerson Ferreira1 ada Silva, Karla Evenny Brito0 tSedimentary geology.g2018 Oct., v. 372 p.75-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2018.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001600287520093500303592002801238596008701266650001101353650001101364650001301375650001101388650001001399650002001409650001501429650001001444650002701454650001001481651001001491700001701501700001801518773009801536856008201634852000901716655001201725IND60590606720221119083914.0190917e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059060672DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-017-0534-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarano, Ken-ichi10aPatrolling and scent-marking behavior in Japanese bumblebee Bombus ardens ardens males: alternative mating tactic?  ap. 120-130.  aPrevious reports note that males of the Japanese bumblebee Bombus ardens ardens perform nest surveillance to mate with new queens. Here, we report that males of this species also perform patrolling and scent-marking for mating. We observed that many B. ardens ardens males fly together from May to June in circular paths through a wooded area in Tokyo, Japan. The flight activity is bimodal with peaks in the morning and late afternoon. When tethered new queens were presented at a focal point, males approached, touched, or grabbed them but ignored them at a foraging site. Males performed scent-marking on tree leaves only in the early morning (05:30 to 07:30), and compounds from the labial gland of B. ardens ardens males were detected on a scent-marked leaf. Based on these findings and previous reports, we conclude that males of this species have at least two mating tactics or strategies: nest surveillance and patrolling.  aPublisher supplied data  a26850219cthe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology, Japan 3aBombus 3aflight 3aforaging 3aleaves 3amales 3amating behavior 3amonitoring 3anests 3ascent marking behavior 3atrees 3aJapan1 aKubo, Ryohei1 aŌno, Masato,0 tApidologie.g2018 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.120-130dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-017-0534-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006200169300001400231520162800245592002801873650002001901650001301921650001201934650001301946650000901959650001301968650001401981650001301995650001102008650001402019653001302033653001002046653001502056653001702071700002302088700002302111773009902134856008502233852000902318655001202327IND60597167620221122060008.0200110e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059716762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2018.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCole, Devon B.10aAuthigenic chromium enrichments in Proterozoic ironstones  ap. 25-43.  aChromium isotopes have recently emerged as a proxy for atmospheric oxygen levels in the Precambrian. Chromium (Cr) enrichments, along with a suite of other redox sensitive metals, have also been used as marine redox proxies for decades. Despite significant interest and growing use of this system, which has been used to argue for low oxygen levels through the mid-Proterozoic leading up to the rise of animals, there is a poor understanding of the host phases of Cr in the sedimentary record. Without this context, interpretation of measured isotopic signatures and concentrations of Cr in various sedimentary archives can be ambiguous. In order to shed light on this problem, we have used electron microprobe elemental mapping to identify authigenic and detrital Cr phases. We have examined a range of ironstone samples that have been previously analyzed for Cr isotopes and find that Cr is predominantly associated with iron rich allochems instead of detrital Cr mineral phases. We did not find evidence for detrital chromite or other Cr-rich detrital minerals. Additionally, we find evidence for authigenic Ti enrichments, and decoupling of Al and Ti—elements traditionally used as detrital tracers—similar to what has been reported in other slowly accumulating metal-rich sediments (e.g., iron manganese nodules). Lastly, we have explored a range of possible sedimentary Cr isotope signals that could result from changes in the percentage of detrital versus authigenic Cr incorporated into a sample, providing clear evidence for the ambiguity in interpretations of this isotope system without petrographic context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProterozoic eon 3aaluminum 3aanimals 3achromium 3airon 3aisotopes 3amanganese 3aminerals 3aoxygen 3asediments 0aChromium 0aRedox 0aIronstones 0aTrace metals1 aO'Connell, Brennan1 aPlanavsky, Noah J.0 tSedimentary geology.g2018 Oct., v. 372 p.25-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2018.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011000170300001800280520166400298592002801962650002501990650001602015650001902031650001602050650003802066650001102104650002102115650002202136650001102158650003102169650001402200650001502214650002602229650001402255700002102269700001402290700001602304700002002320700002202340700001702362773014802379856008302527852000902610655001202619IND60749183620221119141243.0211012e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074918362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-021-03468-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDingess, Kelly A.10aOptimization of a human milk–directed quantitative sIgA ELISA method substantiated by mass spectrometry  ap. 5037-5049.  aImmunoglobulins are the primary protective products in human milk and are responsible for transferring maternal pathogen memory to the infant, providing protection by binding to recognized pathogens and inhibiting virulence. To better understand potentially protective/anti-infective compounds in human milk, the establishment of human milk–tailored analytical approaches is crucial, as most contemporary analytical methods have been optimized for plasma or serum. One of the most prominent immunoglobulins in human milk is secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), which may be relevant for the protection of breastfed infants from harmful pathogens. Advanced sIgA detection methods can help monitor the immune status and development of the mother-infant dyad. We therefore developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) sIgA method for the quantitative analysis of IgA plus secretory component (SC), validated with sIgA standards and substantiated by mass spectrometry (MS)–based proteomics. A very strong correlation was observed between the MS-detected IgA1 and the human milk–specific sIgA ELISA (r = 0.82). Overall, the MS data indicate that the developed human milk sIgA ELISA does not differentiate between sIgA1 and sIgA2 and is, therefore, a reflection of total sIgA. Furthermore, our MS data and the human milk–derived sIgA ELISA data are better correlated than data derived from a standard serum IgA ELISA kit (relative to MS IgA1 r = 0.82 and r = 0.42, respectively). We therefore propose our human milk–specific sIgA ELISA as an ideal quantitative indicator of total sIgA with advantages over current serum IgA ELISA kits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin A 3amass spectrometry 3amemory 3amother-child relationships 3apathogens 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3avirulence1 avan Dam, Pauline1 aZhu, Jing1 aMank, Marko1 aKnipping, Karen1 aHeck, Albert J.R.1 aStahl, Bernd0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 Aug., v. 413, no. 20 p.5037-5049dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03468-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03922naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245014600189300001600335520195400351592002802305650001002333650001102343650001802354650000902372650002102381650002002402650001602422650002002438650002302458650001402481650002502495650001202520650001402532650001802546650001502564650001002579650001602589650001602605650004702621650001202668650005502680650002102735650004602756650002202802650003102824650001702855650001002872650004702882650003502929650001202964650001502976650001102991650001003002650001503012650001603027700001703043700002103060773010703081856005103188852000903239655001203248IND50075032420221117171409.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007503242DNAL7 a226467872pmid7 a10.1080/00071668.2012.6654352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLokaewmanee, K.10aEffects of fermented plant product on growth performance, some blood variables, carcase characteristics, and intestinal histology in broilers  ap. 215-223.  a1. Fermented plant product (FPP) is a natural fermented food which is produced from a mixture of fermented fruit and vegetables, and rice bran (1:9).2. To investigate the effects of FPP on growth performance, some blood variables, carcase characteristics and intestinal histology were determined in 192 broilers. They were divided into 4 groups, with 4 replicates of 12 chicks each; the chicks were provided ad libitum access to a diet consisting of 0, 0·5, 2·0 and 4·0% dietary FPP.3. The crude protein and metabolisable energy concentrations of these diets were adjusted to 230 g CP/kg and 13·40 MJ ME/kg for the 7 to 21 d old chicks, and 200 g CP/kg and 13·40 MJ ME/kg for the 22 to 49 d old chicks, respectively.4. At 49 d of age, feed intake, body weight gain and feed efficiency tended to increase with increase in FPP concentrations. Feed intake increased in the 4·0% dietary FPP group, BW gain increased in the 2·0% and 4·0% dietary FPP groups and feed efficiency increased in all experimental groups.5. There were no differences among diets in the blood variables and carcase characteristics, except for total visceral organ weight, increased in all experimental groups.6. Most of the intestinal villus heights, villus areas, epithelial cell areas and cell mitosis tended to increase with increase in FPP concentrations; duodenal villus height and cell mitosis in the 2·0 and 4·0% dietary FPP groups, and jejunal cell mitosis in all experimental groups were significantly increased. Compared with flat cells on the villus apical surface in the 0% FPP group, all experimental groups had protuberant cells in all intestinal parts.7. In conclusion, hypertrophy of the villi and epithelial cells was observed in the present study, indicating improved growth performance, especially in the 4·0% dietary FPP group. Furthermore, increased total visceral organ weights suggested that FPP has no harmful effects on broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3achicks 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aepithelial cells 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afermented foods 3agrowth performance 3ahistology 3ametabolizable energy 3amitosis 3arice bran 3atissue weight 3avegetables 3avilli 3aweight gain 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickensxbloodxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytology 2aFermentation 2aFruit 2aIntestinesxanatomy & histologyxcytology. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMitosis 2aOrgan Size 2aOryza. 2aSeeds 2aVegetables 2aWeight Gain1 aYamauchi, K.1 aThongwittaya, N.0 tBritish poultry science.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 53, no. 2 p.215-223dTaylor & Francis Groupx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2012.665435  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013400168300001400302520134300316592002801659650002101687650002001708650002101728650001601749650002701765650002301792650002401815650001301839650001201852650001001864650001601874650002101890650001101911650002101922650001401943650001301957650001501970650001201985650001001997650000902007651000902016653002402025653001402049653001102063653001302074700005402087700001602141700001502157700001502172700005502187700001502242773009602257856008502353852000902438655001202447IND60541552720221119233924.0190318e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054155272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2014.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbera, R.I.10aFirst report of the fungus Fomitiporia maxonii Murrill causing citrus wood rot in commercial orange and grapefruit groves in Cuba  ap. 67-72.  aCuban citriculture has recently been affected by important pests and diseases including black citrus aphid Toxoptera citricida Kirkaldy, citrus leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, Asiatic citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, Citrus tristeza disease, and huanglongbing. This complex of ‘invasive species’ is thought to be contributing to the increasing decline of commercial citrus groves. During several surveys carried out in commercial citrus areas of several provinces in Cuba, symptoms of dieback, characterized by the presence of abundant dry branches and wood rot were detected on Criolla Valencia orange, Marsh grapefruit trees on sour orange, and Cleopatra mandarin rootstocks. Samples of branches and trunk wood were processed and a fungus was isolated from all samples. Morphological, physiological and molecular characterization demonstrated that the isolated agent is Fomitiporia maxonii Murrill. The incidence of affected trees was high in most surveyed groves, reaching 100% in old groves. Symptoms similar to the ones found in naturally infected trees were reproduced on trees inoculated with pure cultures of the fungus, and the fungus was recovered in culture from inoculated trees, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. This is the first report of an association of F. maxonii with citrus wood rot in Cuba.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus sinensis 3aDiaphorina citri 3aFomitiporia 3aPhyllocnistis citrella 3aToxoptera aurantii 3aToxoptera citricida 3abranches 3adieback 3afungi 3agrapefruits 3agreening disease 3agroves 3ainvasive species 3amandarins 3aorchards 3arootstocks 3asurveys 3atrees 3awood 3aCuba 0aFomitiporia maxonii 0aIncidence 0aCitrus 0aWood rot1 aDecock, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-385X1 aHerrera, S.1 aFerrer, J.1 aOrtega, I.1 aLopes, S.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7417-30571 aZamora, V.0 tCrop protection.g2014 Apr., v. 58 p.67-72dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2014.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245004300174300001400217520095300231592002801184596007701212596008301289650001501372650001501387650001201402650001001414650001101424650001701435650001401452650002001466650001301486650001501499650002201514700003101536700002701567700003801594700003101632773009601663856008201759852000901841655001201850IND60590606920221119083803.0190917e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059060692DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-017-0540-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarchuk, Angel Roberto14aThe ontogenetic saga of a social brain  ap. 32-48.  aQueen and worker honeybees differ in a number of life-history traits, including the size of certain brain regions, such as the mushroom bodies (MBs), which are larger in workers. However, during the larval period, the differential feeding offered to queens promotes faster brain development. As a result, members of this caste have larger brains than workers. This developmental process is accompanied by the higher expression of several neurogenic genes. Nonetheless, a caste-specific shift in relative brain growth occurs during the next developmental stage. The suggested molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon are variations in hormonal environments, which may mediate higher cell death rates in the queen’s brain than in the workers’. The brain development of this highly eusocial bee is thus a paradoxical case that may represent an evolutionary by-product of the reproductive division of labour in species with female size diphenism.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPQ-02134-14cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais  a307426/2014-9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3abyproducts 3acell death 3afemales 3agenes 3alarvae 3alife history 3amortality 3amushroom bodies 3aontogeny 3apolyethism 3aworker honey bees1 ados Santos, Gabriele David1 aDias Caneschi, Ricardo1 ade Paula Junior, Delcio Eustaquio1 aModa, Lívia Maria Rosatto0 tApidologie.g2018 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.32-48dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-017-0540-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014400170300001800314520143100332592002801763650002101791650001401812650001401826650002301840650001401863650001201877650002001889650001301909650002801922650002401950650002101974650001501995650001602010650001602026650002402042653001402066653002302080653001602103653003202119653001602151700002502167700002302192773009902215856008502314852000902399655001202408IND60646717720221118041301.0190628e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064671772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Pablo D.10aSulfonated activated carbon from corn cobs as heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production using microwave-assisted transesterification  ap. 1710-1716.  aBiodiesel is produced by transesterification reaction of oils catalyzed by homogeneous catalysts, with the latter being non-recoverable and promoter of solubility of the produced glycerol into the otherwise immiscible ester phase, which have to be purified. The need for purification of products is eliminated if heterogeneous catalysts are employed, with the added advantage of the catalyst recovery, however, with disadvantage of requiring drastic reaction conditions (elevated temperatures and pressures, longer reaction times) significantly increasing the costs of production. To overcome such problems, several catalysts were developed, with the sulfonated ones being the most prospective for industrial applications. Thus, the objective herein was to develop a sulfonated heterogeneous catalyst using activated carbon produced from corncobs as precursor material and employ it in microwave-assisted transesterification reactions of soybean oil with ethanol. The optimum operational conditions employed for the reaction were microwave variable power of 0–600 W, catalyst-to-oil mass ratio of 20%, alcohol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1 and reaction time of 20 min. The catalyst successfully catalyzed the transesterification reaction in times as short as 20 min, resulting in a pure biodiesel phase with yield of 88.7%. The catalyst was reused in five subsequent reaction cycles without loss of its catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acorn cobs 3aethanol 3afuel production 3aglycerol 3aindustrial applications 3amicrowave treatment 3aproduction costs 3asolubility 3asoybean oil 3atemperature 3atransesterification 0aCorn cobs 0aAgricultural waste 0aSulfonation 0aTransesterification of oils 0aSoybean oil1 aOliveira, Leandro S.1 aFranca, Adriana S.0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Dec., v. 143 p.1710-1716dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245016900175300001400344520160800358592002801966650001501994650001602009650002102025650002802046650002102074650001802095650002802113650001202141650001902153650001602172650001902188650001302207650001702220653001602237653003402253653003502287653001902322653002202341700001702363700002202380700001602402700001802418700002702436700002002463700002002483773012302503856008202626852000902708655001202717IND60605895420221121111009.0180723e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Bishnu Kumar10aHigh-performance glucose biosensor based on chitosan-glucose oxidase immobilized polypyrrole/Nafion/functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes bio-nanohybrid film  ap. 39-47.  aA highly electroactive bio-nanohybrid film of polypyrrole (PPy)-Nafion (Nf)-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (fMWCNTs) nanocomposite was prepared on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by a facile one-step electrochemical polymerization technique followed by chitosan-glucose oxidase (CH-GOx) immobilization on its surface to achieve a high-performance glucose biosensor. The as-fabricated nanohybrid composite provides high surface area for GOx immobilization and thus enhances the enzyme-loading efficiency. The structural characterization revealed that the PPy-Nf-fMWCNTs nanocomposite films were uniformly formed on GCE and after GOx immobilization, the surface porosities of the film were decreased due to enzyme encapsulation inside the bio-nanohybrid composite materials. The electrochemical behavior of the fabricated biosensor was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and amperometry measurements. The results indicated an excellent catalytic property of bio-nanohybrid film for glucose detection with improved sensitivity of 2860.3μAmM⁻¹cm⁻², the linear range up to 4.7mM (R²=0.9992), and a low detection limit of 5μM under a signal/noise (S/N) ratio of 3. Furthermore, the resulting biosensor presented reliable selectivity, better long-term stability, good repeatability, reproducibility, and acceptable measurement of glucose concentration in real serum samples. Thus, this fabricated biosensor provides an efficient and highly sensitive platform for glucose sensing and can open up new avenues for clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanotubes 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aencapsulation 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglucose 3ananocomposites 3ananohybrids 3apolymerization 3apyrroles 3asurface area 0aPolypyrrole 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes 0aElectrochemical polymerization 0aBio-nanohybrid 0aGlucose biosensor1 aAhmad, Rafiq1 aMousa, Hamouda M.1 aKim, In-gi,1 aKim, Jeong In1 aNeupane, Madhav Prasad1 aPark, Chan-Hee,1 aKim, Cheol Sang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 482 p.39-47dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013000158300002000288520150000308592002801808650002201836650001301858650001601871650002001887650001901907650000901926650001501935650001301950650001001963650001401973700001801987700001702005700002102022700001802043773012402061856007402185852000902259655001202268IND60655630220221119114404.0190803e20190726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065563022DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra04014e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianhua10aFrom kirigami to three-dimensional paper-based micro-analytical device: cut-and-paste fabrication and mobile app quantitation  ap. 23267-23275.  aNowadays quantitative chemical analysis is usually costly, instrument-dependent, and time-consuming, which limits its implementation for remote locations and resource-limited regions. Inspired by the ancient papercutting art (kirigami), we herein introduce a novel cut-and-paste protocol to fabricate 3D microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) that are suitable for on-site quantitative assay applications. The preparation of the device is fast, simple, and independent of any lithographic devices or masks. Particularly designed reaction “channels” were pre-cut from a piece of filter paper, then assembled back to the silanized, superhydrophobic paper pads. The different layers of the device were assembled using a chemically-inert adhesive spray. The fabricated device has high efficiency of liquid handling (up to 60 times faster than conventional methods) and it is particularly inexpensive. Beyond the benchtop fabrication advantage, in conjunction with a custom mobile app developed for colorimetric analysis, we were able to quantify representative environmental contaminants (i.e., the amount of Cr(vi) and nitrite ions) in various water samples with the cut-and-paste μPADs (namely kPADs). Their detection limits (0.7 μg mL⁻¹ for Cr(vi) and 0.4 μg mL⁻¹ for nitrite ions, respectively) are comparable with conventional spectrophotometric methods, which confirm the potential of kPADs for on-site environmental/sanitary monitoring and food toxin pre-screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical analysis 3achromium 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3amonitoring 3anitrites 3apaper 3apollution1 aZhang, Lishen1 aLi, Xiaochun1 aZhang, Xiaoliang1 aYu, Hua-Zhong0 tRSC advances.g2019 July 26, v. 9, no. 40 p.23267-23275dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra04014e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007800175300001600253520098800269592002801257650001401285650001001299650001401309650001501323650001401338650001101352650000901363650001801372651001401390700002101404700002101425773009401446856008501540852000901625655001201634IND60084126820221119030741.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroadhurst, Matt K.10aPost-release mortality of angled sand mullet (Myxus elongatus: Mugilidae)  ap. 272-275.  aGrey mullets (Mugilidae) are important to recreational fisheries throughout the developed world. In Australia, several species are angled and then released in large numbers; all with virtually unknown fate. In response to the need for such data to facilitate effective stock management, this study sought to quantify the post-release mortality and key causal factors for sand mullet (Myxus elongatus). A total of 125 fish were conventionally angled, and then released along with 50 controls into floating cages in a south eastern Australian estuary, where they were monitored for four days. Five treatment fish died, providing a non-significant mortality of 4%. The few fatalities were mostly explained by a significant positive relationship with the length of trace (between the float and hook) used, and bleeding during release. While sand mullet appear quite tolerant of catch and release, their welfare nevertheless could be improved through simple changes to fishing strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMugilidae 3acages 3aestuaries 3ahemorrhage 3amortality 3amullet 3asand 3asport fishing 3aAustralia1 aButcher, Paul A.1 aCullis, Brian R.0 tFisheries research.g2011 Jan., v. 107, no. 1-3 p.272-275dElsevier B.V.x0165-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04507naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016600169300001300335520228800348592002802636650001302664650001702677650002302694650002402717650002202741650001902763650001202782650001702794650000902811650001702820650001102837650002202848650001802870650001302888650002002901650001102921650000902932650001602941650001902957650001802976650001602994650001603010650001503026650004303041650002203084650001303106650000903119650001103128650002303139650002603162650000903188650001203197650001503209650002003224650002403244650002903268650001603297650002403313650001903337650001003356653002903366653002803395653003103423653002503454653001603479653002203495700002903517773008903546856008103635852000903716655001203725IND60085825320221120195857.0160901e20130320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008582532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanita, Sergio C.10aAmmonium chloride salting out extraction/cleanup for trace-level quantitative analysis in food and biological matrices by flow injection tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 1-11.  aA sample extraction and purification procedure that uses ammonium-salt-induced acetonitrile/water phase separation was developed and demonstrated to be compatible with the recently reported method for pesticide residue analysis based on fast extraction and dilution flow injection mass spectrometry (FED-FI-MS). The ammonium salts evaluated were chloride, acetate, formate, carbonate, and sulfate. A mixture of NaCl and MgSO4, salts used in the well-known QuEChERS method, was also tested for comparison. With thermal decomposition/evaporation temperature of <350°C, ammonium salts resulted in negligible ion source residual under typical electrospray conditions, leading to consistent method performance and less instrument cleaning. Although all ammonium salts tested induced acetonitrile/water phase separation, NH4Cl yielded the best performance, thus it was the preferred salting out agent. The NH4Cl salting out method was successfully coupled with FI/MS/MS and tested for fourteen pesticide active ingredients: chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, chlorimuron ethyl, oxamyl, methomyl, sulfometuron methyl, chlorsulfuron, triflusulfuron methyl, azimsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron methyl, aminocyclopyrachlor, aminocyclopyrachlor methyl, diuron and hexazinone. A validation study was conducted with nine complex matrices: sorghum, rice, grapefruit, canola, milk, eggs, beef, urine and blood plasma. The method is applicable to all analytes, except aminocyclopyrachlor. The method was deemed appropriate for quantitative analysis in 114 out of 126 analyte/matrix cases tested (applicability rate=0.90). The NH4Cl salting out extraction/cleanup allowed expansion of FI/MS/MS for analysis in food of plant and animal origin, and body fluids with increased ruggedness and sensitivity, while maintaining high-throughput (run time=30s/sample). Limits of quantitation (LOQs) of 0.01mgkg−1 (ppm), the ‘well-accepted standard’ in pesticide residue analysis, were achieved in >80% of cases tested; while limits of detection (LODs) were typically in the range of 0.001–0.01mgkg−1 (ppm). A comparison to a well-established HPLC/MS/MS method was also conducted, yielding comparable results, thus confirming the suitability of NH4Cl salting out FI/MS/MS for pesticide residue analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetonitrile 3aactive ingredients 3aaminocyclopyrachlor 3aammonium chloride 3aammonium salts 3aanimals 3aazimsulfuron 3abeef 3ablood plasma 3acanola 3achlorimuron ethyl 3achlorsulfuron 3acleaning 3adetection limit 3adiuron 3aeggs 3aevaporation 3aflupyrsulfuron 3afood analysis 3afood plants 3agrapefruits 3ahexazinone 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amagnesium sulfate 3amethomyl 3amilk 3aoxamyl 3apesticide residues 3aquantitative analysis 3arice 3asalting 3aseparation 3asodium chloride 3asulfometuron methyl 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3atriflusulfuron 3aurine 0aTandem mass spectrometry 0aFlow injection analysis 0aPesticide residue analysis 0aMultiresidue methods 0aSalting out 0aAmmonium chloride1 aPadivitage, Nilusha L.T.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Mar. 20, v. 768 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012000154300002000274520167500294592002801969650002101997650002802018650001602046650001202062650001802074650001602092650001402108650001302122650001802135650001702153650001702170650003102187650002502218650001602243650001202259650000902271650000902280650001702289650003302306650002002339650002502359650001802384700001602402700001602418700001402434700001802448773012402466856007402590852000902664655001202673IND60655630320221119114315.0190803e20190725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065563032DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra04026a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Yue10aHybrid cellulose nanocrystal/alginate/gelatin scaffold with improved mechanical properties and guided wound healing  ap. 22966-22979.  aNature derived biopolymers such as polysaccharides and collagen have attracted considerable attention in biomedical applications. Despite excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity, their poor mechanical properties could not meet the requirement for skin regeneration. In this study, cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) was incorporated into the calcium cross-linked sodium alginate/gelatin (SA/Ge) scaffold to reinforce its physicochemical properties. A novel sodium alginate/gelatin/cellulose nanocrystal (SA/Ge/CNC) scaffold was successfully prepared through electrostatic interaction of sodium alginate and gelatin, ionic cross-linking of calcium ions with sodium alginate, and incorporation of CNC. Afterwards, the SA/Ge and SA/Ge/CNC scaffolds were fully characterized and compared with scanning electron microscopy images, swelling behaviors, tensile strengths and contact angles. The involvement of CNC produces a hybrid SA/Ge/CNC scaffold with desired porous network, moderate swelling behavior, and superior mechanical strength (from 18 MPa to 45 MPa). Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity and cell growth assay using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells validated that SA/Ge/CNC scaffold was non-toxic and can prompt cell adhesion and proliferation. The in vivo skin regeneration experiments using the SA/Ge/CNC scaffold group showed an improved skin wound healing process with accelerated re-epithelialization, increased collagen deposition and faster extracellular matrix remodeling. Overall, the results suggested that the SA/Ge/CNC hybrid scaffold with enhanced mechanical performance and wound healing efficacy was a promising biomaterial for skin defect regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiopolymers 3acalcium 3acell adhesion 3acell growth 3acellulose 3acollagen 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3agelatin 3aions 3amice 3ananocrystals 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium alginate 3astrength (mechanics) 3atissue repair1 aLi, Chaoyue1 aWu, Yongzhi1 aLi, Qiwen1 aLiao, Jinfeng0 tRSC advances.g2019 July 25, v. 9, no. 40 p.22966-22979dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra04026a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245022100169300001600390520205200406592002802458650001802486650001902504650001202523650001902535650001202554650001502566650001302581650001802594650002002612650001402632650001502646650002302661650001902684650001402703651001102717651001902728653001102747653001102758653001402769653001502783653003402798700003002832700002302862773010102885856008502986852000903071655001203080IND60597168020221122055916.0200110e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059716802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2018.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, Barbara10aSingle grain heavy mineral provenance of garnet and amphibole in the Surveyor fan and precursor sediments on the Gulf of Alaska abyssal plain — Implications for climate-tectonic interactions in the St. Elias orogen  ap. 173-192.  aThe St. Elias orogen formed as a result of the northwestward drift of the Yakutat terrane along and final collision with the Alaska margin in the Miocene. Its exhumation coincided with changing glacial conditions that are considered to have strongly interacted with mountain building processes. A significant part of the record of these tectonic-climatic interactions is stored in sediments on the Gulf of Alaska abyssal plain including the Surveyor fan. Our study examines temporal provenance changes of Miocene through Pleistocene sediments of the Surveyor fan, Gulf of Alaska, to constrain the dynamics of exhumation and mass transfer from the evolving St. Elias orogen to the adjacent Surveyor deep sea fan. We present single grain geochemical data of amphibole and garnet and ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar cooling ages of biotite and amphibole together with point counting data of heavy minerals from sands and silts from two sites in the distal and proximal fan, drilled by IODP expedition 341 in 2013 (sites U1417 and U1418, respectively).A shift in heavy mineral composition during the Miocene, predating the onset of glaciation, points to a tectonically-induced change in erosion centers and sediment transport, probably caused by the rise of the St. Elias Mountains. Garnet and amphibole data suggest the Chugach metamorphic complex is the main sediment source, implying input to the Surveyor fan from sources relatively far in the north during the Miocene. Changing provenance signals from the Miocene to Pliocene suggest rising input from the lower grade metamorphic areas at the southern flanks of the orogen, indicating the advance of glaciers to the tidewater line, providing material from this flanking region. Higher input from the Chugach metamorphic complex in all Pleistocene sediments suggests the Northern Hemisphere glaciation at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary caused erosion and sediment yield from the interior of the orogen. Climatic changes at the mid-Pleistocene transition did not cause significant changes in the provenance signal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3abiotite 3aclimate change 3acooling 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3amass transfer 3amineral content 3amountains 3aprovenance 3asediment transport 3asediment yield 3asediments 3aAlaska 3aGulf of Alaska 0aAlaska 0aGarnet 0aAmphibole 0aProvenance 0aClimate-tectonic interactions1 aBahlburg, H.q(Heinrich),1 aPfänder, Jörg A.0 tSedimentary geology.g2018 Oct., v. 372 p.173-192dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2018.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004100140245013600181500001900317520143200336592002801768650001501796650002501811650003401836650001401870650001701884650002101901650001501922650002301937650001001960650002801970650001301998650001102011650001302022700003402035700001902069700001902088700004702107700004502154700003802199700004802237700001902285700002002304700001902324773012602343856007402469852000902543655001202552IND60703249320221116180500.0200720e20200408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070324932DNAL7 a10.3390/md180401962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernando, Ilekuttige  Priyan Shanura10aFucoidan Purified from <i>Sargassum polycystum</i> Induces Apoptosis through Mitochondria-Mediated Pathway in HL-60 and MCF-7 Cells  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFucoidans are biocompatible, heterogeneous, and fucose rich sulfated polysaccharides biosynthesized in brown algae, which are renowned for their broad-spectrum biofunctional properties. As a continuation of our preliminary screening studies, the present work was undertaken to extract polysaccharides from the edible brown algae <i>Sargassum polycystum</i> by a modified enzyme assisted extraction process using Celluclast, a food-grade cellulase, and to purify fucoidan by DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography. The apoptotic and antiproliferative properties of the purified fucoidan (F5) were evaluated on HL-60 and MCF-7 cells. Structural features were characterized by FTIR and NMR analysis. F5 indicated profound antiproliferative effects on HL-60 leukemia and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 84.63 &plusmn; 0.08 &micro;g mL<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 93.62 &plusmn; 3.53 &micro;g mL<sup>&minus;1</sup> respectively. Further, F5 treatment increased the apoptotic body formation, DNA damage, and accumulation of HL-60 and MCF-7 cells in the Sub-G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle. The effects were found to proceed via the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. The Celluclast assisted extraction is a cost-efficient method of yielding fucoidan. With further studies in place, purified fucoidan of <i>S. polycystum</i> could be applied as functional ingredients in food and pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aSargassum polycystum 3aanion exchange chromatography 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3abreast neoplasms 3acell cycle 3acost effectiveness 3adrugs 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afucoidan 3afucose 3aleukemia1 aSanjeewa, Kalu  Kapuge Asanka1 aLee, Hyo  Geun1 aKim, Hyun Soo,1 aVaas, Andaravaas  Patabadige Jude Prasanna1 aDe Silva, Hondamuni  Ireshika Chathurani1 aNanayakkara, Chandrika  Malkanthi1 aAbeytunga, Dampegamage  Thusitha Udayangani1 aLee, Dae-Sung 1 aLee, Jung-Suck 1 aJeon, You-Jin 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 Apr. 08, v. 18, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180401963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024004100132040001800173100002700191245009400218300001200312520153500324592002801859650002201887650002501909650002201934650002301956650002301979650002002002650001502022650002302037650001602060650002602076650002602102650001102128650001802139650002202157651002402179651001302203651003102216653001402247653001902261653001402280653002502294653001002319700002302329700002402352700002202376773009302398856008502491852000902576655001202585IND60541553020221119233056.0190318e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054155302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2014.01.0092doi7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2014.01.0092chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Nathanael M.10aEconomics of foliar fungicides for hard red winter wheat in the USA southern Great Plains  ap. 1-6.  aGrain yields of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the southern Great Plains are often reduced by the presence of foliar diseases. This study was conducted to determine whether the application of foliar fungicides is an economically optimal management strategy. The effects of fungicide treatment on commercially available hard red winter wheat varieties with differing levels of genetic resistance (i.e., resistant, intermediate, and susceptible) to foliar diseases were investigated at two locations, Apache and Lahoma, OK, USA, for the harvest years 2005–2012. Two fungicides were rotated between the two locations and applied at approximately Feekes growth stage 9–10.5. When averaged across years, plots to which fungicide was applied generated greater average net returns than plots that did not receive fungicide for susceptible varieties at Apache, and for resistant, intermediate, and susceptible varieties at Lahoma. However, foliar fungicide application was not economical in every year at either location suggesting fungicide use should be reassessed each year given that profitability depends on year specific yield potential, prices, and foliar disease conditions. At both locations high disease incidence occurred in all but one site-year when the average March through May relative humidity exceeded 65%. Additional research would be required to determine the relationship between weather, including relative humidity, and disease incidence, and to develop an economic threshold for treatment decision aid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3adevelopmental stages 3adisease incidence 3aeconomic threshold 3afoliar application 3afoliar diseases 3afungicides 3agenetic resistance 3agrain yield 3ahard red winter wheat 3apesticide application 3aprices 3aprofitability 3arelative humidity 3aGreat Plains region 3aOklahoma 3aSoutheastern United States 0aEconomics 0aFoliar disease 0aFungicide 0aStochastic dominance 0aWheat1 aEpplin, Francis M.1 aEdwards, Jeffrey T.1 aHunger, Robert M.0 tCrop protection.g2014 May, v. 59 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2014.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013900164300001400303520153600317592002801853650002401881650001401905650001401919650001401933650001801947650001501965650001601980650002001996650001302016650001102029650001902040650003302059650001302092650001602105651001002121653001402131653002602145653000802171653002802179700001902207700001702226700001702243700001602260700001802276773009602294856008502390852000902475655001202484IND60541553120221119233128.0190318e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054155312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2014.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jia10aOptimization of d-pinitol extraction from vegetable soybean leaves and its potential application in control of cucumber powdery mildew  ap. 20-27.  ad-pinitol is a bioactive compound with an important application in both food and nonfood industries. In the present study, the leaves of twelve vegetable soybean cultivars that are usually treated as agricultural waste were screened for the presence of d-pinitol. The results showed that the d-pinitol content in these 12 cultivars ranged from 1.32 to 3.04% (w/w) of dry weight, and the cultivar Z98002 was found to contain the highest amount of d-pinitol. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimization of d-pinitol extraction conditions by the Box–Behnken design. The predicted extraction efficiency, which is at least 1.3-fold that of the previously reported typical method, reached to 3.27% under the following optimal conditions: temperature of 65.5 °C, extraction time of 86.8 min, and dilution rate of 1:10. The test in the growth chamber showed that the efficacy of soybean extracts in cucumber powdery mildew control was dose-dependent on the d-pinitol concentration, and the formulated extracts clearly increased the control compared to the crude extract. This effect of the d-pinitol formulation in a greenhouse was confirmed in four provinces of China over a period of two years. Our present study provides the optimized extraction conditions for a selected agricultural waste—vegetable soybean—to obtain a high yield of d-pinitol. Results from the growth chamber test and the greenhouse bioassay will be useful in exploring a low-cost phytochemical fungicide for cucumber powdery mildew control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abioassays 3acucumbers 3acultivars 3adose response 3afungicides 3agreenhouses 3agrowth chambers 3aindustry 3aleaves 3apowdery mildew 3aresponse surface methodology 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3aChina 0ad-pinitol 0aGlycine max (L.)

Determining the activity of these enzymes requires accurate quantitation of a large number of structures. In this study, we describe a method for the quantitation of human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) structures employing LC/MS and isotopically labeled internal standards. Data analysis was accomplished with a newly developed software tool, LC/MS Searcher, that employs a reference structure library to process LC/MS data yielding structural identification with accurate quantitation. The method was used to obtain a meta-enzyme analysis of bacteria, the simultaneous characterization of all glycosidases employed by bacteria for the catabolism of milk oligosaccharides. Analysis of consumed HMO structures confirmed the utility of a β-1,3-galactosidase in Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 (B. infantis). In comparison, Bifidobacterium breve ATCC 15700 showed significantly less HMO catabolic activity compared to B. infantis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium breve 3aBifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis 3abacteria 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abreast milk 3acomputer software 3adigestive system 3aglycosidases 3aisotope labeling 3ametabolism 3amilk 3aoligosaccharides1 aKim, Jaehan1 aWu, Shuai1 aDe Leoz, Maria Lorna A.1 aPeacock, Kyle1 aGrimm, Rudolf1 aGerman, J.

Circle hooks (size 18/0, 0° offset) and J-style hooks (size 9/0, 10° offset) with squid baits were deployed in an alternating fashion. The catch composition was not significantly different for most species between the two types of hooks, except for bigeye tuna, which showed a significantly higher proportion of catches on the circle hook (p≫0.001) and for sailfish, pelagic stingray, and leatherback sea turtle, which had higher catch rates on the J-style hook (p=0.018, p≫0.001, and p=0.044, respectively). Bigeye and yellowfin tuna showed significantly higher rates of survival at the time of gear retrieval with circle hooks, and circle hooks hooked bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, swordfish, and sailfish significantly more often externally than internally. Our results suggest that the use of size 18/0, 0° offset circle hooks in the equatorial pelagic longline fishery may increase the survival of bycatch species at the time of gear retrieval with minimal effects on the catches of target species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermochelys coriacea 3aThunnus albacares 3aThunnus obesus 3aXiphias gladius 3abaits 3abycatch 3asea turtles 3asquid 3asurvival rate 3atuna 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aKerstetter, D.W.1 aHazin, F.H.1 aHazin, Humberto1 aSegundo, R.S.S.L.1 aGraves, J.E.1 aCarvalho, F.1 aTravassos, P.E.0 tFisheries research.g2011 Jan., v. 107, no. 1-3 p.39-45dElsevier B.V.x0165-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009400159500001900253520142600272592002801698650001701726650002701743650001201770650002001782650001301802650001201815650001701827650002401844650002801868650001401896650001701910650001401927651001001941700001401951700001301965700001901978700002001997700001702017773012602034856007402160852000902234655001202243IND60703250320221122234840.0200720e20200410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070325032DNAL7 a10.3390/md180402052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mengjia 10aCladodionen Is a Potential Quorum Sensing Inhibitor Against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is an opportunistic pathogen using virulence factors and biofilm regulated by quorum sensing (QS) systems to infect patients and protect itself from environmental stress and antibiotics. Interfering with QS systems is a novel approach to combat <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections without killing the bacteria, meaning that it is much harder for bacteria to develop drug resistance. A marine fungus <i>Cladosporium</i> sp. Z148 with anti-QS activity was obtained from Jiaozhou Bay, China. Cladodionen, a novel QS inhibitor, was isolated from the extracts of this fungus. Cladodionen had a better inhibitory effect than pyocyanin on the production of elastase and rhamnolipid. It also inhibited biofilm formation and motilities. The mRNA expressions of QS-related genes, including receptor proteins (<i>lasR, rhlR and pqsR</i>), autoinducer synthases (<i>lasI, rhlI and pqsA</i>) and virulence factors (<i>lasB and rhlA</i>) were down-regulated by cladodionen. Molecular docking analysis showed that cladodionen had better binding affinity to LasR and PqsR than natural ligands. Moreover, the binding affinity of cladodionen to LasR was higher than to PqsR. Cladodionen exhibits potential as a QS inhibitor against <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and its structure&ndash;activity relationships should be further studied to illustrate the mode of action, optimize its structure and improve anti-QS activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosporium 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abiofilm 3adrug resistance 3aelastase 3aligands 3amarine fungi 3amechanism of action 3aopportunistic pathogens 3apyocyanin 3arhamnolipids 3avirulence 3aChina1 aZhao, Lu 1 aWu, Hao 1 aZhao, Chaoyue 1 aGong, Qianhong 1 aYu, Wengong 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 18, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180402053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010600174300001400280520192500294592002802219650002602247650001802273650001502291650001202306650001402318650002302332650001402355650001002369650001402379650002402393650002402417650002002441650001102461650001102472651001502483651001102498651001202509700003502521773009202556856008502648852000902733655001202742IND60084127320221119030513.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKevrekidis, Kosmas10aPopulation dynamics of Melicertus kerathurus (Decapoda: Penaeidae) in Thermaikos Gulf (N. Aegean Sea)  ap. 46-58.  aThe east Atlantic-Mediterranean penaeid Melicertus kerathurus constitutes a valuable resource for Mediterranean fisheries. In recent years, its world production is almost totally based on the yields from Greece and Tunisia. A two-year study of prawn stock in Thermaikos Gulf (NW Aegean Sea) provided information on age, growth and mortality of the species. M. kerathurus exhibits a marked sexual growth dimorphism, with females showing an overall wider size range and greater size than males. Mean monthly size, CLₘₐₓ were also in favor of females. Monthly age classes varied from one to four for females and from one to three for males, and corresponded to three generations (0⁺, 1⁺, 2⁺). New generation (0⁺) cohorts recruited into fishery in waves, from late summer to February. According to the von Bertalanffy growth curve, females grow larger than males, but there is a prominent seasonal growth oscillation in both sexes (females: CL∞=62.48, K=1.15, C=0.87, WP=0.16, Rn=0.170; males: CL∞=47.78, K=1.28, C=0.97, WP=0.12, Rn=0.205). Growth performance indices (φ′, φ) and longevity were in favor of females. K values for both sexes in Thermaikos Gulf are the highest reported for the species, suggesting a higher growth rate and a lower longevity. Estimated values for total, natural and fishery mortality were greater in males. In both sexes, an exploitation rate E>0.5 was found, implying an intense fishing impact on M. kerathurus stock in Thermaikos Gulf. Intense exploitation in other parts of the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, along with the replacement of the species by Eritrean penaeid prawns in the eastern Mediterranean, has resulted in a severe reduction in catches, in most countries. Thus, existing stocks of M. kerathurus should be considered as potentially endangered, and species-specific initiatives towards sustainable management of this resource should be implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelicertus kerathurus 3aage structure 3adimorphism 3afemales 3afisheries 3agrowth performance 3alongevity 3amales 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3aresource management 3aseasonal growth 3ashrimp 3asummer 3aAegean Sea 3aGreece 3aTunisia1 aThessalou-Legaki, M.q(Maria),0 tFisheries research.g2011 Jan., v. 107, no. 1-3 p.46-58dElsevier B.V.x0165-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245005200160300001800212520105600230592002801286650001501314650001601329650002501345650002101370650001501391650001501406650000901421650001101430650001301441700002201454700002201476773011201498856007501610852000901685655001201694IND60529100320221119053641.0160717e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052910032DNAL7 a10.1021/ac301136x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, Simon
T.10aAmperometric Noise at Thin Film Band Electrodes  ap. 7744-7749.  aBackground current noise is often a significant limitation when using constant-potential amperometry for biosensor application such as amperometric recordings of transmitter release from single cells through exocytosis. In this paper, we fabricated thin-film electrodes of gold and conductive polymers and measured the current noise in physiological buffer solution for a wide range of different electrode areas. The noise measurements could be modeled by an analytical expression, representing the electrochemical cell as a resistor and capacitor in series. The studies revealed three domains; for electrodes with low capacitance, the amplifier noise dominated, for electrodes with large capacitances, the noise from the resistance of the electrochemical cell was dominant, while in the intermediate region, the current noise scaled with electrode capacitance. The experimental results and the model presented here can be used for choosing an electrode material and dimensions and when designing chip-based devices for low-noise current measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acapacitance 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aexocytosis 3agold 3amodels 3apolymers1 aHeien, Michael L.1 aTaboryski, Rafael0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 84, no. 18 p.7744-7749dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac301136x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245006900154300001600223520172000239592002801959653001701987653002302004653002902027653002202056700002102078700001902099700002002118773011602138856007302254961001202327852000902339655001202348IND60126815820221119023643.0151108e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012681582DNAL7 a10.1603/EN110262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorey, A.

In this study, we characterized the response of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) pupae to low temperatures by using controlled laboratory measurements of supercooling point (SCP), lower lethal temperature (LT₅₀), and lower lethal time (LLTime). The impact of diapause, acclimation, and sex on the cold hardiness of the pupae also were evaluated. Sex did not significantly affect the SCP, LT₅₀, or LLTime. However, the mean SCP of diapausing pupae (-19.3°C) was significantly lower than nondiapausing pupae (-16.4°C). Acclimation of nondiapausing pupae to constant temperatures from 10 to 20°C before supercooling also produced a significantly lower SCP than nondiapausing pupae held at 25°C. The LT₅₀s of nondiapausing and diapausing were not significantly different, but confirmed that H. zea pupae are chill-intolerant because these lethal temperatures are warmer than the corresponding mean SCPs. Diapausing pupae survived longer than nondiapausing pupae at the same, constant, cold temperatures, a finding consistent with the SCP results. Both of these results suggest enhanced cold hardiness in diapausing pupae. When laboratory results were compared with field temperatures and observed distributions of H. zea in the contiguous United States, the laboratory results corroborated what is currently perceived to be the northern overwintering limit of H. zea; approximately the 40ᵗʰ parallel. Moreover, our research showed that areas north of this limit are lethal to overwintering pupae not because of low temperature extremes, but rather the length of time spent at near-zero temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 0acorn earworm 0asupercooling point 0alower lethal temperature 0alower lethal time1 aHutchison, W.

Electron micrograph observations revealed that as-prepared carbon fibers are composed of 40–60 μm long solid and tubular fibers mimicking their natural texture. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction indicated that these carbon fibers are possessing disordered carbon structure with larger interlayer spacing (0.386 nm) than graphite (0.335 nm). These carbon fibers delivered specific reversible capacity of 340 mAh/g at C/10 rate and 300 mAh/g at C/5 rate. Electrochemical performance of as-prepared carbon fibers was further improved by uniform decoration of cobalt oxide particles via solid state thermal processing. CoO–carbon fiber hybrid anode delivered higher reversible capacity, 530 mAh/g at C/10 rate with only 10 mol % of CoO loading. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic effect, namely conductive network of cross-linked carbon fibers and facile electrochemical reaction with deposited monodispersed CoO nanoclusters. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on both carbon fiber and hybrid anodes were conducted to comprehend the lithiation and delithiation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3acarbon fibers 3acarbonization 3acobalt oxide 3acrosslinking 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afungi 3agraphene 3aheat treatment 3alithium batteries 3ananoparticles 3asynergism 3atexture 0aCobalt oxide 0aNanoparticles 0aElectrochemistry 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy 0aCyclic voltammetry 0aSustainability1 aEtacheri, Vinodkumar1 aPol, Vilas G.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 May 02, v. 4, no. 5 p.2624-2631dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b001143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006400142245009200206300001800298500002000316520159800336592002801934650001301962650001101975650001701986650001202003650001902015650002302034650002602057650001602083650002202099650001502121650001102136650001302147650001602160650002102176650001502197650002302212700005902235773012502294856007702419852000902496655001202505IND60788091520221117160716.0220811e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078809152DNAL7 a10.1029/2018WR0241802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Hassaan Furqan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9059-877910aEffect of Hydrogeologic and Climatic Variability on Performance of a Groundwater Market  ap. 4304-4321.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncentive‐based policies, such as the cap‐and‐trade system, have been shown to be useful in the context of groundwater management. This study compares the performance of a groundwater market with water quotas when assumptions of perfect information are violated due to climate change and hydrogeologic heterogeneity and explores how changes in future climate affect market performance. A subbasin of the Republican River Basin, overlying the Ogallala aquifer in the High Plains of the United States, is used as a case study. Building on a previously developed model, a multiagent system model simulating a groundwater market is developed where self‐interested agents can trade water use permits to maximize individual benefits subject to irrigation and land constraints. This economic model is coupled with a calibrated physically based groundwater model for the study region that allows for an evaluation of streamflow depletion impacts, which has been the focus of management efforts in the basin. Results show that trading of permits between farmers results in increased economic benefits and, in some cases, reduced environmental violations. However, the benefits of a groundwater market are distributed unequally resulting in “winners” and “losers” across the system. Future changes in climate are shown to significantly influence farmers willingness to pay for groundwater and thus increase the variation in groundwater price and pumping. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing hydroclimatologic variability and change in the design of groundwater markets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abasins 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aeconometric models 3aenvironmental markets 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3aprices 3aresearch 3astream flow 3awater management 3awatersheds 3awillingness to pay1 aBrown, Casey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8248-041X0 tWater resources research.g2019 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.4304-4321dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR0241803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014200160300002000302520097800322592002801300650001701328650001401345650002301359650001701382650001901399650001401418650001801432650001701450650002601467650000901493700002001502700002201522700001801544700002901562773012301591856007401714852000901788655001201797IND60640515720221119131251.0190504e20160506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064051572DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04068c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZubir, Nor Aida10aGraphene oxide with zinc partially substituted magnetite (GO–Fe₁₋ₓZnₓOy) for the UV-assisted heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction  ap. 44749-44757.  aA series of graphene oxide (GO) and zinc partially substituted magnetite GO–Fe₁₋ₓZnₓOy (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.285) catalysts were synthesised through a precipitation-oxidation method. The rate constants for the degradation of acid orange seven (AO7) proceeded at a significant faster rate under UV-irradiation (up to 670%) than the conventional heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction. The resultant catalysts were mesoporous, so there was no mass transfer limitation for AO7 to access active sites in the catalysts. Further, maximum increases of rate constant up to 220% occurred as the zinc molar concentration increased from x = 0 to x = 0.159. GO enhanced to incorporation of zinc into the combined metal oxide, whilst zinc limited crystal growth, thus forming smaller crystallite sizes. These features proved to be essential for the improved catalytic activity of the resultant catalysts. The optimised zinc molar value at x = 0.159 delivered the best catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystallites 3agraphene oxide 3amagnetite 3amass transfer 3aporous media 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc1 aMotuzas, Julius1 aYacou, Christelle1 aZhang, Xiwang1 aDiniz da Costa, João C.0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 06, v. 6, no. 50 p.44749-44757dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04068c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245006400212300002200276506007600298520101300374592002801387506003701415650001601452650001201468650001101480650001601491653001001507653001001517653002401527653001001551653001601561653001301577653001001590653002601600700001701626773010201643856008301745852000901828655001201837IND60609899520221207130451.0181010e20171130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060989952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.0482doi7 aPMC62196162pmcid7 a291950772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangridge, Paul D.10aEpsin-Dependent Ligand Endocytosis Activates Notch by Force  ap. 1383-1396.e12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDSL ligands activate Notch by inducing proteolytic cleavage of the receptor ectodomain, an event that requires ligand to be endocytosed in signal-sending cells by the adaptor protein Epsin. Two classes of explanation for this unusual requirement are (1) recycling models, in which the ligand must be endocytosed to be modified or repositioned before it binds Notch and (2) pulling models, in which the ligand must be endocytosed after it binds Notch to exert force that exposes an otherwise buried site for cleavage. We demonstrate in vivo that ligands that cannot enter the Epsin pathway nevertheless bind Notch but fail to activate the receptor because they cannot exert sufficient force. This argues against recycling models and in favor of pulling models. Our results also suggest that once ligand binds receptor, activation depends on a competition between Epsin-mediated ligand endocytosis, which induces cleavage, and transendocytosis of the ligand by the receptor, which aborts the incipient signal.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendocytosis 3aligands 3amodels 3aproteolysis 0aNotch 0adelta 0aDSL/Notch signaling 0aepsin 0aendocytosis 0aclathrin 0aforce 0avon Willebrand factor1 aStruhl, Gary0 tCell.g2017 Nov. 30, v. 171, no. 6 p.1383-1396.e12dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011100171300001600282520138800298592002801686650002801714650001001742650002001752650002001772650002401792650002201816650002401838650001101862650002701873650003001900650001501930650001601945650000901961653001701970653001501987653002402002653001602026653001302042653001002055653001602065700002802081700002402109700002402133700001802157700002702175773012402202856008402326852000902410655001202419IND60689871920221122135851.0200424e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068987192DNAL7 a10.3109/1040841X.2011.6409772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurindara Kaura,10aEmerging phytopathogen Macrophomina phaseolina: biology, economic importance and current diagnostic trends  ap. 136-151.  aMacrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. is an important phytopathogenic fungus, infecting a large number of plant species and surviving for up to 15 years in the soil as a saprophyte. Although considerable research related to the biology and ecology of Macrophomina has been conducted, it continues to cause huge economic losses in many crops. Research is needed to improve the identification and characterization of genetic variability within their epidemiological and pathological niches. Better understanding of the variability within the pathogen population for traits that influence fitness and soil survival will certainly lead to improved management strategies for Macrophomina. In this context, the present review discusses various biological aspects and distribution of M. phaseolina throughout the world and their importance to different plant species. Accurate identification of the fungus has been aided with the use of nucleic acid–based molecular techniques. The development of PCR-based methods for identification and detection of M. phaseolina are highly sensitive and specific. Early diagnosis and accurate detection of pathogens is an essential step in plant disease management as well as quarantine. The progress in the development of various molecular tools used for the detection, identification and characterization of Macrophomina isolates were also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3acrops 3adisease control 3aearly diagnosis 3afinancial economics 3agenetic variation 3amicrobial detection 3aniches 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3asaprophytes 3asoil 0aEpidemiology 0afood crops 0aglobal distribution 0astem canker 0ataxonomy 0atoxin 0avariability1 aDhillon, Gurpreet Singh1 aBrar, Satinder Kaur1 aVallad, Gary Edward1 aChand, Ramesh1 aChauhan, Vijay Bahadur0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2012 May 1, v. 38, no. 2 p.136-151dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/1040841X.2011.6409773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015100166300001400317520157100331592002801902650001201930650001001942650001301952650000901965650001101974650002701985650000902012650002402021650001702045650001302062653002602075653001102101653002102112653002402133700001802157700002102175700001802196700002802214700006002242773011802302856008302420852000902503655001202512IND60589716120221118232653.0190405e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058971612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2017.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoroko, Maria12aA Pilot Study Into the Utility of Dynamic Infrared Thermography for Measuring Body Surface Temperature Changes During Treadmill Exercise in Horses  ap. 44-46.  aThe aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of evaluating heat loss from the body surface of horses during exercise on a treadmill using dynamic infrared thermography (IRT). Continuous measurements of body surface temperature change at walk, trot, and during recovery time were collected from five horses using a thermographic camera. Horses were exercised on the treadmill for 25 minutes: 10 minutes of walk, 10 minutes of trot, 5 minutes of walk, and ending with 10 minutes of recovery time. Four thermograms per minute were extracted from the original 30 Hz video sequences for temperature analysis. Four regions of interest (ROIs) were positioned on each analyzed thermographic image including neck (NC), shoulder (SH), chest (CH), and croup area. At baseline, the NC was the hottest ROI, followed by the SH. By the end of the first walk, the temperature at all ROIs had increased, with the NC area remaining the warmest. During the trot, temperature increased for the first 5 minutes, with the greatest increase in temperature in the CH area. During the second walk, the temperatures started to decline in all regions. By the end of the recovery period, temperature had reduced at all regions, with the NC and CH areas demonstrating the biggest drop in temperature. It was found that heat loss from the body surface during exercise can be evaluated by means of dynamic body surface temperature measurement with IRT. More research is now required to fully explore the physiological changes of the equine musculoskeletal system during exercise.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3achest 3aexercise 3aheat 3ahorses 3amusculoskeletal system 3aneck 3asurface temperature 3athermography 3atrotting 0aInfrared thermography 0aEquine 0aThermoregulation 0aSurface temperature1 aHowell, Kevin1 aDudek, Krzysztof1 aWilk, Izabela1 aZastrzeżyńska, Monika1 aJanczarek, Iwona1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9032-88400 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2018 Mar., v. 62 p.44-46dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2017.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245014200163300001400305520174200319592002802061653001502089653002202104653001702126653001002143653002702153700002402180700001602204773011402220856007302334852000902407655001202416IND60126816120221119023646.0151108e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012681612DNAL7 a10.1603/EN111092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Shazly, Mohamed M.10aSeasonal Abundance, Number of Annual Generations, and Effect of an Entomopathogenic Fungus on Phlebotomus papatasi (Diptera: Psychodidae)  ap. 11-19.  aThe monthly density of the sand fly, Phlebotomus Papatasi Scopoli (Diptera: Psychodidae), was monitored during 2009 at Burg El-Arab, a rural district located close to the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. The number of annual generations and the efficacy of microbial control by the entomopathogenic fungus, Metrahizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorok (Ma79), were determined in the laboratory under atmospheric conditions, simulating those of the animal shelters in the study area. We used two collecting techniques; CDC light traps and oiled paper traps, to quantify sand fly density inside houses and in the open field. Adult flies exhibited a seasonal range from April to December. The seasonal pattern was bimodal, with one peak in July and the second one in October. Calculations of the correlation coefficient (r) revealed a significant role of temperature and relative humidity in the monthly abundance of the sand flies in the study area. P. papatasi colony completed seven annual generations under semifield conditions, but the mean developmental time of each immature stage and the mean total duration of development from egg to adult for each generation varied according to the prevailing temperature. The longest generation time was observed in winter (the mean ± SD was 118 ± 11.70 d), and the shortest one occurred at the highest temperatures in summer (the mean ± SD was 25.21 ± 2.04 d). In microbial control studies, the entomopathogenic fungus, M. anisopliae, was used at 15 × 10⁸ spores/g food as a standard dose against the second-instar larvae of P. papatasi at the different seasons during 2009. Mortality reached 100% in winter and decreased to 56.0% as the prevailing temperature increased during the summer season.  aPublisher supplied data 0asand flies 0amonthly abundance 0aBurg El-Arab 0aEgypt 0aMetarhizium anisopliae1 aSoliman, Mustafa M.1 aZayed, Alia0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2012 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.11-19dEntomological Society of Americax0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEN111093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011500170300001600285520189200301592002802193650001302221650000902234650001902243650001602262650001702278650001302295650001702308650001702325650002202342650001102364650002302375650001602398651001002414651001002424651002102434651001302455653001502468653001802483653001802501653002902519700005902548773010702607856008502714852000902799655001202808IND60597317420221120083426.0201202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059731742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Jaein I.10aEfficacy of dust aerosol forecasts for East Asia using the adjoint of GEOS-Chem with ground-based observations  ap. 885-893.  aAsian dust storms occur often and have a great impact on East Asia and the western Pacific in spring. Early warnings based on reliable forecasts of dust storms thus are crucial for protecting human health and industry. Here we explore the efficacy of 4-D variational method-based data assimilation in a chemical transport model for dust storm forecasts in East Asia. We use a 3-D global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and its adjoint model with surface PM₁₀ mass concentration observations. We evaluate the model for several severe dust storm events, which occurred in May 2007 and March 2011 in East Asia. First of all, simulated the PM₁₀ mass concentrations with the forward model showed large discrepancies compared with PM₁₀ mass concentrations observed in China, Korea, and Japan, implying large uncertainties of simulated dust emission fluxes in the source regions. Based on our adjoint model constrained by observations for the whole period of each event, the reproduction of the spatial and temporal distributions of observations over East Asia was substantially improved (regression slopes from 0.15 to 2.81 to 0.85–1.02 and normalized mean biases from −74%–151% to −34%–1%). We then examine the efficacy of the data assimilation system for daily dust storm forecasts based on the adjoint model including previous day observations to update the initial condition of the forward model simulation for the next day. The forecast results successfully captured the spatial and temporal variations of ground-based observations in downwind regions, indicating that the data assimilation system with ground-based observations effectively forecasts dust storms, especially in downwind regions. However, the efficacy is limited in nearby the dust source regions, including Mongolia and North China, due to the lack of observations for constraining the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3adust 3adust emissions 3adust storms 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3aparticulates 3areproduction 3asimulation models 3aspring 3atemporal variation 3auncertainty 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aMongolia 0aAsian dust 0aDust forecast 0aAdjoint model 0aChemical transport model1 aPark, Rokjin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8922-02340 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Mar., v. 234 p.885-893dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04692naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245015500186300001600341520264800357592002803005650001803033650002603051650001303077650001203090650001103102650001403113650002303127650003003150650002503180650000903205650002303214650001003237650001603247650001703263650001203280650001203292650001603304650001003320650002903330650001403359650001203373650001203385650005603397650003003453650003503483650001103518650002403529650003703553650002603590650002003616651001103636651001803647651001103665651001803676700002403694700003203718700002403750700002403774700002403798773011503822856004803937852000903985655001203994IND4485471820221118101336.0120529e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448547182DNAL7 a225809062pmid7 a10.1007/s11626-012-9496-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrasela, James J.10aDevelopment of cell lines from the cactophagous insect: Cactoblastis cactorum (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and their susceptibility to three baculoviruses  ap. 293-300.  aThe unintentional introduction of the cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum, a successful biological control agent formerly employed in the control of invasive prickly pear cactus species (Opuntia spp.) in Australia, Hawaii, South Africa, and various Caribbean islands, has posed great concern as to the possible threat to native, endangered species of cactus in the southeastern USA as well as with the potential to cause a major infestation of commercial and agricultural cactus crops in Mexico. A number of control measures have been investigated with varying degrees of success including, field exploration for cactus moth-specific parasitoids, insecticides, fungal, bacterial, and nematode agents. Current tactics used by the USA–Mexico binational program to eradicate cactus moth from Mexico and mitigate its westward movement in the USA include host plant removal, the manual removal and destruction of egg sticks and infected cacti stems, and the Sterile Insect Technique. One other approach not taken until now is the development of a cactus moth cell line as a tool to facilitate the investigation of baculoviruses as an alternative biocontrol method for the cactus moth. Consequently, we established C. cactorum cell lines derived from adult ovarian tissue designated as BCIRL-Cc-AM and BCIRL-Cc-JG. The mean cell population doubling time was 204.3 and 112 h for BCIRL-Cc-AM and BCIRL-Cc-JG, respectively, with weekly medium change, while the doubling time was 176.6 and 192.6 h for BCIRL-Cc-AM and BCIRL-Cc-JG, respectively, with a daily change of medium. In addition, the daily versus weekly change in medium was reflected in the percentage viability with both cell lines showing higher levels with a daily medium change. Of the three baculoviruses tested, only the recombinant AcMNPV-hsp70Red and GmMNPV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 were able to demonstrate significant production of extracellular virus (ECV) in each of the cell lines, whereas both cell lines were refractive to an HzSNPV challenge at an MOI of 10. In this study, we have demonstrated both the successful development of a C. cactorum cell line and its ability to support a complete baculovirus infection. The potential is also there to pursue further investigations to determine the susceptibility of the cactus moth cell line to other viruses. Additionally, the availability of a cactus moth cell line will facilitate the analysis of viruses prior to using the more expensive bioassay test. Finally, it is hoped with the knowledge presented here that baculoviruses may also be considered as an alternative biocontrol method for the cactus moth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaculoviridae 3aCactoblastis cactorum 3aNematoda 3aOpuntia 3aadults 3abioassays 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acacti and succulents 3aeggs 3aendangered species 3afungi 3ahost plants 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3aislands 3aparasitoids 3astems 3asterile insect technique 3aviability 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aBaculoviridaexgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aBiological Control Agents 2aCell Linexcytologyxvirology. 2aFemale 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLepidopteraxcytologyxvirology. 2aOpuntiaxparasitology 2aOvaryxcytology 3aMexico 3aUnited States 0aMexico 0aUnited States1 aMcIntosh, Arthur H.1 aRingbauer, Joseph, Jr.cJr.1 aGoodman, Cynthia L.1 aCarpenter, James E.1 aPopham, Holly J.

Although the prelimbic cortex (PL, part of medial prefrontal cortex) has been implicated in social behavior, it is not clear which neurons are relevant or how they contribute. We found that PL contains anatomically and molecularly distinct subpopulations that target three downstream regions that have been implicated in social behavior: the nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. Activation of NAc-projecting PL neurons (PL-NAc), but not the other subpopulations, decreased the preference for a social target. To determine what information PL-NAc neurons convey, we selectively recorded from them and found that individual neurons were active during social investigation, but only in specific spatial locations. Spatially specific manipulation of these neurons bidirectionally regulated the formation of a social-spatial association. Thus, the unexpected combination of social and spatial information within the PL-NAc may contribute to social behavior by supporting social-spatial learning.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamygdala 3acortex 3alearning 3amammals 3aneurons 3aprefrontal cortex 3asocial behavior 3aspatial data 0asocial behavior 0amedial prefrontal cortex 0anucleus accumbens 0acalcium imaging 0aoptogenetics1 aJang, Hee Jae1 aPark, Michelle1 aMiller, Ellia M.1 aCox, Julia1 aTaliaferro, Joshua P.1 aParker, Nathan F.1 aBhave, Varun1 aHur, Hong1 aLiang, Yupu1 aNectow, Alexander R.1 aPillow, Jonathan W.1 aWitten, Ilana B.0 tCell.g2017 Dec. 14, v. 171, no. 7 p.1663-1677.e16dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245011700180520206100297592002802358650002002386650001202406650002002418650002202438650001902460650000902479650001602488650001502504650002002519650001902539650001902558650001902577650000902596650001302605650001502618651001202633653001202645653001802657653001502675653001302690653001502703653002002718653000802738653000802746653000802754653000802762700006302770700002302833700005502856700001502911700001802926773009102944856009003035852000903125655001203134IND60791531420221119015636.0220906e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079153142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1361402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLescord, Gretchen L.14aThe speciation of arsenic in the muscle tissue of inland and coastal freshwater fish from a remote boreal region  aElevated concentrations of total arsenic (As) have been reported in boreal freshwater fish in both human-impacted and relatively pristine areas. We assessed the arsenic speciation profiles in muscle tissue of six fish species (n = 300) sampled from nine locations across a remote freshwater watershed in northern Ontario, Canada, extending from inland headwater lakes to the coastal marine confluence. Of the five arsenic species measured, only arsenobetaine (AsB) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were detected in these fish. Riverine fish had up to 10-fold higher total [As] when compared to lacustrine fish. On average, these riverine fish also had higher percentages of AsB (%AsB, 60 ± 26%) and lower percentages of unmeasured arsenic (%UNM, 20 ± 21%), compared to lacustrine fish (28 ± 18% and 52 ± 21% %AsB and %UNM, respectively). DMA percentages (%DMA) were relatively consistent across the watershed, averaging 20 ± 21% across all fish. We examined ecological drivers of As speciation and found that %AsB increased slightly with fish weight in large-body predatory fish, but not in forage fish or insectivores. Furthermore, %AsB was positively related to trophic elevation (inferred from δ¹⁵N) in lacustrine fish across 3 out of 4 communities and within some populations. Lastly, riverine fish with a more marine-based diet had markedly higher %AsB when compared to fish with more freshwater-based diets, indicating an effect of anadromy on arsenic speciation. Overall, knowledge on arsenic speciation in freshwater fish has been limited and these results indicate potential drivers that can be considered in future studies. Furthermore, the absence of toxic inorganic As species in these boreal fish is an important consideration for future environmental monitoring practices and risk assessments, some of which assume 10–20% of total [As] in fish is present as toxic inorganic As. Additional studies on As bioaccumulation and biotransformation are needed in freshwater systems, particularly at the base of aquatic food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanadromous fish 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3acacodylic acid 3adiet 3aforage fish 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3amuscle tissues 3apredatory fish 3ariparian areas 3arisk 3atoxicity 3awatersheds 3aOntario 0aArsenic 0aArsenobetaine 0aSpeciation 0aAnadromy 0aFreshwater 0aStable isotopes 0aAsB 0aDMA 0aMMA 0aiAs1 aJohnston, Thomas A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2414-17241 aPonton, Dominic E.1 aAmyot, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0340-32491 aLock, Alan1 aGunn, John M.0 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136140-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1361403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03940naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245012000192300001600312520201500328592002802343650001802371650003202389650001902421650001302440650001102453650003302464650001202497650001402509650001802523650001202541650005402553650001002607650002102617650003802638650004102676650001602717650002802733650001402761650003202775650002602807650002902833650002702862653001602889653001902905653001702924653001402941700002102955700002402976700002203000700002503022700002403047700002203071773013903093856008503232852000903317655001203326IND50069099020221121051719.0190416e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006909902DNAL7 a240122992pmid7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2013.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDal-Forno, Manuela10aStarting from scratch: Evolution of the lichen thallus in the basidiolichen Dictyonema (Agaricales: Hygrophoraceae)  ap. 584-598.  aPhylogenetic studies indicate that the basidiolichen genus Dictyonema s.lat., often thought to represent only a single genus with few species, includes several well-supported genus-level clades, all of which form associations with a unique lineage of obligately lichenized cyanobacteria (Rhizonema). In an attempt to elucidate the evolution and genus- and species-level diversification in Dictyonema s.lat., we generated 68 new sequences of the nuclear large subunit rDNA (nuLSU), the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and the RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2), for 29 species-level lineages representing all major clades of Dictyonema s.lat. and most of the species currently known. The multilocus phylogeny obtained via maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches indicates the presence of five genus-level groups: a basal clade, Cyphellostereum, that is sister to the rest of the species, a paraphyletic grade representing Dictyonema s.str., and three clades representing the genera Acantholichen, Cora, and Corella. To determine the evolutionary transformations of the lichenized thallus in the group, ancestral character state reconstruction was done using six characters (lichenisation, thallus type, cortex type, hyphal sheath and haustorial type, photobiont morphology, and basidiocarp type). Our analysis indicates a progressive development of the lichenized thallus from loosely organized filamentous crusts with separate, cyphelloid basidiocarps in Cyphellostereum, to filamentous crusts with derived hyphal sheath and cyphelloid–stereoid basidiocarps partially incorporated into the lichen thallus in Dictyonema, to squamulose–foliose thalli with corticioid basidiocarps entirely supported by the lichen thallus in Cora. These results indicate a remarkable evolutionary integration of lichenized and reproductive tissues in Dictyonema s.lat., supporting the hypothesis that, at least in this case, lichenized thalli may have evolved from reproductive structures in their nonlichenized ancestors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aHygrophoraceae 3aancestry 3acortex 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alichens 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3athallus 2aAgaricalesxclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aBiota 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA Polymerase IIxgenetics 2aRNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aBasidiocarp 0aBasidiolichens 0aCyanolichens 0aMushrooms1 aLawrey, James D.1 aSikaroodi, Masoumeh1 aBhattarai, Smriti1 aGillevet, Patrick M.1 aSulzbacher, Marcelo1 aLücking, Robert,0 tFungal biology.g2013 Sept., v. 117, no. 9 p.584-598dElsevier LtdaThe British Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2013.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012900165520177900294592002802073650002102101650001602122650002002138650001902158650001302177650000902190650001802199650001002217650001202227650002602239650001502265650001102280650001502291650001802306650002402324650001302348650002102361650002302382650001702405650001002422651002902432700002602461773012202487856008102609852000902690655001202699IND60702039520221120081034.0200717e20200212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070203952DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100202622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiebman, Matt 10aCropping System Redesign for Improved Weed Management: A Modeling Approach Illustrated with Giant Ragweed (Ambrosia trifida)  aWeeds present important challenges to both conventional farmers who rely on herbicides and organic farmers who rely on cultivation. Data from field experiments indicate that diversifying crop sequences with additional species can improve weed suppression when either herbicides or cultivation serve as primary control tactics. Here, we report the results of modeling analyses that investigated how cropping system diversification would affect the population dynamics of giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida L.), an annual dicotyledonous species that is problematic in the central U.S. for both conventional and organic farmers. We found that to prevent an increase in giant ragweed density, the minimum control efficacy needed from herbicides or cultivation used in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) would be 99.0% in a 2-year corn–soybean system, but 91.4% in a 5-year corn–soybean–rye (Secale cereale L.)–alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) system. Thus, the diversified rotation would be better buffered against less-than-perfect weed control during corn and soybean phases. Further modeling analyses indicated that the weed suppression effect associated with greater rotation length was attributable not only to increased crop species richness but also to greater temporal variation in planting dates. A planting interval variation index (PIVI), calculated as the coefficient of variation in months between planting activities, was strongly associated with the weed suppressive ability of the rotations we modeled and may be a useful metric for designing other cropping systems. Overall, our results indicate that diversified rotation systems that include both annual and perennial crops are likely to be valuable for managing problematic weed species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbrosia trifida 3aGlycine max 3aMedicago sativa 3aSecale cereale 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3aherbicides 3amodels 3aperennials 3aplanting date 3apopulation dynamics 3asoybeans 3aspecies richness 3atemporal variation 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aMidwestern United States1 aNichols, Virginia A.,0 tAgronomy.g2020 Feb. 12, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100202623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002500158245007100183300001800254520163900272592002801911650002501939650002701964650001401991650001102005650001302016650001602029650002002045650001202065700001902077773010402096856007302200852000902273655001202282IND50090666320150206000000.0150206e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009066632DNAL7 a246019892pmid7 a10.1111/jeb.123432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamran‐Disfani, A.10aSelfing, adaptation and background selection in finite populations  ap. 1360-1371.  aClassic deterministic genetic models of the evolution of selfing predict species should be either completely outcrossing or completely selfing. However, even species considered high selfers outcross to a small degree (e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans). This discrepancy between theory and data may exist because the classic models ignore the effects of drift interacting with selection, that is, Hill–Robertson effects. High selfing rates make the effective rate of recombination near zero, which is expected to cause the build‐up of negative disequilibria in finite populations. Despite the transmission advantage associated with complete selfing, low levels of outcrossing may be favoured because of the benefits of increasing the effective rate of recombination to dissipate negative disequilibria. Using multilocus simulations, we confirm that selfing reduces effective population size through background selection and causes negative disequilibria between selected sites. Consequently, the rate of adaptation is substantially reduced in strong selfers. When selfing rate is allowed to evolve, populations evolve to be either strong outcrossers or strong selfers, depending on the parameter values. Amongst selfers, low, but nonzero, levels of outcrossing can be maintained by selection even when all mutations are deleterious; more outcrossing is maintained with higher rates of deleterious mutation. The addition of beneficial mutations can (i) lead to a quantitative increase in the degree of outcrossing amongst stronger selfers but (ii) may cause outcrossing species to evolve into stronger selfers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aevolution 3amodels 3amutation 3aoutcrossing 3apopulation size 3aselfing1 aAgrawal, A.

Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to evaluate the prospects of RuBisCO from widely cultivated cereals (rice, barley, wheat, oat, sorghum, corn) as sources of bioactive peptides, and results were compared to commonly consumed proteins. The large and small RuBisCO subunits were found to contain several bioactive peptides with biological functions relevant to the management and treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, specifically inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV, antioxidative property and activation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Due to high sequence homology, there was negligible difference in occurrence frequency of bioactive peptides within large RuBisCO subunits unlike small subunits, which produced more diverse profiles of bioactive peptides among the cereals. The cereal RuBisCO displayed similar or better prospects as other food proteins except milk proteins, thereby providing cheaper and sustainable precursors of bioactive peptides. Simulated enzymatic hydrolysis of RuBisCO subunits indicated that thermolysin and papain had preferred cleavage patterns for releasing the cryptic peptides compared to gastrointestinal proteases. These findings will contribute towards utilization of RuBisCO as alternative sources of peptide-based nutraceuticals for human health promotion.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3abioinformatics 3awheat 3apeptides 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3abarley 3agastrointestinal system 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3afunctional foods 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aproteolysis 3acorn 3adiabetes 3aantioxidant activity 3apapain 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3amilk proteins 3aoats 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3asequence homology 0aFood proteins 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aRuBisCO 0aIn silico 0aCryptic bioactive peptides 0adietary protein1 aGong, Min1 aWu, Sihong0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 48 p.1794-1799dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2013.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245012800205300002000333506007600353520147300429592002801902506003701930650002801967650001701995650001002012650001702022650001002039650001802049650001902067650002902086650001402115650001302129650001402142653001402156653002102170653001702191653001802208653002502226700001702251700001902268773019402287856007902481852000902560655001202569IND60230346820221207121317.0150614e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023034682DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14212291122doi7 aPMC43719272pmcid7 a257338512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCondé, João,10aImplantable hydrogel embedded dark-gold nanoswitch as a theranostic probe to sense and overcome cancer multidrug resistance  ap. E1278-E1287.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells is a substantial limitation to the success of chemotherapy. Here, we describe facile means to overcome resistance by silencing the multidrug resistance protein 1 ( MRP1 ), before chemotherapeutic drug delivery in vivo with a single local application. Our platform contains hydrogel embedded with dark-gold nanoparticles modified with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-intercalated nanobeacons that serve as an ON/OFF molecular nanoswitch triggered by the increased MRP1 expression within the tumor tissue microenvironment. This nanoswitch can sense and overcome MDR prior to local drug release. The nanobeacons comprise a 5-FU intercalated DNA hairpin, which is labeled with a near-infrared (NIR) dye and a dark-quencher. The nanobeacons are designed to open and release the intercalated drug only upon hybridization of the DNA hairpin to a complementary target, an event that restores fluorescence emission due to nanobeacons conformational reorganization. Despite the cross-resistance to 5-FU, more than 90% tumor reduction is achieved in vivo in a triple-negative breast cancer model following 80% MRP1 silencing compared with the continuous tumor growth following only drug or nanobeacon administration. Our approach can be applied to reverse cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutic drugs and restore treatment efficacy. As a universal nanotheranostic probe, this platform can pave the way to early cancer detection and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiocompatible materials 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3agene therapy 3agenes 3ahydrocolloids 3aimage analysis 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aremission 0ahydrogels 0agold nanobeacons 0atheranostics 0abreast cancer 0amultidrug resistance1 aOliva, Nuria1 aArtzi, Natalie0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 112, no. 11 p.E1278-E1287dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14212291123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009600169300001800265520078400283592002801067650001101095650001201106650001301118650002301131650002401154650001701178650001301195653002201208653003201230653001201262653001801274653001201292700002101304773008701325856008501412852000901497655001201506IND60114029620221119222929.0161024e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011402962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Chi-yŏn,10aRemoval of residual methylene chloride from homoharringtonine by pre-treatment with ethanol  ap. 1809-1813.  aIn this study, methylene chloride, which is a residual solvent in final purified homoharringtonine, was removed effectively through pre-treatment with ethanol.

To date, few studies have surveyed specifically for Siricidae, and many reports of native siricid populations are byproducts of sampling efforts targeting Coleoptera. We report results from a survey targeted specifically at native and exotic Siricidae in Minnesota. We used Lindgren funnel traps from 2006 to 2008 baited with αα /ββ-pinene (Sirex lure), ethanol (EtOH), EtOH + αα-pinene, or Ips 3-part lures. We captured 704 native Siricidae comprising seven species, of which none were exotic. To our knowledge, this is one of the largest field collections of Siricidae from a single discrete set of localities in existence. Adult Siricidae began flying in June and continued into October each year. The αα/ββ-pinene lure was most effective, but the EtOH + αα-pinene lure was also moderately effective. We compare our data with those from several states and provinces in the Great Lakes Region of North America. Our data provide insight into the community composition of native Siricidae in Minnesota, while concurrently providing evidence that S. noctilio populations have not yet reached this far into the continental United States.  aPublisher supplied data 0afunnel traps 0aPinus 0aSirex 0aTremex 0aUrocerus1 aPfammatter, Jesse A.1 aJourney, Ann M.1 aPahs, Tiffany L.1 aCervenka, Valerie J.1 aKoch, Robert L.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2012 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.91-97dEntomological Society of Americax0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEN111923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015100168300001600319520119400335592002801529650001201557650001601569650001501585650001901600650001601619650001401635650001401649650000901663650001701672650001001689650001401699700001901713700002101732773007801753856008401831852000901915655001201924IND60096436320221116222858.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009643632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasiraman, G.10aPerformance, emission and combustion improvements in a direct injection diesel engine using cashew nut shell oil as fuel with camphor oil blending  ap. 116-124.  aThe usage of neat cashew nut shell oil (CSNO) as a fuel in direct injection diesel engine suffers from the problems of incomplete combustion and low brake thermal efficiency due to high viscosity. To overcome this problem, the CSNO was blended with camphor oil (CMPRO) which is less viscous and burns readily, in various proportions by volume. These blends were tested in a single cylinder 1500 rpm, 5.2 kW, direct injection diesel engine fitted with eddy current dynamometer. The performance, emission and combustion characteristics were studied at various loads on the engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm and compared with neat CSNO and diesel fuel operations. Among the blends 30% camphor oil blend with CSNO (CMPRO 30), shows good performance on par with diesel fuel operation with respect to brake thermal efficiency and heat release rate at full load. The brake thermal efficiency of CMPRO 30 is 29.1% compared to base diesel engine brake thermal efficiency of 30.14%. The CMPRO 30 emits 1040 ppm of NO, while diesel emits 1068 ppm. The neat CSNO emits 983 ppm of NO. The smoke emissions are 4.22, 3.91, and 3.64 Bosch Smoke Unit for CSNO, CMPRO 30 and diesel, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acamphor 3acashew nuts 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3afuel oils 3aheat 3anitric oxide 3asmoke 3aviscosity1 aNagalingam, B.1 aBalakrishnan, M.0 tEnergy.g2012 Nov., v. 47, no. 1 p.116-124dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009100172300001600263500001400279520088600293592002801179650003101207650003001238650001501268650002101283650001001304650002301314650001801337650002901355650001701384650002001401650001701421650001401438653001701452653001601469700002201485700002801507700002001535700002201555773012501577856008401702852000901786655001201795IND60689872620221122173852.0200424e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068987262DNAL7 a10.3109/1040841X.2011.6535502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonawane, Avinash10aRole of glycans and glycoproteins in disease development by Mycobacterium tuberculosis  ap. 250-266.  aNAL-light  aGlycoproteins play a critical role in host–pathogen interactions, antigenicity, and virulence determination, and are therefore, considered as potential drug targets. The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), dominantly contains sugars and lipids. Despite the efforts taken by the World Health Organization to reduce the incidence rate, the prevalence of TB is increasing in certain regions. This is mainly attributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Factors that contribute to Mtb virulence and antigenicity remain elusive. However, several studies have shown that sugars and lipids are mainly responsible for Mtb pathogenesis and resistance to numerous drugs. This review gives insight into the role of glycoproteins in mycobacterium pathogenesis, disease development, and its implications in drug development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aWorld Health Organization 3acell walls 3adrug development 3adrugs 3aetiological agents 3aglycoproteins 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogenesis 3apolysaccharides 3atuberculosis 3avirulence 0aMycobacteria 0adrug target1 aMohanty, Soumitra1 aJagannathan, Lakshmanan1 aBekolay, Ashley1 aBanerjee, Sulagna0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 38, no. 3 p.250-266dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/1040841X.2011.6535503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245016300169520151500332592002801847650001601875650001001891650001001901650001501911650001301926650001601939650001301955653003701968653003302005653002602038653004802064653001802112700005802130700001402188700001502202700001402217700001702231700001902248773009102267856009002358852000902448655001202457IND60791531720221119015350.0220906e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079153172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1361442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Zehua10aFacile synthesis of waste-based CdS-loaded hierarchically porous geopolymer for adsorption-photocatalysis of organic contamination and its environmental risks  aIn order to obtain an adsorbent-photocatalyst with low-cost, strong stability and great reusability/recyclability, a waste-based and CdS-loaded hierarchically porous geopolymer (HPG) was prepared by facile synthesis. The adsorption-photocatalysis ability, reusability, and stability of HPG under different conditions were determined. Results indicated that HPG showed better adsorption-photocatalysis performance for organic dyes under alkaline environment, and it remained a high adsorption-photocatalysis efficiency after used for five times. Furthermore, HPG was stable in different environment conditions (strong acidic, acid raining, neutral, high salinity, and high alkali environment). The mass loss of HPG were around 3.22–6.68% (7 days extraction), and the immobilization rates of Cd²⁺ in neutral, high salinity, and high alkali environments were higher than 99.99%. Under visible light irradiation, HPG effectively photo-degraded the organic substances in overlying water of polluted sediments. After 330 min irradiation, the concentrations of COD and TOC were decreased from 47.52 mg/L and 20.9 mg/L to 16.58 mg/L and 11.19 mg/L, respectively. The humic-like and fulvic-like substances were transformed to protein-like substances under photo-degradation effect. This study confirmed that HPG possesses advantages in cost, chemical stability, and reusability, and it has a great potential to be used as in-situ remediation environmental functional material for organic contaminants in lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3airradiation 3alakes 3alight 3aphotolysis 3apolymers 3aremediation 3asalinity 0aHierarchically porous geopolymer 0aVisible light photocatalysis 0aContaminated sediment 0aThree-dimensional fluorescence spectrometry 0aReutilization1 aYang, Xiaohuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8257-37391 aQi, Xinyu1 aZhang, Hao1 aZhang, Yu1 aXia, Xinghui1 aPei, Yuansheng0 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136144-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1361443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015800160300001800318520044800336592002800784650001200812650001500824650001100839650002300850650001700873700001700890700002300907700001800930700001900948700002000967773013200987856007501119852000901194655001201203IND60776341120221121034931.0220505e20220503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077634112DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cc01518h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatri, Hari R.10aGeneration of formaldehyde and formaldehyde-d₂ for hydroxymethylations and hydroxydeuteromethylations of difluoroenolates and difluorobenzyl carbanions  ap. 5490-5493.  aA method for the in situ production of formaldehyde from dimethylsulfoxide, bromine, and cesium carbonate is reported for reactions with difluoroenolates and difluorobenzyl carbanions.

Active P. populiella moths caught in spring and summer supercooled to an average temperature of -16°C, whereas dormant moths excavated from hibernacula in the leaf litter during fall and winter supercooled to an average of -32°C. None of the moths survived freezing in the laboratory. Counts of overwintering moths in leaf litter across microhabitats in interior Alaska demonstrated that moths occurred at significantly higher density beneath white spruce trees than beneath the aspen host, several other hardwood species, or in open areas among trees. During winter, the temperature 1–2 cm below the surface of the leaf litter beneath white spruce trees was on average 7–9°C colder than beneath aspen trees, and we estimate that during at least one period of the winter the temperature under some white spruce trees may have been cold enough to cause mortality. However, the leaf litter under white spruce trees was significantly drier than the litter from other microhabitats, which may assist P. populiella moths to avoid inoculative freezing because of physical contact with ice. We conclude that in interior Alaska, P. populiella overwinter in a supercooled state within leaf litter mainly under nonhost trees, and may prefer relatively dry microhabitats over moister ones at the expense of lower environmental temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaspen leaf miner 0aPopulus tremuloides 0aoverwintering 0asupercooling 0amicrohabitat preference1 aDoak, Patricia1 aSformo, Todd1 aSteiner, Paige M.1 aCarlson, Bryan0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2012 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.180-187dEntomological Society of Americax0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEN111933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03841naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011200170300001600282520188200298592002802180650002302208650001302231650001202244650001202256650001102268650001302279650001102292650002002303650001302323650000902336650001102345650001402356650001802370650001102388650002702399650002402426650002302450650001402473650001102487650001702498650001702515650001802532650001502550650000902565651001102574653002602585653001902611653001802630653001902648700005902667700005902726700006202785700006002847700002102907700003402928700002702962773010802989856008503097852000903182655001203191IND60597317820221120083530.0190613e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059731782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.04.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Gall, Marion10aInvestigating the metal contamination of sediment transported by the 2016 Seine River flood (Paris, France)  ap. 125-139.  aFine sediment transport in rivers is exacerbated during flood events. These particles may convey various contaminants (i.e. metals, pathogens, industrial chemicals, etc.), and significantly impact water quality. The exceptional June 2016 flood of the Seine River (catchment area: 65 000 km2, France), potentially mobilized and deposited contaminated materials throughout the Paris region. Flood sediment deposits (n = 29) were collected along the Seine River and its main tributaries upstream (Yonne, Loing and Marne Rivers) and downstream of Paris (Oise and Eure Rivers). Fallout radionuclides (137Cs, 7Be) were measured to characterize the sources of the material transiting the river, while trace elements (e.g. Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, Cd, Sb, Pb, Tl, Ag) and stable lead isotopes (206Pb/207Pb) were analyzed to quantify the contamination of sediment transported during the flood. In upper sections of the Seine River, sediment mainly originated from the remobilization of particles with a well-balanced contribution of surface and subsurface sources. In the upstream tributaries, sediment almost exclusively originated from the remobilization of subsurface particles. In Paris and downstream of Paris, recently eroded particles and surface sources dominated, suggesting particles were mainly supplied by urban runoff and the erosion of agricultural soils. The highest metal concentrations and Enrichment Factors (EF) were found in the sediment collected in the Loing, Orge and Yvette upstream tributaries. Although these inputs were diluted in the Seine River, an increase in elemental concentrations was observed, progressing downstream through Paris. However, EFs in sediment collected along the Seine River were lower or in the same range of values sampled over the last several decades, reflecting the progressive decontamination of the urbanized Seine River basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acesium 3achromium 3acopper 3adecontamination 3aisotopes 3alead 3anickel 3apathogens 3aradionuclides 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediment deposition 3asediment transport 3asediments 3asilver 3aurban runoff 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aFrance 0aFallout radionuclides 0aTrace elements 0aLead isotopes 0aFingerprinting1 aAyrault, Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8320-69171 aEvrard, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3503-65431 aLaceby, J.

However, the selective and sensitive detection of volatile aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, which are extremely toxic and harmful, using oxide chemiresistors remains challenging because of the molecular stability of benzene rings containing chemicals. Moreover, the performance of the sensing materials is insufficient to detect trace concentration levels of volatile aromatic compounds, which lead to harmful effects on human beings. Here, the strategies for designing highly selective and sensitive volatile aromatic compound gas sensors using oxide chemiresistors were suggested and reviewed. Key approaches include the use of thermal activation, design of sensing materials with high catalytic activity, the utilization of catalytic microreactors and bilayer structures with catalytic overlayer, and the pretreatment of analyte gases or post analysis of sensing signals. In addition, future perspectives from the viewpoint of designing sensing materials and sensor structures for high-performance and robust volatile aromatic compounds gas sensors are provided. Finally, we discuss possible applications of the sensors and sensor arrays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abenzene 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3aethanol 3aformaldehyde 3ahumans 3anitrogen dioxide 3atoluene 3atoxicity 3axylene1 aKim, Ki Beom1 aJeong, Seong-Yong1 aLee, Jong-Heun0 tChemical communications.g2022 May 3, v. 58, no. 36 p.5439-5454dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2cc01563c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002400156245011900180300001600299520098900315592002801304650002101332650000901353650001901362650001001381650001201391650001201403650003001415650002001445700002501465700002501490700002101515700002301536700002001559773011701579856009001696990002301786852000901809655001201818IND60094949020221120054127.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009494902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2010.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhary, Anuradha10aApplication of hypertonic Sabouraud glucose agar for differentiation of Candida dubliniensis from Candida albicans  ap. 440-442.  aAn evaluation of hypertonic Sabouraud glucose agar (SGA) with 6.5% NaCl for phenotypic differentiation of Candida dubliniensis from Candida albicans is reported. Identity of the test fungi (C. albicans, 84; C. dubliniensis, 18) was based on their typical phenotypic characteristics and confirmed by a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction that targets the novel C. dubliniensis group I intron in the large ribosomal subunit. At 96 h of incubation at 28 °C, all of the 84 C. albicans isolates showed growth on hypertonic SGA contrary to the consistently negative results with the 20 C. dubliniensis isolates. In strong contrast, chlamydospore formation on Staib agar yielded 10 (11.9%) false-positive results and 74 (88%) of the test C. albicans isolates showed false-negative results at 45 °C.

However, no in vitro test is currently accepted for the differentiation of ocular irritants (GHS Category 2) and non-irritants (GHS No Category). Human reconstructed tissue models have been suggested for incorporation into a tiered testing strategy to ultimately replace the Draize rabbit eye irritation test (OECD TG 405). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the EpiOcular™ reconstructed cornealike tissue model and the COLIPA pre-validated EpiOcular Eye Irritation Test (EpiOcular-EIT) could be used as suitable components of this testing strategy. The in-house validation of the EpiOcular-EIT was performed by using 60 test substances, including a broad variety of chemicals and formulations for which in vivo data (from the Draize rabbit eye irritation test) were available. The test substances fell into the following categories: 18 severe irritants/corrosives (Category 1), 21 irritants (Category 2), and 21 non-irritants (No Category). Test substances that decreased tissue viability to = 60% (compared to the negative control tissue) were considered to be eye irritants (Category 1/2). Test substances resulting in tissue viability of > 60% were considered to be non-irritants (No Category). For the assessed dataset and the classification cut-off of 60% viability, the EpiOcular-EIT provided 98% and 84% sensitivity, 64% and 90% specificity, and 85% and 86% overall accuracy for the literature reference and BASF proprietary substances, respectively. Applying a 50% tissue viability cut-off to distinguish between irritants and non-irritants resulted in 93% and 82% sensitivity, 68% and 100% specificity, and 84% and 88% accuracy for the literature reference and BASF proprietary substances, respectively. Further, in the EpiOcular-EIT (60% cut-off), 100% of severely irritating substances under-predicted by the BCOP assay were classified as Category 1/2. The results obtained in this study, based on 60 test substances, indicate that the EpiOcular-EIT and the BCOP assay can be combined in a testing strategy to identify strong/severe eye irritants (Category 1), moderate and mild eye irritants (Category 2), and non-irritants (No Category) in routine testing. In particular, when the bottom-up strategy with the 60% viability cut-off was employed, none of the severely irritating substances (Category 1) were under-predicted to be non-irritant. Sensitivity for Category 1/2 substances was 100% for literature reference substances and 89% for BASF SE proprietary substances.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acattle 3acornea 3adata collection 3aeye irritation 3ahumans 3alaboratory animals 3amodels 3aopacity 3apermeability 3arabbits 3aviability1 aKandárová, Helena1 aWareing, Britta1 avan Ravenzwaay, Bennard1 aLandsiedel, Robert0 tATLA.

In addition, the level of extracytoplasmic polyphosphates (polyP related to the cell wall) was determined to understand the polyP physiological role in Hg-treated algal cells. The results showed that the polyP level was higher in the strain CC-125 compared to CC-503. When algal cells were exposed to 1 and 3 μM of Hg, the accumulation of Hg was correlated with the degradation of polyP for both strains. These results suggested that the degradation of polyP participated in the sequestration of Hg. In fact, this mechanism might explain at 72 h the recovery of the polyP level, the efficiency of maximum PSII quantum yield, the low inhibition of growth rate, and the low accumulated Hg in algal biomass. Under the effect of 5 and 7 μM of Hg, the degradation of polyP was complete and could not be recovered, which was caused by a high accumulation and toxicity of Hg already at 24 h. Our results demonstrated that the change of polyP level was correlated with the accumulation and effect of Hg on algal cells during 24–72 h, which can be used as a biomarker of Hg toxicity. Therefore, this study suggested that extracytoplasmic polyP in C. reinhardtii contributed to the cellular tolerance for Hg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aalgae 3abiomarkers 3abiomass 3acell walls 3amercury 3amonitoring 3amutants 3aphotosystem II 3apolyphosphates 3atoxicity 0aMercury 0aPolyphosphate 0aExtracytoplasmic polyP 0aGreen algae 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii1 aDewez, David0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Sept., v. 240 p.506-513dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.04.1413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245021800167300001400385520145300399592002801852650001101880650001601891650001001907650001101917650001201928650001401940650001301954651001001967651001701977653001601994653001702010653001802027653001402045653001102059653002202070700001802092700001702110700001602127700001402143700001602157700001902173700001202192700001502204700001502219700001502234773009602249856008602345852000902431655001202440IND60606814620221120072042.0180730e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060681462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Liyun10aDevelopment of the alluvial and lacustrine terraces on the northern margin of the Hetao Basin, Inner Mongolia, China: Implications for the evolution of the Yellow River in the Hetao area since the late Pleistocene  ap. 87-98.  aTerrace formation processes can reflect the evolution of large rivers. The Hetao Basin is a floodplain of the Yellow River, and there are two to three terraces that extend E–W on the northern margin. Based on a detailed field geological survey and measurement of the terrace sections, combined with sedimentological and chronological analyses, we reconstructed the developmental processes of the three terraces and inferred that three river terraces were formed by the Yellow River. The OSL dating results show that the time of deposition of terrace 3 was prior to 118kaBP. Subsequently, the terrace began to experience incision and formed the geomorphic surface of terrace T3. Similarly, terrace 2 and terrace 1 were mainly deposited from ~109 and 59ka, respectively; and began to be incised prior to 71 and 46ka, respectively. The three terraces in the northern Hetao Basin are the products of the combined actions of climatic shifts and tectonic uplift. The Yellow River's evolutionary history in the Hetao area since the Late Pleistocene is discussed. Before about 120kaBP, the Yellow River may have flowed through the northern Hetao Basin. Between 110 and 70kaBP, the Yellow River experienced at least two changes between river and lake sedimentation. From 60 to 50ka, a very large river-connected lake of the Yellow River was developed in the Hetao Basin. After 50ka, the Hetao river-connected paleolake of the Yellow River gradually dried.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3afloodplains 3alakes 3arivers 3asurveys 3atectonics 3aterraces 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aHetao Basin 0aYellow River 0aRiver terrace 0aPaleolake 0aDating 0aTerrace sediments1 aZhang, Xujiao1 aYe, Peisheng1 aZhao, Xitao1 aHe, Zexin1 aHe, Xiangli1 aZhou, Qingshuo1 aLi, Jie1 aYe, Mengni1 aWang, Zhen1 aMeng, Jing0 tGeomorphology.g2016 June 15, v. 263 p.87-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012800170300001800298520110100316592002801417650002101445650001401466650001501480650002601495653003001521653003001551653004101581653004101622653002801663700002201691700002801713700002101741700002501762700001601787700002001803700002001823700001901843700002101862773008701883856008501970852000902055655001202064IND60114029820221119222641.0161024e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011402982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2013.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanham, Ana B.10aDetermination of the extraction kinetics for the quantification of polyhydroxyalkanoate monomers in mixed microbial systems  ap. 1626-1634.  aFor the first time, a systematic approach was conducted to determine the key factors influencing the kinetics of hydroxyalkanote (HA) extraction in biological systems. Six mixed microbial systems where polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is produced were evaluated. Experiments were carried out for full-scale and lab-scale activated sludge systems using different configurations (containing floccular or granular sludge), as well as specific PHA accumulating cultures that contain high or low intracellular PHA fractions. The overall reaction was limited by the kinetics of the PHA hydrolysis in floccular cultures, whereas in granular cultures, it was limited by the cell lysis step. The monomeric composition of the polymer also had an impact on the HA extraction rate: higher acid concentration and a longer digestion time should be employed when cells accumulate monomers with more substituents, such as hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (H2MB) and hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (H2MV). This study optimised the method for HA extraction, which impacts the assessment of the quantity and quality of PHA biopolymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3adigestion 3ahydrolysis 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 0aPolyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) 0aPolyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) 0aPolyhydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (PH2MB) 0aPolyhydroxy-2-methylvalerate (PH2MV) 0aExtraction and recovery1 aRicardo, Ana Rita1 aAlbuquerque, Maria G.E.1 aPardelha, Filipa1 aCarvalheira, Mónica1 aComa, Marta1 aFradinho, Joana1 aCarvalho, Gilda1 aOehmen, Adrian1 aReis, Maria A.M.0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 48 p.1626-1634dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2013.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003100142245007800173300001800251500002000269520102800289592002801317596007201345596001301417596007301430596007201503650001501575650001601590650001301606650001001619700006301629700002701692773012501719856007701844852000901921655001201930IND60788092520221120030410.0220811e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078809252DNAL7 a10.1029/2018WR0245722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafari Raad, Seyed Mostafa10aOn the Dynamics of Two‐Component Convective Dissolution in Porous Media  ap. 4030-4042.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe studied the influence of the diffusion contrast between species on the dynamics of Rayleigh‐Bénard (RB) convection in porous media. The onset time of buoyancy‐driven instabilities and convective dissolution flux was quantified using linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations. The parametric analysis indicates eight distinct instability regions. Different stability mechanisms were characterized over the given range of diffusivity and relative buoyancy ratios. In particular, transition from instabilities solely by double diffusion to RB convection was identified using linear stability analysis and confirmed using nonlinear simulations. The parametric analysis on the onset also indicates that double diffusion has a potential to accelerate or slow down the RB convection depending on the solutes diffusion contrast. This study provides new insight into the effect of diffusion contrast and can be used to develop strategies for acceleration and deceleration of buoyancy‐driven instabilities.  aPublisher supplied data  cAlberta Innovates | Alberta Innovates ‐ Technology Futures (AITF)  cWestGrid  cCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) 3aconvection 3adiffusivity 3aresearch 3awater1 aHassanzadeh, Hassan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3029-65301 aEnnis‐King, Jonathan0 tWater resources research.g2019 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.4030-4042dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR0245723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245011500208300001400323520197300337592002802310650001702338650002602355650003102381650001502412650002602427650001102453650001302464650000902477650001802486650001502504650001602519651001102535700001702546700001502563700001702578700001502595773009602610856008602706852000902792655001202801IND60606814920221120044627.0180730e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060681492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFressard, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1656-983810aMulti-method characterisation of an active landslide: Case study in the Pays d'Auge plateau (Normandy, France)  ap. 22-39.  aShallow landslides are among the most frequent natural hazards in the Pays d'Auge plateau (Normandy, France) but no study has yet focused on the functioning of these phenomena at a detailed scale. This study aims to identify the structure and mechanical properties of a representative case study in the region. The main objective is to understand landslide dynamics and behaviour in order to assess triggering conditions and quantify triggering thresholds. The results will help complement the regional landslide hazard mapping based on landslide statistical susceptibility mapping and quantification of triggering thresholds. The landslide morphology and internal structure were identified using a multi-method approach. A morphodynamic map was produced in the field using cartographic GPS to depict the surface morphology and map the estimated landslide activity. These field measurements were completed by an analysis of all available aerial-photo images from the French National Geographic Institute (IGN) to identify the occurrence dates and possible landslide reactivations. The landslide structure was defined using multiple electrical tomography profiles, boreholes, augerings and penetration tests. Despite the overall low electrical resistivity of the landslide materials (i.e. ±<80Ω·m), the electrical profiles showed good agreement with the interpreted structure based on direct observations (augerings and penetration tests). The landslide slip surface, internal morphology and palaeotopography were identified. A finite slope model was used to calculate the landslide safety factor based on the internal structure and geotechnical data. The evolution of this safety factor according to the rainfall and the groundwater levels shows that the landslides are more likely to occur after long episodes of high cumulative precipitations with an important role being played by the preliminary conditions and the rise of the surficial groundwater table level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectrical resistance 3aglobal positioning systems 3alandslides 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aplateaus 3arain 3asafety factor 3atomography 3awater table 3aFrance1 aMaquaire, O.1 aThiery, Y.1 aDavidson, R.1 aLissak, C.0 tGeomorphology.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 270 p.22-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200445 u 4500001001100000005001700011008004100028016002100069024004200090040001800132100001900150245015500169300001400324520210000338592002802438650002802466650002502494650002302519650001102542650001302553650001602566650002702582650001402609650002102623650001602644650001602660650001202676650003202688650001102720650001102731650001102742650001002753651003102763700001902794700001502813773012202828856005502950852000903005655001203014IND609643620221118100403.0190605e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND60964362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2012.01228.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTertuliano, M.10aSettling behavior of the glassy‐winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis, vector of Xylella fastidiosa, on southern highbush blueberry cultivars  ap. 67-73.  aThe xylem‐limited bacterium Xylella fastidiosa Wells, Raju, Hung, Wiseberg, Mandelico‐Paul & Brenner causes bacterial leaf scorch, a new disease of southern highbush blueberry [Vaccinium corymbosum L. (Ericaceae) interspecific hybrids] in the southeastern USA. The bacterium is transmitted by sharpshooter leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), with the glassy‐winged sharpshooter (GWSS), Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar), being the most common potential vector in blueberry plantings. Considerable differences are observed in disease intensity among blueberry cultivars in the field, but it remains unknown whether these differences are due to variations in cultivar susceptibility to the bacterium, differences in attractiveness to its vector(s), or both. The settling and feeding behavior of GWSS was evaluated on three southern highbush blueberry cultivars (FL 86‐19, Star, and Emerald) in the greenhouse; in previous field studies, these cultivars were found to be affected by bacterial leaf scorch at high, moderate, and low levels, respectively. Potted plants were caged together with field‐collected GWSS adults for a period of 5 days, with either all three cultivars caged simultaneously (choice test) or individually (no‐choice test). In the choice tests, no differences in cultivar attractiveness were observed during the first 2 days of study. However, from the 3rd day, significantly more adults settled on Emerald (52.7%) than on Star (25.5%) and FL 86‐19 (17.7%). In contrast, in no‐choice tests, the overall host plant acceptance for the three cultivars was similar, and 89.3–92.1% of adults settled on these plants. A significantly greater number of adults settled on the stems (79.3%) vs. the leaves (11.2%). Moreover, they preferred the middle portion of the shoot (56.9%) compared with the upper (7.8%) and the lower (14.7%) portions. In a separate study on FL 86‐19, greater numbers of GWSS nymphs settled on the upper (actively growing) portion of the shoot (82.3%), whereas only 15.8 and 1.5% settled on the middle and lower portions, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomalodisca vitripennis 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aadults 3abacteria 3ablueberries 3acontainer-grown plants 3acultivars 3afeeding behavior 3agreenhouses 3ahost plants 3ahybrids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aleaves 3anymphs 3ascorch 3astems 3aSoutheastern United States1 aSrinivasan, R.1 aScherm, H.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2012 Apr., v. 143, no. 1 p.67-73dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2012.01228.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003300130024004000163024002200203024001900225040001800244100002000262245008300282300001800365506002800383506007200411506007600483506003100559520154700590592002802137596007102165596004502236506003702281650001202318650001302330650002302343650001402366650001402380650001002394650000902404653002702413653002402440653002902464653002202493653000902515700001802524700002402542700002202566773019202588856008002780903002202860852000902882655001202891IND60230347720221207121313.0150614e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023034772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14220891122chorus7 a10.1073/pnas.14220891122doi7 a10.1073/pnas.14220891122chorusOpen7 aPMC43719712pmcid7 a256755082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerry, Clint J.10aRapid behavioral maturation accelerates failure of stressed honey bee colonies  ap. 3427-3432.  aResource is Open Access  aProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aMany complex factors have been linked to the recent marked increase in honey bee colony failure, including pests and pathogens, agrochemicals, and nutritional stressors. It remains unclear, however, why colonies frequently react to stressors by losing almost their entire adult bee population in a short time, resulting in a colony population collapse. Here we examine the social dynamics underlying such dramatic colony failure. Bees respond to many stressors by foraging earlier in life. We manipulated the demography of experimental colonies to induce precocious foraging in bees and used radio tag tracking to examine the consequences of precocious foraging for their performance. Precocious foragers completed far fewer foraging trips in their life, and had a higher risk of death in their first flights. We constructed a demographic model to explore how this individual reaction of bees to stress might impact colony performance. In the model, when forager death rates were chronically elevated, an increasingly younger forager force caused a positive feedback that dramatically accelerated terminal population decline in the colony. This resulted in a breakdown in division of labor and loss of the adult population, leaving only brood, food, and few adults in the hive. This study explains the social processes that drive rapid depopulation of a colony, and we explore possible strategies to prevent colony failure. Understanding the process of colony failure helps identify the most effective strategies to improve colony resilience.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Hermon Slade Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001109  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApoidea 3aforaging 3ahoney bee colonies 3amortality 3apathogens 3aradio 3arisk 0abehavioral development 0atemporal polyethism 0acolony collapse disorder 0acompartment model 0aRFID1 aSøvik, Eirik1 aMyerscough, Mary R.1 aBarron, Andrew B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 112, no. 11 p.3427-3432dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14220891123Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245014600170520173000316592002802046650002302074650001202097650002002109650002002129650001202149650001102161650002002172650001502192650002302207650001602230650001902246650001002265650002302275650002302298650001402321650001302335650001102348650002502359650001302384651001002397653002202407653001002429653002602439653001402465653001702479700001602496700001702512700001702529700005102546700001502597773009102612856009002703852000902793655001202802IND60791532320221119015635.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079153232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1361502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xuming10aBioaccumulation of 35 metal(loid)s in organs of a freshwater mussel (Hyriopsis cumingii) and environmental implications in Poyang Lake, China  aBenthic bioaccumulation of hazardous materials has been a great challenge to the health of lake ecosystems. As representative benthic macroinvertebrates, freshwater mussels and their accumulation characteristics have been regarded as effective indicators for assessing potential risks induced by sedimentary metal(loid)s in lakes. Here we profile organ-specific accumulation of 35 metal(loid)s in a freshwater mussel (Hyriopsis cumingii) and their correlations to metal speciation in sediments of Poyang Lake, the largest lake of China. Significant organ-specific characteristics of metal accumulation were found in gills, though higher thallium (Tl) and selenium (Se) were found in the hepatopancreas, and greater arsenic (As) mostly accumulated in gonads. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the bioaccumulation of silver (Ag), cobalt (Co), and rare earth elements (ΣREE) in gills and As in gonads were closely associated with those in bioavailable fraction of sediments. Based on the biochemical analysis in the major organs, gills exhibited the highest enzymatic activity compared with hepatopancreas and gonads. Sedimentary metals, particularly for available Ag, Co, and ΣREE, play key roles in causing lipid peroxidation in gills and significantly promote the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD)/glutathione reductase (GR), while many metals (e.g., cadmium, manganese, Se) inhibit the glutathione (GSH) content in gonads and hepatopancreas. Our study indicates a high physiological sensitivity of mussels to these target metals, which highlights the significance of organ-specific accumulation of metal(loid)s in understanding the potential ecological risks of sedimentary metal(loid)s in lake ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyriopsis cumingii 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acobalt 3aenzyme activity 3afreshwater 3afreshwater mussels 3aglutathione 3ahepatopancreas 3alakes 3alipid peroxidation 3amacroinvertebrates 3amanganese 3aselenium 3asilver 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athallium 3aChina 0aFreshwater mussel 0aOrgan 0aMetal bioavailability 0aBiomarker 0aPoyang Lake1 aPan, Baozhu1 aShu, Fengyue1 aChen, Xiufen1 aXu, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9737-396X1 aNi, Jinren0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 307 p.136150-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1361503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245009200215300001600307506007600323520127400399592002801673506003701701650003201738650001901770650002101789650002601810650001101836650001501847650002501862650001601887650002101903650002901924650002001953650001601973653003401989653002102023700002102044773012502065856008402190852000902274655001202283IND60689873320221207084836.0200424e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068987332DNAL7 a10.3109/1040841X.2012.6820502doi7 aPMC35678482pmcid7 a226246272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyed, Khajamohiddin10aP450 monooxygenases (P450ome) of the model white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium  ap. 339-363.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhanerochaete chrysosporium, the model white rot fungus, has been the focus of research for the past about four decades for understanding the mechanisms and processes of biodegradation of the natural aromatic polymer lignin and a broad range of environmental toxic chemicals. The ability to degrade this vast array of xenobiotic compounds was originally attributed to its lignin-degrading enzyme system, mainly the extracellular peroxidases. However, subsequent physiological, biochemical, and/or genetic studies by us and others identified the involvement of a peroxidase-independent oxidoreductase system, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. The whole genome sequence revealed an extraordinarily large P450 contingent (P450ome) with an estimated 149 P450s in this organism. This review focuses on the current status of understanding on the P450 monooxygenase system of P. chrysosproium in terms of pre-genomic and post-genomic identification, structural and evolutionary analysis, transcriptional regulation, redox partners, and functional characterization for its biodegradative potential. Future research on this catalytically diverse oxidoreductase enzyme system and its major role as a newly emerged player in xenobiotic metabolism/degradation is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3abiodegradation 3acytochrome P-450 3aextracellular enzymes 3alignin 3ametabolism 3anucleotide sequences 3aperoxidases 3atoxic substances 3atranscription (genetics) 3awhite-rot fungi 3axenobiotics 0aCytochrome P450 monooxygenase 0awhite-rot fungus1 aYadav, Jagjit S.0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 38, no. 4 p.339-363dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/1040841X.2012.6820503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003400146245010700180300001600287520131200303592002801615650002101643650002901664650001401693650001901707650002301726650002301749650001101772650002401783650001201807650001301819650001601832650001501848650001301863650003301876650002001909650002001929653001001949653001201959653001801971653002101989653003302010700003802043700003802081700003002119773010002149856008102249852000902330655001202339IND60589717120221118232356.0190405e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058971712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2018.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCattelan, Marília Gonçalves10aCombined effects of oregano essential oil and salt on the growth of Escherichia coli in salad dressing  ap. 305-310.  aThere is a broad research interest in the search for alternatives to chemical additives for use as natural food preservatives. Although many natural compounds have biological in vitro properties evidenced, in situ studies are still scarce. This study evaluated the effect of oregano essential oil (OEO) and salt (NaCl) concentrations against Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), in salad dressing, using the response surface methodology. The experiment included a 22 central composite rotatable design (CCRD) in a total of 11 formulations of salad dressings. Oregano essential oil was characterized by gas chromatography and salad dressings by ash, lipids, proteins and moisture. OEO was composed mainly by carvacrol (65.1%) and p-cymene (12.0%). Salad dressings showed similar chemical profiles. A mathematical model for the prediction of the antibacterial activity in salad dressing was obtained. The results revealed that the interaction between OEO and salt showed effect on the bacterial count. However, the effect of salt was negative suggesting that the highest NaCl concentrations decreases the bacterial count. Therefore, within the parameters studied, the use of OEO to control E. coli in salad dressing can be considered promising and allows reduction in the levels of salt to be incorporated in food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3acarvacrol 3aessential oils 3afood preservatives 3agas chromatography 3alipids 3amathematical models 3aoregano 3ap-cymene 3aplate count 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aresponse surface methodology 3asalad dressings 3asodium chloride 0aSpice 0aOregano 0aAntibacterial 0aFactorial design 0aSurface response methodology1 aNishiyama, Yara Paula de Oliveira1 aGonçalves, Tânia Maria Vinturim1 aCoelho, Alexandre Rodrigo0 tFood microbiology.g2018 Aug., v. 73 p.305-310dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2018.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013200173300001600305520139900321592002801720650002601748650001701774650000901791650001501800650001701815650002801832650001401860650001501874653001401889653001701903653002801920653001501948653001601963700002201979700002902001700003402030700002502064700002202089773010702111856008502218852000902303655001202312IND60597318220221120231440.0201202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059731822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Mst.

Silver barb were exposed to a solution of 10% and 50% of lethal concentrations (LC₅₀) of profenofos as sub-lethal concentrations at different days (1, 7, 15, and 30 d), along with a control (0% profenofos). Subsequent recovery patterns were assessed allowing the fish exposed to profenofos free water for the same period that they were exposed to profenofos. Our results revealed that with the progression of time and concentration, fish exposed to profenofos showed significantly (p < .05) higher level of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) such as micronuclei, bi-nuclei, degenerated nuclei, notched nuclei, nuclear bridge and nuclear buds, as well as erythrocytic cellular abnormalities (ECA) such as echinocytic, elongated, fusion, spindle, tear-drop and twin shaped cells. After exposure, the silver barb recovered spontaneously, and the abnormal erythrocytic parameters were normalized with a concentration- and duration-dependent fashion. Therefore, these abnormalities and their recovery can be used to assess the toxic levels of pesticides on aquatic organisms. There is great potential to use this technique as in vivo to predict susceptibility of aquatic animals to environmental pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarbonymus gonionotus 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3afreshwater 3agenotoxicity 3alethal concentration 50 3apollution 3aprofenofos 0aBiomarker 0aGenotoxicity 0aPeripheral erythrocytes 0aProfenofos 0aSilver barb1 aMoniruzzaman, Md.1 aMostakim, Golam Mohammod1 aKhan, Mohammad Sadequr Rahman1 aRahman, Md.

The objective of this study was to validate a defined set of targets using artificial miRNA mimics transfected into cell lines to confirm specific targets of endogenous miRNAs after administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Sixteen hours after mimic transfection of 3D4/21 cell lines, the cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were harvested and collected at 0, 1, 3, and 8 h post administration. The selected genes DAD1, IL8, and ESR, which are involved in known pathways of inflammation. and are predicted or validated human targets of either miR-146a, let-7a, or miR-22-3p. These were then evaluated by quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) to verify microRNA-mRNA interaction in swine. Using the ROX reference dye, mRNA changes in expression were assessed using the comparative CT Method (ΔΔCT method) for normalization against the PBS control group. DAD1 and ESR1 were negatively regulated by miR-22-3p and miR-146a-5p, respectively in 3D4/21 cells after LPS stimulation. However, miR-146a-5p may play an indirect positive regulatory role of both DAD1 and IL8 mRNA expression. Furthermore, we found an inverse relationship between LPS stimulation compared with the let-7a-5p overexpression with DAD1. Our inflammation study provides new evidence on the roles and predicted targets of miR-146a, let-7a, and miR-22-3p in swine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3adyes 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3alipopolysaccharides 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3aswine 3atransfection 3aveterinary medicine 0aInflammation 0amiRNA mimics 0aSwine1 aChavez, Chris1 aMyers, Michael J.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2022 Dec. 05, v. 150 p.115-121dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015000162300001400312520166600326592002801992650001502020650001302035650002502048650001502073650001602088650002202104650003502126650002002161650003802181650001102219650003002230650001802260650001902278650002002297650001502317653002902332653002502361653003402386653001602420653002302436700001602459700001702475700001802492700001602510700001402526700001602540773009002556856008102646852000902727655001202736IND60085822420221120185841.0160901e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008582242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Shuxue12aA rapid and highly sensitive portable chemiluminescent immunosensor of carcinoembryonic antigen based on immunomagnetic separation in human serum  ap. 94-99.  aTo detect a biomarker for lung cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a highly sensitive, selective, rapid and portable immunosensor based on immunomagnetic separation and chemiluminescence immunoassay was introduced. A sandwich scheme assay has been utilized with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled anti-CEA antibody and immunomagnetic beads (IMBs). The presence of target protein CEA caused the formation of the sandwich structures (IMBs-CEA-HRP labeled antibody). IMBs were applied to capture CEA and immobilize CEA through the external magnetic field. The HRP at the surface of the antibody catalytically oxidized the luminescence substrate to generate optical signals which were detected by a portable home-made luminometer and which were directly proportional to the concentration of CEA in the samples. The signals were dependent on CEA concentrations in a linear range from 0 to 50ngmL−1. The limit of detection (LOD) of this method was as low as 5.0pgmL−1 (S/N=3). The novel immunosensor was highly sensitive with an assay time of <35min. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10%. The anti-CEA antibody can be bound to the bead efficiently with a conjugation rate of 73%. IMBs could be stored in 4°C protecting from light for 2 months without obvious reduction of biological activity. Human reference sera mixed with various concentrations of CEA were tested with the proposed method and commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, and a good linear relationship was obtained. This proposed technique demonstrated an excellent performance for quantifying CEA and was expected to be used for clinical testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abioactive properties 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3achemiluminescence 3achemiluminescence immunoassays 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3aimmunosensors 3alung neoplasms 3amagnetic fields 3aperoxidase 0aCarcinoembryonic antigen 0aImmunomagnetic beads 0aChemiluminescence immunoassay 0aLuminometer 0aSuperparamagnetism1 aLiu, Juntao1 aLuo, Jinping1 aHuang, Yiqing1 aShi, Wentao1 aWang, Bin1 aCai, Xinxia0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Mar. 05, v. 766 p.94-99dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04650naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003200135040001800167100001800185245013500203300001100338506007600349520232900425592002802754506003702782650001402819650002002833650002502853650002002878650001702898650001002915650002002925650003002945650003302975650001203008650001403020650001903034650002503053650001803078650001703096650001303113650001303126650001003139650001203149651001303161651001203174651001303186651001103199651001403210700002203224700001903246700002503265700002103290700004203311700001903353700001703372700003603389700002103425700002103446700001803467700002503485700002103510700002503531700001903556700002303575700003003598700002403628700001803652773011003670856007903780852000903859655001203868IND50064332520221207134936.0191003e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006433252DNAL7 aPMC36063282pmcid7 a234334282pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-6-472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, Marta10aPhylogeography of the neotropical Anopheles triannulatus complex (Diptera: Culicidae) supports deep structure and complex patterns  ap. 47.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The molecular phylogenetic relationships and population structure of the species of the Anopheles triannulatus complex: Anopheles triannulatus s.s., Anopheles halophylus and the putative species Anopheles triannulatus C were investigated. METHODS: The mitochondrial COI gene, the nuclear white gene and rDNA ITS2 of samples that include the known geographic distribution of these taxa were analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Bayesian inference, Maximum parsimony and Maximum likelihood approaches. RESULTS: Each data set analyzed septely yielded a different topology but none provided evidence for the seption of An. halophylus and An. triannulatus C, consistent with the hypothesis that the two are undergoing incipient speciation. The phylogenetic analyses of the white gene found three main clades, whereas the statistical parsimony network detected only a single metapopulation of Anopheles triannulatus s.l. Seven COI lineages were detected by phylogenetic and network analysis. In contrast, the network, but not the phylogenetic analyses, strongly supported three ITS2 groups. Combined data analyses provided the best resolution of the trees, with two major clades, Amazonian (clade I) and trans-Andean + Amazon Delta (clade II). Clade I consists of multiple subclades: An. halophylus + An. triannulatus C; trans-Andean Venezuela; central Amazonia + central Bolivia; Atlantic coastal lowland; and Amazon delta. Clade II includes three subclades: Panama; cis-Andean Colombia; and cis-Venezuela. The Amazon delta specimens are in both clades, likely indicating local sympatry. Spatial and molecular variance analyses detected nine groups, corroborating some of subclades obtained in the combined data analysis. CONCLUSION: Combination of the three molecular markers provided the best resolution for differentiation within An. triannulatus s.s. and An. halophylus and C. The latest two species seem to be very closely related and the analyses performed were not conclusive regarding species differentiation. Further studies including new molecular markers would be desirable to solve this species status question. Besides, results of the study indicate a trans-Andean origin for An. triannulatus s.l. The potential implications for malaria epidemiology remain to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles 3aBayesian theory 3aanalysis of variance 3adata collection 3aepidemiology 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ageographical distribution 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amalaria 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apopulation structure 3aribosomal DNA 3ariver deltas 3asympatry 3atopology 3atrees 3atropics 3aAmazonia 3aBolivia 3aColombia 3aPanama 3aVenezuela1 aBickersmith, Sara1 aHarlow, Wesley1 aHildebrandt, Jessica1 aMcKeon, Sascha N1 aSilva-do-Nascimento, Teresa Fernandes1 aLoaiza, Jose R1 aRuiz, Freddy1 aOliveira, Ricardo Lourenço de,1 aSallum, Maria AM1 aBergo, Eduardo S1 aFritz, Gary N1 aWilkerson, Richard C1 aLinton, Yvonne M1 aJuri, Maria J Dantur1 aRangel, Yadira1 aPóvoa, Marinete M1 aGutiérrez-Builes, Lina A1 aCorrea, Margarita M1 aConn, Jan E.,0 tParasites & vectors.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.47-47dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010200181300001600283520122100299592002801520650002501548650002401573650002501597650002801622650001201650650001501662650001801677651001201695651001001707651001901717651001801736653002701754653002901781653002501810653001601835653002001851773011401871856008601985852000902071655001202080IND60646714020221118041407.0190725e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064671402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeyva-de la Hiz, Dante I.10aEnvironmental innovations and policy network styles: The influence of pluralism and corporativism  ap. 839-847.  aThe increasing awareness of sustainability issues in industrialized countries has resulted in an unprecedented rise in the number of environmental innovations produced worldwide. However, while this is a general tendency, the amount and importance of environmental innovations is far from consistent across industrialized countries. The influence of countries’ policy network styles – referring to which and how interest groups participate in making public policy choices is a dimension that has been subject to growing interest and controversy. We propose that companies from pluralistic countries will generate more environmental innovations, but the importance of environmental innovations will be higher in neo-corporatist countries. Our analysis, based on a longitudinal analysis of 84,274 environmental patents from the United States, Japan, Germany, and the UK during the period 1976–2003, indicates support for our prediction that neo-corporatist countries tend to generate more important environmental innovations than pluralistic countries. Yet, our findings do not support our hypothesis suggesting that pluralistic countries are more likely to generate a higher number of environmental innovations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adeveloped countries 3alongitudinal studies 3amulticultural diversity 3apatents 3aprediction 3apublic policy 3aGermany 3aJapan 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States 0aEnvironmental behavior 0aEnvironmental innovation 0aInstitutional theory 0aPluralistic 0aNeo-corporatist0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 232 p.839-847dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013700165300001600302520133100318592002801649650002201677650001101699650000901710650001501719650001001734650001401744650001301758650001301771650002101784650001701805650001401822650001201836653001301848653002601861653002901887653002101916653001201937700002101949700001701970700001501987700001502002700001402017700002002031700001302051700001402064700001502078773011302093856008602206852000902292655001202301IND60646714220221118041406.0200405e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064671422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhe10aInvestigation of elements (U, V, Sr, Ga, Cs and Rb) leaching and mobility in uranium-enriched coal ash with thermochemical treatment  ap. 115-125.  aUranium and other trace elements in coal ash have received a significant attention as the beneficial reuse of hazardous wastes. In this study, combined with X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectroscopy and other analyses, thermochemical treatment (sodium hydroxide) and leaching trial (water, alkaline and acid solution) were conducted to evidence that elements are selectively encapsulated in Si–Al glass, eutectic and Fe-enriched fraction during combustion leading to a low extraction efficiency. Thereinto, comparing the main host of V, Cs, Rb and Sr in Si–Al glass, there are 47%, 45% and 8% of U encapsulated with Si–Al glass, eutectic and Fe-enriched fraction, while 59% of Ga remains in Si–Fe-enriched residue. Different from the large extraction of V, Cs, Rb and Ga followed by the removal of Si–Al glass and water leaching, U and Sr remained in residue with a high mobility. Overall, the leaching efficiencies of U, V, Cs, Rb, Ga and Sr were significantly improved and up to 92%, 100%, 74%, 78%, 41% and 98% respectively at the condition of NaOH/ash = 1.5, 500 °C and 1 h. Hence, it is necessary to properly handle the leachate also residue due to their potential environmental implications when the ash is employed to synthesize advanced materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acesium 3acoal 3acombustion 3aglass 3aleachates 3aleaching 3arubidium 3asodium hydroxide 3aspectroscopy 3astrontium 3auranium 0aCoal ash 0aElement encapsulation 0aThermochemical treatment 0aAqueous leaching 0aUranium1 aWang, Changxiang1 aLiu, Danqing1 aLi, Yilian1 aNing, You,1 aYang, Sen1 aZhang, Yangyang1 aTang, Ye1 aTang, Zhi1 aZhang, Wei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.115-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017300168300001300341520081200354592002801166650001401194650001401208650001601222650000901238650001301247650001601260650001601276650001901292651001501311653001401326653002101340653002101361700002401382700001701406700002001423773009401443856008201537852000901619655001201628IND60749181220221119141135.0210831e20210824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074918122DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1057.674332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeijen, Hans R.12aA review of Madagopsina Feijen, Feijen & Feijen (Diptera, Diopsidae) with description of a new species, key to the species, and discussion of intrageneric relationships  ap. 1-21.  aFor the recently established genus Madagopsina (Diopsidae, stalk-eyed flies), Madagopsina makayensis Feijen, Feijen & Feijen, sp. nov. is described from Madagascar.

Results showed that the weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of soy protein isolate (SPI) and those of the aggregates increased 74–104% and 39–67%, respectively after the extrusion treatments. However, they decreased from 2.688 to 2.340×106g/mol and from 1.115 to 0.926×107g/mol, respectively when SME increased from 839.81 to 1277.01kJ/kg. The increasing SME caused the proportion increase of low molecular weight fractions from 35.02% to 52.63% as well. It was concluded that protein was disassociated/depolymerized by mechanical shear during the extrusion process, and the increasing SME could enhance the extent of breakdown of protein aggregates. There existed vital factors contributing to the aggregation of proteins, and more information of the vital factors needs to be further investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotein aggregates 3alight scattering 3alasers 3aspecific energy 3agel chromatography 3aextrusion 3asoy protein isolate 3amolecular weight 0aSEC-MALLS 0aSpecific mechanical energy 0asize exclusion chromatography 0aSoy protein aggregation 0aExtrusion1 aZhang, Bo1 aWei, Yimin1 aLi, Shujing0 tJournal of food engineering.g2013 Mar., v. 115, no. 2 p.220-225dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001900136245006900155300001600224520070200240592002800942650001300970650001300983650001100996650001701007650001301024650001101037650001801048650001001066650002001076650001601096650001001112650002801122650003501150700002701185773011101212856003901323852000901362655001201371IND4529938120221118092059.0160222e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452993812DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.30972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlrich, Detlef10aTowards the development of molecular markers for apple volatiles  ap. 286-289.  aImproving flavour quality of apple varieties is an important but complex breeding goal.

In this study, a submersible probe type microbial electrochemical sensor was constructed, and the current signal showed a linear relationship with the VFAs concentration (0–200 mM) at the specific reaction time from 10 to 120 min (R2 > 0.96), with the slope increased from 0.87 × 10−3 to 1.70 × 10−3 mA mM −1. The sensor showed a good selectivity when VFAs were co-existed with 2 g/L of additional organic matters (cellulose, yeast extract, peptone, and potassium oleate), and 0.1% formaldehyde. Particular attention should be paid when additional electroactive matter such as Cu(II) as well as high concentration of TAN (above 200 mg/L) was co-existed with VFAs in the digestate. When amending the artificial AD digestate with extra 50 mM NaCl to increase the ionic strength, the current generation increased from 0.064 ± 0.002 to 0.185 ± 0.001 mA (50 mM VFAs at 60 min). The sensor was successfully applied for actual digestate samples detection and the results did not show significance differences with the total VFAs measured by GC. The submersible probe type sensor depicted a good repeatability during one-month operation. This study provides a direct approach based on microbial electrochemical technology for VFAs monitoring in the AD process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic digestion 3acellulose 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aformaldehyde 3aionic strength 3amonitoring 3aoleic acid 3apeptones 3asensors (equipment) 3asodium chloride 3avolatile fatty acids 3ayeast extract 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aBiosensor 0aExtracellular electron transfer 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aVolatile fatty acids1 aChu, Na1 aZeng, Raymond Jianxiong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 232 p.1371-1378dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245012200177300001600299520181200315592002802127650002202155650002102177650002402198650000802222650001402230650001602244650001502260650001402275650001102289650002202300651001502322653001202337653002402349653001902373653002402392653002402416700002002440700001802460700002302478700001802501700002002519700001702539700002402556700001902580700001702599773009402616856008702710852000902797655001202806IND60084124320221119031021.0161027e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrachfeld, Stefanie10aIron oxide tracers of ice sheet extent and sediment provenance in the ANDRILL AND-1B drill core, Ross Sea, Antarctica  ap. 420-433.  aThe AND-1B drill core recovered a 13.57millionyear Miocene through Pleistocene record from beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf in Antarctica (77.9°S, 167.1°E). Varying sedimentary facies in the 1285m core indicate glacial–interglacial cyclicity with the proximity of ice at the site ranging from grounding of ice in 917m of water to ice free marine conditions. Broader interpretation of climatic conditions of the wider Ross Sea Embayment is deduced from provenance studies. Here we present an analysis of the iron oxide assemblages in the AND-1B core and interpret their variability with respect to wider paleoclimatic conditions. The core is naturally divided into an upper and lower succession by an expanded 170m thick volcanic interval between 590 and 760m. Above 590m the Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles are diatom rich and below 760m late Miocene glacial cycles are terrigenous. Electron microscopy and rock magnetic parameters confirm the subdivision with biogenic silica diluting the terrigenous input (fine pseudo-single domain and stable single domain titanomagnetite from the McMurdo Volcanic Group with a variety of textures and compositions) above 590m. Below 760m, the Miocene section consists of coarse-grained ilmenite and multidomain magnetite derived from Transantarctic Mountain lithologies. This may reflect ice flow patterns and the absence of McMurdo Volcanic Group volcanic centers or indicate that volcanic centers had not yet grown to a significant size. The combined rock magnetic and electron microscopy signatures of magnetic minerals serve as provenance tracers in both ice proximal and distal sedimentary units, aiding in the study of ice sheet extent and dynamics, and the identification of ice rafted debris sources and dispersal patterns in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aclimatic factors 3aelectron microscopy 3aice 3amagnetite 3aperiodicity 3aprovenance 3asediments 3asilica 3atracer techniques 3aAntarctica 0aANDRILL 0aAntarctic Ice Sheet 0arock magnetism 0asediment provenance 0aelectron microscopy1 aPinzon, Juliana1 aDarley, Jason1 aSagnotti, Leonardo1 aKuhn, Gerhard1 aFlorindo, Fabio1 aWilson, Gary1 aOhneiser, Christian1 aMonien, Donata1 aJoseph, Leah0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2013 Nov., v. 110 p.420-433dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245013000172300002000302520154500322592002801867650001501895650001501910650002201925650001701947650003901964650002102003650003002024650000702054650002202061650002202083650001602105650001602121700003002137700002602167700003702193773012402230856007402354852000902428655001202437IND60655627520221118001917.0190803e20190724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065562752DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra02567g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Nathalia Vieira10aRevealing a new fluorescence peak of the enhanced green fluorescent protein using three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy  ap. 22853-22858.  aFluorescent proteins have many applications as biomarkers and biosensors in the medical and biological fields. Their success was largely supported by modifications of the first isolated fluorescent protein, the wild-type Green Fluorescent Protein (wtGFP), which allowed the development of improved variants such as the Enhanced GFP (EGFP). The first reports on EGFP indicated that the protein presented a single form and fluorescence peak, in contrast to the two conformations observed in wtGFP. However, after experimental determination of the crystalline structure of EGFP, two conformations were found, generating questions regarding the relationship between EGFP structure and its spectral characteristics. To resolve the controversy, this study evaluated EGFP 3D fluorescence spectra at lower wavelengths and under distinct conditions (different concentrations, pH and temperatures), revealing the existence of a second fluorescence peak for this protein. It was possible to confirm that the new peak was not a reflection of the intrinsic fluorescence of proteins or an artefact from the 3D fluorescence spectroscopy. It was also shown that the second peak is pH dependent, sensitive to high temperatures and linearly related to EGFP concentration, confirming a direct relationship between the new fluorescence peak and EGFP protein structure. In addition to the revelation of the new EGFP fluorescence peak, this study demonstrated that 3D fluorescence can be used as powerful technique in the discovery of other elusive fluorophores.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3acrystal structure 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3apH 3aprotein structure 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3awavelengths1 aSaponi, Carolina Falaschi1 aGreaves, Tamar Louise1 aPereira, Jorge Fernando Brandão0 tRSC advances.g2019 July 24, v. 9, no. 40 p.22853-22858dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra02567g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245007400218300001600292520131300308592002801621650002301649650004101672650001101713650002001724650003301744650001601777650002901793650002701822650001501849650001401864650001601878650001501894650001401909650001501923650002701938650001501965650001901980650001101999650002102010650001602031650002002047650002002067650002802087651001002115651001302125653001502138653003502153653001502188653002502203653002602228700002602254700002702280700002002307773010102327856008602428852000902514655001202523IND60635247520221119204702.0190410e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063524752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Girolamo, Anna Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5605-623910aImproving grey water footprint assessment: Accounting for uncertainty  ap. 822-833.  aThe grey water footprint (GWF) refers to the amount of freshwater required to dilute pollutants to meet water-quality standards. The aim of this paper was to estimate the GWF and its uncertainty for crop production at the basin scale. The proposed approach was tested in the Rio Mannu Basin (Sardinia, Italy) for durum wheat production. The fraction of nutrients flowing into the river and groundwater was evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model that was calibrated with in-stream monitoring data. A bootstrap technique coupled with Monte Carlo simulations was used to estimate the uncertainty of the GWF due to the variability of the primary input data and the unknown natural background level of nutrients in the waters. The GWF for total phosphorus (TP) input (3284 m3 t−1) was higher than that for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (275 m3 t−1), despite the lower rate of phosphorus fertiliser application. The uncertainty was found to be relevant for both DIN (60%) and TP (18%). The environmental sustainability of durum wheat production was assessed throughout the water pollution level. This showed that the TP load exceeded the assimilation capacity at the reach scale, and that further analyses are needed to assess the environmental sustainability at the basin scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abasins 3acrop production 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3adurum wheat 3aenvironmental indicators 3afertilizer application 3afreshwater 3agreywater 3agroundwater 3amonitoring 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apollutants 3apollution load 3arivers 3atotal phosphorus 3auncertainty 3awater footprint 3awater pollution 3awater quality standards 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0aGrey water 0aNitrogen and phosphorus export 0aSWAT model 0aUncertainty analysis 0aWater pollution level1 aMiscioscia, Pierluigi1 aPoliti, T.q(Tiziano),1 aBarca, Emanuele0 tEcological indicators.g2019 July, v. 102 p.822-833dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009600164300001600260520122500276592002801501650001101529650001901540650002301559650001501582650001601597650001601613650001401629650002001643653001101663653003401674653001401708653001601722653002001738700002401758700002301782700001501805700002201820773011401842856008301956852000902039655001202048IND60597165720221122082159.0190318e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059716572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun, Ueli10aUltrasonographic and radiographic findings in 503 cattle with traumatic reticuloperitonitis  ap. 154-161.  aThis study involved 503 cattle with traumatic reticuloperitonitis (TRP), 494 of which underwent ultrasonographic and 484 radiographic examination of the reticulum.

Mill) is a fresh fruit variety that is popular in China. Low temperature storage is an important method for retaining fruit quality postharvest. However, jujube fruits are susceptible to surface pitting under low temperature storage. Therefore, we performed transcriptome analysis to investigate the changes in gene expression in surface-pitted jujube fruit (SPF). First, we developed cDNA libraries of SPF and surface-intact fruit (SIF) that had been stored at − 1 ± 0.5 °C. As a result, 21,136,649 and 21,663,126 high-quality clean reads were generated and 47,386 contigs were obtained. Second, we performed sequences annotation by gene description and gene ontology (GO term) analysis, which clustered the genes into three functional groups. A total of 2706 predicted proteins were assigned to specific metabolic pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. An analysis of differential gene expression between SPF and SIF revealed more than 1210 genes that are differentially expressed in jujube in response to surface-pitting under low temperature storage, which are involved in lipid, carbohydrate, energy, amino acid, terpenoids, and polyketides metabolism, as well as membrane transport, signal transduction, translation, signal transduction, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. We investigated the pattern of phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene expression in SPF by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis. Our results provide new insights into the biology of surface pitting in jujube, which occurs under low temperature storage. Our findings help confirm the low-temperature tolerance pathways that function in postharvest fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphus jujuba 3aamino acids 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acDNA libraries 3acarbohydrates 3acomplementary DNA 3aenergy 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3alipids 3amoieties 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aphysiological transport 3apolyketides 3aproteins 3araw fruit 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary metabolites 3asignal transduction 3aterpenoids 3atranscriptomics 3aChina1 aWang, Tengyue1 aChen, Lan1 aLi, Limei1 aWang, Yong1 aLi, Xihong1 aXing, Yage0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2018 Feb., v. 59, no. 1 p.59-70dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-018-0007-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012500166300001600291520138600307592002801693650001101721650001201732650001001744650001201754650002201766650001401788651001601802651001101818700002001829700001901849700002001868700001901888700001901907700002101926773011801947856008202065852000902147655001202156IND50061822320221118092059.0210217e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006182232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-012-0889-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacht, Michael10aAre Ring Ouzel (Turdus torquatus) populations of the low mountain ranges remnants of a broader distribution in the past?  ap. 231-237.  aThe Ring Ouzel (Turdus torquatus) has an arctic–alpine distribution, with small populations also occurring at the higher altitudes of the low mountain ranges north of the Alps. The populations of the Alps and mountain ranges are classified as the subspecies T. torquatus alpestris, and those of the northern populations as T. torquatus torquatus. Since birds are mobile when, e.g., compared to mammals of the same size, it is likely that the populations in the low mountain ranges originated from dispersal events after the last ice age. We analyzed an mtDNA fragment of Ring Ouzel museum specimens from across Europe. We found a shallow gene tree with little differentiation between the subspecies and therefore incomplete lineage sorting. However, both, subspecies as well as low mountain range populations were characterized by private alleles respectively. Furthermore, when we grouped sequenced specimens according to their origin in an alpine group, a group from the low mountain ranges, and two northern groups, we found significant differentiation between the alpine and the low mountain range group, similar to the difference between the alpine and the two northern groups. This suggests an origin of populations on the low mountain ranges similar to that of the arctic–alpine disjunction, and that these populations are remnants of a broader distribution in the past.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurdus 3aalleles 3abirds 3amammals 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3aAlps region 3aEurope1 aRösner, Sascha1 aMüller, Jörg1 aPfeifer, Robert1 aStadler, Jutta1 aBrandl, Roland1 aOpgenoorth, Lars0 tJournal of ornithology.g2013 Jan., v. 154, no. 1 p.231-237dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-012-0889-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245008500168500001900253520125900272592002801531650002101559650002201580650002201602650001401624650001701638650002501655650001901680650001301699650001101712650001801723650001401741650001601755650001701771700002501788700002701813700002701840700002701867700002701894700002501921700002901946700002701975700002702002700002902029773012602058856007402184852000902258655001202267IND60703240620221116180620.0200720e20200311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070324062DNAL7 a10.3390/md180301552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuznetsova, Tatyana  A.10aImmunoadjuvant Activity of Fucoidans from the Brown Alga <i>Fucus evanescens</i>  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study presents the results of a comparative evaluation of the effect of structural modifications of fucoidans from the brown alga Fucus evanescens (native, highly purified product of fucoidan enzymatic hydrolysis, a new regular 1&rarr;3;1&rarr;4-&alpha;-L-fucan, sulphated mainly at C2 and acetylated at C4 of the fucose residue) on the effector functions of innate and adaptive immunity cells in vitro and in vivo. Using flow cytometry, we found that all examined fucoidans induce the maturation of dendritic cells, enhance the ability of neutrophils to migrate and adhere, activate monocytes and enhance their antigen-presenting functions, and increase the cytotoxic potential of natural killers. Fucoidans increase the production of hepatitis B virus (HBs) specific IgG and cytokine Th1 (IFN-&gamma;, TNF-&alpha;) and Th2 (IL-4) profiles in vivo. The data obtained suggest that in vitro and in vivo adjuvant effects of the products of fucoidan enzymatic hydrolysis with regular structural characteristics are comparable to those of the native fucoidan. Based on these data, the products of fucoidan enzymatic hydrolysis can be considered as an effective and safe candidate adjuvant to improve the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFucus evanescens 3aHepatitis B virus 3aadaptive immunity 3aadjuvants 3acytotoxicity 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aflow cytometry 3afucoidan 3afucose 3ainterleukin-4 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 3atherapeutics1 aSmolina, Tatyana  P.1 aMakarenkova, Ilona  D.1 aIvanushko, Lydmila  A.1 aPersiyanova, Elena  V.1 aErmakova, Svetlana  P.1 aSilchenko, Artem  S.1 aZaporozhets, Tatyana  S.1 aBesednova, Natalya  N.1 aFedyanina, Lydmila  N.1 aKryzhanovsky, Sergey  P.0 tMarine drugs.g2020 Mar. 11, v. 18, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180301553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010300166300001600269520228200285592002802567650001502595650001402610650002702624650001702651650001702668650000902685650002102694650001902715650001902734650002202753650001602775650001402791650001902805653003702824653003502861653002702896653001502923653005002938653001902988700002203007700005903029700002403088700001803112700001703130773012503147856008203272852000903354655001203363IND60605893720221122195104.0180723e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaj, Praveena10aEffect of polyelectrolyte morphology and adsorption on the mechanism of nanocellulose flocculation  ap. 158-167.  aThe effect of polyelectrolyte morphology, charge density, molecular weight and concentration on the adsorption and flocculation of Microfibrillated Cellulose (MFC) were investigated. Linear Cationic Polyacrylamide (CPAM) and Branched Polyethylenimine (PEI) of varying charge density and molecular weight were added at different dosages to MFC suspensions. The flocculation mechanisms were quantified by measuring gel point by sedimentation, and floc size, strength and reflocculation ability through Focussed Beam Reflectance Measurements. Polymer adsorption was quantified through zeta potential and adsorption measurements using polyelectrolyte titration. The flocculation mechanism of MFC is shown to be dependent on polyelectrolyte morphology. The high molecular weight branched polymer, HPEI formed rigid bridges between the MFC fibres. HPEI had low coverage and negative zeta potential at the optimum flocculation dosage, forming flocs of high strength. After breaking of flocs, total reflocculation was achieved because the high rigidity of polymer did not allow reconformation or flattening of the polyelectrolyte adsorbed on MFC surface. The lower molecular weight branched polymer, LPEI (2kDa) showed rapid total deflocculation, complete reflocculation and had maximum flocculation occurring at the point of zero charge. These characteristics correspond to a charge neutralisation mechanism. However, if the flocculation mechanism was purely charge neutralisation mechanism, the minimum gel point would be at the point of zero charge. Since this is not the case, this difference was attributed to the high polydispersity of the commercial LPEI used, allowing some bridges to be formed by the largest molecules, changing the minimum gel point. With the linear 80% charged 4MDa CPAM, bridging mechanism dominates since maximum flocculation occurred at the minimum gel point, negative zeta potential and low coverage required for maximum flocculation. Reflocculation was not possible as the long linear polymer reconformed on the MFC surface under a flat conformation. Flocculation with the linear 50% charged 13MDa CPAM happened by bridging with the minimum gel point and maximum flocculation corresponding to roughly half polyelectrolyte surface coverage on cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3aelectrolytes 3aflocculation 3agels 3amolecular weight 3aneutralization 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyethyleneimine 3areflectance 3atitration 3azeta potential 0aMicrofibrillated Cellulose (MFC) 0aCationic Polyacrylamide (CPAM) 0aPolyethylenimine (PEI) 0aAdsorption 0aFocussed Beam Reflectance Measurements (FBRM) 0aZeta potential1 aBatchelor, Warren1 aBlanco, Angeles1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6820-76981 ade la Fuente, Elena1 aNegro, Carlos1 aGarnier, Gil0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 481 p.158-167dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245013500185300001600320520068600336592002801022650002101050650001801071650001101089650002701100650001301127650000901140650001501149650001001164650001201174650003101186650004401217650001601261650001101277650005501288650003501343650000901378650002401387650003101411773010701442856005101549852000901600655001201609IND50075030820221120221228.0140410e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007503082DNAL7 a224048152pmid7 a10.1080/00071668.2011.6510982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPis, Tomasz10aGrowth and development of chicks of two species of partridge: the grey partridge (Perdix perdix) and the chukar (Alectoris chukar)  ap. 141-144.  a1.

The allometric relationship between tarsus length and body mass followed a geometric similarity (1/3 power) in both grey partridges and chukars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlectoris chukar 3aPerdix perdix 3achicks 3agrowth and development 3ahatching 3alegs 3apartridges 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBeakxgrowth & development 2aBody Temperature Regulationxphysiology 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aGalliformesxclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aHindlimbxgrowth & development 2aMale 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWingxgrowth & development0 tBritish poultry science.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 53, no. 1 p.141-144dTaylor & Francis Groupx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2011.651098  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100002200179245011100201300001600312500002400328500001500352520142400367650002001791650002701811650001301838650001801851650001001869650001701879650001601896650002801912650002901940650002101969650003101990650002702021650005002048650001802098650003102116650002002147650005302167651001202220651001102232651001202243651001102255653002902266653002302295653003402318700002602352700002102378773011202399852000902511856009102520930003302611945002502644946001102669655001202680IND4428837720221120174356.0091118e20091220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442883772DNAL7 a198503232pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aHill, Jonathan R.10aSize distribution of methylmercury associated with particulate and dissolved organic matter in freshwaters  ap. 408-414.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWater samples were collected from 20 wetland, river and lake sites across Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec to investigate the distribution of methylmercury (MeHg) associated with various size fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Tangential Flow UltraFiltration (TUF) was used to fractionate DOM by nominal molecular size (<0.2μm, <300kDa, <30kDa, <5kDa and <1kDa). DOM fluorescence (DOM FL) and absorbance (DOC Abs) were used to quantify DOM photoreactivity and aromaticity in each sample. Significant differences in the size-associated distribution of MeHg, Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), DOM FL, and DOM Abs were observed between wetlands, rivers, and lakes. The low molecular weight (LMW) fraction (<5kDa) in wetlands contained the majority of MeHg (70.0±13.8%), DOC (56.1±9.4%), and DOM FL (77.4±7.5%). DOM FL was also high in the LMW fraction for rivers (60.6±25%) and lakes (75.2±16.9%). Mean MeHg concentrations in the LMW fraction of lakes (41±26pgL⁻¹) and rivers (32±19pgL⁻¹) were substantial but much lower than wetlands. Rivers had the highest percentage of methylmercury (38.0±23.5%) in the particulate (>0.2µm) fraction. This research highlights the importance of low molecular weight dissolved organic matter in methylmercury fate. For example, a large proportion of MeHg was found in the LMW weight fractions (mean=47.3±25.4%) of the wetlands, rivers, and lakes in this study. 3awater pollution 3achemical concentration 3awetlands 3afractionation 3alakes 3aparticulates 3ariver water 3amethylmercury compounds 3adissolved organic carbon 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size distribution 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aParticle Size 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aUltrafiltration 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 3aOntario 3aQuebec 0aOntario 0aQuebec 0adissolved organic matter 0asize fractionation 0alow molecular weight fraction1 aO'Driscoll, Nelson J.1 aLean, David R.S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Dec. 20, v. 408, no. 2 p.408-414dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02128naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100002300171245010300194300001600297500001500313520098900328650002901317650002001346650002001366650001001386650001001396650001801406653001701424700002301441700001801464773010301482852000901585856007701594930003301671945002501704946001301729655001201742IND4362046920221120164403.0040413e20040211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436204692DNAL7 a10.1021/jf034381m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In both cases, the enzyme was in its latent state, and it was activated by sodium dodecyl sulfate. PPO was purified to apparent homogeneity. The soluble PPO purification was achieved by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration chromatography, with apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa. The membrane PPO purification was achieved by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration with apparent molecular mass of 54 kDa. A totally denaturing SDS-PAGE indicated the presence of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa for both fractions, with the band also revealed by Western blot. A partially denaturing SDS-PAGE stained a single active 36 kDa band for both fractions. Under native isoelectric focusing, a major acidic band of pH 5.2 was detected in both fractions. Kinetic characterization of PPO on the natural substrate L-dopa was carried out. 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aenzyme kinetics 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3abeets 3aBeta vulgaris 0apurification1 aGarcia-Carmona, F.1 aEscribano, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 Feb. 11, v. 52, no. 3 p.609-615x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf034381m3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03476naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100001500173245017400188300001600362500002400378500001500402520190900417650001702326650001402343650001602357650001502373650001302388650001302401650001402414650001002428650003102438650001502469650001902484650002502503650002802528650001702556650001702573650001102590653002802601700002002629700002402649773010902673852000902782856008602791930003302877945002502910946001102935655001202946IND4428840320221120164448.0091118e20100131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442884032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aB200 0aF2001 aSingh, Era10aVariability in antioxidant and metabolite levels, growth and yield of two soybean varieties: An assessment of anticipated yield losses under projected elevation of ozone  ap. 168-177.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGlobal mean tropospheric ozone concentration is expected to increase by more than 20% by 2050. Although the present levels of ozone may not induce visible symptoms in most of the plants, they can result in substantial production losses and reproductive output. There are wide variations in ozone sensitivity among varieties in same species. This paper reports variations in ozone sensitivity for two tropical soybean (Glycine max L.) varieties (PK 472 and Bragg) exposed to projected elevated ozone concentrations of 70 and 100ppb for 4h daily from germination to maturity under natural field conditions. Differential sensitivities of cultivars to ozone were assessed by comparing the levels of antioxidative potential, metabolite production, growth behaviour, biomass accumulation and yield responses. The activity of catalase decreased whereas peroxidase increased in both the varieties upon exposure to O₃, however, the magnitude of change was always higher in PK 472 as compared to Bragg. The larger magnitude of reductions in the levels of antioxidants, metabolites and nutrients also reflected the greater sensitivity of PK 472 compared to Bragg. The differential response of biochemical characteristics corresponded to significant reductions in plant length, number and area of leaves, component-wise biomass and yield parameters of PK 472 as compared to Bragg. This work emphasizes the greater sensitivity of a newly developed variety PK 472 of soybean compared to that of the older variety, Bragg. Further, the effects of ozone on different plant characteristics were found to be more prominent during reproductive than vegetative growth in these two varieties. In view of the anticipated increasing tropospheric O₃ concentrations the in near future, the results of the present study can be utilized in screening out more resistant varieties of soybean for greater agricultural productivity. 3aplant growth 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3aperoxidase 3acatalase 3asoybeans 3aleaf area 3aozone 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3acrop yield 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidant activity 3adry matter partitioning 3aplant damage 3aantioxidants 3aleaves 0adry matter accumulation1 aTiwari, Supriya1 aAgrawal, Madhoolika0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2010 Jan. 31, v. 135, no. 3 p.168-177dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.09.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100106b20100205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/12/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02287naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001900164245009200183300001600275500002400291500001500315520094100330650002301271650002801294650002401322650001601346650001201362650000901374650002201383650001501405650002001420650002301440650002401463653002401487653002401511653002101535773010901556852000901665856008601674930003301760945002501793946001101818655001201829IND4428840620221120164332.0091118e20100131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442884062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ7101 aIrmler, Ulrich10aChanges in earthworm populations during conversion from conventional to organic farming  ap. 194-198.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe development of earthworms was investigated from 2001 to 2008 on the 176ha arable fields of Ritzerau Farm (northern Germany) converted 2001-2004 from conventional to organic farming. Earthworms were recorded six times per year on a grid of 85 sampling points, whereas pH was determined in 2001 and 2005 and carbon content in 2001. Weak correlations between earthworm numbers and soil pH or organic matter of soil were found for few species, except for Lumbricus castaneus which was more abundant at pH>6.5. Lumbricus rubellus benefited most from grain cultivation, Lumbricus terrestris from organic management. Aporrectodea caliginosa and Aporrectodea rosea were mainly related to rainfall and more abundant under 700-900mm rain per year. Compensation of declined abundance after a period of heavy dryness lasted 0.5-1 year.

The introduction of pastures and/or annual crops utilizing different management systems produced changes in the dynamics of soil organic matter. This study evaluated the microbial attributes of a Typic Quartzipsamment (Arenosols in FAO classification) in native vegetation, pastures, and soybean cultivation under conventional (CT) and no-till (NT) systems. The soil samples (0-5, 5-10 and 10-20cm layers) were collected in July 2005 and February 2006 from different systems: native Cerrado (CE), CT for 4 years with soybean (CT4S), CT for 4 years with soybean in rotation with millet (CT4S/M), an area that has been under pasture for 22 years (PA22), and an area that remained under pasture for 13 years, followed by NT with soybean in rotation with millet for 5 years (NT5). Soil inorganic N (nitrate and ammonium), microbial C and N and basal respiration were determined. The soil metabolic quotient (qCO₂) and the Cmic:Corg ratios were calculated. The predominant form of inorganic N in the native Cerrado (CE) and in the pasture area (PA22) was ammonium, while the conventional system (CT4S/M) and no-till system (NT5) areas presented higher nitrogen availability for crops in the form of nitrate. The microbial C and N concentrations increased in the wet season, and the highest values were found in the Cerrado (CE) and in pasture (PA22) areas, where the permanent soil cover and the lack of soil disturbance by agricultural practices allowed more favorable conditions for microbial development. The CT4S area presented the highest qCO₂ index and the lowest Cmic:Ctotal ratio, indicating that the conversion of total carbon into microbial carbon is less efficient in this system. Since sandy soils are more susceptible to degradation, the use of more conservationist management systems promotes more favorable conditions to microbial development and maintenance. 3asandy soils 3ano-tillage 3amillets 3asoil depth 3aland use 3aammonium nitrogen 3apastures 3anitrate nitrogen 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil fertility 3acerrado soils 3aGlycine max 3aconventional tillage 3asoil organic matter 3aPennisetum glaucum 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen 3asoybeans 3avegetation 3aBrazil 0acrop management1 aPiccolo, Marisa de Cássia1 aFeigl, Brigitte Josefine1 aCerri, Carlos Clemente1 aCerri, Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2010 Jan. 31, v. 135, no. 3 p.161-167dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.09.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100106b20100205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/12/04  aNon-US 7aarticle01615naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245008600169300001600255500001500271520052400286650002900810650001500839650003000854650002000884650001400904650001800918653001600936700001300952700001600965773010300981852000901084856007701093930003301170945002501203946001301228655001201241IND4362045520221120155652.0040413e20040211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436204552DNAL7 a10.1021/jf03475642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

After 3-hr incubation at 37 °C, 17.6 mM γ-Glu-Val was obtained, with the yield being 88%. γ-Glu-Val was purified on a Dowex 1 x 8 column and then identified by NMR. 3abitter-tasting compounds 3adipeptides 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3aenzyme activity 3asynthesis 3aglutamic acid 0aamino acids1 aKato, K.1 aKumagai, H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 Feb. 11, v. 52, no. 3 p.577-580x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf03475643Available from publisher's Web site  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03187naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100001900194245023900213300001800452500002400470520107700494650001501571650001601586650002301602650002701625650002001652650002201672650001901694650001601713650001501729650002301744650001101767650003001778650002201808650004001830650003201870650002101902650004601923650002301969650003801992650002902030650003302059650002302092650005902115650004102174653003102215653002902246700002002275773010002295852000902395856008802404930003302492945002502525946001102550655001202561IND4428833520221120155529.0091118e20091204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442883352DNAL7 a198538562pmid7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH000 0aQ2051 aHsu, Chia-Chen10aMicroscale solid phase extraction of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid in water and guava fruit extract using alumina-coated iron oxide nanoparticles followed by capillary electrophoresis and electrochemiluminescence detection  ap. 8575-8580.  aIncludes references  aA microscale solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using alumina-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe₃O₄@Al₂O₃ NPs) as the affinity adsorbent for glyphosate (GLY) and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in aqueous solution is reported. One milligram of Fe₃O₄@Al₂O₃ NPs was employed to extract both analytes in 5ml of aqueous solution. After 5min extraction, magnetic NPs were isolated from sample solution by employing an external magnet. Followed by rinsing the NPs with 5μl of 20mM Na₄P₂O₇ solution for 5min, the extract was directly analyzed using the derivatization-free CE-electrochemiluminescence (CE-ECL) method. With a sample-to-extract volume ratio of 1000, the enrichment factors for GLY and AMPA were 460 and 64, respectively. The limits of detection (LODs) were 0.3 and 30ngml⁻¹ for GLY and AMPA in water, respectively. The developed method was applied to the analysis of GLY in guava fruit. The LOD of GLY in guava was 0.01μgg⁻¹. Total analysis time including sample pretreatment, SPE and CE-ECL was less than 1h. 3aglyphosate 3ametabolites 3aherbicide residues 3asolid phase extraction 3awater pollution 3aaqueous solutions 3aaluminum oxide 3airon oxides 3aadsorption 3afood contamination 3aguavas 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achemiluminescence 2aElectrophoresis, Capillaryxmethods 2aFerric Compoundsxchemistry 2aFruitxchemistry 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aLimit of Detection 2aLuminescent Measurementsxmethods 2aNanoparticlesxchemistry 2aOrganophosphonatesxanalysis 2aPsidiumxchemistry 2aSolid Phase Microextractionxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0aaminomethylphosphonic acid 0aelectrochemiluminescence1 aWhang, Chen-Wen0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Dec. 4, v. 1216, no. 49 p.8575-8580dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.10.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20091201b20091204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02495naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001100154245020200165300001800367500001500385520089600400650001601296650002301312650001101335650001801346650001901364650001101383650002001394650001401414650001101428650004401439650001701483650001101500650001901511650001501530650002701545653001801572653007401590700001901664700002201683700002201705773010501727852000901832856007701841930003301918945002501951946001301976655001201989IND4362037020221120155524.0040413e20040324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436203702DNAL7 a10.1021/jf035065a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The results showed that synchrotron transmission FTIR microspectroscopy could provide spectral, chemical, and functional group characteristics of grain barley tissue at ultrahigh spatial resolutions. The spatially localized structural-chemical distributions of biological components (lignin, cellulose, protein, lipid, and carbohydrates) and biological component ratios could be imaged. Such information on molecular microstructural-chemical features within the tissue can be used for plant breeding programs for selecting superior varieties of barley for special purposes and for prediction of grain barley quality and nutritive value for humans and animals. 3afeed grains 3acarbonyl compounds 3abarley 3ahemicellulose 3aplant proteins 3astarch 3anutritive value 3acellulose 3alipids 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aseed anatomy 3alignin 3ahistochemistry 3aprediction 3anondestructive methods 0acarbohydrates 0asynchrotron transmission Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy1 aMcKinnon, J.J.1 aChristensen, C.R.1 aChristensen, D.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 Mar. 24, v. 52, no. 6 p.1484-1494x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf035065a3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/09  aOther US 7aarticle02574naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163100001700180245010800197300001600305500002400321500001500345520097100360650002501331650002301356650001701379650001001396650001501406650001901421650000701440650001601447650001901463650002101482650001601503650001001519653002301529700001801552700002001570700002001590700002601610700005401636700002701690773011201717852000901829856008601838856004901924930003301973945002502006946001302031655001202044IND4428828920221120155620.0091117e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442882892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2009.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The identification of the mite strain was achieved through microscopic observations and confirmed to be Carpoglyphus lactis (L). The diffusion of compounds produced by C. lactis during adverse external conditions is possibly achieved due to mites falling inside the oak casks. Fino wines from oak casks colonized by C. lactis (L) exhibited a more “floral” and “citric” character – such as lemon-like – than wines without mites. These attributes are related to citronellol and neral, respectively. Neral is segregated as an alarm pheromone by this strain of mite. Significant differences were also observed in terms of limpidity, which may be dependant on sample pH. In terms of gustative profile, wines colonized with mites showed higher “floral and refreshing sensations” and were more bitter. 3achemical composition 3aaromatic compounds 3awine quality 3amites 3awine aging 3aCarpoglyphidae 3apH 3aflor yeasts 3aodor compounds 3aflavor compounds 3awhite wines 3ataste 0avolatile compounds1 aOcete, Rafael1 aPedroza, Miguel1 aZalacain, Amaya1 aMiguel, Concepcion de1 aLópez Izquierdo, Ma.

  1 aJestoi, M.10aAnalysis of the Fusarium mycotoxins fusaproliferin and trichothecenes in grains using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 1464-1469.  a2019-12-04  aA method is described using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the simultaneous detection of the Fusarium mycotoxins fusaproliferin and seven trichothecenes from grains. Sample purification of the raw extract was carried out with commercial solid phase extraction columns, and the recovery of the more polar analytes was increased by rinsing the column with acetonitrile. A significant matrix effect was found for the analysis of fusaproliferin and trichothecenes; thus, the calibrants should be prepared in a blank matrix. The response was linear in the range used. The mean recovery for fusaproliferin was 60.4 or 62.9%, depending on the spiking level. With respect to the trichothecenes, the recovery was generally higher (70.2-125.3%). The method proved to be repeatable for the analysis of fusaproliferin and trichothecenes. The limit of detection for fusaproliferin in the blank matrix mixture was 50 microgram/kg, and that for trichothecenes was 5-15 microgram/kg. Thirty-eight Finnish grain samples were analyzed for fusaproliferin and trichothecenes with the method developed. Fusaproliferin was not detected in any of the samples. The mean levels of deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, nivalenol, HT-2 toxin, and T-2 toxin in Finnish grain samples were 272, 17, 150, 40, and <20 microgram/kg, respectively. 3abarley 3afood analysis 3aoats 3afood contamination 3aFusarium proliferatum 3awheat 3arye 3atrichothecenes 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3aItaly 3aFinland 0amycotoxins1 aRitieni, A.1 aRizzo, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 Mar. 24, v. 52, no. 6 p.1464-1469x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf035130g3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040831b20040901c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/08  aOther US 7aarticle03252naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163100001900180245012800199300001600327500002400343500001500367520130400382650001801686650002701704650001301731650002201744650001601766650002701782650003301809650002301842650002301865650002801888650001301916650001201929650001301941650001201954650002301966650001301989650002702002650002402029650001102053650002302064651001902087651001902106651001902125653001502144653001402159700001802173700001902191700002402210700002302234773013002257852000902387856008602396856004902482930003302531945002502564946001302589655001202602IND4428828820221120155647.0091117e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442882882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2009.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Gaertn. (syn. Butyrospermum parkii L.), Sapotaceae, is a unique natural product of African countries and is of great nutritional and commercial significance. The volatile compounds of various shea butter samples were analysed to investigate the influence of differences in manufacturing (boiling/roasting or combined procedures) on the headspace composition and with regard to the different origin of the samples. Volatile compounds were analysed by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry after headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME). Qualitative and semi-quantitative patterns of volatile compounds investigated in this study were composed of fatty acids degradation products, e.g. acetic and hexanoic acid, carbonyl compounds (hexanal, heptanal, trans-2-heptenal, 2,4-heptadienal), 2-pentylfurane, processing compounds like furfural as well as glycerol and residue compounds from technical processing steps including milling. Comparison of the volatile profile of 16 different shea butters from four African countries showed that processing steps including drying of kernels before producing the fat and additional roasting procedures influence shea butter headspace composition significantly. 3avegetable oil 3afatty acid composition 3aroasting 3amass spectrometry 3ashea butter 3asolid phase extraction 3acapillary gas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3avolatile compounds 3afood processing quality 3aglycerol 3amilling 3acatechin 3aboiling 3acarbonyl compounds 3afurfural 3ageographical variation 3aVitellaria paradoxa 3adrying 3aphenolic compounds 3aCentral Africa 3aEastern Africa 3aWestern Africa 0aSapotaceae 0aseed oils1 aKrist, Sabine1 aMasters, Eliot1 aUnterweger, Heidrun1 aBuchbauer, Gerhard0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2009 , v. 22, no. 7-8 p.738-744dAcademic PresswJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2009.02.0113Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2009.02.011  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/12/29  aOther US 7aarticle02401naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001700171245007400188300001800262500001500280520109300295650001701388650001901405650001901424650001801443650002201461650001501483650002801498650001201526650002501538653002801563653002601591653001701617700001601634700001201650700001901662773010501681852000901786856007701795930003301872945002501905946001301930655001201943IND4362038120221120150432.0040413e20040324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436203812DNAL7 a10.1021/jf034593j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We report on a new sweetpotato that exhibits mottled purple flesh attributable to high concentrations of anthocyanins. By perfusing transverse sweetpotato sections with the reactive oxygen species H2O2, followed by the H2O2 sensitive fluorochrome scopletin, we show that anthocyanins act as antioxidants in situ within the sweetpotato storage roots. We also demonstrate in vitro antioxidant activity by sweetpotato anthocyanins, where an additive effect with hydroxycinnamic acids is observed. Anthocyanic foods have been shown to offer protection against a variety of degenerative disease processes. Given that sweetpotato can be eaten several hundred grams at a time and as a staple, these data are consistent with the possibility of superior health protection by anthocyanic varieties of sweetpotato in comparison to most common fruits and vegetables. 3aanthocyanins 3asweet potatoes 3acoumaric acids 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ascopoletin 3afree radical scavengers 3amutants 3aantioxidant activity 0areactive oxygen species 0apurple sweet potatoes 0aantioxidants1 aGould, K.S.1 aLim, C.1 aFerguson, L.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 Mar. 24, v. 52, no. 6 p.1511-1513x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf034593j3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/09  aOther US 7aarticle03536naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100002200188245011200210300001600322500002400338500001500362520188000377650002202257650002602279650003002305650002502335650002102360650002002381650001202401650002702413650001602440650002202456650001602478650002402494650002702518650002102545650002002566650004202586653002102628653002402649653001702673700002302690773011202713852000902825856009102834930003302925945002502958946001102983655001202994IND4428835820221120150521.0091118e20091220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442883582DNAL7 a198538872pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aNeukum, Christoph10aQuantitative assessment of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability to contamination using numerical simulations  ap. 245-254.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIntrinsic vulnerability assessment to groundwater contamination is part of groundwater management in many areas of the world. However, popular assessment methods estimate vulnerability only qualitatively. To enhance vulnerability assessment, an approach for quantitative vulnerability assessment using numerical simulation of water flow and solute transport with transient boundary conditions and new vulnerability indicators are presented in this work. Based on a conceptual model of the unsaturated underground with distinct hydrogeological layers and site specific hydrological characteristics the numerical simulations of water flow and solute transport are applied on each hydrogeological layer with standardized conditions separately. Analysis of the simulation results reveals functional relationships between layer thickness, groundwater recharge and transit time. Based on the first, second and third quartiles of solute mass breakthrough at the lower boundary of the unsaturated zone, and the solute dilution, four vulnerability indicators are extracted. The indicator transit time t ₅₀ is the time were 50% of solute mass breakthrough passes the groundwater table. Dilution is referred as maximum solute concentration C max in the percolation water when entering the groundwater table in relation to the injected mass or solute concentration C ₀ at the ground surface. Duration of solute breakthrough is defined as the time period between 25% and 75% (t ₂₅%-t ₇₅%) of total solute mass breakthrough at the groundwater table. The temporal shape of the breakthrough curve is expressed with the quotient (t ₂₅%-t ₅₀%)/(t ₂₅%-t ₇₅%). Results from an application of this new quantitative vulnerability assessment approach, its advantages and disadvantages, and potential benefits for future groundwater management strategies are discussed. 3asimulation models 3aquantitative analysis 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater recharge 3agroundwater flow 3arisk assessment 3asolutes 3awater quality analysis 3avadose zone 3ahydrologic models 3awater table 2aComputer Simulation 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 0asolute transport 0agroundwater quality 0ahydrogeology1 aAzzam, R.q(Rafig)0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Dec. 20, v. 408, no. 2 p.245-254dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.0463Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03209naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245013000148300001600278500002400294520171600318650002802034650001902062650001402081650001902095650001502114650001402129650002302143650000702166650001302173650001002186650001402196650001202210650002402222650002702246650003102273650003402304650003102338650003602369650002802405650003302433650004302466650004902509700001702558700001602575773011502591852000902706655001202715IND4373216820221120143827.0050811e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437321682DNAL7 a147549192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheridan, J.P.10aEarly responses of resistant and susceptible potato roots during invasion by the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis  ap. 751-760.  aIncludes references  aSignals from roots of resistant (cv. Maris Piper) and susceptible (cv. Desiree) potato cultivars during invasion by second stage juveniles (J2s) of the potato cyst nematode, Globodera rostochiensis, were investigated. Novel experimental chambers enabled the recording of electrophysiological responses from roots during nematode invasion. The root cell membrane potentials were maintained throughout the 3 d required to assess invasion and feeding site development. The steady-state resting membrane potentials of Desiree were more negative than those of Maris Piper on day 1, but the reverse on day 3. After 5 d there was no difference between the two cultivars. Intracellular microelectrodes detected marked spike activity in roots after the application of J2s and there were distinct and reproducible differences between the two cultivars, with the response from Desiree being much greater than that from Maris Piper. The responses to mechanical stimulation of roots by blunt micropipettes and sharp electrodes were consistent and similar in both cultivars to the responses in Maris Piper obtained after nematode invasion, but could not account for the marked response found in Desiree. Exogenous application of exoenzymes, used to mimic nematode chemical secretions, resulted in a distinct depolarization pattern that, although similar in both cultivars, was different from patterns obtained during nematode invasion or mechanical stimulation. The pH of homogenates prepared from roots of both cultivars was measured and a Ca(2+) channel blocker was used to assess the role of Ca(2+) in nematode invasion. The results indicated a role for Ca(2+) in the signalling events that occur during nematode invasion. 3aGlobodera rostochiensis 3acell membranes 3acultivars 3acyst nematodes 3aelectrodes 3ajuveniles 3amembrane potential 3apH 3apotatoes 3aroots 3asecretion 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxphysiology 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aElectrophysiologyxmethods 2aErwiniaxgrowth & development 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMembrane Potentialsxphysiology 2aNematodaxpathogenicity 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aPlant Rootsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aSolanum tuberosumxparasitologyxphysiology.1 aMiller, A.J.1 aPerry, R.N.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2004 Mar., v. 55, no. 397 p.751-760dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008300127300001600210500019300226500002400419500001500443520150700458650002001965650001401985650001101999650001402010650001202024650002202036650001802058650001002076650002102086650001902107653001402126700001502140700001602155773014102171852000902312856008602321655001202407IND4463056120221122035114.0120419s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446305612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVernieri, P.10aGrowth control by mechanical conditioning in Salvia splendens Sellow ex Schult  ap. 307-312.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 1, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSeedlings growth is commonly controlled by chemical growth regulators, but recent legal regulations on the use of these products have caused wide changes on the practices for seedlings growth control. So, mechanical stress has been proposed as an alternative treatment for height control in some species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of mechanical stress (brushing, shaking, impedance) on height control in Salvia splendens, one of the most widely diffused bedding plants, compared with the traditional chemical method (Topflor). The use of a chemical growth regulator, Topflor, was more effective than mechanical methods in height control in Salvia splendens, cv. Flamex 2000. In details, marked differences in stem height, total dry weight and leaf area among plants treated with Topflor and control were statistically significant. Although control and all mechanical stress methods led to similar total dry weight, differences in some morphological parameters were observed: impedance and brushing significantly reduce plant height and leaf area, whereas shaking does not affect either plant size or leaf area. No significative differences were found in flower development among the treatments, in terms of both date of flowering and flower size. Moreover, abscisic acid synthesis at root level and its translocation to shoots did not seem to be affected by stress methods, suggesting no relationships among mechanical stress and chemical signalling originating from the roots. 3aseedling growth 3aflowering 3ashoots 3aleaf area 3aflowers 3amechanical stress 3aabscisic acid 3aroots 3aSalvia splendens 3abedding plants 0aimpedance1 aMugnai, S.1 aTognoni, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.307-312dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_46.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03251naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008100126300001600207500019300223500002400416520188200440650000802322650001202330650002202342650001202364650001302376650001102389650001502400650001702415650001202432650002302444650001302467650001202480650001102492650001302503650001002516650001802526700002002544700001702564773014102581852000902722856008602731655001202817IND4463056020221122035135.0120419s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446305602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalas, M.C.10aEffect of cultural practices on a sweet pepper crop in a mild winter climate  ap. 301-306.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 1, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  aAccording to the data of the SOIVRE (2000), the exports of sweet pepper during 1999-2000 in Almeria were 11063178 tm. The Spanish intensive horticulture sector has to improve its competitive position in the international markets. It is therefore necessary to improve the commercial organization and to obtain suitable products for the market, with no pesticide residues whatsoever, by using environmentally friendly production methods. Pruning or thinning techniques will provide better air circulation, which helps to reduce the incidence of diseases and opens the canopies for spraying and harvesting. The pruning technique could be a method to obtain good quality sweet pepper fruits following less aggressive methods with the environment. The aim of this work is to evaluate the combination of two types of pruning techniques and two training systems. Four experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, plants were trained with three stems by removing all side shoots, then the plants were "embraced" along their entire length by two horizontal plastic wires forming a row or hedge. The second experiment was similar to the first one but plants had only two stems. During the third one, the initial handling of the pruning technique was just like the former ones, but only three main stems and all axillary shoots were removed continuously during the whole cropping cycle; these three main stems were supported by a high wire system. The fourth experiment was similar to the previous one but only with two main stems. Fruits were graded by diameter and weight, and then analyzed to determine some quality parameters such as firmness, ºBrix and thickness. As a general conclusion, the use of a high wire training system with three main stems would be the most appropiate in a sweet pepper crop to obtain fruits of better quality, and higher early and total yields. 3aair 3aclimate 3adisease incidence 3aexports 3afirmness 3afruits 3aharvesting 3ahorticulture 3amarkets 3apesticide residues 3aplastics 3apruning 3ashoots 3aspraying 3astems 3asweet peppers1 aUrrestarazu, M.1 aCastillo, E.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.301-306dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_45.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02547naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008800131300001600219500019300235500002400428500001500452520109400467650002401561650002601585650002201611650001901633650001401652650001101666650001401677650001601691650001501707650001401722650001001736650001701746650001601763650002301779653001301802700001801815700001501833700001701848773014101865852000902006856008602015655001202101IND4463055920221122035145.0120419s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446305592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIncalcaterra, G.10aInfluences of different pollinators on winter melon grown under polyethylene tunnel  ap. 297-299.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 1, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWinter melon is an important horticultural crop in Sicily. Melon plants grown outside during the spring-summer months are normally pollinated by honey bees. Previous researches showed that early yields can be achieved by planting melon under protected cultivation during the winter. However, problems with fruit set have been associated with lack of insect pollination due to the erratic activity of the flying bees during the winter months under plastics. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of different pollinators on fruit yield and quality of winter melon grown under protected cultivation. Seedlings of a winter melon landrace were transplanted onto polyethylene tunnels. Colonies of Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia cornuta were respectively introduced into the tunnels a few days prior to anthesis. Plants exposed to O. cornuta and B. terrestris gave higher and earlier yields than those exposed to A. mellifera and open pollinated (control). This research supports the use of colonies of Bombus and Osmia as alternate pollinators to honey bees. 3ahorticultural crops 3aprotected cultivation 3aBombus terrestris 3aApis mellifera 3alandraces 3awinter 3aseedlings 3apollinators 3ahoney bees 3afruit set 3aOsmia 3apolyethylene 3afruit yield 3ainsect pollination 0aplastics1 aIapichino, G.1 aD'Anna, F.1 aSinacori, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.297-299dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_44.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02779naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009100127300001600218500019300234500002400427520142500451650004301876650001401919650001101933650001201944650001601956650001601972650001101988650001201999650001102011650001302022700001602035700001402051700001502065700002002080700001702100700001602117773014102133852000902274856008602283655001202369IND4463062020221122022445.0120419s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446306202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimaldi, C.10aStudy of the distribution of photoassimilates in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill)  ap. 579-583.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 2, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  aWith the aim of evaluating the distribution of assimilates in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill), a trial under greenhouse was carried out with plants in hydroponic solution. The treatments were: H1; H2 and H3: Controls with the first, second and third leaf (among the first and the second truss) supplied with glucose [ C 14 (U) ] respectively H4: Pruning of the third leaf between trusses and the second leaf supplied. The pruning was done 25 days after the anthesis of the first cluster, the leaves were supplied in all treatments. 24 hours later, the plants were fractionated in root, shoot, basal leaves, expanded leaves, non expanded leaves, 1st , 2nd and 3rd trusses and apex. The plant material remained in stove up to constant weight. The samples were digested with OHNa 9N, homogenized, and scintillating solution Bray + cab-o-sil at 5% was added. The activity of the samples were measured in a Beckman LS 100 C liquid scintillation counter. The pruning of the third leaf modified the pattern distribution of assimilates in the plant. The group of clusters were the most important sinks in all treatments, reaching the highest value in H4 (70%). The stem was an important sink in all treatments. The highest contribution to it (30%) was done by the second leaf (H2). The removal of the third leaf increased the amount of assimilates entering the fruits and decreased the amount of glucose entering the stem. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aflowering 3afruits 3aglucose 3agreenhouses 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3apruning 3ashoots 3atomatoes1 aCarbone, A.1 aGarbi, M.1 aGarcia, N.1 aBarrenechea, M.1 aMartinez, S.1 aGimemez, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.579-583dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_86.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02526naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245021100130300001400341500002400355520126900379650002301648650001501671650001401686650002001700650002301720650001401743650000901757650001301766650001101779650001901790650001401809650001301823650001501836650001301851650001401864650002201878650001101900650001001911650001001921700002201931773013001953852000902083655001202092IND4463068320221122022753.0120420s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446306832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Mark G.10aEgg Parasitism by Trissolcus basalis (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) in Architecturally Varied Habitats, and Observations on Parasitism in Macadamia Nut Orchards and Other Habitats Following Augmentative Release  ap. 23-31.  aIncludes references  aThe ability of T. basalis to locate and parasitize Nezara viridula eggs was investigated in habitats with different architectures (monocot, broad leaf shrubs, mixed weeds). Trissolcus basalis demonstrated a significant preference for searching in weedy habitats dominated by Crotalaria pallida. Dispersal and host utilization efficiency of T. basalis was quantified in macadamia orchards on trees and weeds, and in weed- infested pastures. Parasitism of N. viridula eggs in macadamia nut orchards on trees and weeds was low. In weedy pasture the effects of predation (42% of eggs destroyed) and parasitism (approximately 16% of eggs destroyed) appeared to be greater than in orchards. Quantification of the level of indispensable mortality contributed by T. basalis and predatory insects is needed. While augmentative release of T. basalis in macadamia nut orchards shows little potential for suppression of N. viridula, releases in weedy habitats adjacent to orchards may contribute to reducing numbers of N. viridula moving into orchards from surrounding habitat by increasing mortality at the egg stage. The economics of implementing augmentative releases of T. basalis in macadamia nut production will likely render augmentative release strategies impractical. 3aCrotalaria pallida 3aLiliopsida 3aMacadamia 3aNezara viridula 3aTrissolcus basalis 3aeconomics 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3amacadamia nuts 3amortality 3aorchards 3aparasitism 3apastures 3apredation 3apredatory insects 3ashrubs 3atrees 3aweeds1 aDiez, Joselito M.0 tProceedings of the Hawaiian Entomological Society.g2011 Dec., v. 43 p.23-31dHawaiian Entomological Societyx0073-134X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003400133040001800167100001500185245015400200500002400354500001500378506007600393520133300469506003701802650001701839650002801856650001601884650002701900650001501927650001801942650001401960650001001974650001701984650001502001650001402016650001502030650002602045650002302071650002602094650004102120650004302161650001402204653001002218653001802228700002002246700001902266700001802285773005302303852000902356856008402365655001202449IND4463042520221207060314.0120417s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446304252DNAL7 a218961602pmid7 aPMC31751732pmcid7 a10.1186/1471-2229-11-1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Imke10aFatty acid profiles and their distribution patterns in microalgae: a comprehensive analysis of more than 2000 strains from the SAG culture collection  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmong the various biochemical markers, fatty acids or lipid profiles represent a chemically relatively inert class of compounds that is easy to isolate from biological material. Fatty acid (FA) profiles are considered as chemotaxonomic markers to define groups of various taxonomic ranks in flowering plants, trees and other embryophytes. Results The fatty acid profiles of 2076 microalgal strains from the culture collection of algae of Göttingen University (SAG) were determined in the stationary phase. Overall 76 different fatty acids and 10 other lipophilic substances were identified and quantified. The obtained FA profiles were added into a database providing information about fatty acid composition. Using this database we tested whether FA profiles are suitable as chemotaxonomic markers. FA distribution patterns were found to reflect phylogenetic relationships at the level of phyla and classes. In contrast, at lower taxonomic levels, e.g. between closely related species and even among multiple isolates of the same species, FA contents may be rather variable. Conclusion FA distribution patterns are suitable chemotaxonomic markers to define taxa of higher rank in algae. However, due to their extensive variation at the species level it is difficult to make predictions about the FA profile in a novel isolate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aembryophytes 3ainterspecific variation 3afatty acids 3afatty acid composition 3abiomarkers 3achemotaxonomy 3aphylogeny 3atrees 3aAngiospermae 3amicroalgae 3adatabases 3aprediction 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aDatabases, Factual 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMicroalgaexchemistryxclassification. 2aPhylogeny 0aAlgae 0aMagnoliophyta1 aHodac, Ladislav1 aFriedl, Thomas1 aFeussner, Ivo0 tBMC Plant biology.g2011, v. 11x1471-22297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-11-1243Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03595naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003400133040001800167100002000185245009200205500002400297500001500321506007600336520139800412506003701810650002201847650001401869650001101883650001301894650002801907650001901935650001901954650000801973650001001981650001401991650001902005650001302024650001502037650001702052650001802069650001102087650003502098650001302133650002802146650001902174650001802193650002202211650002602233650005102259650003402310650003602344650002502380650002202405650002702427650001802454653002502472700002202497700002002519700001702539700002002556700002602576700002002602700001602622700001602638700002202654700001502676773005302691852000902744856008402753655001202837IND4463041120221207060505.0120417s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446304112DNAL7 a219517882pmid7 aPMC31913342pmcid7 a10.1186/1471-2229-11-1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaseneyer, Grit10aFrom RNA-seq to large-scale genotyping - genomics resources for rye (Secale cereale L.)  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground The improvement of agricultural crops with regard to yield, resistance and environmental adaptation is a perpetual challenge for both breeding and research. Exploration of the genetic potential and implementation of genome-based breeding strategies for efficient rye (Secale cereale L.) cultivar improvement have been hampered by the lack of genome sequence information. To overcome this limitation we sequenced the transcriptomes of five winter rye inbred lines using Roche/454 GS FLX technology. Results More than 2.5 million reads were assembled into 115,400 contigs representing a comprehensive rye expressed sequence tag (EST) resource. From sequence comparisons 5,234 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified to develop the Rye5K high-throughput SNP genotyping array. Performance of the Rye5K SNP array was investigated by genotyping 59 rye inbred lines including the five lines used for sequencing, and five barley, three wheat, and two triticale accessions. A balanced distribution of allele frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 was observed. Residual heterozygosity of the rye inbred lines varied from 4.0 to 20.4% with higher average heterozygosity in the pollen compared to the seed parent pool. Conclusions The established sequence and molecular marker resources will improve and promote genetic and genomic research as well as genome-based breeding in rye.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asequence analysis 3acultivars 3abarley 3abreeding 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aSecale cereale 3aheterozygosity 3arye 3awheat 3atriticale 3agene frequency 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ainbred lines 3atranscriptome 3apollen 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aBreeding 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Frequency 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenomicsxmethods 2aGenotyping Techniques 2aHigh-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencingxmethods 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSecalexgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTranscriptome 0anucleotide sequences1 aSchmutzer, Thomas1 aSeidel, Michael1 aZhou, Ruonan1 aMascher, Martin1 aSchön, Chris-Carolin1 aTaudien, Stefan1 aScholz, Uwe1 aStein, Nils1 aMayer, Klaus F.X.1 aBauer, Eva0 tBMC Plant biology.g2011, v. 11x1471-22297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-11-1313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03784naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003400133040001800167100002200185245015900207500002400366506007600390520161900466506003702085650001702122650001802139650001602157650002502173650001502198650001402213650001702227650001402244650002402258650001802282650001202300650001402312650001402326650002002340650002902360650002402389650005202413650002602465650003002491650006002521650002802581650001402609650004202623650002502665650002702690700002402717700001902741700002202760700002302782700001902805700002502824700002002849700002302869700002002892700002202912700001802934773005302952852000903005856008403014655001203098IND4463041920221207060347.0120417s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446304192DNAL7 a219432272pmid7 aPMC31914822pmcid7 a10.1186/1471-2229-11-1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVannerum, Katrijn10aTranscriptional analysis of cell growth and morphogenesis in the unicellular green alga Micrasterias (Streptophyta), with emphasis on the role of expansin  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground Streptophyte green algae share several characteristics of cell growth and cell wall formation with their relatives, the embryophytic land plants. The multilobed cell wall of Micrasterias denticulata that rebuilds symmetrically after cell division and consists of pectin and cellulose, makes this unicellular streptophyte alga an interesting model system to study the molecular controls on cell shape and cell wall formation in green plants. Results Genome-wide transcript expression profiling of synchronously growing cells identified 107 genes of which the expression correlated with the growth phase. Four transcripts showed high similarity to expansins that had not been examined previously in green algae. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these genes are most closely related to the plant EXPANSIN A family, although their domain organization is very divergent. A GFP-tagged version of the expansin-resembling protein MdEXP2 localized to the cell wall and in Golgi-derived vesicles. Overexpression phenotypes ranged from lobe elongation to loss of growth polarity and planarity. These results indicate that MdEXP2 can alter the cell wall structure and, thus, might have a function related to that of land plant expansins during cell morphogenesis. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the potential of M. denticulata as a unicellular model system, in which cell growth mechanisms have been discovered similar to those in land plants. Additionally, evidence is provided that the evolutionary origins of many cell wall components and regulatory genes in embryophytes precede the colonization of land.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMicrasterias 3acell division 3acell growth 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3acellulose 3aembryophytes 3aexpansins 3agene overexpression 3amorphogenesis 3apectins 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aregulator genes 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aMicrasteriasxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aHuysman, Marie J.J.1 aRycke, Riet de1 aVuylsteke, Marnik1 aLeliaert, Frederik1 aPollier, Jacob1 aLütz-Meindl, Ursula1 aGillard, Jeroen1 aVeylder, Lieven de1 aGoossens, Alain1 aInzé, D.q(Dirk)1 aVyverman, Wim0 tBMC Plant biology.g2011, v. 11x1471-22297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-11-1283Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04397naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003400133040001800167100001200185245012700197500002400324500001500348506007600363520212000439506003702559650001602596650002702612650002402639650001402663650002602677650001002703650002202713650002402735650000902759650001202768650001902780650001802799650002002817650001702837650002802854650002002882650001302902650001702915650000802932650002202940650002102962650005702983650002803040650002803068650004603096650003803142650001703180650005503197650002703252650002703279650005703306653001003363700001703373700001303390700002003403700001503423700001703438700001603455700001703471700001703488773005303505852000903558856008403567655001203651IND4463048520221207074437.0120418s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446304852DNAL7 a221959732pmid7 aPMC33116282pmcid7 a10.1186/1471-2229-11-1802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Tao10aAnalysis of expression sequence tags from a full-length-enriched cDNA library of developing sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum)  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground Sesame (Sesamum indicum) is one of the most important oilseed crops with high oil contents and rich nutrient value. However, genetic improvement efforts in sesame could not get benefit from molecular biology technology due to poor DNA and RNA sequence resources. In this study, we carried out a large scale of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) sequencing from developing sesame seeds and further conducted analysis on seed storage products-related genes. Results A normalized and full-length enriched cDNA library from 5 approximately 30 days old immature seeds was constructed and randomly sequenced, leading to generation of 41,248 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) which then formed 4,713 contigs and 27,708 singletons with 44.9% uniESTs being putative full-length open reading frames. Approximately 26,091 of all these uniESTs have significant matches to the counterparts in Nr database of GenBank, and 21,628 of them were assigned to one or more Gene ontology (GO) terms. Homologous genes involved in oil biosynthesis were identified including some conservative transcription factors regulating oil biosynthesis such as LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), PICKLE (PKL), WRINKLED1 (WRI1) and majority of them were found for the first time in sesame seeds. One hundred and 17 ESTs were identified possibly involved in biosynthesis of sesame lignans, sesamin and sesamolin. In total, 9,347 putative functional genes from developing seeds were identified, which accounts for one third of total genes in the sesame genome. Further analysis of the uniESTs identified 1,949 non-redundant simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Conclusions This study has provided an overview of genes expressed during sesame seed development. This collection of sesame full-length cDNAs covered a wide variety of genes in seeds, in particular, candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of sesame oils and lignans. These EST sequences enriched with full length will contribute to comparative genomic studies on sesame and other oilseed plants and serve as an abundant information platform for functional marker development and functional gene study.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asesame seed 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aopen reading frames 3adatabases 3atranscription factors 3aseeds 3acomplementary DNA 3agenetic improvement 3aoils 3alignans 3acDNA libraries 3aoilseed crops 3aSesamum indicum 3abiosynthesis 3aexpressed sequence tags 3anutritive value 3agenomics 3aseed storage 3aRNA 3amolecular biology 3aseed development 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSesame Oilxmetabolism 2aSesamumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0agenes1 aDong, Caihua1 aMao, Han1 aZhao, Yingzhong1 aChen, Hong1 aLiu, Hongyan1 aDong, Xuyan1 aTong, Chaobo1 aLiu, Shengyi0 tBMC Plant biology.g2011, v. 11x1471-22297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-11-1803Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03867naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003400133040001800167100002400185245012500209500002400334506007600358520207600434506003702510650001902547650001202566650001102578650002102589650001502610650001702625650001102642650002702653650002502680650002802705650003502733650001102768650002602779650003202805650001302837650001702850650001502867650002702882650003802909650001402947650002702961650003602988700002203024700003203046700002303078700002203101700002003123773005303143852000903196856008403205655001203289IND4463048220221207053849.0120418s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446304822DNAL7 a222044902pmid7 aPMC32925392pmcid7 a10.1186/1471-2229-11-1832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuzanneau, Jérôme10aAssociation study between the gibberellic acid insensitive gene and leaf length in a Lolium perenne L. synthetic variety  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground Association studies are of great interest to identify genes explaining trait variation since they deal with more than just a few alleles like classical QTL analyses. They are usually performed using collections representing a wide range of variability but which could present a genetic substructure. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that association studies can be performed using synthetic varieties obtained after several panmictic generations. This demonstration is based on an example of association between the gibberellic acid insensitive gene (GAI) polymorphism and leaf length polymorphism in 'Herbie', a synthetic variety of perennial ryegrass. Methods Leaf growth parameters, consisted of leaf length, maximum leaf elongation rate (LERmax) and leaf elongation duration (LED), were evaluated in spring and autumn on 216 plants of Herbie with three replicates. For each plant, a sequence of 370 bp in GAI was analysed for polymorphism. Results Genetic effect was highly significant for all traits. Broad sense heritabilities were higher for leaf length and LERmax with about 0.7 in each period and 0.5 considering both periods than for LED with about 0.4 in each period and 0.3 considering both periods. GAI was highly polymorphic with an average of 12 bp between two consecutive SNPs and 39 haplotypes in which 9 were more frequent. Linkage disequilibrium declined rapidly with distance with r 2 values lower than 0.2 beyond 150 bp. Sequence polymorphism of GAI explained 8-14% of leaf growth parameter variation. A single SNP explained 4% of the phenotypic variance of leaf length in both periods which represents a difference of 33 mm on an average of 300 mm. Conclusions Synthetic varieties in which linkage disequilibrium declines rapidly with distance are suitable for association studies using the "candidate gene" approach. GAI polymorphism was found to be associated with leaf length polymorphism which was more correlated to LERmax than to LED in Herbie. It is a good candidate to explain leaf length variation in other plant material.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLolium perenne 3aalleles 3aautumn 3agibberellic acid 3ahaplotypes 3aheritability 3aleaves 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspring 3asynthetic populations 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenotype 2aGibberellins 2aHaplotypes 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aLoliumxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Leavesxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide1 aHuyghe, Christian1 aEscobar-Gutierrez, Abraham.1 aJulier, Bernadette1 aGastal, François1 aBarre, Philippe0 tBMC Plant biology.g2011, v. 11x1471-22297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-11-1833Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02347naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009000127300001400217500019300231500002400424520103900448650003801487650001001525650001601535650001501551650000901566650000901575650002601584650002101610650001101631650001001642700001601652700002101668700001701689700002201706773013901728852000901867856008501876655001201961IND4463051420221121222231.0120419s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446305142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaroto, J.V.10aEvaluation of the biennial performance of Dolichos lablab L. in protected cultivation  ap. 81-84.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 1, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  aResearch was conducted over two seasons (1997-98 and 1998-99) to determine the productive potential of green pods during the first and the second year plants, studying two different sowing dates and using a local accession of the botany variety albiflorus D.C. of Dolichos lablab L.

Harvesting began in March and April 1998 respectively in the first season, and in November 1998 (in both sowing dates) in the second season. The pods were harvested in an immature state twice a week and then counted and weighed. The accumulated autumn-winter-spring yields were higher with the second-year plants, but later yields were similar to those of the one-year old plants, and in both cases very high, up to 4.76 kg per plant. No significant differences in average pod weight were detected between both types of plants in study. The autumn-winter yields were higher with the earliest sowings. 3aLablab purpureus subsp. purpureus 3abeans 3agreenhouses 3aharvesting 3apeat 3apods 3aprotected cultivation 3asandy loam soils 3asowing 3atrays1 aPascual, B.1 aSan Bautista, B.1 aFresquet, J.1 aLopez-Galarza, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.81-84dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_9.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04958naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001400213500019300227500002400420520354900444650002103993650001204014650000904026650001104035650001004046650001704056650002404073650002604097650000904123650002104132650001704153650001704170650002004187650002204207651001104229700001504240700001704255700001904272773013904291852000904430856008504439655001204524IND4463050920221121222112.0120419s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446305092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Malfa, G.10aInnovative trends in shelter characteristics for protected horticulture in Sicily  ap. 47-51.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 1, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  aThe protected cultivation of horticultural crops based mainly on the use of plastic as material for covering the structures, is progressively going through an evolutionary process that also concerns the shelter typologies. The process in Sicily, as well as in other Italian regions, is in response to the needs of: a) adapting shelters to plant shape and size and to canopy volumes; b) mitigating stressing climatic conditions occurring in unheated plastic greenhouses; c) promoting the setting up and the spreading of more sustainable cultivation protocols. Concerning the first requirement, more and more new shelters have appeared. The most significant - apart from mini tunnels and direct covers – are walk-in medium-sized tunnels, still home-made but now set up with metal structures, to protect melons, strawberries and other shallow vegetable crops. They are now very common along the eastern Mediterranean coast of Sicily especially for melon production. The present diversification of shelters used to protect table grapes in order to have an earlier or later production can also be referred to the same requirement. A particular shelter typology (tendone) is widely diffused with the covering material applied either on a whole plant line or for each single plant (fazzoletto); tunnels, saddle roof and multi-span greenhouses (capanna and capannina) are also used for earlier production. In order to control the stressing conditions, we should underline the progressive substitution of traditional wooden greenhouses for growing vegetables and flowers with the new typologies that are being built, more and more, with new materials and criteria. Greenhouses with bent and wooden roofs, double covered to reduce heat losses during the night are now used; other changes concern roof shape rounding in order to make positioning the plastic film on the structure easier and cheaper. Concerning the materials we also report the use of galvanised pipes, mainly for building tunnels or multi-tunnels. Wooden greenhouses are disappearing more and more, while wooden components are still being used together with concrete piles. A common innovation for new greenhouses is the raising of their height thus achieving more unitary volumes; roof openings are also used but they have consequences on the criteria for double covering application. With the aim of improving ventilation, the adoption of roof windows or other similar devices is now considered for table grape shelters too, especially large multi tunnels or multi-span structures. In relation to the aim of setting up new cultivation methods, or improving the previous ones, we must stress the use of higher greenhouses and/or arranged so as to make it easier for them to be covered with shading nets. This allows a reduction of seasonal as well as daily thermal excursions and consequently a more prolonged utilisation of the greenhouses all year long. Within the framework of new cultivation protocols we would like to point out the wide use of plastic nets applied on shelter windows so to avoid the entrance of dangerous insects as well as keeping the pronubes, released to promote the fruit setting, inside the greenhouse. Increasing attention is finally being paid to the shape and the slope of greenhouse roofs, in order to collect rain water, as well as to the devices for soilless culture. New shelter typologies will surely go on being created as the need for further improvement in productive processes for yield, quality and sustainability becomes more and more pressing. 3aclimatic factors 3aflowers 3aheat 3amelons 3apipes 3aplastic film 3aplastic greenhouses 3aprotected cultivation 3arain 3asoilless culture 3astrawberries 3atable grapes 3avegetable crops 3avegetable growing 3aSicily1 aCicala, A.1 aLa Malfa, S.1 aPulvirenti, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.47-51dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_4.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02652naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009600124300001600220500019300236500002400429520108000453650002001533650001201553650001401565650001801579650001101597650001101608650001401619650002001633650002101653650002001674650003501694650001201729650002401741650001701765650001101782650001101793650002101804650001001825650002301835700001701858700001201875700001901887700001601906773014101922852000902063856008602072655001202158IND4463054420221121222022.0120419s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446305442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColla, G.10aEffects of substrates on yield, quality and mineral composition of soilless-grown cucumbers  ap. 205-209.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 1, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  aCucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L.) were grown in soilless culture under greenhouse conditions at the Experimental farm of University of Tuscia, Central Italy to evaluate the effects of four substrates (rockwool, pumice, perlite, and coir) on growth, yield, fruit quality, and plant mineral composition. Plants grown in coir, perlite and pumice yielded more than those grown in rockwool. Similar results were obtained for dry weight of leaves, stems, and fruits. Fruit quality in term of dry matter, soluble solid content, titratable acidity, and pH was not significant affected by treatments. Concentrations of K and Na were highest in nutrient solution, and fruits of coir treatment while perlite and pumice treatments had highest Ca concentration in nutrient solution, leaves and fruits. Phosphorus and Mg were highest in nutrient solution and plant organs of coir treatment, respectively. The above findings may be explain by the different chemical and physical properties of substrates and their interaction with nutrient solution composition and plant nutrient uptake. 3aCucumis sativus 3acalcium 3acucumbers 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aperlite 3aphysical properties 3aplant organs 3apumice 3asodium 3asoilless culture 3astems 3atitratable acidity1 aSaccardo, F.1 aRea, E.1 aPierandrei, F.1 aSalerno, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.205-209dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_29.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02265naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009800123300001600221500019300237500002400430500001500454520100000469650002001469650001801489650002601507650002101533650001701554650001301571650001601584653001801600700001901618700001301637700001701650773014101667852000901808856008601817655001201903IND4463054020221121222025.0120419s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446305402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoca, D.10aNitrate and water uptake rates on a short term basis by a rose soilless crop under greenhouse  ap. 181-187.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate: Product and Process Innovation, Volume 1, held March 5-8, 2002, Ragusa-Sicilia, Italy.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA study of a rose crop in a hydroponic recirculating system, has been carried out to measure the hourly balance of water and nitrate uptake, as a basic information for soilless culture management. Our results suggest different trends in the NO3- uptake pattern, depending on environmental conditions. Effects of global radiation are shown. The close relationship between global radiation and water uptake has already been shown, but nitrate uptake is not so clearly related either to solar radiation or to transpiration. The use of different shading covers during Spring and Summer to avoid the incidence of excessive radiation on the greenhouse, seems to affect the NO3- uptake rate during the day hours. The NO3- uptake rate along the night hours was kept in the range of 0.013 to 0.067 mmol.plant-1.h-1, independently of the inside radiation range of the previous day. An oscillatory pattern of NO3- uptake has been observed along the night, with a 3 to 4 hours interval between oscillations. 3asolar radiation 3atranspiration 3aenvironmental factors 3asoilless culture 3awater uptake 3anitrates 3agreenhouses 0awater balance1 aMartinez, P.F.1 aSuay, R.1 aMartinez, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 Sept., , no. 614 p.181-187dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/614/614_25.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01963naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002100139245005700160300001600217500001500233520103300248650001101281650001601292650001501308650001101323650000701334650001201341653002001353700001801373773010001391852000901491856007901500939003301579946001301612655001201625IND9302568420221121124338.0930428e199001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930256842DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00091a0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutherford, S.M.10aGuanidination of lysine in selected dietary proteins  ap. 209-211.  a2019-12-04  aLysine in proteins can be converted to homoarginine by the guanidination reaction with O-methylisourea (MIU). Food proteins in which all the lysine has been converted to homoarginine can be used in nutrition studies to directly determine endogenous lysine excretion from the gut. The pH of the reaction solution is known to affect the completeness of conversion of lysine to homoarginine. Optimum pHs of 11.0, 10.7, and 10.8 were found for sodium caseinate, gelatin, and soy isolate protein, respectively, when 2% (w/v) of each protein in 0.6 M MIU was incubated at 20 degrees C for 144 h. As the protein concentration in 0.6 M MIU was increased above 2% (w/v), the extent of conversion declined markedly for sodium caseinate and the soy isolate but there was only a very small decline for gelatin. With gelatin, a maximum conversion of lysine to homoarginine of 95% was achieved, indicating that guanidinated gelatin is a suitable protein source for directly determining the endogenous excretion of lysine in the mammalian gut. 3alysine 3asoy protein 3aguanidines 3acasein 3apH 3agelatin 0adietary protein1 aMoughan, P.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.209-211x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00091a0463Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01900naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007800168300001600246500002400262520096300286650002601249650001201275650001401287650001901301650002501320650002401345650001901369650001601388700001901404773009401423852000901517856004801526655001201574IND4423657720221121032020.0090724e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442365772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-009-9854-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiontkovski, S.

The results of the multiple regression analysis showed that the decline in zooplankton biomass was positively related to the NAO-index and to phosphate concentration. We also found that the depth of the thermocline has decreased over the period of our investigation. Thus, the decline we report in zooplankton biomass may be related to the combined effect of two phenomena driven by global temperature increase: (1) the widening of the distributional range of tropical species due to the expansion of the 'tropical belt' and (2) a decrease in primary production resulting from the thinning of the thermocline. The decline of zooplankton biomass we report suggests that global warming of the ocean may be altering tropical food webs, and through them, it may also indirectly impact tropical oceans biogeochemical cycles. 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3afood webs 3aglobal warming 3aprimary productivity 3aregression analysis 3atropical foods 3azooplankton1 aCastellani, C.0 tHydrobiologia.g2009 Oct., v. 632, no. 1 p.365-370dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9854-1 7aarticle02983naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245012000169300001800289500002400307520150000331650001701831650002101848650004301869650002101912650001001933650001901943650002201962650001601984650001002000650001902010650001202029650003002041650001102071650000902082650002502091650003302116650002402149650002402173650001402197650001002211651001802221700002402239700002302263700002402286773011002310852000902420856004802429655001202477IND4411669820221121022024.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441166982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-008-0843-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchleitner, Andreas10aGenetic diversity among oat varieties of worldwide origin and associations of AFLP markers with quantitative traits  ap. 1041-1053.  aIncludes references  aOne hundred and fourteen oat (Avena sativa L.) varieties of worldwide origin were evaluated for genetic diversity based on 77 molecular polymorphisms produced by eight selective AFLP primer combinations. Genetic similarity, calculated using the DICE coefficient, was used for cluster analysis and principal component analysis was applied. In addition population structure was explored to identify discrete subpopulations based on allele frequency. Although clustering and population structure showed relationships with region and country of origin, there was no obvious relationship to hull presence or hull colour. Oat varieties originating from European breeding programs showed less diversity than varieties originating from North and South America. Associations between AFLP markers and agronomic traits (grain yield, groat yield, panicle emergence, plant height, and lodging) as well as kernel quality traits (kernel weight, test weight, screening percent and groat percent) were also investigated. Marker-trait associations were tested using a naïve simple regression model and five additional models that account for population structure. Significant associations were found for 23 AFLP markers, with many of these affecting multiple traits. This study demonstrates that diversity can be significantly enhanced using a global collection, and provides evidence for marker-trait associations that can be validated in segregating populations and exploited through marker-assisted selection. 3aAvena sativa 3aagronomic traits 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3ahulls 3ainflorescences 3alodging 3amarker-assisted selection 3amodels 3aoats 3apopulation structure 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative traits 3aregression analysis 3ascreening 3aseeds 3aSouth America1 aTinker, Nicholas A.1 aZechner, Elisabeth1 aBuerstmayr, Hermann0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2008 Nov., v. 117, no. 7 p.1041-1053dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-008-0843-y 7aarticle03151naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245009600195300001400291500002400305500001500329520162900344650002501973650001301998650004202011650001502053650001402068650001702082650002002099650002602119650002002145650001002165650001902175650001902194650003102213650001102244650005302255650001502308650002902323650002702352650004202379653001502421700001702436700001902453773010902472852000902581856005502590655001202645IND4385669220221121021857.0061203e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438566922DNAL7 a171778752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01604.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMISHINA, TATIANA E.10aExpression of a nitric oxide degrading enzyme induces a senescence programme in Arabidopsis  ap. 39-52.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNitric oxide (NO) has been proposed to act as a factor delaying leaf senescence and fruit maturation in plants. Here we show that expression of a NO degrading dioxygenase (NOD) in Arabidopsis thaliana initiates a senescence-like phenotype, an effect that proved to be more pronounced in older than in younger leaves. This senescence phenotype was preceded by a massive switch in gene expression in which photosynthetic genes were down-regulated, whereas many senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase gene ACS6 involved in ethylene synthesis were up-regulated. External fumigation of NOD plants with NO as well as environmental conditions known to stimulate endogenous NO production attenuated the induced senescence programme. For instance, both high light conditions and nitrate feeding reduced the senescence phenotype and attenuated the down-regulation of photosynthetic genes as well as the up-regulation of SAGs. Treatment of plants with the cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurin (BAP) reduced the down-regulation of photosynthesis, although it had no consistent effect on SAG expression. Metabolic changes during NOD-induced senescence comprehended increases in salicylic acid (SA) levels, accumulation of the phytoalexin camalexin and elevation of leaf γ-tocopherol contents, all of which occurred during natural senescence in Arabidopsis leaves as well. Moreover, NO fumigation delayed the senescence process induced by darkening individual Arabidopsis Columbia-0 (Col-0) leaves. Our data thus support the notion that NO acts as a negative regulator of leaf senescence. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aethylene 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3afumigation 3aphenotype 3anitric oxide 3alight intensity 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3agenes 3asalicylic acid 3aphotosynthesis 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aHydrolysis 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aOxygenasesxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxphysiology. 0asenescence1 aLamb, Chris.1 aZEIER, JÜRGEN0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2007 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.39-52dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01604.x 7aarticle02270naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008500131300001800216500002400234520120400258650001401462650001601476650001001492650002001502650001001522650001201532650002301544650003301567650001701600650002301617650001101640650001201651700001901663700002001682700001901702700001501721773013901736852000901875655001201884IND4435913320221120230547.0100423e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443591332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoss-Moore, L.A.10aEpigenetics and fetal adaptation to perinatal events: Diversity through fidelity  ap. E216-E222.  aIncludes references  aPerinatal insults, including fetal undernutrition and hypoxia, are associated with an increased susceptibility to several adult-onset metabolic disorders. These include cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and obesity. However, the mechanisms driving the long-term phenotypic consequences have only recently begun to be elucidated. A primary mechanism accounting for perinatal adaptation is the epigenetic modification of chromatin. In this context, epigenetic modifications to chromatin are thought to arise in response to a perinatal insult in an effort to modulate gene expression and maximize fetal survival. In this symposium report, we discuss epigenetics as a mechanism by which perinatal adaptations can be made by the developing fetus. We examine the benefits of using multiple in vivo models to understand the interrelation of signals that come together and result in perinatal adaptation. Epigenetic effects on IGF-1 arising from a perinatal insult are discussed, as are the difficulties and challenges associated with this complex field. In conclusion, epigenetics provides a means of modulating gene transcription, thus allowing fetal adaptation to a broad variety of conditions. 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3afetus 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amalnutrition 3ametabolic diseases 3amodels 3aobesity1 aMetcalfe, D.B.1 aAlbertine, K.H.1 aMcKnight, R.A.1 aLane, R.H.0 tJournal of animal science.g2010 Apr., v. 88, no. 13_electronic_suppl p.E216-E222dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245011800190300001600308500002400324520110800348650001601456650002801472650000801500650001801508650001601526650001301542650001001555650001101565650001201576650001101588650001101599650001201610650001301622650001901635650001401654650001301668650002001681650001001701650001201711650001701723650002601740650006601766650002001832650002301852650002901875650002701904650005901931650001701990650003302007650002002040650001302060650004002073650002902113650001402142650003302156650004202189650004302231700001602274700002102290700002502311700001702336700002002353773009702373852000902470856005502479655001202534IND4458942120221120215718.0110610e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445894212DNAL7 a214573662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04555.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVain, Philippe12aA T-DNA mutation in the RNA helicase eIF4A confers a dose-dependent dwarfing phenotype in Brachypodium distachyon  ap. 929-940.  aIncludes references  aIn a survey of the BrachyTAG mutant population of Brachypodium distachyon, we identified a line carrying a T-DNA insertion in one of the two eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) genes present in the nuclear genome. The eif4a homozygous mutant plants were slow-growing, and exhibited reduced final plant stature due to a decrease in both cell number and cell size, consistent with roles for eIF4A in both cell division and cell growth. Hemizygous plants displayed a semi-dwarfing phenotype, in which stem length was reduced but leaf length was normal. Linkage between the insertion site and phenotype was confirmed, and we show that the level of eIF4A protein is strongly reduced in the mutant. Transformation of the Brachypodium homozygous mutant with a genomic copy of the Arabidopsis eIF4A-1 gene partially complemented the growth phenotype, indicating that gene function is conserved between mono- and dicotyledonous species. This study identifies eIF4A as a novel dose-dependent regulator of stem elongation, and demonstrates the utility of Brachypodium as a model for grass and cereals research. 3aArabidopsis 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aRNA 3acell division 3acell growth 3adwarfing 3agenes 3agrains 3agrasses 3aleaves 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3anuclear genome 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3astem elongation 3astems 3asurveys 3atransfer DNA 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBrachypodiumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aCells, Cultured 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factor-4Axgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGenotype 2aInflorescencexgrowth & development 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Leavesxultrastructure 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aThole, Vera1 aWorland, Barbara1 aOpanowicz, Magdalena1 aBush, Max S.1 aDoonan, John H.0 tplant journal.g2011 June, v. 66, no. 6 p.929-940dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04555.x 7aarticle03818naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245017800178300001800356500002400374520151000398650001601908650001501924650001401939650001201953650002501965650001801990650001702008650001002025650001502035650001602050650001102066650001002077650001802087650001502105650001302120650002102133650001302154650001702167650002402184650001202208650007202220650005902292650002302351650004602374650004402420650003802464650006102502650001102563650002802574650001302602650003202615650001702647650006602664650002302730650002702753650007002780700002202850700002602872700001902898773011602917852000903033856007803042655001203120IND4411254820221120215521.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441125482DNAL7 a187829082pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ern2152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRonceret, Arnaud14aThe alpha-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase gene is transcriptionally activated in male and female gametes prior to fertilization and is essential for seed development in Arabidopsis  ap. 3649-3659.  aIncludes references  aSugar residues in proteoglycan complexes carry important signalling and regulatory functions in biology. In humans, heparan sulphate is an example of such a complex polymer containing glucosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine residues and is present in the extracellular matrix. Although heparan sulphate has not been found in plants, the At5g13690 gene encoding the alpha-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAGLU), an enzyme involved in its catabolism, is present in the Arabidopsis genome. Among our collection of embryo-defective lines, a plant was identified in which the T-DNA had inserted into the AtNAGLU gene. The phenotype of atnaglu is an early arrest of seed development without apparent male or female gametophytic effects. These data demonstrated the essential function in Arabidopsis consistent with the contribution of NAGLU to the Sanfilippo syndrome in human. Expression of AtNAGLU in plants was shown to be prevalent during reproductive development. The presence of AtNAGLU mRNA was observed during early and late male gametogenesis and in each cell of the embryo sac at the time of fertilization. After fertilization, AtNAGLU was expressed in the embryo, suspensor, and endosperm until the cotyledonary stage embryo. This precise pattern of expression identifies the cells and tissues where a remodelling of the N-acetyl-glucosamine residues of proteoglycan complexes is occurring. This work provides original evidence of the important role of N-acetyl-glucosamines in plant reproductive development. 3aArabidopsis 3aembryo sac 3aendosperm 3aenzymes 3aextracellular matrix 3agametogenesis 3agametophytes 3agenes 3agerm cells 3aglucosamine 3ahumans 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3apolymers 3aseed development 3asulfates 3atransfer DNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGerm Cellsxchemistryxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aReproduction 2aSeedsxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSequence Alignment 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aalpha-N-Acetylgalactosaminidasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aGadea-Vacas, Jose1 aGuilleminot, Jocelyne1 aDevic, Martine0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2008 Oct., v. 59, no. 13 p.3649-3659dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern2153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01851naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002700141245007500168300001600243500002400259520084400283650002501127650001801152650002101170650002101191650002101212773019401233852000901427856008101436856004401517655001201561IND4383341320221120215622.0060903e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438334132DNAL7 a10.1093/eurrag/jbl0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergès-Sennou, Fabian10aStore loyalty, bargaining power and the private label production issue  ap. 315-335.  aIncludes references  aOne of many explanations offered for the rise of private labels (PLs) is that they increase the bargaining power of the retailer. The prior question of the PL production assignment has not been analysed in an economic framework. The retailer can either entrust the production of his PL to the national brand (NB) manufacturer at a low unit cost, with the disadvantage that both products (NB and PL) are held by the same agent, or he can choose a firm from the competitive fringe with a higher unit production cost. In a framework where loyalty (presence of store-switching and brand-switching consumers) and bargaining strength count, we show that the retailer will assign his PL production to the NB manufacturer when the latter's bargaining power is low. However, a higher consumer loyalty for the NB can reverse the retailer's decision. 3abusiness enterprises 3amanufacturing 3aproduct labeling 3aproduction costs 3aretail marketing0 tEuropean review of agricultural economics.g2006 Sept., v. 33, no. 3 p.315-335dOxford University Press and the Foundation for the European Review of Agricultural Economicsx0165-15877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurrag/jbl0183Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://erae.oxfordjournals.org/archive/ 7aarticle03567naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013100164300001600295500002400311520231400335650001802649650002902667650001802696650001502714650001402729650001602743650002502759650002002784650001902804650001502823650001202838650001502850650001002865650001402875651001302889700001902902700002902921700002602950773010002976852000903076856004803085655001203133IND4457552920221120215711.0110506e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445755292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-011-9373-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurová, Diana10aIntegrating differentiated landscape preferences in a decision support model for the multifunctional management of the Montado  ap. 225-237.  aIncludes references  aA great part of the Alentejo region in Southern Portugal is covered by an agro-silvo pastoral system, the Montado. This traditional land-use system is specific, inter alia, in its ability to join production with favorable conditions for non-production functions. At the present time, as society positively evaluates and even demands cultural and amenity functions from the countryside, the Montado management faces the challenge of integrating production with non-production functions in a way which will result in suitable multifunctionality, and a more sound viability of the whole system. The decision support tool (DST) for the cork oak Montado management, the CORKFITS, based on the single-tree growth model and working at the stand level, is oriented primarily to the management of the production functions, but it is able to integrate also other data that can contribute for a more multifunctionality oriented management. In this exploratory study, the integration in the DST, of the preference distribution, as expressed by landscape users is investigated. The aim was to test a more comprehensive functioning of this tool, where non-production functions are also integrated. The described integration intended to communicate to decision-makers how the change in management practices at tree and under cover level, might alter the satisfaction of expectations of different user groups, as such changes affect the composition of the Montado, at both levels. The users considered are those practicing non-production functions in the Montado. Preferences were assessed through a questionnaire survey applied in the region of Alentejo, in the area of dominance of the cork oak, in the Montado system. The non-production functions are, in this context, related particularly to hunting, aesthetic appreciation related to walking and other leisure activities, to life quality, and to tradition and identity, as well as bee-keeping and mushroom picking. This paper focuses on the description of the specific methodological steps applied for the successful integration of the landscape preferences of different user groups into the DST for the cork oak Montado. Integration has proved to be possible, even if some methodological challenges still need to be faced for a more consistent use of the proposed tool. 3aQuercus suber 3adecision support systems 3agrowth models 3alandscapes 3amushrooms 3apastoralism 3aproduction functions 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3arecreation 3asurveys 3atraditions 3atrees 3aviability 3aPortugal1 aSurový, Peter1 ade Almeida Ribeiro, Nuno1 aPinto-Correia, Teresa0 tAgroforestry systems.g2011 June, v. 82, no. 2 p.225-237dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-43667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-011-9373-8 7aarticle01917naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008500128300001600213300002100229520091200250650001201162650001301174650001001187650001901197650001101216650001001227650001601237650002301253650001101276650002501287650002101312651001001333651001201343653002201355700001801377773006901395852000901464939003301473946001301506655001201519IND9004807720221120215516.0900928e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900480772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEveritt, J.H.10aRemote sensing of Chinese tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) and associated vegetation  ap. 273-278.  ap. 273-278. ill.  aChinese tamarisk is an invader of riparian sites in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Plant canopy light reflectance measurements showed that Chinese tamarisk had higher visible (0.55- and 0.65-micrometer wavelengths and 0.63- to 0.69-micrometer waveband) reflectance than did associated woody and herbaceous plant species in the late fall-early winter period when its foliage turned a yellow-orange to orange-brown color prior to leaf drop. Chinese tamarisk had a yellow-orange color on conventional color (0.40- to 0.70-micrometer) aerial photographs during this phenological stage that made it distinguishable from other plant species. Computer analyses of conventional color film positive transparencies showed that Chinese tamarisk populations could be quantified from associated vegetation. This technique can permit area estimates of Chinese tamarisk infestations on wildland areas. 3aTamarix 3ahabitats 3aweeds 3aremote sensing 3acanopy 3acolor 3areflectance 3aseasonal variation 3aautumn 3ainfrared photography 3ariparian buffers 3aTexas 3aArizona 0acolor photography1 aDeLoach, C.J.0 tWeed science.g1990 May, v. 38, no. 3 p.273-278x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03044naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001700168245014200185300001600327500002400343500001500367520140400382650002301786650002701809650002301836650002301859650002101882650001101903650002201914650002001936650002801956650001401984650001601998650002102014650002202035650001202057650002102069650002002090653002002110653001102130653002602141700001602167700001502183700001502198700001702213773009602230852000902326856007402335930003302409945002502442946001102467655001202478IND4382058920221120215530.0060717s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438205892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.09.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ5011 aCastillo, I.10aChanges in lipolysis and volatile fraction of a goat cheese manufactured employing a hygienized rennet paste and a defined strain starter  ap. 590-598.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of a hygienized rennet paste (HRP) and a defined strain starter IFPL on the volatile fraction of goat cheese (Majorero) was examined. Three batches were made and those cheeses produced either industrially (IL) or in artisanal manner (AL) were compared with the experimental lot (EL), which included both HRP and IFPL starter in its manufacture. Analysis of the volatile fraction was by static headspace connected to GC-MS and this disclosed a total of 28 components belonging to the following chemical families: fatty acids, esters, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols. Most of the volatile components identified appeared in all lots but at different concentrations. IL cheeses were distinguished from the other lots, including HRP in their manufacture, essentially by a lower presence of esters and FFA (both branched-chain and aliphatic acids). The use of HRP and a defined strain starter culture (including Lb. casei IFPL 731 as adjunct) directly affected lipolysis degree. This was reflected in an increase in the mono-and diglyceride concentrations and in a greater content of short-chain FFA, particularly butanoic acid, an important flavour component, which imparts a desirable sharp, "piquant" taste to Majorero cheese. The IFPL starter culture also had a significant effect on concentrations of compounds such as 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3 methyl-1-butanol, isoamyl butyrate and acetoin. 3avolatile compounds 3atraditional technology 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3afree fatty acids 3arennet 3amonoacylglycerols 3adiacylglycerols 3ashort chain fatty acids 3alipolysis 3agoat cheese 3afood composition 3amass spectrometry 3astrains 3aflavor compounds 3acheese starters 0afood processing 0aesters 0aindustrial production1 aCalvo, M.V.1 aAlonso, L.1 aJuarez, M.1 aFontecha, J.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 100, no. 2 p.590-598dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.09.0813electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/03/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02367naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002100177245012300198300001600321500002400337500001500361520078100376650002501157650002801182650001301210650001901223650002101242650002301263650002201286650002301308650002401331650001401355650002901369651001101398653002401409653001101433653001901444653002501463700002901488700001501517700002201532700002301554773009601577852000901673856007401682930003301756945002501789946001101814655001201825IND4382058720221120205448.0060717s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438205872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.09.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aT300 0aQ5001 aDelamare, A.P.L.10aAntibacterial activity of the essential oils of Salvia officinalis L. and Salvia triloba L. cultivated in South Brazil  ap. 603-608.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe essential oils of Salvia officinalis and Salvia triloba cultivated in South Brazil were analyzed by GC-MS.

Furthermore, combination with spray-drying, as a post-treatment after fermentation by strain A6, had the additional advantage of enabling the use of spray-dried fermented flour to prepare gruels with higher DM content (30-33%) corresponding to 128-140 kcal/100 g of gruel. 3arice 3asoybeans 3ablended foods 3alactic fermentation 3alactic acid bacteria 3aenergy density 3acomplementary foods 3aweaning foods 3agelatinization 3aslurries 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3arheological properties 3adry matter content 3aenergy requirements 3aspray drying1 aLoiseau, G.1 aIcard-Verniere, C.1 aRochette, I.1 aTreche, S.1 aGuyot, J.P.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 100, no. 2 p.623-631dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.09.0803electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/03/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02837naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001400191245015600205300001600361500001500377500002400392520119200416650001801608650001101626650001101637650001601648650003001664650002001694650001401714650001901728650001101747650001501758650001201773650002201785650002001807650003101827650001101858650001201869651001001881651001001891700002001901700001601921700001301937700002701950700001601977773010701993852000902100856006902109930003302178945002502211946001102236655001202247IND4382115320221120205607.0060720e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438211532DNAL7 a156452462pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-004-0223-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF600 0aF3001 aGalan, C.10aHeat requirement for the onset of the Olea europaea L. pollen season in several sites in Andalusia and the effect of the expected future climate change  ap. 184-188.  aIn process  aIncludes references  aOlives are one of the largest crops in the Mediterranean region, especially in Andalusia, in southern Spain. A thermal model has been developed for forecasting the start of the olive tree pollen season at five localities in Andalusia: Cordoba, Priego, Jaen, Granada and Malaga using airborne pollen and meteorological data from 1982 to 2001. Threshold temperatures varied between 5°C and 12.5°C depending on bio-geographical characteristics. The external validity of the results was tested using the data for the year 2002 as an independent variable and it confirmed the models accuracy with only a few days difference from predicted values. All the localities had increasingly earlier start dates during the study period. This could confirm that olive flower phenology can be considered as a sensitive indicator of the effects of climate fluctuations in the Mediterranean area. The theoretical impact of the predicted climatic warming on the olives flowering phenology at the end of the century is also proposed by applying Regional Climate Model data. A general advance, from 1 to 3 weeks could be expected, although this advance will be more pronounced in mid-altitude inland areas. 3aOlea europaea 3aolives 3apollen 3apollination 3ameteorological parameters 3aair temperature 3aflowering 3aclimate change 3amodels 3aprediction 2aClimate 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aHot Temperature 2aOleaxgrowth & development 2aPollen 2aSeasons 3aSpain 0aSpain1 aGarcia-Mozo, H.1 aVazquez, L.1 aRuiz, L.1 aDiaz de la Guardia, C.1 aTrigo, M.M.0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2005 Jan., v. 49, no. 3 p.184-188dSpringerx0020-71287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-004-0223-53electronic resource  a20060731b20060804c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/07/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02555naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001400168245012700182300001600309500002400325500001500349520106900364650001601433650002501449650002801474650001701502650001701519650001801536650001901554650002301573650001301596650002501609650000901634650001901643650001701662653002401679653002301703700001401726700001601740700001701756700001601773773009601789852000901885856007401894930003301968945002502001946001102026655001202037IND4382064120221120205549.0060718s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438206412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.09.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aS2001 aJerez, M.12aA comparison between bark extracts from Pinus pinaster and Pinus radiata: Antioxidant activity and procyanidin composition  ap. 439-444.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe composition and antiradical activity of procyanidins from the bark of two kinds of pine, Pinus pinaster and Pinus radiata, were compared. Both the total bark extract and the fraction soluble in both water and ethyl acetate (OW) were evaluated, because of their promising results in previous experiments. Results showed that P. radiata bark was richer in total phenols and also in procyanidins, catechin always being the main unit, so terminal as extensional. For P. pinaster, epicatechin was the predominant extension unit. The mean degree of polymerization (mDP) was higher for the latter. Interestingly, opposite results were encountered for the corresponding OW fractions, where P. radiata showed a mDP of 2.9 vs. 2.3 of P. pinaster. It was also found that the higher the mDP the higher was the specific antiradical activity. The different procyanidin composition and specific antiradical activity of the two kinds of barks, and particularly their OW fractions, may lead to the design of efficient natural antioxidants with application in the food industry. 3aepicatechin 3achemical composition 3ainterspecific variation 3aforest trees 3aprocyanidins 3aPinus radiata 3aplant extracts 3achemical structure 3acatechin 3aantioxidant activity 3abark 3aPinus pinaster 3aantioxidants 0aspecies differences 0aphenolic compounds1 aSelga, A.1 aSineiro, J.1 aTorres, J.L.1 aNunez, M.J.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 100, no. 2 p.439-444dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.09.0643electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/03/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02410naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002500170245010700195300001600302500002400318500001500342520104700357650002401404650002601428650001701454650002001471650002301491650002101514650003701535650002101572650001901593653002301612700002101635700001801656700002401674773011201698852000901810856007601819930003301895945002501928946001101953655001201964IND4382199920221120160821.0060723e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438219992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1445-6664.2006.00208.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF6001 aNORSWORTHY, JASON K.10aEffects of isothiocyanates on purple (Cyperus rotundus L.) and yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.)  ap. 131-138.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPurple and yellow nutsedge are two of the most troublesome weeds in the world. In the south-eastern USA, both weeds are common in vegetable crops and are the most difficult weeds to control in this region. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the herbicidal activity of five liquid isothiocyanates (ITCs) (benzoyl, o-tolyl, m-tolyl, tert-octyl, and 3-fluorophenyl) on purple and yellow nutsedge. All ITCs were applied to soil in jars at 0, 100, 1000, 5000, and 10 000 nmol g⁻¹ of soil and sealed for 72 h to prevent gaseous losses, followed by nutsedge growth evaluations after an additional 18 days. All ITCs reduced purple and yellow nutsedge shoot density and shoot biomass over the concentrations evaluated, with differences in the effectiveness on each species apparent among the compounds. Based on the lethal concentration values for shoot density, all ITCs were more effective in suppressing purple nutsedge than yellow nutsedge. Benzoyl and 3-fluorophenyl were generally the most effective of the five ITCs evaluated. 3amechanism of action 3aherbicidal properties 3aweed control 3aisothiocyanates 3aCyperus esculentus 3aCyperus rotundus 3astructure-activity relationships 3aapplication rate 3aglucosinolates 0achemical structure1 aMALIK, MAYANK S.1 aJHA, PRASHANT1 aOLIVEIRA, MARCOS J.0 tWeed biology and management.g2006 Sept., v. 6, no. 3 p.131-138dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1444-61627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-6664.2006.00208.x3electronic resource  a20070223b20070303c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/02/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01924naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001800170245005000188300001600238500002400254520067000278650001500948650002400963650001400987650002201001650001901023650001601042650001701058650001901075650001301094650001901107650001201126650001901138650002301157700001901180773012501199852000901324856007601333930003301409945002501442946001101467655001201478IND4382195520221120144511.0060723e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438219552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0307.2006.00259.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aQ5011 aONER, YASEMIN10aMilk protein polymorphisms in Holstein cattle  ap. 180-182.  aIncludes references  aMilk samples from 203 Holstein cows were phenotyped for genetic variants αs₁-casein, β-casein, κ-casein and β-lactoglobulin using starch-gel electrophoresis.

Both endo- and exo-peptidases were active in the pH 3.0 silage (silage A), quickly breaking down the protein nitrogen to amino nitrogen. In the pH 2.0 silage (silage B) only acid endo-peptidase and a weak exo-peptidase activity were present, slowing the formation of amino nitrogen during autolysis. The additional presence of formic acid in pH 2.0 silage (silage C) limited the increase in pH during autolysis and prevented any increase in amino nitrogen, indicating the complete suppression of exo-peptidase activity in such silages. Correspondingly, the amounts of short peptides and amino acids were highest in silage A and smallest in silage C. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3asilage 3aproteolysis 3apH 3aproteinases 0aviscera meal1 aMcCurdy, A.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.45-50x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00091a0103Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03057naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152100001500169245015100184300001600335500002400351500001500375520157000390650003001960650001501990650001602005650001602021650001302037650002702050650002402077650002102101650002302122650001802145650001302163650001502176651001302191653002102204700001902225773013402244852000902378856007602387856005502463930003302518945002502551946001102576655001202587IND4382189420180615000000.0060723e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438218942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2006.01078.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAyalew, G.10aOccurrence of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.) and its parasitoids in Ethiopia: influence of geographical region and agronomic traits  ap. 343-348.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSurveys were carried out in 2001 in brassica-producing areas of Ethiopia to determine the geographic distribution and severity of diamondback moth (DBM) and occurrence of indigenous parasitoids. Principal component analysis was used to analyse the importance of nine parameters - DBM density, parasitism by different parasitoid species (Oomyzus sokolowskii, Diadegma spp., Apanteles sp. and overall parasitism), cropping systems, pesticide use, frequency of pesticide application and altitude. A total of 194 brassica fields in 13 different areas were visited. Principal component analysis showed that the first two of the nine principal components (largely DBM density and pesticide use) accounted for 70% of the variation in the data set. Higher DBM numbers were associated with pesticide usage and higher overall parasitism with intercropping. Eight parasitoid species were recorded of which three species were important both in distribution and level of parasitism. These include Oomyzus sokolowskii (Hym., Eulophidae), Diadegma spp. (Hym., Ichneumonidae) and Apanteles sp. (Hym., Braconidae). Overall parasitism ranged from 3.6% to 79.5% with big differences between areas. Apanteles sp. and Diadegma spp. were largely confined to the south-western part of Ethiopia where insecticide use is minimal. Oomyzus sokolowskii is mainly distributed in areas of the Rift Valley and northern Ethiopia with relatively heavy insecticide use. This study indicated a huge impact of repeated insecticide treatment and agronomic practices on DBM severity and its parasitoids. 3ageographical distribution 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aHymenoptera 3aBrassica 3ageographical variation 3aPlutella xylostella 3aagronomic traits 3apopulation density 3aintercropping 3aaltitude 3apesticides 3aEthiopia 0acropping systems1 aOgol, C.K.P.O.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2006 Aug., v. 130, no. 6-7 p.343-348dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2006.01078.x3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2006.01078.x  a20061120b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/20  aNon-US 7aarticle01594naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245005200158300001600210520069200226650001000918650001900928650002000947650002100967650001800988650002101006700001901027773010001046852000901146856007901155939003301234946001301267655001201280IND9302566220221120135128.0930428e199001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930256622DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00091a0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImafidon, G.I.10aNucleic acid nitrogen of animal and plant foods  ap. 118-120.  aMeat products contained greater concentrations of nucleic acid nitrogen (NAN) (0.35-0.56 mg/g) than dairy and egg products (0.05-0.15 mg/g) but, relative to product nitrogen, the compositions were less than 0.5%.

The oligomers are extracted from corn oil with hexane-acetonitrile, the extract is evaporated almost to dryness, and the concentrate is diluted with dimethylacetamide for separation and quantitation of the oligomers by HPLC. Recovery studies were performed using bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and the PET cyclic trimer. The mean recoveries from corn oil were 96.2 and 98.4% for BHET and the PET cyclic trimer, respectively. This method was also used to measure the migration of PET cyclic oligomers from PET susceptor food trays, PET-coated paperboard food trays, and crystallized PET food trays under microwave-use conditions. Oligomers beginning with the cyclic trimer through the cyclic octamer were found to migrate. 3amicrowave cooking 3achemical analysis 3afood packaging 3aplastics 3acorn oil 0apolymers 0acontaminants1 aHollifield, H.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.145-148x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00091a0313Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02365naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001400139245014300153300001600296520121300312650002001525650001101545650001501556650002501571650003401596650002101630650002801651650003601679700001901715700002001734700001501754773010001769852000901869856007901878939003301957946001301990655001202003IND9302566620221120135201.0930428e199001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930256662DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00091a0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, K.C.10aIsolation and characterization of pentacyclic triterpene ovipositional stimulant for the sweet potato weevil from Ipomoea batatas (L.)

The 1:3 methylene chloride-hexane fraction yielded compound I: > 96% purity, the most dominant compound present; mp 238-239.5 degrees C; IR, 1730, 1250 cm-1. The mass spectrum of compound I displayed a molecular ion at m/z 468 with a molecular formula of C32H52O2. The fragmentation pattern was indicative of a pentacyclic triterpene with isopropyl and acetate moieties. Compound II, which could be produced by the hydrolysis of compound I, was present in the 1:1 methylene chloride-hexane fraction: mp 214-215.5 degrees C; IR, 3400 cm-1; molecular ion, m/z 426; molecular formula, C30H50O. The alcohol of compound I (compound II) was identified as boehmerol. Based on 13C NMR and GC-MS data and physical evidence, the structure of compound I was established and tentatively named boehmeryl acetate.

These compounds, which have been identified as flavors in natural products, show characteristic behavior in NMR and mass spectroscopy depending on the number of methylene groups (n) between the sulfur atoms. 2-(Alkylthio)-1-ethanethiols (n = 2) can easily be identified by their typical 1H NMR spectra; they show an additional coupling for the SH protons with the RSCH2 protons. Generally, fragmentation of molecular ions of the title compounds occurs mainly by alpha and beta-cleavage, leading to intense peaks of m/e 61 and 47. For 3-(alkylthio)-1-propanethiols (n = 3), characteristic peaks with m/e 107 and 106 corresponding to [M - (R)].+ and [M - (R-(-H))].+, respectively.

During the present investigations cell-free culture filtrate (CFCF) of Phoma herbarum FGCC no. 75 was evaluated for its phytotoxic property against Parthenium hysterophorus L. The results of shoot cut, detached leaf and seedling bioassays revealed the presence of a toxic metabolite in the CFCF that was responsible for the toxicity against the target weed. Further, the toxic metabolite was characterized after the CFCF extraction with butanol, hexane, chloroform, acetone and ethyl acetate. The residues left after solvent evaporation were evaluated separately for their toxicity against the weed. Residue obtained from ethyl acetate fraction showed very distinct toxicity when compared with others. On the basis of analysis by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry, the tentative structure of the phytotoxic compound was deduced to be 3-nitro-1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid (3-nitrophthalic acid). This is the first report confirming the potential of this particular toxin from Ph. herbarum as a biorational, which can be applied as a phytotoxin against Par. hysterophorus. 3aParthenium hysterophorus 3aphytotoxicity 3abiological control agents 3aplant extracts 3abioassays 3aPhoma 3amycotoxins 3achemical structure 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asecondary metabolites 3ainvasive species 3anoxious weeds 3aculture filtrates 3abiological control 0aPhoma herbarum 0ametabolites1 aVerma, K.K.1 aRajak, R.C.1 aPandey, A.K.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2006 Aug., v. 154, no. 7-8 p.461-468dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01129.x3electronic resource  a20070125b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02268naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001800161245009700179300001600276500002400292500001500316520093100331650001901262650002501281650001201306650001101318650003301329650001501362650002401377650002501401650001001426650002101436653001901457700002001476700001901496700001901515773013401534852000901668856007601677930003301753945002501786946001101811655001201822IND4382192220221120135116.0060723e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438219222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.01003.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aLee, Gee-Dong14aThe optimization of microwave-assisted extraction of decursin from Angelica gigas Nakai root  ap. 737-742.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResponse surface methodology was used to display the characteristics of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of soluble solids and decursin from Angelica gigas Nakai root, thereby allowing MAE conditions to be optimized.

Decursin content of the extract was estimated to be maximal at 2.52% using 97.7% ethanol, 90.2 W microwave power, and 6.1 min extraction time. The estimated optimal MAE conditions (67% ethanol, 100 W and 6 min) to maximize both components were verified by comparing estimated values with experimental values (42.2% soluble solids, 2.2% decursin), which were higher than those (35.8% solids, 2.0% decursin) obtained by conventional reflux extraction (60% ethanol, 95 °C and 6 h). 3aAngelica gigas 3atotal soluble solids 3aethanol 3ayields 3aresponse surface methodology 3aextraction 3amicrowave treatment 3amedicinal properties 3aroots 3aherbal medicines 0asoluble solids1 aLee, Seon-Young1 aKim, Kwang-Soo1 aKwon, Joong-Ho0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2006 Aug., v. 41, no. 7 p.737-742dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.01003.x3electronic resource  a20060912b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01759naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245007100154300001600225520082300241650001101064650002101075650002001096650001901116653001501135653001301150700001401163700002301177773009901200852000901299856007901308939003301387946001301420655001201433IND9301610220221120135032.0930318e199205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930161022DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00017a0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValero, E.10aKinetic study of the effect of metabisulfite on polyphenol oxidase  ap. 904-908.  aA kinetic study of the inhibition of the catecholase activity of polyphenol oxidase by metabisulfite has been made. Metabisulfite affected enzymatic browning in two different ways: (a) it reacted with the quinones produced by catalytic activity, and (b) it had a direct effect on the enzyme by irreversibly binding to both 'met' and 'oxy' forms of the enzyme, with different in activation rate constants. Kinetic data obtained by varying the substrate concentration showed a positive kinetic cooperativity effect. These results indicate that metabisulfite is an example of an irreversible enzyme inhibitor rendered unstable in the reaction medium by enzymatic catalysis. The kinetic model proposed for its action mechanism was simulated in the computer, and a good agreement with the experimental results was obtained. 3agrapes 3acatechol oxidase 3aenzyme activity 3ametabisulfites 0ainhibition 0abrowning1 aVaron, R.1 aGarcia-Carmona, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1992 May, v. 40, no. 5 p.904-908x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00017a0423Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01753naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245007700158300001300235520081800248650001701066650000901083650001901092650002501111650001901136650003601155700001701191773009701208852000901305856007901314939003301393946001301426655001201439IND9302563920221120124158.0930428e199001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930256392DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00091a0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Quere, J.L.10aComposition of the essential oils of blackcurrant buds (Ribes nigrum L.)  ap. 3-10.  aThe essential oils of 23 varieties of blackcurrant buds were investigated for chemical composition and chemosystematic studies.

They are H+ and un-ionized carboxyl groups, both of which can exist in organic soils. When hydroxyatrazine is the only reaction product, there are four chemical species. These are the reactant and product in both free and sorbed states. A typical heterogeneous kinetics experiment would monitor only one or two of these. An HPLC technique has now been demonstrated however, which monitors five chemical species during the course of heterogeneous catalysis experiments. These are solution-phase reactant and product, reversibly sorbed reactant and product, and material balance loss. A 2-week experiment can produce equilibrium and rate constants for sorption and the reaction rate constant. These are relevant to the persistence and movement of atrazine in soils. The constants are consistent with those previously found for a humic acid. 3aatrazine 3ahydrolysis 3achemical speciation 3aorganic soils1 aKhan, S.U.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.297-308x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00091a0663Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02080naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245012000133300001800253520131800271650002001589650001401609650002101623650001201644653001501656773008801671852000901759939003301768946001301801655001201814IND9302477820221120114044.0930426e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930247782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichols-Orians, C.10aDifferential effects of condensed and hydrolyzable tannin of polyphenol oxidase activity of attine symbiotic fungus  ap. 1811-1819.  aThe leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes is a generalist herbivore of the neotropics and collects leaf material to cultivate a fungus. It appears that this fungus, a Basidiomycete, is responsible for the ability of the ants to utilize most of the available woody plant species. Tannins and other phenolics are ubiquitous secondary chemicals in woody plants, and Basidiomycete fungi produce enzymes, such as polyphenol oxidase, that are capable of polymerizing and inactivating the phenolics. This study evaluates the effects of a condensed and a hydrolyzable tannin on the activity of polyphenol oxidase and the growth of the fungus. I hypothesized that low concentrations of tannin would not inhibit polyphenol oxidase activity but high concentrations would inhibit the enzyme. Consequently, I predicted that only high concentrations of tannin would inhibit fungal growth, Laboratory assays with the fungus indicated that hydrolyzable tannin (tannic acid) and condensed tannin (quebracho tannin) differ in the mechanism of inhibition. Tannic acid does not inhibit polyphenol oxidase activity but does inhibit fungal growth. Quebracho tannin, however, inhibits both polyphenol oxidase activity and fungal growth. As predicted, both tannic acid and quebracho tannin primarily inhibit the fungus at high concentrations. 3aAtta cephalotes 3asymbiosis 3acatechol oxidase 3atannins 0ainhibition0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1991 Sept., v. 17, no. 9 p.1811-1819x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01677naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245013300171300001800304520066900322650002000991650001901011650001401030650001501044653001501059653001201074653001201086700002001098773008801118852000901206856007801215939003301293946001301326655001201339IND9302477420221120114056.0930426e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930247742DNAL7 a242579182pmid7 a10.1007/BF009937262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatli, B.10aMetabolically blocked analogs of housefly sex pheromone.

This study examines the relationships between δ¹³C signatures of consumers (invertebrates and salmonid fishes) and water velocity in the Sainte Marguerite River, QC, Canada, and compares them to patterns for periphyton, both along the river main-stem and in a small tributary. 2. Relationships of δ¹³C signatures of herbivore/grazers and collector/gatherers with water velocity were strong and similar to those of periphyton, but relationships for filter-feeders were weak, probably reflecting the effect of spatial averaging of their food supply as a result of downstream transport. 3. Velocity effects on salmonid signatures were much weaker than those of lower trophic levels, being barely significant except in the small tributary where the fish were resident and isolated from the main river. In the river main-stem, even when reach standardised (reach mean subtracted from each data point), fish signatures were only weakly related to water velocity. 4. The fidelity with which velocity effects are transmitted to consumers from benthic algae is highly variable, and depends on a combination of consumer and resource movements, in addition to the trophic position of the consumer. 3acarbon 3afish 3afood availability 3afood webs 3aherbivores 3ainvertebrates 3aperiphyton 3arivers 3astable isotopes 3aQuebec 0abenthic invertebrates 0acarbon signature 0awater velocity1 aTRUDEAU, VERONIQUE0 tFreshwater biology.g2010 June, v. 55, no. 6 p.1303-1314dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02354.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04076naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245013400150300001600284520261500300650002802915650002202943650001202965650001902977650001602996650001203012650001803024650000903042650001003051650001403061650001403075650000903089650001503098650001003113651001503123651001203138653001303150653002903163653002503192653002203217653001803239700002003257700001903277700002303296773011103319852000903430856007503439930003303514946001103547655001203558IND4439359220221120094459.0100702s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443935922DNAL7 a10.1071/WR080312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFey, Karen10aBehavioural responses of voles to simulated risk of predation by a native and an alien mustelid: an odour manipulation experiment  ap. 273-282.  aContext. Potential mammalian prey commonly use the odours of their co-evolved predators to manage their risks of predation. But when the risk comes from an unknown source of predation, odours might not be perceived as dangerous, and anti-predator responses may fail, except possibly if the alien predator is of the same archetype as a native predator. Aims. In the present study we examined anti-predator behavioural responses of voles from the outer archipelagos of the Baltic Sea, south-western Finland, where they have had no resident mammalian predators in recent history. Methods. We investigated responses of field voles (Microtus agrestis) to odours of native least weasels (Mustela nivalis) and a recently invading alien predator, the American mink (Mustela vison), in laboratory. We also studied the short-term responses of free-ranging field voles and bank voles (Myodes glareolus) to simulated predation risk by alien mink on small islands in the outer archipelago of the Baltic Sea. Key results. In the laboratory, voles avoided odour cues of native weasel but not of alien mink. It is possible that the response to mink is a context dependent learned response which could not be induced in the laboratory, whereas the response to weasel is innate. In the field, however, voles reduced activity during their normal peak-activity times at night as a response to simulated alien-mink predation risk. No other shifts in space use or activity in safer microhabitats or denser vegetation were apparent. Conclusions. Voles appeared to recognise alien minks as predators from their odours in the wild. However, reduction in activity is likely to be only a short-term immediate response to mink presence, which is augmented by longer-term strategies of habitat shift. Because alien mink still strongly suppresses vole dynamics despite these anti-predator responses, we suggest that behavioural naiveté may be the primary factor in the impact of an alien predator on native prey. Implications. Prey naiveté has long been considered as the root cause of the devastating impacts of alien predators, whereby native prey simply fail to recognise and respond to the novel predation risk. Our results reveal a more complex form of naiveté whereby native prey appeared to recognise alien predators as a threat but their response is ultimately inadequate. Thus, recognition alone is unlikely to afford protection for native prey from alien-predator impacts. Thus, management strategies that, for example, train prey in recognition of novel threats must induce effective responses if they are expected to succeed. 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3aMicrotus agrestis 3aMustela 3aNeovison vison 3acoevolution 3aislands 3amicrohabitats 3amink 3aodors 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3avegetation 3avoles 3aBaltic Sea 3aFinland 0aactivity 0aanti-predatory behaviour 0abehavioural naiveté 0ahabitat selection 0asmall rodents1 aBanks, Peter B.1 aYlönen, Hannu1 aKorpimäki, Erkki.0 tWildlife research.g2010, v. 37, no. 4 p.273-282dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR080313Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03413naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010900181300001600290520183700306650001702143650000802160650001702168650002002185650003602205650001602241650000902257650002202266650001502288650002902303650004002332650003202372650002602404650001102430650000902441650001602450650005602466650002202522650002902544651001302573653001902586700001802605700002402623773011002647852000902757856008502766930003302851946001102884655001202895IND4436354220221120083129.0100430e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443635422DNAL7 a197279092pmid7 a10.1007/s00198-009-1036-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, P. 10aSelecting men for bone densitometry: performance of osteoporosis risk assessment tools in Portuguese men  ap. 977-983.  aSummary Clinicians need tools to identify patients most likely to benefit from bone mineral density (BMD) testing, for which cost-effectiveness does not allow generalized screening. This study supports the utility of osteoporosis risk assessment tools in selecting men for BMD testing. Different cutoff values may be appropriate for different countries and/or ethnic origins. Introduction Our aim was to evaluate the utility of three osteoporosis (OP) risk assessment tools in a large group of Portuguese men aged 50 or more and to determine the best cutoff value to be used for selecting men for bone densitometry. Methods We assessed the performance of three simple tools in 202 randomly selected men: body weight criterion (BWC), osteoporosis self-assessment tool for Asians (OSTA), and a modified version of the OSTA equation (OST). Previously published cutoff values (validated in postmenopausal women) and three additional cutoff values were tested. Sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), predictive values, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for correctly selecting men with OP (defined by BMD testing) were determined. Results Mean age of the cohort was 63.8 years. According to the World Health Organization diagnostic categories, 16.8% had osteoporosis. The best performing cutoffs for correctly selecting men with OP for BMD testing were OST < 3 (SE = 75.5%, SP = 50.0%, AUROC = 0.632), OSTA < 3 (SE = 73.5%, SP = 58.3%, AUROC = 0.659), and BWC < 75 kg (SE = 73.5%, SP = 61.3%, AUROC = 0.674). Conclusions OP risk assessment tools seem to be useful in men aged 50 or more. Best cutoff values are different from those recommended for postmenopausal women. Different cutoff values may be appropriate for different countries and/or ethnic origins. 3adensitometry 3amen 3aosteoporosis 3arisk assessment 2aAbsorptiometry, Photonxmethods 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAlgorithms 2aBone Densityxphysiology 2aBone Diseases, Metabolicxdiagnosis 2aDecision Support Techniques 2aEpidemiologic Methods 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOsteoporosisxdiagnosisxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aPatient Selection 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 3aPortugal 0aMass screening1 aCoutinho, M. 1 ada Silva, J.

Chimeric oligo DNA probes containing LNAs demonstrated highly improved specificities and could discriminate between BrNIT-T1 and BrNIT-T2. These LNA-containing probes were applied to ISH. BrNIT-T1 was strongly expressed in cells containing expanding secondary plasmodia of P. brassicae, but not in cells containing resting spores. On the other hand, BrNIT-T2 transcripts were localized in noninfected cells rather than infected cells during the clubroot growth phase but coexisted with mature resting spores at a later phase of clubroot development. Immunostaining for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) revealed IAA accumulation in cells containing growing plasmodia. IAA immunostaining in infected cells was reduced as the pathogen formed resting spores, but the signal was again enhanced in cells containing mature resting spores at a later phase of infection, suggesting that IAA is involved in both the early growth and the latest maturation phase of clubroot development. Expression of BrNIT-T1 and BrNIT-T2 in turnip roots was upregulated by exogenous treatment with cytokinin and jasmonic acid, respectively. Thus, these two phytohormones are possible triggers of abnormal IAA production in clubroot tissue via induction of the respective nitrilase. Given these results, we propose a model for isoform-specific roles of B. rapa nitrilases in auxin biosynthesis involved in phytohormone crosstalk during development of clubroot disease. 3aBrassica rapa 3aDNA probes 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3abiosynthesis 3achimerism 3aclubroot 3acytokinins 3agenes 3ain situ hybridization 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3amodels 3anitrilase 3anucleic acids 3apathogens 3aroots 3aspores 3aturnips 0aBrassica rapa L.

The mechanisms relating to the sexual reproduction of this plant pathogen are still unclear, as are the infection structures involved and the symptoms produced. In the present study, bean plants were inoculated with ascospores and conidia, and the events taking place within the following 120 h were investigated using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The symptoms exhibited by plants inoculated with the ascospores were milder than in those inoculated with conidia. Microscopy revealed that most of ascospores produced germ tubes and appressoria at an early stage (24 h after inoculation). From 48 h onwards, the formation of hyphae and the production of germ tubes and appressoria were great. In contrast, infections originating from conidia developed more slowly, and at 24 and 48 h, many non-germinated conidia were present, whereas only few conidia developed germ tubes and appressoria. Ascospore germination and appressorium formation were similar on both resistant and susceptible cultivars. Hence, the symptoms and the temporal sequence of events associated with the infection of bean plants by the two fungal forms differed, although the structures produced were similar. This is the fist report comparing symptoms and prepenetration events between anamorph and teleomorph of G. cingulata f.sp. phaseoli in common bean. 3aColletotrichum lindemuthianum 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aanamorphs 3aanthracnose 3aappressoria 3aascospores 3abeans 3aconidia 3acultivars 3afungi 3agerm tube 3agermination 3alight microscopy 3aplant pathogens 3aplant reproduction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asexual reproduction 3ateleomorphs1 aBarcelos, Quélen L.1 aAlves, Eduardo1 aCamargoJr, Osnil A.1 adeSouza, Elaine A.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2010 Apr., v. 158, no. 4 p.270-277dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2009.01608.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100715b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01729naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245010400135300001600239300002100255500001500276520085500291650002201146650002201168650001001190650001001200653001801210653001601228700001501244700001901259773007001278852000901348939003301357946001301390655001201403IND8900160620221120073738.0890110e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890016062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStamm-Katovich, E.J.10aDevelopment of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) root buds following emergence from lateral roots  ap. 758-763.  ap. 758-763. ill.  a2019-12-05  aIn common milkweed, the development of subterranean root buds on excised root segments, following emergence from the parent root, is characterized by development of nodes and internodes followed by internode expansion.

The occurrence of a well-developed vascular system throughout the root bud and between the parent root and bud provides evidence that retardation of growth of inhibited root buds in common milkweed is not caused by anatomical constraints. 3aplant development 3aAsclepias syriaca 3aweeds 3aroots 0aplant anatomy 0agrowth rate1 aWyse, D.L.1 aBiesboer, D.D.0 tWeed science.g1988 Nov., v. 36, no. 6 p.758-763x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01884naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099040001800116100002300134245003800157300001600195520054700211650001200758650000900770650001000779650001100789650001400800650001400814650001500828650001000843650001200853650002200865650001100887650000900898650002100907650001100928650002100939650002400960650000900984650000900993650002301002650004001025650001001065653003501075653001901110653003201129700002101161700002001182773010201202852000901304939003301313945000801346655001201354991595788660742620221120073906.0780501e197711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894823522DNAL7 a5672342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlynn, Margaret A.10aEffect of diet on fecal nutrients  ap. 521-526.  aA study assessed the bacterial and biochemical components of the feces of human subjects fed a sequence of four constant diets, each of a month's duration.

The results were surprisingly accurate, although the boys tended to overestimate low levels of intake and underestimate high levels. A literature review revealed other validated self-reports for 6 adults and 5 children.

Breast milk may offer certain nutritional and nonnutritional advantages for immature babies. Preterm milk is theoretically more appropriate than term or pooled mature breast milk; however, some nutrients may be inadequate to support intrauterine rates of growth in small premature infants. Ne w formulas specifically designed for preterm babies appear to be safe and to promote improved weight gain, fat absorption, bone mineralization, and nitrogen retention. Nutritional needs of growing preterm infants are better met by premature formulas than by formulas designed for term babies.

Blood pressure is lower in infants than in children or adults and increases with age. There is a lesser degree of tracking of blood pressure in children than in adults; a single occasion of high blood pressure in children is not as predictive of elevated blood pressure in the future as it is in adults. A review of the evidence indicates that heredity, obesity, and sodium intake are important determinants of blood pressure. Non-pharmacologic methods of treatment, including weight loss (for obese patients) and sodium restriction are preferable to drug therapy in hypertensive children. Long-term diet modifications begun in childhood may be beneficial for the prevention of adult hypertension. These measures, including avoidance of high sodium diets and prevention of obesity, are especially indicated for children with a family history of hypertension. Thus, there is a role for the nutritionist in the management and the possible prevention of essential hypertension.

Dissipation modes of norflurazon were characterized by using 14C-labeled herbicides for adsorption, mobility, photolysis, and volatility studies to aid in the prediction of conditions influencing herbicide carryover problems. A direct soil-counting technique modified for use in these studies yielded a norflurazon recovery as high as 83% of the applied radioactivity. Relative mobility of the herbicides on soil thin-layer chromatography plates was fluometuron greater than or equal to atrazine > norflurazon. Norflurazon adsorption increased and mobility decreased as soil organic matter and clay content increased. Considerable upward movement of norflurazon and atrazine occurred in subirrigated columns containing herbicide-treated Hebert silt loam. Upward movement in excess of 5 cm occurred in 10 days and 8 weeks for atrazine and norflurazon, respectively. Photolysis and volatilization studies with norflurazon and atrazine revealed low volatilization but significant photolytic losses for norflurazon when herbicide-treated soil-coated slides were exposed to ultraviolet or sunlight. After 98 h atrazine volatilization was greater and photolysis in sunlight less than that observed for norflurazon. Laboratory studies showing upward movement of norflurazon and atrazine, in conjunction with dissipation losses occurring at the soil surface, suggested that losses of norflurazon and atrazine are facilitated by movement in capillary water referred to as the "wick" effect. 3anorflurazon 3apesticide persistence 3aphotolysis 3aatrazine 3afluometuron 3aadsorption 3aradiolabeling 3alosses from soil 3acrop rotation 3acapillarity 0avolatility 0amovement in soil 0acounting1 aLavy, T.L.0 tWeed science.g1990 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.81-88x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04103naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245015500186300001600341520204400357650001802401650001502419650001202434650002302446650002602469650001302495650000902508650001802517650002002535650002002555650001102575650002702586650001402613650001102627650002102638650001302659650004402672650007502716650001202791650003502803650003702838650007402875650005902949650005103008650004003059653001603099653001703115653002903132700002003161700002503181700002503206773012003231852000903351856008503360930003303445946001103478655001203489IND4439754920221120031150.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443975492DNAL7 a204801822pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-010-0980-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHödl, Elisabeth.10aCadmium stress stimulates tissue turnover in Helix pomatia: increasing cell proliferation from metal tolerance to exhaustion in molluscan midgut gland  ap. 159-171.  aIn terrestrial pulmonate snails, cadmium (Cd) uptake leads to the induction of a Cd-specific metallothionein isoform (Cd-MT) that protects against adverse interactions of this toxic metal ion. Increasing concentrations of Cd cause increased individual mortality possibly linked to pathological alterations in the snail midgut gland. Histological, immuno-histochemical, and electron-microscopic methods in combination with tissue metal analyses and quantification of MT induction parameters were applied to the midgut gland of Cd-exposed Roman snails (Helix pomatia). Conspicuous concentration-dependent alterations occurred in this organ, including the metal-induced increase of Cd-MT concentration and manifestation of Cd-MT mRNA precipitations in all midgut gland cell types. The most evident alteration was an increase of cellular turnover reflected by enhanced cell proliferation. Intensified vesiculation of endoplasmic reticulum was noted in basophilic cells and an increasing formation of lipofuscin granules in excretory cells. At the highest Cd concentrations, mitochondrial membranes were disrupted in basophilic cells, and lipofuscin granules were released from excretory cells into the midgut gland tubular system. Some of these alterations (e.g., increased cell proliferation rate, vesiculation of endoplasmic reticulum) detected at low Cd concentrations were interpreted as adaptive response processes enhancing the tolerance of exposed individuals to metal stress. Cellular alterations at higher Cd concentrations (e.g., mitochondrial structural damage) clearly represented ongoing irreversible cellular disruption. Combined evaluation of cellular biomarkers and MT saturation levels indicated that the transition from stress resistance to depletion of resistance capacity occurred above a threshold of 0.8 µmol Cd/g dry weight in the midgut gland of H. pomatia. At these Cd concentrations, Cd-MT was saturated with Cd²⁺ ions, whereas at the cellular level, structural alterations turned into pathological deterioration. 3aHelix pomatia 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3acell proliferation 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agranules 3aions 3amessenger RNA 3ametal tolerance 3ametallothionein 3amidgut 3amitochondrial membrane 3amortality 3asnails 3astress tolerance 3atoxicity 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aAnimal Structuresxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDigestive Systemxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aHelix, Snailsxcytologyxdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aIntracellular Spacexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effects 0aHeavy metal 0aToxic effect 0aHelix pomatia (Mollusca)1 aFelder, Edward 1 aChabicovsky, Monika 1 aDallinger, Reinhard 0 tCell and tissue research.g2010 July, v. 341, no. 1 p.159-171dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-010-0980-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03253naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009700184300001600281520151900297650001501816650001101831650001401842650001201856650001201868650001401880650001301894650002801907650001401935650001601949650001301965650001101978650001901989650001402008650001402022650001102036650001302047650001102060650001702071650001902088650002602107650003102133650004102164651001002205651001802215651001002233653002602243653003102269653002002300700002402320700002302344773013402367852000902501856008502510930003302595946001102628655001202639IND4433939220221120031242.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443393922DNAL7 a194155202pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0865-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavikumār, Pi.10aMajor ion chemistry and hydrochemical studies of groundwater of Bangalore South Taluk, India  ap. 643-653.  aGroundwater is almost globally important for human consumption as well as for the support of habitat and for maintaining the quality of base flow to rivers, while its quality assessment is essential to ensure sustainable safe use of the resources for drinking, agricultural, and industrial purposes. In the current study, 28 groundwater samples were collected around Vrishabhavathi valley region of Bangalore South Taluk to assess water quality and investigate hydrochemical nature by analyzing the major cations (Ca² ⁺ , Mg² ⁺ , Na ⁺ , K ⁺ ) and anions [graphic removed] , Cl ⁻ , F ⁻ , [graphic removed] , [graphic removed] , [graphic removed] , [graphic removed] besides some physical and chemical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, and total hardness). Also, geographic information system-based groundwater quality mapping in the form of visually communicating contour maps was developed to delineate spatial variation in physico-chemical characteristics of groundwater samples. Piper trilinear diagram was constructed to identify groundwater groups (hydrochemical facies) using major anionic and cationic concentration and it was found that majority of the samples belongs to [graphic removed] and [graphic removed] hydrochemical facies. Wilcox classification and US Salinity Laboratory hazard diagram suggests that 92.86% of the samples were falling under good to permissible category and C3-S1 groups, respectively, indicating high salinity/low sodium. 3aalkalinity 3aanions 3abase flow 3acalcium 3acations 3achlorides 3adrinking 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3arivers 3asalinity 3asodium 3aspatial data 3awater hardness 2aElectric Conductivity 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aIndia 3aUnited States 0aIndia 0aVrishabhavathi valley 0aCation and anion chemistry 0aSalinity hazard1 aVenkatesharaju, K. 1 aSomashekar, R.

In autopolyploids, changes to the nuclear environment are not as profound as in allopolyploids, and therefore the effects of genome doubling on gene regulation remain unclear. To investigate the consequences of autopolyploidization per se, we performed a microarray analysis in three equivalent lineages of matched diploids and autotetraploids of Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, we compared the expression levels of GFP transgenes driven by endogenous enhancer elements (enhancer traps) in diploids and autotetraploid of 16 transgenic lines. We expected that true ploidy-dependent changes should occur in independently derived autopolyploid lineages. By this criterion, our microarray analysis detected few changes associated with polyploidization, while the enhancer-trap analysis revealed altered GFP expression at multiple plant life stages for 25% of the lines tested. Genes on individual traps were coordinately regulated while endogenous gene expression was not affected except for one line. The unique sensitivity of enhancer traps to ploidy, in contrast to the observed stability of genes, could derive from lower complexity of regulatory pathways acting on traps versus endogenous genes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aallopolyploidy 3aautopolyploidy 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3aenhancer elements 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahybridization 3amicroarray technology 3atranscriptome 3atransgenes 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aDiploidy 2aEnhancer Elements, Geneticxgenetics 2aFluorescence 2aGene Duplication 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPolyploidy 0aenhancer gene trap 0agene regulation 0amicroarray1 aDilkes, Brian P.1 aYoo, Suk-Young1 aHenry, Isabelle M.1 aMadlung, Andreas1 aDoerge, R.

Younger eaters may prefer fast foods to conventional hospital meals, and older people may have some loss of sensory discrimination resulting in a less critical attitude toward the food. Environmental differences in dining were more important than other variables between staff and patients; ambulatory patients and staff rated the dining room environment similarly and unlike ward patients. The extent to which hospital foodservice problems are interrelated with general attitudes and feelings of the consumers was shown by the finding that mood, job satisfaction, and patient satisfaction with medical care all were significantly correlated with ratings of food and foodservice. About 20% of patients supplemented their meals with snacks, suggesting the need to continue improving the acceptability of hospital food and foodservice. 3aage 3aconsumer satisfaction 3ahospital food service 3asurveys 3aenvironmental factors 3afood acceptability 3asnacks 3aattitudes and opinions 0aDining rooms 0aMilitary food service1 aDuBose, Cynthia N.1 aCardello, Armand V.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1980 Mar., v. 76, no. 3 p.236-242aAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801020c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01874naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245003800136300001600174300002400190520092600214650001201140650002401152650001301176650003501189650001801224650000901242650001201251650002201263653002001285653002301305773013301328852000901461939003301470945000801503946001301511655001201524991595781730742620221117182907.0800926e198002  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800026412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunro, Hamish N.10aMajor gaps in nutrient allowances  ap. 137-141.  ap. 137-141. charts.  aFew nutrition reports or recommendations deal with the dietary needs of a large sector of the population, the elderly. Nutrition has 3 potential aspects for the aging: tissue function is progressively lost; aging results in accumulation of some diseases which probably have nutritional components, such as atherosclerosis or cancer; and the optimal nutrient intakes of the elderly are not known. The nutritional needs of elderly adults are different from young and middle-aged adults. Recent studies show a progressive decline in energy needs with age, from 2,700 kcal at age 30 to 2,100 kcal at 80. Ascorbic acid intake in the elderly can be as low as half that of young adults and iron deficiency among elderly women is uncommon. Calcium and vitamin A deficiencies are reflected in the high rate of osteoporosis and bone fractures. Protein intake is low among the elderly, since caloric intake is often greatly reduced. 3aelderly 3adeficiency diseases 3aproteins 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3aascorbic acid 3airon 3acalcium 3aelderly nutrition 0aGeriatric diets 0aNutrient standards0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1980 Feb., v. 76, no. 2 p.137-141aAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800926c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02405naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245013000158300001600288520100200304650001301306650002001319650001901339650002001358650002301378650001501401650001901416650002901435650001701464650001501481650001501496650002001511651001001531653003301541653001401574653003201588653002401620700001401644700001801658700001901676773010201695852000901797856008501806930003301891946001101924655001201935IND4437042820221117175830.0100514e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443704282DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-010-1542-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Li 10aTrace Analysis of Fifteen Androgens in Environmental Waters by LC-ESI-MS-MS Combined with Solid-Phase Disk Extraction Cleanup  ap. 867-873.  aA rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry method, combined with solid-phase disk extraction cleanup, was developed and applied to the analysis of fifteen androgens in waste water.

Similar estimates of calorie and carbohydrate intakes were produced by both studies. Data on other nutrients ranged from 6%-88% with the computerized questionnaire; the dietary assessment service included apparently unwarranted recommendations regarding mineral and vitamin supplements.

These transformations are more extreme in some legume species than others, leading to fundamental differences in rhizobial life history and evolution. Here, we analysed the distribution of different bacteroid morphologies over a legume phylogeny to understand the evolutionary history of this host-influenced differentiation. Using existing electron micrographs and new flow cytometric analyses, bacteroid morphologies were categorized as swollen or nonswollen for 40 legume species in the subfamily Papilionoideae. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks were used to reconstruct ancestral states at the bases of all major subclades within the papilionoids. Extreme bacteroid differentiation leading to swelling was found in five out of the six major papilionoid subclades. The inferred ancestral state for the Papilionoideae was hosting nonswollen bacteroids, indicating at least five independent origins of host traits leading to swollen bacteroids. Repeated evolution of host traits causing bacteroid swelling indicates a possible fitness benefit to the plant. Furthermore, as bacteroid swelling is often correlated with loss of reproductive viability, the evolution of bacteroid cooperation or cheating strategies could be fundamentally different between the two bacteroid morphologies. 3aFaboideae 3aflow cytometry 3alegumes 3alife history 3aphylogeny 3aviability 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFabaceaexgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aFlow Cytometry 2aPhylogeny 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aRhizobiumxcytologyxphysiology. 2aRoot Nodules, Plantxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 0aancestral character state reconstruction 0abacteroid 0anodule type 0apapilionoid legumes 0arhizobia1 aSchmitt, Imke1 aSprent, Janet I.1 aDenison, R.

The evaluation instrument contained 82 competency statements of functional responsibilities in administrative and clinical dietetics; it was administered to hospital dietitians in a 5-state area and 290 survey questionnaires were analyzed. Respondents were asked to indicate who should perform a given activity according to a 5-point scale. Results indicated that dietitians were more willing to delegate routine administrative tasks than clinical ones. The potential for delegation was influenced by the respondent's position, experience, and years in the profession. On the basis of the competencies defined for dietetic practice, dietitians were most willing to delegate food service management functions to technicians. Although no clinical competencies were considered to have high delegation potential, some nutritional care activities were marked as having potential for shared responsibility between dietetian and dietetic technician. These findings have implications for the design of technical education programs.

Components of this strategy include: examining current practices and needs; redefining roles and responsibilities; delineating goals, objectives, and action plans; communicating objectives and plans to change "targets", and evaluating progress so that objectives may be revised if necessary. Results of this strategy as applied in one health care setting are gratifying. Included are implementation of a comprehensive nutritional assessment program, acquisition of support personnel, and expansion of the role of clinical dietitians.

Self-administered questionnaires were returned by 232 of 448 randomly selected members of the Ohio Dietetic Association. The findings indicate that dietitians perceived a greater educational need for professional knowledge than for behavioral, communicative, and socio-cultural sciences. Higher need levels were expressed for skills in technical and human ability than for skills in conceptual ability, and, generally, for nutritional knowledge rather than knowledge application. High interest in nutritional care topics was consistent with the fact that 68% of the employed respondents indicated responsibility in clinical and general practice. 3adietitians 3asurveys 3aprofessional education 3ahealth education 3ahealth services 3anutrition education 3anutrition knowledge 3aadult education 2aAdministrative Personnelxeducation 2aBehavioral Sciencesxeducation 2aCommunication 2aCultural Characteristics 2aDiet Therapy 2aDietary Servicesxorganization & administration 2aDieteticsxeducation 2aEducation, Continuingxstandards 2aHealth Facilities 2aHumans 2aNutritional Sciencesxeducation 2aProfessional Practice 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf-Evaluation Programsxstandards 2aSocioeconomic Factors1 aHubbard, Rachel M.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1979 Oct., v. 75, no. 4 p.429-433aAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800116c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02576naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245007800155300001600233300003000249500001500279520068200294650002600976650003301002650001301035650003801048650002301086650001501109650001001124650001801134650001601152650001601168650001001184650002101194650005101215650004201266650004601308650001801354650002201372650003801394650007201432650007401504650001101578650001101589650001101600650001501611650002301626653002301649653002301672653002201695700002101717700002201738700002501760773010201785852000901887939003301896945000801929946001301937655001201950991595780170742620221117160530.0831221e198308  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830035542DNAL7 a64099532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaeschel, Inge E.10aDiet and growth of children with glycogen storage disease Types I and III  ap. 135-141.  ap. 135-141. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: Patients with glycogen storage disease (GSD) Types I and III were placed on a dietary treatment plan of frequent daytime feedings and continuous drip nocturnal enteral feedings of defined nutrient composition. Specific anthropometric measurements were collected to document and evaluate growth. There were a significant increase in arm muscle area and a relative decrease in triceps skinfold thickness not previously documented in the literature. Study results confirmed previous reports of accelerated growth rate and improvement of biochemical abnormalities. The dietitian's role in nutrition assessment and dietary management of GSD patients is emphasized.

Blocking or modulation of CD-specific T cell response by altered prolamin peptides are currently considered as a potential alternative to the only effective therapy of CD based on a life-long gluten-free diet. Two prolamin peptides, the 9-mer ASRVAPGQQ and the 10-mer GTVGVAPGQQ sequences, were identified by mass spectrometry in the peptic/tryptic digest of prolamins (PTP) from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) cv. Adamello, and investigated for their ability to preclude the stimulation of CD-specific mucosal T cells by gluten proteins. Methods Gluten-specific polyclonal intestinal T cell lines from five CD children (mean age 5 years) were exposed to 50 μg/ml of a deamidated PTP from whole flour of common wheat (T. aestivum) cv. San Pastore, and tested for proliferation and production of interferon-γ (INF-γ) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). The same experiment was performed in the presence of 20 μg/ml of the 9-mer or the 10-mer peptide. Results T cells exposed to PTP showed a threefold increase in proliferation and INF-γ production, and a significant (P ≤ 0.05) reduction in IL-10 secretion as compared with control cells incubated with the culture medium. Addition of either the 9-mer or the 10-mer peptide to PTP downregulated T cell proliferation and INF-γ production, and caused a significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in IL-10 secretion. Conclusions The T cell reactivity elicited by PTP is precluded by both the 9-mer and the 10-mer sequence, suggesting that over-expression of these proteolytically stable peptides may result in a wheat flour with reduced toxicity for CD patients. 3agluten-free diet 3asecretion 3aT-lymphocytes 3aceliac disease 3agluten 3ainterferon-gamma 3aprolamins 3adurum wheat 3atherapeutics 3awheat flour 3achildren 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3apatients 3ainterleukin-10 3atoxicity 3amass spectrometry 3acell proliferation 3aculture media 2aCeliac Diseasexgeneticsximmunology. 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aGlutensximmunology 2aHumans 2aInterferon-gammaxsecretion. 2aInterleukin-10xsecretion. 2aLymphocyte Activationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aProlaminsxpharmacology 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aTriticumxchemistry 0apeptides1 aVincentini, Olimpia 1 aDi Nardo, Giovanni 1 aBoirivant, Monica 1 aGazza, Laura 1 aPogna, Norberto 0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2010 June, v. 49, no. 4 p.251-255dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-009-0080-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02171naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245004800161300001600209520139600225653001001621700002001631773012801651852000901779856008501788930003301873946001101906655001201917IND4430742520221123001229.0100101e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443074252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00285-008-0201-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHillen, T. 12aA user's guide to PDE models for chemotaxis  ap. 183-217.  aMathematical modelling of chemotaxis (the movement of biological cells or organisms in response to chemical gradients) has developed into a large and diverse discipline, whose aspects include its mechanistic basis, the modelling of specific systems and the mathematical behaviour of the underlying equations. The Keller-Segel model of chemotaxis (Keller and Segel in J Theor Biol 26:399-415, 1970; 30:225-234, 1971) has provided a cornerstone for much of this work, its success being a consequence of its intuitive simplicity, analytical tractability and capacity to replicate key behaviour of chemotactic populations. One such property, the ability to display “auto-aggregation”, has led to its prominence as a mechanism for self-organisation of biological systems. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to finite-time blow-up under certain formulations of the model, and a large body of work has been devoted to determining when blow-up occurs or whether globally existing solutions exist. In this paper, we explore in detail a number of variations of the original Keller-Segel model. We review their formulation from a biological perspective, contrast their patterning properties, summarise key results on their analytical properties and classify their solution form. We conclude with a brief discussion and expand on some of the outstanding issues revealed as a result of this work. 0a92C171 aPainter, K.

Peak emission of these compounds occurred during the third to fifth hours of the photophase arid differences were observed in the ratios of the three components emitted by male laboratory-reared and wild flies. These three compounds were synthesized, and a method was developed to formulate a synthetic blend that released the compounds in a ratio similar to that emitted by wild male medflies. Attractiveness of the blend to female medflies was demonstrated under field conditions by comparing trap catches. Black spherical traps, baited with the synthetic blend to release 1.6 male equivalents, caught significantly more females than blank traps and traps from which the blend released was 0.3, 3.2 or 6.4 male equivalents. 3aCeratitis capitata 3asex pheromones 3achemical composition 3asynthesis 3abioassays 3ainsect traps 3ainsect control 3abiological control1 aLandolt, P.J.1 aTumlinson, J.H.1 aChambers, D.L.1 aMurphy, R.E.1 aDoolittle, R.E.1 aDueben, B.D.1 aSivinski, J.1 aCalkins, C.O.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1991 Sept., v. 17, no. 9 p.1925-1940x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009937393Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01725naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245006300173300001800236520078100254650001501035650001101050650001401061650002501075700001501100700001601115700002001131700001501151773008801166852000901254856007801263939003301341946001301374655001201387IND9302478320221123001331.0930426e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930247832DNAL7 a242579282pmid7 a10.1007/BF009937362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, T.H.10aChemistry of venom alkaloids in the ant genus Megalomyrmex  ap. 1897-1908.  aChemical analyses of three species in the Neotropical ant genus Megalomyrmex have identified this taxon as the third myrmicine genus to produce alkaloids as major venom products. Workers of U. leoninus and workers and ergatoids of U. goeldii produce one or more of four trans-2.5-dialkylpyrrolidines previously identified in other myrmicine genera. M. modestus, on the other hand, is distinctive in producing the novel alkaloid (SE,8E)-3-butyl-5-hexylpyrrolizidine (5d), whose structure was established using a micro-Hofmann degradation sequence. The relationship of Megalomyrmex to other alkaloid-producing ant genera is discussed along with the possible chemotaxonomic significance of the analyzed species when viewed in terms of the recognized species groups in this genus. 3aFormicidae 3avenoms 3aalkaloids 3achemical composition1 aBlum, M.S.1 aFales, H.M.1 aBrandao, C.R.F.1 aLattke, J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1991 Sept., v. 17, no. 9 p.1897-1908x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009937363Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02765naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245015700169300001600326520106000342650002401402650002501426650001101451650002501462650001101487650000901498650002001507650001201527650001301539650001501552650002101567650003201588650002301620650001701643650001201660650001101672650002801683650001201711650001401723650002601737650001001763653004101773653001501814653001601829653001801845700002101863700002501884700001501909773013001924852000902054856009202063930003302155946001102188655001202199IND4434188120221123001231.0100319e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443418812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-5967.2010.00272.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ajit.14aThe inhibition of molting fluid enzymes of Pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) by an aspartic protease inhibitor: Its effects on insect development  ap. 113-121.  aIn this study, the inhibition of molting fluid enzymes from Helicoverpa armigera by an aspartic protease inhibitor, Alkalophilic Thermophilic Bacillus Inhibitor (ATBI) purified from Bacillus sp. is reported. The in vitro experiments showed 80% inhibition (IC₅₀= 48 μM) of hemoglobin hydrolyzing and 95% inhibition (IC₅₀= 35 μM) of chitin hydrolyzing activity from molting fluid by ATBI (IC₅₀ value is the ATBI concentration for 50% inhibition of total enzymatic activity). The treatment of H. armigera larvae with 400 μM ATBI recorded 20% larval mortality, 27.77% deformed pupae and 12.22% deformed adults. The LC₅₀ value (Concentration of ATBI calculated to give 50% mortality) calculated for insect population was found to be 330.06 μM. Similarly, significant variations in mean larval and pupal weight, no. of eggs laid per female and percent hatching of eggs were observed at higher concentrations of ATBI. The results may provide the basis for the selection of non-host inhibitors to develop a H. armigera insecticide formulation. 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aadults 3aaspartic proteinases 3achitin 3aeggs 3aenzyme activity 3afemales 3ahatching 3ahemoglobin 3ain vitro studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsect development 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amolting 3amortality 3aproteinase inhibitors 3apupae 0aAlkalo-Thermoplic Bacillus Inhibitor 0achitinases 0aH. armigera 0amolting fluid1 aKULYE, Mahesh S.1 aDeshpande, Mukund V.1 aRao, Mala.0 tEntomological research.g2010 Mar., v. 40, no. 2 p.113-121dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1738-22977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5967.2010.00272.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100319b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03171naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001400154245008000168300001600248520141400264650001301678650001401691650001001705650002101715650001301736650001301749650002001762650001001782650001901792650001601811650002901827650001201856650001401868650003001882650004301912650003001955650002001985650002402005650000902029650004502038650003102083650003102114650004502145650001702190653002502207653001802232653001302250700001402263700001602277700001402293773013402307852000902441856007502450930003302525946001102558655001202569IND4436214920221122224834.0100430s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443621492DNAL7 a204508392pmid7 a10.1071/RD091742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnzar, M.10aResponse of buffalo spermatozoa to low temperatures during cryopreservation  ap. 871-880.  aThis is the first detailed report on the response of buffalo spermatozoa to low temperatures during freezing. The study determined the critical temperature zone for buffalo spermatozoa and developed a suitable freezing rate for this species. Semen from four Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls diluted in Tris-citric acid was frozen in a programmable freezer. Motion characteristics, plasma membrane integrity and acrosome morphology were determined at +4, 0, -5, -10, -20, -30, -40, -50, -80 and -196°C by removing semen straws from the freezer at exactly these temperatures and rewarming them at 37°C. The first statistical decline in sperm motility and lateral head displacement was observed at -40°C. For all other parameters, there was biphasic decline: for curvilinear velocity, at 0°C and -50°C; and for plasma membrane integrity and acrosome morphology, at -30°C and -50°C. In a second series of experiments, buffalo spermatozoa were frozen using slow (-10°C min⁻¹), medium (-20°C min⁻¹) or fast (-30°C min⁻¹) freezing rates, between -10°C and -80°C. Freezing of buffalo spermatozoa at a rate of -30°C min⁻¹ yielded higher post-thaw motion characteristics, plasma membrane integrity and normal acrosomes. In conclusion, different sperm characteristics respond differently at low temperatures and the freezing of buffalo spermatozoa at a higher rate ensures higher post-thaw semen quality. 3aacrosome 3abuffaloes 3abulls 3acryopreservation 3afreezers 3afreezing 3aplasma membrane 3asemen 3asperm motility 3atemperature 2aAcrosomexultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloes 2aCell Membranexphysiology 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aFreezingxadverse effects 2aHot Temperature 2aHypotonic Solutions 2aMale 2aSemen Preservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSperm Headxultrastructure 2aSperm Motilityxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aTime Factors 0acritical temperature 0afreezing rate 0amotility1 aRasul, Z.1 aAhmed, T.A.1 aAhmad, N.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2010, v. 22, no. 5 p.871-880dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD091743Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03774naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245015000190300001600340520210000356650002302456650001202479650002502491650001102516650002402527650005102551650002402602650003502626650004802661650003002709650002802739650003102767650000902798650001702807650005702824653001702881653001802898653001302916653001502929700001802944700001402962700002002976773012702996852000903123856009203132930003303224946001103257655001203268IND4439010120221122210857.0100625e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443901012DNAL7 a205907502pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01227.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindborg, K.A.10aEffects of in vitro antagonism of endocannabinoid-1 receptors on the glucose transport system in normal and insulin-resistant rat skeletal muscle  ap. 722-730.  aObjective: We determined the direct effects of modulating the endocannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor on the glucose transport system in isolated skeletal muscle from insulin-sensitive lean Zucker and insulin-resistant obese Zucker rats. Methods: Soleus strips were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin, without or with various concentrations of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 or with the CB1 receptor agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA). Results: CB1 receptor protein expression in visceral adipose (57%), soleus (40%) and myocardial (36%) tissue was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in obese compared to lean animals, with a trend for a reduction (17%, p = 0.079) in the liver. In isolated soleus muscle from both lean and obese Zucker rats, CB1 receptor antagonism directly improved glucose transport activity in a dose-dependent manner. Basal glucose transport activity was maximally enhanced between 100 and 200 nM SR141716 in lean (26-28%) and obese (22-31%) soleus. The maximal increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport for lean muscle (~30%) was achieved at 50 nM SR141716 and for obese muscle (~30%) at 100 nM SR141716. In contrast, CB1 receptor antagonism did not alter hypoxia-stimulated glucose transport activity. CB1 receptor agonism (1 mM ACEA) significantly decreased both basal (15%) and insulin-stimulated (22%) glucose transport activity in isolated lean soleus. This effect was reversed by 200 nM SR141716. In both lean and obese muscle, the functionality of key signalling proteins (insulin receptor β-subunit, Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)) was not altered by either CB1 receptor agonism or antagonism. Conclusion: These results indicate that the engagement of CB1 receptor can negatively modulate both basal and insulin-dependent glucose transport activity in lean and obese skeletal muscles, and that these effects are not mediated by the engagement of elements of the canonical pathways regulating this process in mammalian skeletal muscle. 3ainsulin resistance 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aFemale 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aMuscle, Skeletalxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPiperidinesxpharmacology 2aPyrazolesxpharmacology 2aQuinoxalinesxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Zucker 2aReceptor, Cannabinoid, CB1xantagonists & inhibitors 0aCB1 receptor 0asoleus muscle 0aSR141716 0aZucker rat1 aTeachey, M.K.1 aJacob, S.1 aHenriksen, E.J.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2010 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.722-730dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01227.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100628b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03417naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245009400168300001600262520198100278650001902259650001602278650001202294650002202306650002102328650002102349650001402370650000902384650001002393650001502403650002302418650003202441650002902473650002402502650001002526650001202536650002002548653002002568653001402588700002102602700002302623700002002646773011202666852000902778856009202787930003302879946001102912655001202923IND4436583820221122210926.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443658382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2009.02228.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, R.V.10aBiochemical responses of coffee resistance against Meloidogyne exigua mediated by silicon  ap. 586-593.  aCoffea arabica cultivars Catuaí 44 and IAPAR 59, susceptible and resistant, respectively, to the root knot nematode Meloidogyne exigua, were grown in pots containing Si-deficient soil amended with either calcium silicate (+Si) or calcium carbonate (-Si). There was an increase of 152 and 100%, respectively, in Si content of root tissue of cvs Catuaí 44 and IAPAR 59 in the +Si compared to the -Si treatment, but no significant difference between Si treatments for calcium content. Plants, assessed 150 days after inoculation (d.a.i.) showed that the number of galls (NG) and number of eggs (NE) significantly decreased by 16·8 and 28·1% respectively, for susceptible cv. Catuaí 44 in the presence of Si, whilst both NG and NE were significantly lower for cv. IAPAR 59 compared to the susceptible cultivar regardless of Si treatments. In a separate experiment, biochemical assays were carried out 5 and 10 d.a.i. There was no significant difference between Si treatments and cultivars for concentration of total soluble phenolics. The concentration of lignin-thioglycolic acid (LTGA) derivatives significantly increased by 11·5% in roots of nematode-inoculated plants of susceptible cv. Catuaí supplied with Si. In roots of inoculated plants of resistant cv. IAPAR 59, the increase was 23 and 10%, respectively, for treatments with and without silicon. Peroxidase (POX), polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activities significantly increased in roots of inoculated plants compared with roots of non-inoculated plants, regardless of cultivar or Si treatment. In +Si treatments at 10 d.a.i., POX activity in roots of nematode-inoculated plants of cvs Catuaí 44 and IAPAR 59 increased by 39·9 and 31·3%, respectively; PPO increased by 54·9 and 56·1%; and PAL activity was also higher at 26·6 and 62·9%. It was concluded that supplying Si to coffee plants increases root resistance against M. exigua by decreasing its reproductive capacity. 3aCoffea arabica 3aMeloidogyne 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium silicate 3acatechol oxidase 3acultivars 3aeggs 3agalls 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3areproductive performance 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 3asilicon 3asoil amendments 0ahost resistance 0aphenolics1 aOliveira, R.D.L.1 aNascimento, K.J.T.1 aRodrigues, F.A.0 tPlant pathology.g2010 June, v. 59, no. 3 p.586-593dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2009.02228.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03530naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245017000194300001600364520157700380650001501957650001601972650001401988650005202002650002502054650002602079650001602105650002102121650003302142650002402175650003702199650001302236650003602249650006702285650004302352650003602395653001202431653001902443653002302462653001102485700002702496700002402523700002002547700002102567700002202588700001802610700001602628700001702644773014602661852000902807856009202816930003302908946001102941655001202952IND4434541720221122210925.0100326e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443454172DNAL7 a204869302pmid7 a10.1111/j.1747-0285.2010.00957.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, J. Richard14aThe Use of Biochemical and Biophysical Tools for Triage of High-Throughput Screening Hits - A Case Study with Escherichia coli Phosphopantetheine Adenylyltransferase  ap. 444-454.  aHigh-throughput screening is utilized by pharmaceutical researchers and, increasingly, academic investigators to identify agents that act upon enzymes, receptors, and cellular processes. Screening hits include molecules that specifically bind the target and a greater number of non-specific compounds. It is necessary to 'triage' these hits to identify the subset worthy of further exploration. As part of our antibacterial drug discovery effort, we applied a suite of biochemical and biophysical tools to accelerate the triage process. We describe application of these tools to a series of 9-oxo-4,9-dihydropyrazolo[5,1-b]quinazoline-2-carboxylic acids (PQ) hits from a screen of Escherichia coli phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT). Initial confirmation of specific binding to phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase was obtained using biochemical and biophysical tools, including a novel orthogonal assay, isothermal titration calorimetry, and saturation transfer difference NMR. To identify the phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase sub-site bound by these inhibitors, two techniques were utilized: steady-state enzyme kinetics and a novel ¹⁹F NMR method in which fluorine-containing fragments that bind the ATP and/or phosphopantetheine sites serve as competitive reporter probes. These data are consistent with PQs binding the ATP sub-site. In addition to identification of a series of PPAT inhibitors, the described hit triage process is broadly applicable to other enzyme targets in which milligram quantities of purified target protein are available. 3abiophysics 3acalorimetry 3ascreening 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBinding, Competitive 2aBiophysical Phenomena 2aCalorimetry 2aCatalytic Domain 2aEscherichia colixenzymology 2aFluorinexchemistry 2aHigh-Throughput Screening Assays 2aKinetics 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aQuinazolinesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0a19F NMR 0aantibacterials 0aphosphopantetheine 0atriage1 aThanabal, Venkataraman1 aMelnick, Michael M.1 aLall, Manjinder1 aDonovan, Charles1 aSarver, Ronald W.1 aLee, Doh-Yeel1 aOhren, Jeff1 aEmerson, Don0 tChemical biology & drug design.g2010 May, v. 75, no. 5 p.444-454dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895937x1747-02857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2010.00957.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100326b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02413naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015800161520126800319592002801587650000801615650002501623650001301648650001101661650001201672650001201684650001701696650001801713650001501731650001001746650001601756650001101772700002501783700002101808773012701829856007401956852000902030655001202039IND60652195520221120200339.0190712e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065219552DNAL7 a10.3390/su100308892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomingo, Rosario12aA Multi-Response Optimization of Thrust Forces, Torques, and the Power of Tapping Operations by Cooling Air in Reinforced and Unreinforced Polyamide PA66  aThe use of cooling air during machining is an environmentally conscious procedure, and its applicability to different processes is a research priority. We studied tapping operations, an important operation in the assembly process, using cooling air with unreinforced polyamide (PA66) and polyamide reinforced with glass fiber (PA66-GF30). These materials are widely used in industry, but their behavior with respect to tapping has not been studied. We analyze the outcomes regarding the thrust force, torque, and power at cutting speeds between 15 and 60 m/min. The experimental tests were executed using cooling air at 22 °C, 2 °C, and −18 °C in dry conditions. The M12 × 1.75 mm taps were high-speed steel, with cobalt as the base material and coatings of TiN and AlCrN. To identify the more influential factors, an analysis of variance was performed, along with multi-response optimization to identify the desirability values. This optimization shows that the optimum for PA66can be found in environments close to 3 °C, while the optimum for PA66-GF30 is found at the minimal temperature studied (−18 °C). Thus, cooling air can be considered an adequate procedure for tapping operations, to increase the sustainability of the manufacturing processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanalysis of variance 3acoatings 3acobalt 3acooling 3acutting 3aglass fibers 3amanufacturing 3apolyamides 3asteel 3atemperature 3atorque1 ade Agustina, Beatriz1 aMarín, Marta M.0 tSustainability.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100308893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04998naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245011800203300001100321506007600332520240200408592002802810596009202838596008202930596008703012506003703099650002503136650001303161650002503174650001803199650001403217650002703231650001403258650002503272650001903297650001603316650001603332650001503348650001103363650002203374650001103396650002103407650003103428650001003459650001203469650001203481650002303493650001803516650004203534650002003576650002103596650001803617650001403635650001003649650001103659650001603670650004803686650002203734650001003756650002403766650001103790650001203801650001803813650001803831651001003849700002103859700001503880700001603895700001403911700005503925773009803980856008104078852000904159655001204168IND60649667420221207142849.0200527e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064966742DNAL7 a312723712pmid7 aPMC66109722pmcid7 a10.1186/s12863-019-0760-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Weibo10aHepatic transcriptome profile of sheep (Ovis aries) in response to overgrazing: novel genes and pathways revealed  ap. 54.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Overgrazing is a major factor that causes steppe degradation in Inner Mongolian, resulting in extensive ecosystem damage. Scarcity of grass means sheep are smaller and therefore mutton and cashmere production is greatly reduced, which has resulted in massive annual economic losses. Liver is the primary metabolic organ in mammals. It is also the key source of energy supply and detoxification of metabolites in animals, has a close relationship with animal growth. However, investigations on the responses of sheep induced by consequence of overgrazing, particularly those relating to liver-related molecular mechanisms and related metabolic pathways, remain elusive. RESULTS: The body weight daily gain of sheep, immune organ indices (liver and spleen), and serum parameters related to immune response, protein synthesis and energy supply (IgG, albumin, glucose and non-esterified fatty acid) were significantly lower in the overgrazing group. Other serum parameters including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen and interleukin-6 were significantly higher in the overgrazing group. For the RNA-Seq results, we identified approximately 50 differentially expressed genes, of which half of were up-regulated and the other half were down-regulated (overgrazing group versus light grazing group). Bioinformatics analysis identified two enriched KEGG pathways including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway (related to lipolysis) and ECM-receptor interaction (related to liver injury and apoptosis). Additionally, several of the down-regulated genes were related to detoxification and immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, based on the high-throughput RNA sequencing profile integrated with the results of serum biochemical analyses, consequences of lower forage availability and quality under overgrazing condition induced altered expression levels of genes participating in energy metabolism (particularly lipid metabolism) and detoxification and immune responses, causing lipolysis and impaired health status, which might be key reasons for the reduced growth performance of sheep. This investigation provides a novel foundation for the development of sheep hepatic gene interactive networks that are a response to the degraded forage availability under overgrazing condition.  aPublisher supplied data  a1610332016010cthe Fundamental Research Funds for Central Nonprofit Research Institutes  a2014CB138804cthe Chinese National Key Basic Research and Development Program  a2012BAD13B07cthe Chinese National Key Technology Research and Development Program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanimal growth 3aapoptosis 3aaspartate transaminase 3abilirubin 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aforage 3afree fatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3agrasses 3agrowth performance 3ahealth status 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterleukin-6 3alipolysis 3aliver 3amutton 3aovergrazing 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aprotein synthesis 3asheep 3asignal transduction 3aspleen 3asteppes 3atranscriptome 3aurea nitrogen 3aChina1 aBadgery, Warwick1 aDing, Yong1 aGuo, Huiqin1 aGao, Yang1 aZhang, Jize1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3719-37420 tBMC genetics.g2019 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.54-54dBioMed CentralwJournal:2166x1471-21567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-019-0760-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245011300194300001600307500001500323520127800338592002801616650001701644650001301661650002601674650002001700650001801720650001501738650001401753650001501767650002301782650002501805650002701830650002201857650002301879653001101902700003101913700002901944773010001973856005502073852000902128655001202137IND4464756120221119163054.0120503e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446475612DNAL7 a224586592pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04116.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÅgren, Göran I.,10aNutrient limitation on terrestrial plant growth – modeling the interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus  ap. 953-960.  a2019-12-06  a• Growth of plants in terrestrial ecosystems is often limited by the availability of nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) Liebig’s law of the minimum states that the nutrient in least supply relative to the plant’s requirement will limit the plant’s growth. An alternative to the law of the minimum is the multiple limitation hypothesis (MLH) which states that plants adjust their growth patterns such that they are limited by several resources simultaneously. • We use a simple model of plant growth and nutrient uptake to explore the consequences for the plant’s relative growth rate of letting plants invest differentially in N and P uptake. • We find a smooth transition between limiting elements, in contrast to the strict transition in Liebig’s law of the minimum. At N : P supply ratios where the two elements simultaneously limit growth, an increase in either of the nutrients will increase the growth rate because more resources can be allocated towards the limiting element, as suggested by the multiple limitation hypothesis. However, the further the supply ratio deviates from these supply rates, the more the plants will follow the law of the minimum. • Liebig’s law of the minimum will in many cases be a useful first‐order approximation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant growth 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3agrowth models 3aecosystems 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxmetabolism 0aplants1 aWetterstedt, J.

The catalytic performance of some solid acids such as γ-Al₂O₃ and molecular sieves for the self-condensation of n-butyraldehyde was investigated and the results showed that γ-Al₂O₃ was the best one. Then the effect of preparation conditions on the catalytic performance of γ-Al₂O₃ and the effect of reaction conditions on the self-condensation of n-butyraldehyde were discussed. In order to improve the catalytic performance, γ-Al₂O₃ was modified by different substances and Ce–Al₂O₃ was found to show the best catalytic performance; the conversion of n-butyraldehyde and the yield of 2-ethyl-2-hexenal could reach 93.8% and 88.6%, respectively. Moreover, the Ce–Al₂O₃ catalyst had excellent reusability. The XPS analysis of Ce3d demonstrated that the valence state of cerium affected the catalytic performance of Ce–Al₂O₃ to some extent but not predominantly. Instead the acid–base property of Ce–Al₂O₃ played a dominant role in the catalytic performance. The reaction components formed over the Ce–Al₂O₃ catalyst were identified by GC-MS and then some side-reactions were speculated and a reaction network for n-butyraldehyde self-condensation catalyzed by Ce–Al₂O₃ was proposed. Subsequently, the research on the intrinsic kinetics of n-butyraldehyde self-condensation catalyzed by Ce–Al₂O₃ showed that both the forward and backward reactions are second order and the corresponding activation energy is separately 79.60 kJ mol⁻¹ and 74.30 kJ mol⁻¹, which is higher than that of the reaction catalyzed by an aqueous base or acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacids 3aactivation energy 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acerium 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3asieves1 aLiang, Ning1 aAn, Hualiang1 aZhao, Xinqiang1 aWang, Yanji0 tRSC advances.g2015 Dec. 08, v. 5, no. 125 p.103523-103533dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21125e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012500161300001800286500002000304520146200324592002801786650001201814650001801826650001901844650001501863650001701878650002101895650002501916650001401941650001901955700001701974700001701991700002502008700002102033700005902054773015002113856007302263852000902336655001202345IND60596970120221119205236.0180622e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059697012DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.54072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalther, Cornelia10aIntegrated process development ‐ quality by design compliant evaluation of upstream variations at the microscale level  ap. 2021-2032.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Evaluation of optimized upstream conditions is often solely based on titers that do not reflect the downstream process and, consequently, the final purity and yield. This is especially critical for proteins expressed as inclusion bodies (IBs) because the subsequent downstream process is more complex than for soluble proteins. A miniaturized process development platform representing the entire downstream process at a microscale level combined with a multi‐fermenter system for bioprocess screening enables fast investigation, using quality by design (QbD) measures, of the quality of feedstock compositions that are altered by upstream conditions. RESULTS: High‐throughput methods were integrated for an entire process chain, including upstream and downstream processing, for production of a recombinant protein as IBs. The miniaturized process chain consisted of cell disruption, IB harvesting, solubilization, refolding, and chromatographic purification. This enables processing and evaluation of 16 different fermentation conditions within 7 days. Only 2 g of initial biomass was required for evaluation of an individual fermentation. This resulted in a 15‐fold reduction of time and a 100‐fold reduction of material compared with common bench scale experiments. CONCLUSION: This microscale process chain mimics the bench process and is able to differentiate purity variations as low as 2%. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abioprocessing 3achromatography 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3ainclusion bodies 3arecombinant proteins 3ascreening 3asolubilization1 aBoras, Dario1 aDemmel, Lars1 aBerkemeyer, Matthias1 aBrocard, Cecile,1 aDürauer, Astrid1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6007-76970 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 July, v. 93, no. 7 p.2021-2032dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.54073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015000159520170500309592002802014650001502042650002002057650002002077650002602097650001602123650002202139650001502161650002002176650000902196700001402205700001702219700001802236700002002254700001702274700002002291700001702311700001302328700001502341773012902356856007502485852000902560655001202569IND60781077320221120024747.0220623e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078107732DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141228662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yibing 12aA Novel Intelligent Method Based on the Gaussian Heatmap Sampling Technique and Convolutional Neural Network for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping  aLandslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is significant for disaster prevention and mitigation, land use management, and as a reference for decision-making. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning have been successfully applied to LSM studies and have been shown to improve the accuracy of LSM. Although optimizing the quality of negative samples at the input step of a deep learning model can improve the accuracy of the model, the risk of model overfitting may increase. In this study, an LSM method based on the Gaussian heatmap sampling technique and a CNN was developed from the perspective of LSM dataset sampling. A Gaussian heatmap sampling technique was used to enrich the variety of landslide inventory at the input step of the deep learning model to improve the accuracy of the LSM results. This sampling technique involved the construction of a landslide susceptibility Gaussian heatmap neural network model, LSGH-Net, by combining a CNN. A series of optimization strategies such as attention mechanism, dropout, etc., were applied to improve the model structure and training process. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed the benchmark CNN-based algorithm in terms of metrics (Accuracy = 95.30%, F1 score = 95.13%, and Sensitivity = 91.79%). The Gaussian heatmap sampling technique effectively improved the accuracy of frequency histograms of the landslide susceptibility index, which provided finer-grained mapping details and more reasonable landslide density. By analyzing Gaussian heatmap at different scales, the approach proposed in this paper is an important reference for different regions and other disaster susceptibility studies as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adecision making 3adisaster preparedness 3ainventories 3aland use planning 3alandslides 3aneural networks 3arisk1 aZhou, Yi 1 aWang, Futao 1 aWang, Shixin 1 aWang, Zhenqing 1 aJi, Jianwan 1 aWang, Jingming 1 aZou, Weijie 1 aYou, Di 1 aQin, Gang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 15, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141228663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04367naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002200181245014100203300001600344506007600360520242800436592002802864506003702892650001602929650002002945650001702965650001702982650001502999650001603014650001503030650001603045650001203061650001303073650001403086650001703100650001203117650002103129650004603150650003903196650003103235650001403266650001703280653001503297653001603312653001403328653001803342653001403360653002103374653001403395653001703409653001103426653001503437653001403452653001103466700002203477700002403499773009903523856007403622852000903696655001203705IND60115116220221207061658.0150202e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011511622DNAL7 a234863412pmid7 aPMC36313402pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mct0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndress, Peter K.10aAdvances in the floral structural characterization of the major subclades of Malpighiales, one of the largest orders of flowering plants  ap. 969-985.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Malpighiales are one of the largest angiosperm orders and have undergone radical systematic restructuring based on molecular phylogenetic studies. The clade has been recalcitrant to molecular phylogenetic reconstruction, but has become much more resolved at the suprafamilial level. It now contains so many newly identified clades that there is an urgent need for comparative studies to understand their structure, biology and evolution. This is especially true because the order contains a disproportionally large diversity of rain forest species and includes numerous agriculturally important plants. This study is a first broad systematic step in this endeavour. It focuses on a comparative structural overview of the flowers across all recently identified suprafamilial clades of Malpighiales, and points towards areas that desperately need attention. Methods The phylogenetic comparative analysis of floral structure for the order is based on our previously published studies on four suprafamilial clades of Malpighiales, including also four related rosid orders (Celastrales, Crossosomatales, Cucurbitales, Oxalidales). In addition, the results are compiled from a survey of over 3000 publications on macrosystematics, floral structure and embryology across all orders of the core eudicots. Key Results Most new suprafamilial clades within Malpighiales are well supported by floral structural features. Inner morphological structures of the gynoecium (i.e. stigmatic lobes, inner shape of the locules, placentation, presence of obturators) and ovules (i.e. structure of the nucellus, thickness of the integuments, presence of vascular bundles in the integuments, presence of an endothelium in the inner integument) appear to be especially suitable for characterizing suprafamilial clades within Malpighiales. Conclusions Although the current phylogenetic reconstruction of Malpighiales is much improved compared with earlier versions, it is incomplete, and further focused phylogenetic and morphological studies are needed. Once all major subclades of Malpighiales are elucidated, more in-depth studies on promising structural features can be conducted. In addition, once the phylogenetic tree of Malpighiales, including closely related orders, is more fully resolved, character optimization studies will be possible to reconstruct evolution of structural and biological features within the order.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCelastrales 3aCrossosomatales 3aCucurbitales 3aMalpighiales 3aOxalidales 3acorrelation 3aembryology 3aendothelium 3aflowers 3anucellus 3aphylogeny 3arain forests 3asurveys 3avascular bundles 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aMalpighiaceaexanatomy & histology 2aOvulexanatomy & histology 2aPhylogeny 2aReproduction 0aAndroecium 0aCelastrales 0aCOM clade 0acore eudicots 0aevolution 0afloral structure 0agynoecium 0aMalpighiales 0aovules 0aOxalidales 0aphylogeny 0arosids1 aDavis, Charles C.1 aMatthews, Merran L.0 tAnnals of botany.g2013 May, v. 111, no. 5 p.969-985dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mct0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002100168245010200189300001600291520139600307592002801703650001501731650001001746650001201756650001301768650001201781650002501793650003901818650004201857650001401899650003101913700002301944700002101967773011001988856008302098852000902181655001202190IND60082787920221120132637.0141101e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008278792DNAL7 a221557132pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2011.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNardi, Francesco10aInternal consistency as a method to assess the quality of dating estimates using multiple markers  ap. 874-879.  aMultiple tools are available to infer time in phylogentic reconstructions and multiple markers/genes are generally used to obtain more solid reconstructions, opening to the issue of which marker performs better in dating. Following the observation that multiple markers, applied to the same group of taxa or even to the same topology, generally produce different time estimates, we suggest two new estimators: DDⱼₖ to quantify the discordance between two ultrametric dated trees with identical topology and IDⱼ to quantify the discordance of one tree with respect to a study-set of trees in terms of their date estimates. Furthermore we suggest a procedure based on a stepwise exclusion algorithm to rank trees from the most to the least consistent with the study-set of trees based on their time estimates. We name the quality of a tree of having time estimates that agree with the majority of other trees as ‘internal consistency’. We applied this procedure to assess the internal consistency of trees individually obtained from 14 mitochondrial markers in 5 insect orders and to test whether one or more markers repeatedly produce dates that are more consistent. Three genes (nad4, nad5 and cytb) repeatedly perform better than others, one (cox2) worse. We suggest this method could be applied in evaluating the performance of different markers preliminary to a dating analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3agenes 3ainsects 3atopology 2aAnimals 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aInsectaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMultilocus Sequence Typingxstandards 2aPhylogeny 2aReproducibility of Results1 aCarapelli, Antonio1 aFrati, Francesco0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2012 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.874-879dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017100159300002000330520133400350592002801684650004401712650002301756650002201779650003701801650000901838650003701847650003901884650001401923650001601937650001501953650001701968650004401985650001902029650001902048650003302067650002002100650003702120650003702157700002102194700001902215700002102234773012402255856007402379852000902453655001202462IND60640528620221119131405.0190504e20160411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064052862DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04392e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Tonkeswar10aFormation of onion-like fullerene and chemically converted graphene-like nanosheets from low-quality coals: application in photocatalytic degradation of 2-nitrophenol  ap. 35177-35190.  aThe formation of coal-derived carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) consisting of onion-like fullerene and chemically converted graphene-like nanosheets from the low-quality coals were observed during an oxidation-cum-extraction (OCE) process. Detailed characterization of these CNMs was examined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), solid-state ¹³C NMR, UV-visible spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy (FL) techniques. The size of the coal-derived onion-like fullerenes was found to be in the size range of 5–20 nm and composed of 5–20 nm concentric shells. The outer diameter of the onion-like structures was estimated to be in the range of 3–15 nm. The presence of clusters of chemically converted graphene-like nanosheets was also observed in the coal-derived CNMs obtained by this novel OCE process. The method reported in this paper could be an inexpensive and simple chemical process for the preparation of CNMs from coals. These low-quality coal-derived CNMs were utilized as an efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of hazardous 2-nitrophenol under natural sunlight irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acoal 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afullerene 3airradiation 3ananosheets 3anitrophenols 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolar radiation 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aBoruah, Purna K.1 aDas, Manash R.1 aSaikia, Binoy K.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 11, v. 6, no. 42 p.35177-35190dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04392e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245014000206300002000346520142500366592002801791596009901819650003501918650002201953650002501975650001902000650001302019650001802032650001302050650002002063650004402083650001402127650002602141650000902167650002402176650001502200653002902215653000902244653002202253653003202275653002602307653002602333700002102359700003102380700002102411700002402432773014202456856008002598852000902678655001202687IND60788984420220818000000.0220818e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078898442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.2c009002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazzei, Pierluigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5312-496910aQuantitative Evaluation of Noncovalent Interactions between 3,4-Dimethyl-1H-pyrazole and Dissolved Humic Substances by NMR Spectroscopy  ap. 11771-11779.  aNitrification inhibitors (NI) represent a valid chemical strategy to retard nitrogen oxidation in soil and limit nitrate leaching or nitrogen oxide emission. We hypothesized that humic substances can complex NI, thus affecting their activity, mobility, and persistence in soil. Therefore, we focused on 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) by placing it in contact with increasing concentrations of model fulvic (FA) and humic (HA) acids. The complex formation was assessed through advanced and composite NMR techniques (chemical shift drift, line-broadening effect, relaxation times, saturation transfer difference (STD), and diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY)). Our results showed that both humic substances interacted with DMPP, with HA exhibiting a significantly greater affinity than FA. STD emphasized the pivotal role of the aromatic signal, for HA-DMPP association, and both alkyl methyl groups, for FA-DMPP association. The fractions of complexed DMPP were determined on the basis of self-diffusion coefficients, which were then exploited to calculate both the humo-complex affinity constants and the free Gibbs energy (Kd and ΔG for HA were 0.5169 M and −1636 kJ mol–¹, respectively). We concluded that DMPP-based NI efficiency may be altered by soil organic matter, characterized by a pronounced hydrophobic nature. This is relevant to improve nitrogen management and lower its environmental impact.  aPublisher supplied data  aFARB-2020-ORSA202852cUniversit? degli Studi di Salernodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007065 3a3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate 3aGibbs free energy 3aenvironmental impact 3ahydrophobicity 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aquantitative analysis 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3atechnology 0aNitrification inhibitors 0aDMPP 0aSoil humic matter 0aDOSY and STD NMR techniques 0aAssociation constants 0aNMR correlation times1 aCangemi, Silvana1 aMalakshahi Kurdestani, Ali1 aMueller, Torsten1 aPiccolo, Alessandro0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 July 27, v. 56, no. 16 p.11771-11779dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c009003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002700158245008900185300001800274520142900292592002801721650002001749650001701769650001001786650001201796650001101808650001801819650001101837650002601848650000901874650002301883650002001906650001101926650001301937650002001950650001601970650001301986700003801999700002802037700003002065700003502095773013102130856007302261852000902334655001202343IND60082573820221119022957.0141029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008257382DNAL7 a246872632pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.66782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaria da Rocha, Silvia10aProduct characteristics and quality of bovine blood‐enriched dried vegetable paste  ap. 3255-3262.  aBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate a preparation of vegetable paste with bovine blood in order to maximize the protein content using linear programming, and to analyze the product characteristics and quality of bovine blood‐enriched vegetable paste dried in a spouted bed. The drying experiments were performed by evaluating the effects of inlet air temperature, paste flow rate and paste solids concentration on the dried product characteristics and quality (functional and nutritional properties). RESULTS: The vegetable paste enriched with bovine blood was a good source of protein (∼0.20 g g⁻¹, dry basis), and the linear programming was adequate to select the constituents (carrot, onion, potato, kale, tomato, soybean oil and bovine blood) and optimize their quantities. The drying conditions of bovine blood‐enriched vegetable paste in the spouted bed that gave the best product characteristics were an air temperature of 110 °C and a paste flow rate of 600 mL h⁻¹ with 0.07 g g⁻¹ solids concentration. CONCLUSION: The addition of bovine blood to vegetable paste by linear programming increased the protein content of the paste and improved its functional properties and digestibility. The powder obtained from the spouted bed drier showed suitable functional and nutritional properties and was also a good source of antioxidant compounds. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aantioxidants 3ablood 3acarrots 3acattle 3adigestibility 3adrying 3afunctional properties 3akale 3alinear programming 3anutritive value 3aonions 3apotatoes 3aprotein content 3asoybean oil 3atomatoes1 aKappaun Rodrigues, Marla Cristina1 aLegemann Monte, Micheli1 aQuites Larrosa, Ana Paula1 ade Almeida Pinto, Luiz Antonio0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2014 Dec., v. 94, no. 15 p.3255-3262dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.66783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03868naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245023600209300001200445506007600457520245100533592002802984506003703012650003103049650002003080650001303100650001103113650001303124650001803137650001603155650002003171700001703191700002603208700001503234700002203249773009703271856008103368852000903449655001203458IND60550219520221207144707.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055021952DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-016-0826-12doi7 aPMC50152242pmcid7 a276041932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeburek, Florian10aEffect of intralesional platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment on clinical and ultrasonographic parameters in equine naturally occurring superficial digital flexor tendinopathies – a randomized prospective controlled clinical trial  ap. 191.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Regenerative and anti-inflammatory effects on tendinopathies have been attributed to blood-derived biologicals. To date the evidence for the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment of naturally occurring equine tendinopathies is limited. The purpose of this placebo-controlled clinical trial was to describe the effect of a single treatment of equine superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) disease with PRP on clinical and ultrasonographic parameters. Twenty horses with naturally occurring tendinopathies of forelimb SDFTs were randomly assigned to the PRP-treated group (n = 10) or control group (n = 10) after clinical and ultrasonographic examination. The SDFTs received an intralesional treatment with autologous PRP or were injected with saline, respectively (day 0). All horses participated in a standardized exercise programme and were re-examined clinically, with B-mode ultrasonography (5 times at regular intervals) and ultrasound tissue characterization (week 12 and 24 after treatment) until week 24. Long-term performance was estimated via telephone inquiry. RESULTS: Compared to day 0, lameness decreased significantly by week 8 after treatment with PRP and by week 12 in the control group. Ultrasonographically there was no difference in the summarized cross sectional area between the groups at any time point. Ultrasound tissue characterization showed that echo types representing disorganized matrix decreased significantly throughout the observation period in the PRP-treated group. Echo type II, representing discontinuous fascicles, not yet aligned into lines of stress was significantly higher 24 weeks after PRP treatment. Eighty percent of the PRP treated horses reached their previous or a higher level of performance after 12 months compared to 50 % in the CG. After 24 months these proportions were 60 % and 50 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A single intralesional treatment with PRP up to 8 weeks after onset of clinical signs of tendinopathy contributes to an earlier reduction of lameness compared to saline treatment and to an advanced organization of repair tissue as the fibrillar matrix is getting organized into fascicles while remodelling continues. Long term, PRP treatment has the potential to increase the number of horses reaching their previous level of performance. Earlier treatment of tendinopathy with PRP should be considered to enhance these effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aclinical trials 3aexercise 3ahorses 3alameness 3atissue repair 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography1 aGaus, Moritz1 avan Schie, Hans T.

Composition and construction of each plant community are largely under the control and influence of edaphic factors, and these factors help to identify growing plants of their own region. Determination of the scientific relationship between soil factors and vegetation in each region and its expansion to other similar regions will be important achievements in the management of rangelands. The aim of the study was to compare the physical and chemical properties of soil in the two communities of shrub land and grassland. For this purpose, two sites of grassland and shrub land were selected in the rangeland of Vavsar Kiasar. Vavsar is located in longitude 45′′ 43′ 53°–35′′ 37′ 53° and in latitude 13′′ 10′ 36°–40′′ 5′ 36°. Climate was semi-arid to semi-humid and Mediterranean, using the Domartin method. Dominant plant species in the shrub land were Artemisia aucheri , Astragalus caspicus , Acantholimon bodeamun , and Stachys infelata , and species Festuca ovina, Stachys inflata, Noea mucronata , and Ephorbia cheiradenia were dominant in grassland. Sixty soil samples from each site were taken from two depths, 0–15 and 15–30 cm. In the laboratory, soil properties including organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC), calcium carbonate (CaCO ₃) percentage, moisture content, and percentages of clay, silt, and sand were measured. The comparison of mean soil properties was performed between the two communities and two depths by using the T-test. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the level of 5% among electrical conductivity, moisture content, and clay percentages at two depths of soil in the shrub-land site but there were no significant differences in soil factors between the two depths in the grassland site. There was a significant difference in the first depth of soil between shrub-land and grassland communities according to percentages of sand and silt, electrical conductivity, and CaCO ₃ and organic-matter percentages and in the second depth between the two communities for electrical conductivity, CaCO ₃ percentage, and clay percentage. In conclusion, soil condition in the shrub land was more desirable than in grassland because there was a greater percentage of vegetation and grazing intensity was less.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aAstragalus 3aFestuca ovina 3aStachys 3acalcium carbonate 3aclay 3aedaphic factors 3aelectrical conductivity 3agrasslands 3agrazing intensity 3anitrogen content 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant communities 3arangelands 3asand 3asemiarid zones 3ashrubs 3asilt 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil depth 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3awater content 3aIran 0aGrassland 0aIran 0ashrub land 0asoil properties 0aVavsar1 aKargar, Mansureh1 aGhorbani, Jamshid0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 44, no. 1-4 p.331-338dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.7419443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03957naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245013400213300001800347506007600365520255900441592002803000506003703028650001703065650002303082650002003105650002003125650002103145650001203166650001303178650001103191650001303202700002503215700001703240700001903257700001903276700003103295773010303326856008503429852000903514655001203523IND60532038220221207053249.0160726e20150728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053203822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.5b005912doi7 aPMC45206262pmcid7 a261350412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoryanova, Bogdana10aRate and Equilibrium Constants for an Enzyme Conformational Change during Catalysis by Orotidine 5′-Monophosphate Decarboxylase  ap. 4555-4564.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe caged complex between orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase (ScOMPDC) and 5-fluoroorotidine 5′-monophosphate (FOMP) undergoes decarboxylation ∼300 times faster than the caged complex between ScOMPDC and the physiological substrate, orotidine 5′-monophosphate (OMP). Consequently, the enzyme conformational changes required to lock FOMP at a protein cage and release product 5-fluorouridine 5′-monophosphate (FUMP) are kinetically significant steps. The caged form of ScOMPDC is stabilized by interactions between the side chains from Gln215, Tyr217, and Arg235 and the substrate phosphodianion. The control of these interactions over the barrier to the binding of FOMP and the release of FUMP was probed by determining the effect of all combinations of single, double, and triple Q215A, Y217F, and R235A mutations on kcₐₜ/Kₘ and kcₐₜ for turnover of FOMP by wild-type ScOMPDC; its values are limited by the rates of substrate binding and product release, respectively. The Q215A and Y217F mutations each result in an increase in kcₐₜ and a decrease in kcₐₜ/Kₘ, due to a weakening of the protein–phosphodianion interactions that favor fast product release and slow substrate binding. The Q215A/R235A mutation causes a large decrease in the kinetic parameters for ScOMPDC-catalyzed decarboxylation of OMP, which are limited by the rate of the decarboxylation step, but much smaller decreases in the kinetic parameters for ScOMPDC-catalyzed decarboxylation of FOMP, which are limited by the rate of enzyme conformational changes. By contrast, the Y217A mutation results in large decreases in kcₐₜ/Kₘ for ScOMPDC-catalyzed decarboxylation of both OMP and FOMP, because of the comparable effects of this mutation on rate-determining decarboxylation of enzyme-bound OMP and on the rate-determining enzyme conformational change for decarboxylation of FOMP. We propose that kcₐₜ = 8.2 s–¹ for decarboxylation of FOMP by the Y217A mutant is equal to the rate constant for cage formation from the complex between FOMP and the open enzyme, that the tyrosyl phenol group stabilizes the closed form of ScOMPDC by hydrogen bonding to the substrate phosphodianion, and that the phenyl group of Y217 and F217 facilitates formation of the transition state for the rate-limiting conformational change. An analysis of kinetic data for mutant enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation of OMP and FOMP provides estimates for the rate and equilibrium constants for the conformational change that traps FOMP at the enzyme active site.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3adecarboxylation 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahydrogen bonding 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenol 3aproteins1 aGoldman, Lawrence

The diagnosis is based on several methods such as cytology, bacteriology and histopathology; however the outcome of these methods may be inconclusive even when used together. The objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the usefulness of acute phase proteins as an additional diagnostic tool for diagnosis of subclinical endometritis in mares and (2) to evaluate the association between macroscopic changes in uterine flushes and inflammation of the uterus. Materials were collected from 53 Icelandic mares with subclinical endometritis. Endometrial swabs and uterine lavage for cytological and bacteriological examinations and two endometrial biopsies were taken. Blood samples were collected 12–24 h after ovulation to determine the concentrations of serum amyloid A and haptoglobin in the 53 subfertile mares and, for comparison, from 20 non-pregnant mares that later conceived. RESULTS: Twenty-five mares were classified as positive for endometritis based on endometrial biopsy, which was used as the ‘gold standard’. We observed a correlation between cloudy efflux in the lavage and (1) polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration of the endometrium (P = 0.031), (2) positive cytology in samples obtained by cotton swabs (P = 0.019) and uterine lavage (P = 0.011), and (3) positive microbiology from samples obtained by cotton swabs (P = 0.001) and uterine lavage (P = 0.047). The degree of agreement between PMN infiltration and positive cytology from samples taken by cotton swabs and uterine lavage was fair to moderate. We found no association between the concentration of acute phase proteins and infiltration of the endometrium by PMNs, or with positive results of cytological and microbiological examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum amyloid A and haptoglobin was not proven useful for diagnosis of subclinical endometritis in Icelandic mares. Macroscopic changes in the fluid collected by lavage were not consistently indicative of infection, but when present they indicate inflammation in the uterus with a high probability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute phase proteins 3aamyloid 3abacteriology 3abiopsy 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acell biology 3acotton 3aendometritis 3aendometrium 3ahaptoglobins 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3amares 3aovulation 3aprobability1 aKról, Jarosław1 aNowak, Marcin1 aStefaniak, Tadeusz1 aAubertsson, Gudmar1 aKozdrowski, Roland0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2015 Dec., v. 58, no. 1 p.50-50dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-016-0233-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006700171300001600238520206500254592002802319650000902347650003802356650002002394650002202414650001502436650001102451650001802462650002002480650001202500650001202512650001802524650001002542650001502552650002002567650001302587650002102600650001402621650001402635650000902649650002102658650002402679650002002703650001802723650002202741650001002763651000902773653000902782653002002791653001802811653001302829653001902842700002102861773013502882856008403017852000903101655001203110IND50076267320221119121116.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007626732DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.7419492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafarian, Zeinab10aEffects of Land-Use Change on Soil Organic Carbon and Nitrogen  ap. 339-346.  aAlthough the literature is full of references to soil degradation under forest cultivation, very little information is available on changes in soil properties following deforestation of the Hyrcanian area in northern Iran. Also, the literature provides little information on the effects of conversion from deforested cropland to grazing, a likely direction of land-use change in northern Iran. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of conversion of native forests into farmlands and/or grazing lands on soil properties and nutrients in the Hyrcanian forest. The dominant land uses are native forest, dryland farming of barley and wheat, and grazing. Three transects were established on hill slopes of the study area. Transects represented three land-use changes that occurred from 1967 to 2004 and included mature forest (Fagus orientalis and Acer velotinom) converted to dryland farming (barley and wheat) in 1970s, dryland farming converted to irrigated rice farming in mid-1980s, and dryland farming not cultured from 1986 to now. Average transects slope gradients were 23° (T ₁), 15° (T ₂), and 4° (T ₃). Three positions (top, middle, and bottom of hill slope) were selected on each transect to represent each land-use type. Therefore, nine sites were selected to analyze land-use change effects on soil properties. Twenty-m vertical transects were established perpendicular to main transects. At each vertical transect, three surface soil samples (0–25 cm) were collected to measure soil properties. Total nitrogen (N) was determined by the Kjeldahl method and soil organic carbon (SOC) content was measured using the modified Walkley–Black wet oxidation procedure. Comparisons of mean differences among land uses revealed that soils under native forest contained 4.73% SOC and 0.474% total N, which were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than contents under grazing (1.76% SOC, 0.323% total N) or dryland faming (1.37% SOC and 0.248% total N). Differences between grazing and dryland farming were not statistically significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. orientalis 3aKjeldahl method 3aagricultural land 3aarid lands 3abarley 3adeforestation 3adryland farming 3aforests 3agrazing 3agrazing lands 3ahills 3airrigation 3aland use change 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aoxidation 3arice 3asoil degradation 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil properties 3asoil sampling 3atopographic slope 3awheat 3aIran 0aIran 0aland-use change 0aMohammad Abad 0anitrogen 0aorganic carbon1 aKavian, Ataollah0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 44, no. 1-4 p.339-346dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.7419493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245011400196300002000310520152900330592002801859650001401887650001501901650001501916650001701931650001401948650001101962650001601973650001501989653001402004653003202018653000902050653002202059700001202081700001602093700005202109700001802161773014202179856007902321852000902400655001202409IND60756078720221117225251.0211110e20211029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075607872DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c184352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, De1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8488-513810aEfficient Removal of Pb(II) from Aqueous Systems Using Spirulina-Based Biohybrid Magnetic Helical Microrobots  ap. 53131-53142.  aWastewater remediation toward heavy metal pollutants has attracted considerable attention, and various adsorption-based materials were employed in recent years. However, it is still challenging to explore low-cost and high-efficient adsorbents with superior removal performance, nontoxicity, flexible operation, and good reusability. Herein, Fe₃O₄- and MnO₂-loaded biohybrid magnetic helical microrobots (BMHMs) based on Spirulina cells were presented for the first time, and their performance on Pb(II) removal was studied in detail. Intracellular synthesis of Fe₃O₄ and MnO₂ nanoparticles into Spirulina cells was successively conducted to obtain the BMHMs with superparamagnetism and high surface activity. The BMHMs could be flexibly propelled under magnetic actuation, and collective cork-screw spinning was performed to enhance fluidic diffusion with intensive adsorption. Rapid and significant removal of Pb(II) in wastewater was achieved using the swarming microrobots, and a high adsorption capacity could be reached at 245.1 mg/g. Moreover, the BMHMs could be cyclically reutilized after simple regeneration, and good specificity toward Pb(II) was verified. The adsorption mechanism was further studied, which revealed that the pseudo-second-order kinetics dominated in the adsorption process, and the Langmuir isothermal model also fitted the experimental results well. The intriguing properties of the BMHMs enable them to be versatile platforms with significant potentials in wastewater remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirulina 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aheavy metals 3amagnetism 3amodels 3aremediation 3awastewater 0abiohybrid 0amagnetic helical microrobot 0aMnO2 0aPb(II) adsorption1 aLi, Bin1 aCeli, Nuoer1 aCai, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5167-55241 aZhang, Deyuan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 29, v. 13, no. 44 p.53131-53142dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c184353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04548naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002700124024003400151040001800185100005600203245017500259300001400434500002000448500001500468506002800483506003000511520203400541592002802575596008602603596009402689596006502783596004502848596004602893506003702939650002002976650001502996650001503011650001203026650003003038650002503068650002203093650001003115650002103125650002103146650001703167650002203184650002303206650002003229651001203249651001103261651001803272651001603290651001403306700005303320700002703373700001503400700005503415700002603470700005403496700005303550700001703603773012603620856007303746903002203819852000903841655001203850IND60596950020221207074905.0180622e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059695002DNAL7 a10.1111/aab.124302chorus7 a10.1111/aab.124302doi7 a10.1111/aab.124302chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToševski, I.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3666-315110aTwenty‐five years after: post‐introduction association of Mecinus janthinus s.l. with invasive host toadflaxes Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica in North America  ap. 16-34.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aLinaria vulgaris, common or yellow toadflax, and Linaria dalmatica, Dalmatian toadflax (Plantaginaceae), are Eurasian perennial forbs invasive throughout temperate North America. These Linaria species have been the targets of classical biological control programmes in Canada and the USA since the 1960s. The first effective toadflax biological control agent, the stem‐mining weevil Mecinus janthinus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was introduced from Europe in the 1990s. This weevil has become established on L. dalmatica and L. vulgaris in both countries, although it has shown greater success in controlling the former toadflax species. Genetic and ecological studies of native range M. janthinus populations revealed that weevils previously identified as a single species in fact include two cryptic species, now recognised as M. janthinus, associated with yellow toadflax, and the recently confirmed species Mecinus janthiniformis, associated with Dalmatian toadflax. The results of a comprehensive study characterising haplotype identities, distributions and frequencies within M. janthinus s.l. native range source populations were compared to those populations currently established in the USA and Canada. The presence of both Mecinus species in North America was confirmed, and revealed with a few exceptions a high and consistent level of host fidelity throughout the adopted and native ranges. Genetic analysis based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene (mtCOII) defined the origin and records the subsequent North American establishment, by haplotype, of the European founder populations of M. janthinus (northern Switzerland and southern Germany) and M. janthiniformis (southern Macedonia), and provided population genetic indices for the studied populations. This analysis together with existing North American shipment receipt, release and rearing records elucidates probable redistribution routes and sources of both weevil species from initially released and established adopted range populations.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Department of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006759  cMinistarstvo Prosvete Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvojadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004564  cMontana State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009501  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOIdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000002010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acryptic species 3aperennials 3ahaplotypes 3arearing 3abiological control agents 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aLinaria dalmatica 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3aLinaria vulgaris 3amitochondria 3aMecinus janthinus 3abiological control 3aNorth Americans 3aGermany 3aCanada 3aUnited States 3aSwitzerland 0aMacedonia1 aSing, S.E.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5290-291X1 aDe Clerck‐Floate, R.1 aMcClay, A.1 aWeaver, D.K.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5273-37381 aSchwarzländer, Mark,1 aKrstić, O.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3688-21321 aJović, J.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7623-05531 aGassmann, A.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2018 July, v. 173, no. 1 p.16-34dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46323x0003-47467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aab.124303Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle04373naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001400181245007300195300001600268506007600284520210900360592002802469506003702497650001202534650001502546650001302561650001002574650001402584650001202598650001302610650001302623650001102636650001002647650001402657650001602671650001602687650001802703650003002721650001302751650001202764650002802776650001402804650004602818650002502864650001402889650002802903650001702931650001702948650002802965650003402993650001703027650004103044651001103085653002103096653001603117653002103133653002703154653002203181653001703203653000803220653001803228653002703246653002603273653001203299653001603311653001503327700001703342700002503359773010003384856007403484852000903558655001203567IND60115137720221207061217.0150202e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011513772DNAL7 a241076832pmid7 aPMC38903902pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mct2192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Mimi10aFloral adaptation to local pollinator guilds in a terrestrial orchid  ap. 289-300.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Studies of local floral adaptation in response to geographically divergent pollinators are essential for understanding floral evolution. This study investigated local pollinator adaptation and variation in floral traits in the rewarding orchid Gymnadenia odoratissima , which spans a large altitudinal gradient and thus may depend on different pollinator guilds along this gradient. Methods Pollinator communities were assessed and reciprocal transfer experiments were performed between lowland and mountain populations. Differences in floral traits were characterized by measuring floral morphology traits, scent composition, colour and nectar sugar content in lowland and mountain populations. Key Results The composition of pollinator communities differed considerably between lowland and mountain populations; flies were only found as pollinators in mountain populations. The reciprocal transfer experiments showed that when lowland plants were transferred to mountain habitats, their reproductive success did not change significantly. However, when mountain plants were moved to the lowlands, their reproductive success decreased significantly. Transfers between populations of the same altitude did not lead to significant changes in reproductive success, disproving the potential for population-specific adaptations. Flower size of lowland plants was greater than for mountain flowers. Lowland plants also had significantly higher relative amounts of aromatic floral volatiles, while the mountain plants had higher relative amounts of other floral volatiles. The floral colour of mountain flowers was significantly lighter compared with the lowland flowers. Conclusions Local pollinator adaptation through pollinator attraction was shown in the mountain populations, possibly due to adaptation to pollinating flies. The mountain plants were also observed to receive pollination from a greater diversity of pollinators than the lowland plants. The different floral phenotypes of the altitudinal regions are likely to be the consequence of adaptations to local pollinator guilds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDiptera 3aGymnadenia 3aaltitude 3acolor 3aevolution 3aflowers 3ahabitats 3alowlands 3anectar 3aodors 3aphenotype 3apollination 3apollinators 3asugar content 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAltitude 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aEcosystem 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aOdorants. 2aOrchidaceaexphysiology 2aPigmentation 2aPlant Nectar 2aPollinationxphysiology 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aReproduction 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 0aEurope 0aLocal adaptation 0apollination 0afloral evolution 0ageographical variation 0afloral morphology 0afloral scent 0aVOC 0afloral colour 0apollinator assemblages 0apollinator adaptation 0aDiptera 0aOrchidaceae 0aspeciation1 aGross, Karin1 aSchiestl, Florian P.0 tAnnals of botany.g2014 Jan., v. 113, no. 2 p.289-300dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mct2193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013100168300001600299520163500315592002801950650002701978650001302005650001602018650002702034650001902061650001502080650001702095650002502112650001302137650001402150650002502164653003902189653001302228653001202241653002402253653004202277700001802319700001802337700001302355700001902368700001602387700001702403700001702420773012202437856008202559852000902641655001202650IND60531979320221118220750.0180904e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053197932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hong-Cheng10aEfficient treatment of azo dye containing wastewater in a hybrid acidogenic bioreactor stimulated by biocatalyzed electrolysis  ap. 198-207.  aIn this study, a novel scaled-up hybrid acidogenic bioreactor (HAB) was designed and adopted to evaluate the performance of azo dye (acid red G, ARG) containing wastewater treatment. Principally, HAB is an acidogenic bioreactor coupled with a biocatalyzed electrolysis module. The effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and ARG loading rate on the performance of HAB were investigated. In addition, the influent was switched from synthetic wastewater to domestic wastewater to examine the key parameters for the application of HAB. The results showed that the introduction of the biocatalyzed electrolysis module could enhance anoxic decolorization and COD (chemical oxygen demand) removal. The combined process of HAB-CASS presented superior performance compared to a control system without biocatalyzed electrolysis (AB-CASS). When the influent was switched to domestic wastewater, with an environment having more balanced nutrients and diverse organic matters, the ARG, COD and nitrogen removal efficiencies of HAB-CASS were further improved, reaching 73.3%±2.5%, 86.2%±3.8% and 93.5%±1.6% at HRT of 6hr, respectively, which were much higher than those of AB-CASS (61.1%±4.7%, 75.4%±5.0% and 82.1%±2.1%, respectively). Moreover, larger TCV/TV (total cathode volume/total volume) for HAB led to higher current and ARG removal. The ARG removal efficiency and current at TCV/TV of 0.15 were 39.2%±3.7% and 28.30±1.48mA, respectively. They were significantly increased to 62.1%±2.0% and 34.55±0.83mA at TCV/TV of 0.25. These results show that HAB system could be used to effectively treat real wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication parameters 3aazo dyes 3abioreactors 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecolorization 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3awastewater treatment 0aHAB (hybrid acidogenic bioreactor) 0aScale-up 0aAzo dye 0aDomestic wastewater 0aCyclic activated sludge system (CASS)1 aCheng, Hao-Yi1 aWang, Shusen,1 aCui, Dan1 aHan, Jing-Long1 aHu, Ya-Ping1 aSu, Shi-Gang1 aWang, Ai-Jie0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Jan., v. 39 p.198-207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001400160245007900174300001800253500000900271500001500280520175800295592002802053650001502081650002402096650001302120650001602133650001002149650001602159650001302175650001802188650001602206650001302222650002302235653001802258700001702276700001502293700001302308773012502321852000902446856009702455655001202552IND2037905920221121042323.0191122e199309  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203790592DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500050023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Y.10aAccuracy of Sap Flow Measurement Using Heat Balance and Heat Pulse Methods  ap. 1080-1086.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe heat balance and the heat pulse methods for measurement of sap flow in plants, were compared under conditions of variable evaporative demands in order to evaluate their accuracy. The study was conducted with potted soybean (Glycine max Merr. cv. tamahomare) and corn (Zea mays cv. kakuteru 901) plants housed in a plastic chamber. The computed sap flow was compared to transpiration rate as measured by weight loss. The calibration coefficient for the heat pulse expresses the ratio of actual transpiration rate, Tr (mg s⁻¹), to measured heat velocity, v (mm s⁻¹), multiplied by the stem area, a (mm²). The ratio Tr/(v × a) was 1.01 ± 0.08 and 1.73 ± 0.1 for soybean and corn, respectively. The coefficient was not affected by plant age, size, or atmospheric evaporative demand. Accuracy of measurements using the heat pulse method was poor at low transpiration rate. The heat balance method does not require calibration (except for the gauge factor for estimating the sheath conductance). Transpiration was estimated accurately by this method in both species at low or moderate rates (0.6 L d⁻¹). As the transpiration rate increased, the computed sap flow deviated from the measured transpiration, in soybean, transpiration was underestimated by 20%, while in corn, it was overestimated by 25%. Results indicated that the basic assumption of the heat balance method (i.e., that the stem surface temperature is considered a reliable measure of the average temperature over the entire cross-sectional area) may be incorrect either at high or fluctuating flow rates, or whenever the water conducting system is distributed unevenly in the stem cross section.

Ionic liquids (ILs) used as additives to the aqueous two‐phase system (ATPS) can improve the extraction yield. RESULTS: In this study, seven ILs were added to the ethanol/ammonium sulfate ATPS and used for the salting‐out extraction (SOE) of sinomenine from Sinomenium acutum. The IL [C₂OHmim]FeCl₄ was screened as the optimal additive, then the influencing factors IL amount, ethanol concentration, salt concentration, and temperature were investigated. The maximum extraction efficiency of 96.4% was obtained under the following conditions: 23.06 wt% ethanol concentration, 27.28 wt% (NH₄)₂SO₄ concentration, 4.0 wt% [C₂OHmim]FeCl₄ and 40°C temperature. Moreover, the components in the SOE system can be recycled after extraction. CONCLUSION: Thus, this ATPS had lower cost and higher extraction ability, and it is feasible to scale up using a small amount of ILs. This system can also be used in the extraction of some other important active compounds from natural plant resources. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aSinomenium acutum 3aactive ingredients 3aadditives 3aammonium sulfate 3aethanol 3aionic liquids 3asalt concentration 3asinomenine 3atemperature1 aLi, Qiao1 aWu, Shuanggen1 aSun, Danyu1 aTan, Zhijian1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3976-01170 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 July, v. 93, no. 7 p.1925-1930dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.53183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03752naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015900154520226900313592002802582650004102610650001702651650002002668650002102688650001502709650001202724650001602736650002602752650001502778650002602793650002102819650002202840650001102862650001102873650001902884650001102903650001702914650001802931650001302949650002302962650002102985650001703006651001003023700001503033773012703048856007403175852000903249655001203258IND60652168920221118053049.0190712e20180131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065216892DNAL7 a10.3390/su100203542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xue10aIrrigation Water Availability and Winter Wheat Abandonment in the North China Plain (NCP): Findings from a Case Study in Cangxian County of Hebei Province  aThe North China Plain (NCP) is the major winter wheat producing area in China. Abandonment of this crop has, however, become more and more prevalent in this region since the late 1990s. Although the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain little understood, irrigation water availability (IWA) has always been regarded as the key factor limiting winter wheat production on the NCP. The aim of this paper is to determine the role played by IWA in the abandonment of winter wheat, using evidence drawn from a case study in Cangxian County, Hebei Province. First-hand data were collected for this study from 350 households in 35 villages, using semistructured one-on-one questionnaires. Five types of irrigation water sources were defined and identified at the level of individual land plots: “ground and surface water”, “just groundwater”, “just rivers”, “just reservoirs”, and “no irrigation”. These levels correspond to a decreasing trend in the overall frequency of irrigation and thus provide a clear proxy indicator for IWA. The results from a series of multilevel multinomial models show that the higher the IWA, the less likely it is for a land plot to abandon winter wheat. Specifically, using “no irrigation” cases as a control group, the results show that land plots with more sources of irrigation water also tend to be characterized by greater IWA, including “ground and surface water” and “just groundwater”, and also have lower probabilities of abandoning winter wheat. In contrast, land plots with less IWA (less irrigation water sources), including “just reservoirs” and “just rivers”, are more likely to abandon winter wheat. The results also show that, in addition to IWA, soil quality and plot size at the plot level, as well as demographic characteristics, farm equipment, and land fragmentation at the household level and irrigation prices at the village level, all play additional significant roles in the cropping-system decisions made by farmers. A number of suggestions are made in this paper regarding policy implementation related to integrative water management and transferred water reallocation, in order to achieve the twin goals of water conservation and winter wheat production on the NCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3acase studies 3acrop production 3acropping systems 3ademography 3afarmers 3agroundwater 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahouseholds 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3arivers 3asoil quality 3asurface water 3avillages 3awater conservation 3awater reservoirs 3awinter wheat 3aChina1 aLi, Xiubin0 tSustainability.g2018 Jan. 31, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100203543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245014200208300001600350506007600366520140500442592002801847506003701875650002301912650002401935650001001959650001801969650002201987650001602009650001102025650001502036650000902051650001902060650002802079650001302107650001702120650001402137650002002151700002002171700001902191700002002210700002302230700003202253700002302285700002702308700002402335700002402359700002202383700001702405773017102422856007902593852000902672655001202681IND60173820720221207093239.0150603e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017382072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12093621102doi7 aPMC35490942pmcid7 a232775462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristante, Enrico10aIdentification of an essential endogenous regulator of blood–brain barrier integrity, and its pathological and therapeutic implications  ap. 832-841.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe blood–brain barrier (BBB), a critical guardian of communication between the periphery and the brain, is frequently compromised in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in the inappropriate passage of molecules and leukocytes into the brain. Here we show that the glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory messenger annexin A1 (ANXA1) is expressed in brain microvascular endothelial cells, where it regulates BBB integrity. In particular, ANXA1 ⁻/⁻ mice exhibit significantly increased BBB permeability as a result of disrupted interendothelial cell tight junctions, essentially related to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, which stabilizes tight and adherens junctions. This situation is reminiscent of early MS pathology, a relationship confirmed by our detection of a selective loss of ANXA1 in the plasma and cerebrovascular endothelium of patients with MS. Importantly, this loss is swiftly restored by i.v. administration of human recombinant ANXA1. Analysis in vitro confirms that treatment of cerebrovascular endothelial cells with recombinant ANXA1 restores cell polarity, cytoskeleton integrity, and paracellular permeability through inhibition of the small G protein RhoA. We thus propose ANXA1 as a critical physiological regulator of BBB integrity and suggest it may have utility in the treatment of MS, correcting BBB function and hence ameliorating disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadherens junctions 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acell polarity 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3ahumans 3aleukocytes 3amice 3amicrofilaments 3anervous system diseases 3apatients 3apermeability 3asclerosis 3atight junctions1 aMcArthur, Simon1 aMauro, Claudio1 aMaggioli, Elisa1 aRomero, Ignacio A.1 aWylezinska-Arridge, Marzena1 aCouraud, Pierre O.1 aLopez-Tremoleda, Jordi1 aChristian, Helen C.1 aWeksler, Babette B.1 aMalaspina, Andrea1 aSolito, Egle0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 110, no. 3 p.832-841dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12093621103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012300158300002000281520083500301592002801136650001401164650002301178650001101201650004901212650003701261650001101298650001301309650001301322650001201335650001701347650003301364650001701397650001101414650001201425650001301437650002101450650003701471700002001508700001401528700002301542773012401565856007401689852000901763655001201772IND60640529220221119131056.0190504e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064052922DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04409c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaity, Tanmoy10aHeterogeneous O-arylation of nitroarenes with substituted phenols over a copper immobilized mesoporous silica catalyst  ap. 33380-33386.  aHighly porous and robust mesoporous silica, SBA-15 has been subjected to post-synthesis modification for the anchoring of copper through Schiff base moiety formation using the silicon alkoxide route.

Due to specialization of ErM and saprotrophic, lignin-degrading fungi in litter decomposition and nutrient mobilization, we hypothesized that the presence of both types of fungi may exert a synergism in the proximity of plant detritus, thereby increasing the growth of plants over those grown with only one type or no added fungi. METHODS: We tested this hypothesis by introducing ascomycetous ErM or root-endophytic fungi and the saprotrophic basidiomycete Agrocybe praecox to highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) grown in a substrate of pine litter, bark and wood chips in a container experiment, and measured plant nutrient status and growth parameters over 30-months. RESULTS: We detected no synergistic or antagonistic interactions between the saprotrophic basidiomycete and the root-symbiotic ascomycetes. Addition of lignin-degrading A. praecox but not ErM or endophytic symbionts positively impacted shoot growth, plant biomass, total P and N uptake from the substrate and precocity in fruit bearing despite widely acknowledged high saprotrophic abilities of the latter. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that lignin-degrading basidiomycetes are compatible with ericoid mycorrhizal roots and asymbiotically enhance plant growth via the release of N, P, and other nutrients from lignin-rich plant residues, thereby attenuating potential nutrient competition between plants and microbes as low quality litter decomposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrocybe 3aAscomycota 3aPinus 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3abark 3abiomass 3ablueberries 3acontainers 3aearly development 3aendophytes 3afruits 3afungi 3alignin 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aroots 3ashoots 3asymbionts 3asynergism 3awood chips1 aSadowsky, Jesse J.1 aLukešová, Tereza1 aAlbrechtová, Jana,1 aVosátka, Miroslav0 tPlant and soil.g2012 June, v. 355, no. 1-2 p.341-352dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-011-1106-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245009600210300001400306520091700320592002801237650001701265650001301282650002001295650001601315650001101331650001401342650001501356650001701371653002601388653002701414653004001441653001301481653001601494700001801510700006701528700002201595700002901617773009001646856008401736852000901820655001201829IND60570772020221120122117.0180904e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057077202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarthy, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5087-604910aReversibly constraining spliceosome-substrate complexes by engineering disulfide crosslinks  ap. 25-35.  aThe spliceosome is a highly dynamic mega-Dalton enzyme, formed in part by assembly of U snRNPs onto its pre-mRNA substrate transcripts. Early steps in spliceosome assembly are challenging to study biochemically and structurally due to compositional and conformational dynamics. We detail an approach to covalently and reversibly constrain or trap non-covalent pre-mRNA/protein spliceosome complexes. This approach involves engineering a single disulfide bond between a thiol-bearing cysteine sidechain and a proximal backbone phosphate of the pre-mRNA, site-specifically modified with an N-thioalkyl moiety. When distance and angle between reactants is optimal, the sidechain will react with the single N-thioalkyl to form a crosslink upon oxidation. We provide protocols detailing how this has been applied successfully to trap an 11-subunit RNA-protein assembly, the human U1 snRNP, in complex with a pre-mRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3acysteine 3adisulfide bonds 3aengineering 3ahumans 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3aspliceosomes 0aChemical modification 0aDisulfide crosslinking 0aNucleic acid–protein interactions 0aU1 snRNP 0aSpliceosome1 aGarside, Erin1 aMeschede-Krasa, Yonatan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7473-24801 aMacMillan, Andrew1 aPomeranz Krummel, Daniel0 tMethods.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 125 p.25-35dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007700168300001600245520147100261592002801732650002201760650001401782650002201796650001701818650001401835650000901849650001801858650001201876650000901888650000701897650001201904650001301916653001401929653001801943653002301961700001901984700001402003700002002017773010102037856008602138852000902224655001202233IND60584766420221119054114.0190319e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058476642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xuanxuan10aFabrication of milled cellulose particles-stabilized Pickering emulsions  ap. 427-435.  aPickering emulsions stabilized by milled cellulose particles of the sizes ranging from 38 nm to 671 nm, which were prepared from a simple organic solvent -free media-milling process using cellulose powders with original sizes of 10–90 μm, have been successfully fabricated. The milled cellulose particles maintained their original rod-like shapes after the milling process. However, a notable decrease in the crystallinity of milled cellulose particles with the increase of milling time was verified by using X-ray diffraction. The effects of milling time, initial cellulose concentrations and oil/water ratios on the droplet sizes and stability of cellulose particles-stabilized Pickering emulsions were investigated. The milled cellulose particles were irreversibly adsorbed at the oil/water interface and formed stable emulsions with droplet size between 40 and 60 μm, which exhibited good stability over one-month storage. Milled cellulose stabilized emulsions also exhibited good stability against a wide range of pH (3, 5, 7, 9) and salt conditions (0.1–100 mM) with slight change in the droplet sizes. The rheological tests indicated the formation of gel network in the emulsions, which further promoted the emulsion stability. As sustainable biomolecules without negative impact on environment, cellulose particles processed through media-milling open opportunities for developing environmentally friendly new materials for emulsion stabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3amilling 3aoils 3apH 3apowders 3asolvents 0aCellulose 0aMedia-milling 0aPickering emulsion1 aZhang, Hongwei1 aLi, Yunqi1 aHuang, Qingrong0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2018 Apr., v. 77 p.427-435dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002000160245004400180300001600224500000900240500001500249520156600264592002801830650001701858650002101875650002001896650002201916650001401938650002001952650001801972650002301990650002502013650002502038653002602063773012202089852000902211856009702220655001202317IND2037509220221121020830.0191122e199307  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203750922DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500040026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForcella, Frank10aSeedling Emergence Model for Velvetleaf  ap. 929-933.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aConsistent postemergence weed control requires information on the timing of weed emergence. Information is especially important for velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medikus), which interferes with many crops over a broad geographic range. The objective of this study was to develop a model that predicts the timing and proportional extent of velvetleaf seedling emergence. Environmental effects on seed germination and seedling emergence, used to construct the model, were determined in growth chambers or from published sources. Two variables drive the model: average daily soil temperature of the seed zone (5-cm soil depth) and daily rainfall. The model requires initialization by four seed zone parameters: (i) soil water content at the start of the simulation period, (ii) soil water holding capacity, (iii) soil bulk density, and (iv) a water retention curve relating percent soil water to soil water potential. The model was validated using field data collected in Illinois in 1967 and 1969 and in Minnesota in 1990. Regressions of predicted and observed seedling emergence resulted in r² values of 0.91, 0.97, and 0.98 for 1967, 1969, and 1990, respectively. Correspondence (regression coefficients) between predicted and observed seedling emergence was 0.83, 1.01, and 1.01 for 1967, 1969, and 1990, respectively.

Near-atomic-resolution distributions of arsenic, iron, and oxygen demonstrate the diffusion and reactions of arsenic in nZVI. The reactions occur primarily in the surface layer, especially at the oxide–metallic iron [Fe(0)] interface. As(V) is attracted to the surface via electrostatic interactions and embedded in the nanoparticle via chemical reduction to form a thin (1.0–1.2 nm) layer of elemental arsenic inside the shell.

We report here on the self-limiting supramolecular polymerization (SPZ) of a series of multiarmed amphiphiles with propagation-attenuated reactivities that can automatically terminate the polymerization process, enabling effective control in both lengths and polydispersity. Through incorporating multiarmed oligoethylene-glycol (OEG) onto a quadratic aromatic segment, the lengths of the resultant SPs can be tuned from ∼1 μm to 130 and 50 nm with a polydispersity index of ∼1.2 for the last two SPs. We believe that the level of chain frustration of the multiarmed OEG segments, determined by both the number of arms and the degree of polymerization, poses physical and entropic constrains for supramolecular propagation to exceed a threshold length.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3ajournals 3alength 3aobjectives 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asurfactants1 aWang, Feihu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0358-967X1 aWang, Han1 aZhang, Weijie1 aAnderson, Caleb F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0760-19281 aCui, Honggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4684-26550 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Oct. 29, v. 143, no. 44 p.18446-18453dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c064953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100005800180245017300238300001800411500002000429500001500449506007600464520147900540592002802019506003702047650000902084650001602093650001102109650001802120650001302138650001502151650003102166650001402197650001302211650002602224650001402250650001902264650001102283653001702294700002002311700002302331773012902354856007302483852000902556655001202565IND60596957420221207084330.0180622e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059695742DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.132012doi7 aPMC60477332pmcid7 a296032972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiinemets, Ulo,1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3078-219210aChanges in photosynthetic rate and stress volatile emissions through desiccation‐rehydration cycles in desiccation‐tolerant epiphytic filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae)  ap. 1605-1617.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExposure to recurrent desiccation cycles carries a risk of accumulation of reactive oxygen species that can impair leaf physiological activity upon rehydration, but changes in filmy fern stress status through desiccation and rewatering cycles have been poorly studied. We studied foliage photosynthetic rate and volatile marker compounds characterizing cell wall modifications (methanol) and stress development (lipoxygenase [LOX] pathway volatiles and methanol) through desiccation–rewatering cycles in lower‐canopy species Hymenoglossum cruentum and Hymenophyllum caudiculatum, lower‐ to upper‐canopy species Hymenophyllum plicatum and upper‐canopy species Hymenophyllum dentatum sampled from a common environment and hypothesized that lower canopy species respond more strongly to desiccation and rewatering. In all species, rates of photosynthesis and LOX volatile emission decreased with progression of desiccation, but LOX emission decreased with a slower rate than photosynthesis. Rewatering first led to an emission burst of LOX volatiles followed by methanol, indicating that the oxidative burst was elicited in the symplast and further propagated to cell walls. Changes in LOX emissions were more pronounced in the upper‐canopy species that had a greater photosynthetic activity and likely a greater rate of production of photooxidants. We conclude that rewatering induces the most severe stress in filmy ferns, especially in the upper canopy species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arisk 3arehydration 3acanopy 3aHymenophyllum 3amethanol 3acell walls 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aepiphytes 3asymplast 3aferns and fern allies 3aemissions 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 0alipoxygenase1 aBravo, León A.1 aCopolovici, Lucian0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2018 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1605-1617dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.132013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245013100168300002000299520171200319592002802031650001402059650001102073650003102084650001802115650001402133650002402147650003102171650001902202650001102221700003302232700003302265700002702298700003002325700006802355700002602423700007502449773017302524856008102697852000902778655001202787IND60788992520220818000000.0220818e20220725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078899252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c016232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMollinedo, Helvio10aPower Consumption and Energy Dissipation Rate Reduction in Agitated Tanks by Control Rods Attached to a Pitched Blade Impeller  ap. 11898-11907.  aThe effects of axially symmetric control rods added to the archetypal four-blade pitched blade turbine (PBT) have been evaluated. The convectional PBT and two control rod configurations were tested (P2 and P3). Modifications resulted in a significant improvement in the hydrodynamic performance of the PBT impeller. Experimental measurements of torque and mixing time have been obtained, as well as flow measurement through particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques to validate and compare the results obtained through numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics. All these experimental tests and simulations have been used to evaluate the hydrodynamic behavior of these rod-controlled impellers. It was found that the modified PBT with control rods shows reduced power consumption compared to the conventional PBT. The use of control rods has achieved a reduction of up to 12.18% in the power number. It was found that the control rods reduce the fluid separation, reducing the pressure drag and the suction pressure zones on the rear of the blade, thus reducing the power consumption. Despite the reduction in the pumping number for the two configurations proposed, pumping efficiency is not greatly affected. For configuration P3, the efficiency is similar to that of the PBT. It is worth highlighting that all the control rods evaluated showed a reduction in the energy dissipation rate, and for the best case, P3, a maximum of 17.02% reduction was achieved. The reduction in the energy dissipation rate may be useful in applications that require low shearing stresses during processing. Also, the same impeller design may decrease the energy consumption during long-term processing tasks.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3ahydrodynamics 3aimpellers 3amathematical models 3aparticle image velocimetry 3aprocess design 3atorque1 aMendoza-Escamilla, Victor X.1 aRivadeneyra-Romero, Gabriela1 aGonzalez-Neria, Israel1 aYañez-Varela, J.

Such flows may be significantly affected by particle shape and bed configuration. In this study, a pseudo-fluid model is developed to calculate average flow velocity through gravel beds. The proposed approach is able to take into account particle shape effect using the drag coefficient associated with an isolated sediment grain and also bed configuration effect in terms of apparent viscosity. The model was then calibrated with ten series of laboratory data, which were collected using vertical columns packed with spherical and natural gravels. Finally, the model was successfully applied to estimate total flow discharges for laboratory-scale open channel flows over a gravel bed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrag coefficient 3agravel 3amodels 3apowders 3aviscosity 0aApparent viscosity 0aDrag coefficient 0aGravel bed 0aPseudo-fluid 0aSettling velocity1 aQiao, Changkai1 aChen, Xingwei1 aLiu, Xingnian0 tPowder technology.g2014 July, v. 260 p.15-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245010400180300001600284520090000300592002801200650001701228650002001245650001601265650002101281650002401302650001501326650001101341650001501352651001001367653003101377653001801408653001301426653001501439653002001454700003201474700002001506700001801526700003001544773013501574856008401709852000901793655001201802IND50076267920221119120936.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007626792DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.7423202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Blanco, M.

The study was conducted in the Corbeira catchment, a small agroforestry catchment (16 km ²) located in NW Spain, under temperate humid climate. Phosphorus export response to antecedent flow conditions is complex and nonlinear, making it difficult to predict patterns of P export using linear relationships. It has been shown that other factors such as erosion on cultivated land as well as the timing of mineral fertilizer and manure applications play important roles in the P export in this catchment. This work also demonstrates the need to examine larger data sets when the relationships between hydrologic conditions and P export are analyzed to capture the high variability shown in these types of catchments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata collection 3ahumid zones 3amanure spreading 3amineral fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3aSpain 0aantecedent flow conditions 0ahumid climate 0aNW Spain 0aphosphorus 0arural catchment1 aTaboada-Castro, M.

Repertoire sizes varied between 44 and 60 phrase types per bird for the 13 birds analyzed here. The repertoire was subdivided into ‘themes’ containing between two and seven phrase types. The birds sang the phrase types in a given theme for a time before eventually introducing a new theme; in this manner the repertoire was revealed relatively slowly over time. Theme composition within a bird’s repertoire did not change within or between singing bouts throughout the season. The tendency to sing in themes was corroborated by network analysis, which revealed small-world structure in the songs. Phrase types were widely shared within the population. I discuss these findings as they compare with the singing styles of other species, both closely and distantly related.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aphylogeny 3avocalization 3aSierra Nevada (California)0 tJournal of ornithology.g2016 Jan., v. 157, no. 1 p.13-22dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-015-1238-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245015300178520120300331592002801534650001601562650002101578650002201599650003001621650001801651650001101669650001001680650001201690650002001702650002401722653001401746653001401760653002201774653002301796653002201819653001601841653000801857653000801865653000701873653000801880700002001888700001901908700005701927700002601984700006402010773011202074856008702186852000902273655001202282IND60772215320221119110507.0220502e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077221532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2022.1110742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarasinghege, Chalani10aInvestigation on the effect of the heating surface temperature of 1st evaporator on sucrose loss and the degradation of sugarcane juice constituents  aTo enable more energy efficient sugar production from sugarcane, higher process temperatures in the 1st evaporator is typically utilized, as this allows higher temperature bleed vapours to be used rather than process steam for other heating duties in the factory. This invariably increases juice degradation and the temperature difference (ΔT) between the heated surface and juice can be even higher where process steam used for heating is superheated. This study investigated the effect of high surface temperatures (139–168 °C) and residence times (0–60 min) on both factory and synthetic juice degradation using a specially designed laboratory evaporator rig. The results show that ΔT is inversely proportional to the heat transfer coefficient. At up to 148 °C and short residence time, there were minor differences in the juice degradation profile. However, at higher temperatures there were significant sucrose loss (≤2.5%), amino acid degradation, lignin (associated with fibre in juice) depolymerization to hydroxycinnamic acids, isomerization of trans-to cis-aconitic acid, and the formation of alcohols. Strategies to minimize juice degradation in evaporators are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3adepolymerization 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat transfer coefficient 3aisomerization 3alignin 3asteam 3asucrose 3asugarcane juice 3asurface temperature 0aSugarcane 0aSuperheat 0aThermal stability 0aSucrose hydrolysis 0aJuice degradation 0aEvaporation 0aESJ 0aHTC 0aLP 0aΔT1 aBroadfoot, Ross1 aBottle, Steven1 aBartley, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6683-61591 aDoherty, William O.S.1 aRackemann, Darryn W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5055-64830 tJournal of food engineering.g2022 Sept., v. 329 p.111074-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2022.1110743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013900156520141400295592002801709650001301737650002301750650001101773650002001784650002201804650002201826650001101848650001601859650001701875650001101892700001501903700001701918700001801935700001801953700001601971700002101987773012902008856007502137852000902212655001202221IND60781078520221117171930.0220623e20220616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078107852DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141228802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Feili 10aDominant Factors in the Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Precipitation Change in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Urban Agglomeration  aUrbanization has a significant influence on precipitation, but existing studies lack the spatial and temporal heterogeneity analysis of its impact on precipitation in urban areas at different levels. This study investigates the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and the influencing factors on six dimensions in 156 urban areas in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2018, utilizing a mixed-methods analytical approach. The results show that the change in the natural factor layer caused by urbanization was the most important factor, affecting urban precipitation variation in summer and over the whole year, accounting for 34.5% and 10.7%, respectively. However, the contribution of the urban thermal environment in summer cannot be ignored, and the change in the urban thermal environment caused by human activities in winter is an important influencing factor. When considering the optimal combination of factors, relative humidity was shown to be significant in the spatial variations in precipitation during summer, which contributed 26.2%, followed by human activity as indicated by night-time light intensity. Over the whole year, aerosol optical depth makes the substantial contribution of 21.8% to urban precipitation change. These results provide benchmarks for improving the adaptability of urban-environment change and urban planning in the context of urbanization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aanalytical methods 3ahumans 3alight intensity 3arelative humidity 3aspatial variation 3asummer 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awinter1 aLiang, Ze 1 aMa, Weijing 1 aShen, Jiashu 1 aWang, Yueyao 1 aLiu, Dahai 1 aLi, Shuangcheng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 16, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141228803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245012700206300001200333506007600345520091400421592002801335506003701363650002001400650004401420650001301464650001601477650003501493650001601528650001201544650001101556650002101567650001701588650000901605650001201614650001701626650003101643650002001674650002201694773010901716856008201825852000901907655001201916IND60550220020221207140323.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055022002DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0498-32doi7 aPMC50147652pmcid7 a283302662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShameer, Syed10aBiosorption of lead, copper and cadmium using the extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) of Bacillus sp., from solar salterns  ap. 194.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExtracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have a great deal of research interest as they protect the producer from different stresses including antibiotics, ionic stress, desiccation and assist in bio-film formation, pathogenesis, adhesion, etc. In this study haloalkaliphilic Bacillus sp., known to cope with osmophilic stress, was selected and screened for EPS production.

It is often unclear what combinations and intensities of management actions are required to achieve meaningful conservation outcomes. We investigate whether disease and predator control can reverse population declines of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). Based on longitudinal monitoring of the epidemiological and demographic status of over 500 animals over 4 years, coupled with an intensive disease and predator management programme, we use survival analyses to estimate annual age‐specific survival rates and population growth, and simulations to quantify the benefit of these actions. Predation and disease accounted for 63% and 29% of mortality, respectively, across all years, with wild dog (dingoes or dingo‐hybrids: Canis dingo, C. dingo × Canis familiaris), carpet pythons (Morelia spilota) and domestic dogs (C. familiaris) accounting for 82%, 14% and 4% of confirmed predation mortalities, respectively. In the first 2 years, before disease and dog control had major impact, the population was declining rapidly with annual growth rates of 0.66 and 0.90. In the third and fourth years, after interventions had been fully implemented, the population growth rate had increased to 1.08 and 1.20. The intrinsic survival rate of joeys was 71.2% (excluding deaths resulting from the death of the mother). Adult survival rates varied as a function of sex, age and year. Even in a declining koala population, management actions can achieve meaningful conservation outcomes (population growth rates greater than one). However, benefits may be short‐lived in the absence of longer term strategies to manage threats. This work also identifies wild dogs as a major threat to koalas, highlighting the need to better understand how wild dog impacts vary in space and time. Policy implications. Offsetting policy that addresses habitat loss alone may achieve little or no meaningful benefit to declining koalas populations. Management must address suites of threats affecting these populations and ensure that the cumulative effects of these actions achieve positive population growth rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorelia 3aPhascolarctos cinereus 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3adeath 3adingoes 3adogs 3ahabitat destruction 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3apredator control 3aspace and time 3asurvival rate1 aDe Villiers, Deidré,1 aLoader, Jo1 aRobbins, Amy1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9231-06361 aStigner, Madeleine1 aForbes, Neil1 aHanger, Jonathan0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2018 July, v. 55, no. 4 p.1966-1975dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.131273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002100185245017200206506007600378520179200454592002802246506003702274650001302311650002902324650001102353650001002364650001902374650001502393650001402408650001202422650001402434650001502448650002702463650001402490700002102504700001902525773011902544856007802663852000902741655001202750IND60649358420221207112750.0190704e20171018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064935842DNAL7 a10.3390/insects80401102doi7 aPMC57467932pmcid7 a290578312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Andrew K.14aThe Heartrate Reaction to Acute Stress in Horned Passalus Beetles (<em>Odontotaenius disjunctus</em>) is Negatively Affected by a Naturally-Occurring Nematode Parasite  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere are many events in the lives of insects where rapid, effective stress reactions are needed, including fighting conspecifics to defend territories, evading predators, and responding to wounds. A key element of the stress reaction is elevation of heartrate (HR), for enhancing distribution of blood (hemolymph) to body compartments. We conducted two experiments designed to improve understanding of the insect stress reaction and how it is influenced by parasitism in a common beetle species (Odontotaenius disjunctus). By non-destructively observing heartbeat frequency before, during and after applying a stressor (physical restraint) for 10 min, we sought to determine: (1) the exact timing of the cardiac stress reaction; (2) the magnitude of heartrate elevation during stress; and (3) if the physiological response is affected by a naturally-occurring nematode parasite, Chondronema passali. Restraint caused a dramatic increase in heartrate, though not immediately; maximum HR was reached after approximately 8 min. Average heartrate went from 65.5 beats/min to a maximum of 81.5 (24.5% increase) in adults raised in the lab (n = 19). Using wild-caught adults (n = 77), average heartrates went from 54.9 beats/min to 74.2 (35.5% increase). When restraint was removed, HR declined after ~5 min, and reached baseline 50 min later. The nematode parasite did not affect baseline heartrates in either experiment, but in one, it retarded the heartrate elevation during stress, and in the other, it reduced the overall magnitude of the elevation. While we acknowledge that our results are based on comparisons of beetles with naturally-occurring parasite infections, these results indicate this parasite causes a modest reduction in host cardiac output during acute stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNematoda 3aOdontotaenius disjunctus 3aadults 3ablood 3acardiac output 3aheart rate 3ahemolymph 3ainsects 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aphysiological response 3apredators1 aCoogler, Brandon1 aJohnson, Isaac0 tInsects.g2017 Oct. 18, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects80401103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04621naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014200163300001600305500001500321520257900336592002802915650003102943650002402974650002602998650002103024650002903045650001503074650001603089650001503105650001303120650002403133650001303157650001303170650001103183650001203194650001403206650001203220650002403232650002603256650004303282650000903325650001803334650001303352650002003365650002103385650001703406650001803423650002203441650001703463650001003480653002603490653001103516653002803527653003103555653001603586653002103602653001303623653001603636700001903652700001903671700001703690773010903707856008603816852000903902655001203911IND60531996320221119025326.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053199632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, J.10aFungal endophyte and tall fescue cultivar interact to differentially affect bulk and rhizosphere soil processes governing C and N cycling  ap. 165-174.  a2019-12-06  aTall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.)) is a cool-season perennial grass within which can live a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala) thought to provide enhanced edaphic and climactic stress tolerance to the host compared to non-infected individuals. Our prior research demonstrated that a variety of root exudate compounds released from tall fescue were differentially affected by tall fescue cultivar, endophyte genotype and their interaction. Changes in root exudates and associated microbial communities could influence soil processes, including carbon and nitrogen cycling, but these effects may differ depending on fescue and endophyte genetics. To test this, we collected rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from six year old field plots located in Lexington, KY planted with two different tall fescue cultivars (PDF and 97TF1), each containing four endophyte treatments [endophyte-free (E−) or infected with one of three strains of E. coenophiala (common toxic, novel AR542E+ and novel AR584E+)]. The influence of fescue cultivar, endophyte strain, and soil sample location (rhizosphere vs. bulk) were assessed for soil organic carbon, soil organic nitrogen, particulate and non-particulate organic matter (POM and n-POM, respectively) - C and – N, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) pools. Soil functional aspects were evaluated by measuring soil respiration and the activity of seven different soil enzymes related to C, N and P cycling. We found that rhizosphere soils had greater microbial biomass, potential enzyme activity, and oxygen utilization, but lesser POM-N concentrations than bulk soils. In rhizosphere soils, tall fescue cultivar had the greatest influence on soil microbial community structure, while endophyte genotype had a stronger influence on soil C fractions (notably POM-C). Changes in root system architecture, biomass, and tissue composition, together with root exudate chemistry, which we have shown in previous studies to be affected by endophyte infection and fescue cultivar, likely explain these findings. There was greater POM-N in bulk soils which was influenced by the interaction of endophyte and cultivar potentially due to differences in the chemical composition of the tissues brought about by this interaction. Our results support current observations that tall fescue cultivar and fungal endophyte strain influence soil C and N cycling and, by analyzing bulk and rhizosphere soils separately, go further to show the level of influence cultivar and endophyte have within each of these compartments.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil organic nitrogen 3asoil respiration 3adissolved organic carbon 3aendophytes 3arhizosphere 3aperennials 3agenetics 3asoil microorganisms 3agenotype 3aplanting 3aoxygen 3atissues 3acultivars 3agrasses 3acommunity structure 3amicrobial communities 3aFestuca arundinacea subsp. arundinacea 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3atoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3astress tolerance 3aroot systems 3aroot exudates 3amicrobial biomass 3asoil enzymes 3afungi 0aEpichloë coenophiala 0acarbon 0aPhospholipid fatty acid 0aParticulate organic matter 0aTall fescue 0aFungal endophyte 0anitrogen 0aRhizosphere1 aMcCulley, R.L.1 aPhillips, T.D.1 aMcNear, D.H.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2016 Oct., v. 101 p.165-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007400160520090200234592002801136650001901164650001301183650002201196650001201218650001201230773012701242856007401369852000901443655001201452IND60652165120221118052805.0190712e20180126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065216512DNAL7 a10.3390/su100203192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeidenfeld, Adi10aTourism Diversification and Its Implications for Smart Specialisation  aThe complex nature of tourism, its strong inter-sectoral relationships and regional dimension challenge innovation. The advent of smart specialisation, which focuses on regional diversification across sectors, offers considerable and hitherto largely unrealized potential for developing innovative tourism policies within this new agenda. This paper addresses the understudied concept of tourism diversification and its unrealized relevance to smart specialisation, which has emerged as a mainstream logic underpinning EU Cohesion Policy reforms and has diffused into other OECD countries. It provides a theoretical framework for studying product, market, sectoral and regional diversification as well as related variety in tourism. Some policy implications for realizing tourism diversification and for the potential role of tourism in smart specialisation strategies in particular are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acohesion 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3atourism0 tSustainability.g2018 Jan. 26, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100203193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011900182300001600301520141900317592002801736650001501764650001201779650001401791650001901805650001401824650000901838650001301847650001401860650001301874650002101887650001401908650001501922650001601937650001401953650001401967650001201981650001301993650001102006650000902017650002302026650001802049650001502067653001902082653001302101653001502114653001402129653001102143700003002154700003002184773013502214856008402349852000902433655001202442IND50076268220221119121046.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007626822DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.7423372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaboada-Castro, M.

This is a small catchment with previous agricultural diffuse and accidental pollution mainly due to the spreading of slurry. Ion concentrations were monitored over a period of approximately 6 years at the catchment outlet. Agricultural land use was replaced by eucalyptus plantations from mid-July 1998. Great temporal variability was observed for each ion and also among ions. The mean concentrations of studied ions were greatest during the agricultural period. The most pronounced differences occurred for NH ₄, PO ₄-P, NO ₂, and K. All presented the greatest concentration peaks in the agricultural phase, with the exception of Ca. During this period the following concentrations (mg L ⁻¹) were reached: NO ₃110, NH ₄ 31, NO ₂ 3.76, PO ₄-P 35.96, Ca 30, Mg 12.42, K 97, Na 50, Si 13.9, Cl 96, and SO ₄ 16.6. The slurries seem to have contributed notably toward the increase in the concentration of nutrients and major ions in the drainage water of the catchment, affecting water quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3acalcium 3achemistry 3adrainage water 3aevolution 3aions 3aland use 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3anitrogen dioxide 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplantations 3apollution 3apotassium 3asilicon 3aslurries 3asodium 3asoil 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3awatersheds 0aDrainage water 0aland use 0amajor ions 0anutrients 0aslurry1 aRodríguez-Blanco, M.

Mature soils outside the proglacial area (soil ages >700years) served as reference for advanced soil development. All soils were sampled in triplicate per surface age to estimate the variability of soil formation. Different selective dissolution methods were applied to quantify Fe and Al pools with respect to their role for soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization during initial pedogenesis. The chemical composition of organic matter was characterized by using solid-state CPMAS ¹³ C NMR spectroscopy. Leptosols and Regosols were found in the glacier foreland which showed a high variability of development ranging from morphologically undeveloped to soils forming Ah horizons within 70years. These different stages of soil development were present at a small scale within the same surface age according to past glacier movements. Particle-size distribution varied between soils of similar age and without chronological trend. These results point to the strong impact of different glacial deposition and subsequent glaciofluvial erosion, which was indicated by buried organic surface layers, on soil formation. In general, we found a rapid accumulation of OC in the mineral soils (7.1gm⁻²year⁻¹) and organic surface layers with increasing soil age. Similarly, the amount of poorly crystalline Fe oxides and Al phases increased reflecting the growing potential for SOC stabilization. This was indicated by the strong relationship between SOC stocks and stocks of oxalate soluble Fe and Al. In contrast to strongly increasing quantities, only small changes in the composition of organic matter as well as Fe and Al pools were detected during initial pedogenesis. Fe oxides and inorganic Al phases mainly remained poorly crystalline. Our results point to the concurrent evolution of SOC and poorly crystalline Fe oxides and Al phases with positive feedback mechanisms during initial soil formation. In the Swiss Alpine environment, soil development on silica rich parent material proceeds to Cambisols within at least 700years as evidenced by the reference soils found outside the proglacial area. They showed indications of weak podzolization as some Fe and Al were translocated downwards. The comparison between the foreland soils and the Cambisols showed decreasing accumulation rates of SOC and pedogenic Fe and Al. This indicates that soil formation processes slow down already after some hundred years or accumulation of Fe and Al increasingly occurs at greater soil depth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage of soil 3asilica 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asoil organic carbon 3amineral soils 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil depth 3aorganic soils 3asoil formation 3aSwitzerland 0aorganic matter1 aSmittenberg, Rienk1 aKögel-Knabner, Ingrid,0 tGeoderma.g2011 June 15, v. 163, no. 1-2 p.83-94dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011500173300002000288520214700308592002802455650001902483650001102502650001702513650001102530650002602541650003302567650001702600650001102617650001402628650001302642650001702655700002602672700002602698700002302724773015502747856008302902852000902985655001202994IND60751229320221120214201.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075122932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14251-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekun, Festus Victor14aThe relevance of EKC hypothesis in energy intensity real-output trade-off for sustainable environment in EU-27  ap. 51137-51148.  aConsidering the prevailing wave of global warming and other environmental challenges, which can be attributed to increasing environmental pollution as a result of economic activity, thus, it is essential to understand the effect of economic progress on the environment. More importantly, this endeavor is especially suited for the European Union (EU) member states, which account for a sizable portion of the world economy. However, by considering the open border or trade policy approach of the bloc, this study applies a battery of econometrics analysis that consists of mean group, augmented mean group, common correlated effect mean group estimators, and Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality analysis for direction of causality. These techniques are superior to first-generation methods to substantiate the relationship between real income, energy intensity, and carbon emission between annual frequency data from 1990 to 2017. Empirical results from series of cointegration tests reveal the long-run equilibrium relationship between the highlighted variables in the EU. Our study validates the existence of EKC phenomenon where emphasis is based on GDP growth at the expense of environmental quality. This implies that EU growth trajectory comes with an environmental trade-off and consequences. However, few countries in the region have made substantial strides of carbon reduction but not as a bloc. This position is resonated by the regression from all estimators in harmony where energy intensity dampens environmental quality in the blocs investigated. On the direction of causality, feedback Granger causality is observed running from GDP growth and carbon emission. A similar direction of causality is seen between energy intensity and carbon emission. These outcomes have far-reaching consequences on the environment. This study recommends the need for energy transition to cleaner and friendlier energy technologies by EU officials. That is, the need for a paradigm shift from conventional energy based on fossil fuel to renewable energy should be pursued in the region. More policy directions are outlined in the concluding section.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon 3aeconometrics 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afossil fuels 3aincome 3apollution 3aresearch 3atrade policy1 aAlola, Andrew Adewale1 aGyamfi, Bright Akwasi1 aYaw, Sarpong Steve0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 37 p.51137-51148dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14251-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009800177300001600275520158000291536028901871592002802160596012202188596011402310596004702424650001802471650002302489650001702512650002002529650001502549650001002564650002102574650002002595650002202615650003002637650001502667650003302682650001802715650001402733651001702747653002302764653002302787653001502810653001402825653001902839653001502858700002102873700002602894773012602920856008503046852000903131655001203140IND60595781720221120173400.0180607e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059578172DNAL7 a10.1080/14772000.2017.14045042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaphitz, Rita M Lopez10aCryptic species in the Andean hemiparasite Quinchamalium chilense (Schoepfiaceae: Santalales)  ap. 260-270.  aThe integration of different characters (e.g. morphological, ecological, and molecular) is now recognized as important in species delimitation. In particular, genetic distances between homologous genes have been suggested as one of the main tools to identify species, especially in the case of cryptic species. Quinchamalium is morphologically variable and occupies a diverse set of biomes across its distribution in the Southern Andes. Recent work based on morphology has synonymized the entire genus as a single morphospecies, Quinchamalium chilense. This widely distributed taxon presents the opportunity to find potential cryptic species. The main objective of this study was to test the existence of cryptic species, based mainly on phylogenetic gene trees, genetic distances, and geographic patterns of haplotypes from molecular markers of the nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (trnL-F) genomes, considering climatic and morphological characteristics. The ITS phylogeny and corresponding haplotype network resulted in three lineages with strong genetic differentiation and distinct geographic patterns. These lineages were informally named Desert, Matorral, and Mountain, based on their geographic distribution in different biomes. The trnL-F chloroplast phylogeny did not distinguish Desert from Matorral, and the haplotype network showed overlap between these last two lineages. Overall, we hypothesize the existence of two cryptic species within Quinchamalium chilense (Mountain and Matorral–Desert) that correspond to genetic, climatic, and morphological differences.  aThis work was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica [grant number 2011-1036], [grant number 2014-0584]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas [grant number PIP 0282]; Universidad Nacional del Comahue [grant number PIN B149].  aPublisher supplied data  a2011-1036 2014-0584cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológicadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003074  aPIP 0282cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicasdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002923  aPIN B149cUniversidad Nacional del Comahue 3aSchoepfiaceae 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3acryptic species 3aecosystems 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amorphospecies 3aphylogeny 3aAndes region 0agenetic divergence 0amolecular lineages 0amorphology 0aphylogeny 0aphylogeography 0aspeciation1 aEzcurra, Cecilia1 aVidal-Russell, Romina0 tSystematics and biodiversity.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 16, no. 3 p.260-270dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000156x1478-09337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2017.14045043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245011700205520141500322592002801737650002401765650001401789650002001803650002701823650002201850650001201872650002601884650000901910650001601919650001101935650002301946650001401969650001501983650001601998650001102014650001102025650001502036650001702051650001102068650001702079650001902096650002202115650001502137651001702152700005902169700002502228700001902253773010802272856007702380961001302457852000902470655001202479IND60596937920221119203215.0181203e20180426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059693792DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/14310542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerrill, Stephen D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1929-866310aSoil Quality and Water Redistribution Influences on Plant Production over Low Hillslopes on Reclaimed Mined Land  aCoal surface mining in northern Great Plains USA led to reclamation experiments with soil respreading. Respread soil depth (RSD) and runoff of water redistribution (WR) effects interacted in original North Dakota studies, complicating interpretations. We determined WR and soil depth/soil quality (SQ) effects on hillslope production patterns for sites with soil wedges (2%–5% slope, 50-m length) over sodic mine spoils. At Zap, cool-season forages crested wheatgrass (CWG: Agropyron cristatum) and Russian wildrye (Psathyrostachys juncea) generally decreased as RSD increased upslope. At Stanton, alfalfa (Medicago sativa), native grasses (Bouteloua spp.), and CWG responded to RSD, increasing 70% to midslope and decreasing further. A SQ index (SQI) based on six indicator properties was highly correlated (r > 0.7) with RSD. Yield regressions with RSD or SQI were generally significant for Stanton forages and for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) at both sites. Yield regressions with WR index (catchment area-based) indicated dominance of WR effects at Zap. Cool-season forages at Zap evidently responded to springtime runoff, while Stanton forages and spring wheat at both sites used water later in the season and responded to soil depth/SQ effects. Results suggest models for interaction of SQ and landform WR affecting productivity should include plant community composition and water-use information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgropyron cristatum 3aBouteloua 3aMedicago sativa 3aPsathyrostachys juncea 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalfalfa 3abotanical composition 3acoal 3acold season 3aforage 3aindigenous species 3alandforms 3amine spoil 3amined soils 3amodels 3arunoff 3asoil depth 3asoil quality 3aspring 3aspring wheat 3asurface mining 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3aNorth Dakota1 aLiebig, Mark A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2716-36651 aHendrickson, John D.1 aWick, Abbey F.0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2018 Apr. 26, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/14310543Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245013600171520138300307592002801690650001101718650001201729650001301741650001701754650000901771650001201780650002401792700003001816700002501846700002201871773012101893856007402014852000902088655001202097IND60742688420221122081641.0210624e20210525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074268842DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130617942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbarushimana, Jean-Claude 14aThe Relationship between Bodyweight Status and Weight Perception Explains Differences in Calories Ordered in a Food Choice Exercise  aUnderstanding food choice is critical to be able to address the rise in obesity rates around the globe. In this paper, we examine the relationship between measured (BMI, using self-reported height and weight) and perceived weight status with the number of calories ordered in a controlled online food choice exercise. A total of 1044 participants completed an online food choice exercise in which they selected ingredients for a sandwich from five categories: meat/protein, cheese, spread/dressing, bread, and vegetables. We examine the number of calories ordered by participants and use linear regression to study the relationship of BMI category relative to self-reported perceived weight status with calories ordered. As a comparison to previous literature, we also examine the relationship between relative weight status and self-reported dieting behavior using logistic regression. We find that participants perceiving themselves to have a higher BMI than their BMI calculated using height and weight ordered significantly fewer calories and were more likely to report dieting than participants who perceived themselves to have a lower BMI than their calculated BMI. The relationship between perceived weight status and measured weight status explains behavior in a food choice task. Understanding how people perceive their weight may help design effective health messages.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreads 3acheeses 3aexercise 3afood choices 3ameat 3aobesity 3aregression analysis1 aGustafson, Christopher R.1 aGitungwa, Henriette 1 aZeballos, Eliana 0 tNutrients.g2021 May 25, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130617943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013800169300001600307520140600323592002801729650002701757650002201784650002901806650002601835650002601861650001901887650001501906650001401921650002101935650002301956650001001979650001101989650001202000650001302012650001602025650003302041650001402074650001202088650002202100650001402122700001902136700002002155700001702175700001702192773011602209856008102325852000902406655001202415IND60173864520221122034613.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017386452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-015-0636-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Anupama10aBacillus thuringiensis C25 which is rich in cell wall degrading enzymes efficiently controls lettuce drop caused by Sclerotinia minor  ap. 577-589.  aSclerotinia is a phytopathogenic genus of fungi that form sclerotia: black, hard, seed-like functioning bodies. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Sclerotinia minor are major threats to vegetable cultivation. In this study, we identified an efficient biocontrol agent against lettuce drop caused by S. minor. Initially, 43 bacterial strains isolated from Sclerotinia-infected field were screened for antifungal effects against S. minor. The selected bacterial strains (i.e. C5 and C25) conferred significant (P < 0.05) inhibition in mycelia growth, formation and viability of sclerotia of S. minor in vitro. Especially, strain C25 significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed the disease severity of lettuce drop caused by S. minor and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. On the basis of biochemical and genetic analyses, strain C25 was identified as a subspecies of Bacillus thuringiensis. Strain C25 exhibited activities of variety of cell wall degrading enzymes such as proteases, β-1,3-glucanase, and chitinase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) implied that strain C25 induced degeneration, distortion, and rupture of hyphae of S. minor. Conclusively, our study was the first to report that Bacillus thuringiensis significantly suppressed sclerotial diseases by degrading the cell walls of pathogenic fungi, at least in part. Strain C25 would be a potential BCA (biocontrol agent) for the agricultural industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aSclerotinia minor 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aagricultural industry 3aantifungal properties 3abeta-glucanase 3acell walls 3achitinase 3adisease severity 3afungal antagonists 3afungi 3ahyphae 3alettuce 3amycelium 3aproteinases 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asclerotia 3astrains 3avegetable growing 3aviability1 aSultana, Razia1 aChae, Jong-Chan1 aKim, Kangmin1 aLee, Kui-Jae0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2015 July, v. 142, no. 3 p.577-589dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-015-0636-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014000167300001600307520164100323592002801964650004801992650004202040650001702082650001902099650001902118650001002137650001002147650002102157650002302178650001502201650001702216650002502233650001702258650000902275650001902284650002802303651001602331700005902347773011802406856008302524852000902607655001202616IND60776457220221120141314.0220506e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077645722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-022-00959-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Yong-Sun10aIsolation and identification of multi-trait plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria from coastal sand dune plant species of Pohang beach  ap. 523-533.  aRhizobacteria are root-associated bacteria that influence plant growth by various direct and indirect mechanisms. In quest of efficient plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) with multiple plant growth–promoting traits, a total of 52 rhizobacterial isolates were isolated from the rhizospheric soil collected at Pohang beach, Republic of Korea. The bacterial isolates were evaluated in vitro for their plant growth–promoting traits like production of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, and phosphate solubilization activities. More than 28% of the isolates revealed all of the multi-trait plant growth–promoting activities, whereas 11.54% exhibited robust results for producing IAA, ACC deaminase, siderophore, and phosphate solubilization activities. Similarly, 36% isolates were capable for the production of IAA, siderophore, and ACC deaminase, while 32% revealed phosphate solubilization and siderophore production. The isolates with prominent multi-trait plant growth–promoting activities were identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and matched to Pseudomonas koreensis-(S4T10), Pseudomonas fluorescens-(S3B1), Serratia fonticola-(S1T1), Sphingobacterium multivorum-(S1B1), Brevundimonas vesicularis-(S1T13), and Arthrobacter sp.-(S2T9) with 99–100% similarity. Our results confirm that further evaluation of these PGPR (exhibiting multi-traits for plant growth promotion) is required on crop plants to reveal their pragmatic role under normal and abiotic stress conditions and add into the consortium of biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aArthrobacter 3aabiotic stress 3abiofertilizers 3adunes 3agenes 3agrowth promotion 3aindole acetic acid 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere bacteria 3asiderophores 3asoil 3asolubilization 3asustainable agriculture 3aSouth Korea1 aʻAlī, Sājid,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0696-30570 tFolia microbiologica.g2022 June, v. 67, no. 3 p.523-533dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl18090x0015-56327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-022-00959-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03710naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024004400135040001800179100006100197245017900258300001400437506007600451506003100527520178500558592002802343596008302371506003702454650001702491650001402508650002302522650001302545650002102558650001202579650002302591650001202614650002402626650002202650650001102672650001702683650001502700653001302715653004202728653001102770653002102781653001902802653000902821700001902830700001602849700001702865773011102882856008802993856004503081961000903126852000903135655001203144IND60557191220221215143344.0190405e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055719122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.09.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.09.0022chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamanga-Sollo, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0483-342410aRole of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 in estradiol 17β-induced alterations in protein synthesis and protein degradation rates in fused bovine satellite cell cultures  ap. 90-96.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIn feedlot steers, estradiol-17β (E2) and combined E2 and trenbolone acetate (a testosterone analog) implants enhance rate and efficiency of muscle growth; and, consequently, these compounds are widely used as growth promoters in several countries. Treatment with E2 stimulates protein synthesis rate and suppresses protein degradation rate in fused bovine satellite cell (BSC) cultures; however, the mechanisms involved in these effects are not known with certainty. Although the genomic effects of E2 mediated through the classical estrogen receptors have been characterized, recent studies indicate that binding of E2 to the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER)-1 mediates nongenomic effects of E2 on cellular function. Our current data show that inhibition of GPER-1, matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2/9), or heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (hbEGF) suppresses E2 stimulate protein synthesis rate in cultured BSCs (P < 0.001) suggesting that all of these are required in order for E2 to stimulate protein synthesis in these cultures. In contrast, inhibition of GPER-1, MMP2/9, or hbEGF has no effect on the ability of E2 to suppress protein degradation rates in fused BSC cultures indicating that these factors are not required in order for E2 to suppress protein degradation rate in these cells. Furthermore, treatment of fused BSC cultures with E2 increased (P < 0.05) pAKT levels indicating that the pAKT pathway may play a role in E2-stimulated effects on cultured BSC. In summary, our current data show that active GPER-1, MMP2/9, and hbEGF are necessary for E2-stimulated protein synthesis but not for E2-simulated suppression of protein degradation in cultured BSC. In addition, E2 treatment increases pAKT levels in cultured BSC.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell culture 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3afeedlots 3agrowth promotion 3aheparin 3ametalloproteinases 3amuscles 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein synthesis 3asteers 3atestosterone 3atrenbolone 0aEstrogen 0aG protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 0aMuscle 0aProtein turnover 0aSatellite cell 0apAKT1 aThornton, K.J.1 aWhite, M.E.1 aDayton, W.R.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2017 Jan., v. 58 p.90-96dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl34945x0739-72407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.09.0023Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5571912  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169500001900279520132100298592002801619650001301647650001801660650001301678650001201691650002101703650001301724650001101737650001901748650001901767650001401786650002201800650001501822653001801837653002101855653002501876700001701901700001501918700001801933700001501951700001901966700001901985700001402004773011402018856008602132852000902218655001202227IND60716138520221123010404.0210226e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071613852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1242622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhuoyao10aAnodic oxidation of ciprofloxacin using different graphite felt anodes: Kinetics and degradation pathways  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCiprofloxacin (CIP) is ubiquitous in the environment which poses a certain threat to human and ecology. In this investigation, the physical and electrochemical properties of graphite felt (GF) anodes which affected the anodic oxidation (AO) performance, and the CIP removal effect of GF were evaluated. The GFs were used as anodes for detection of ·OH with coumarin (COU) as molecule probe and removal of CIP in a 150 mL electrolytic cell with Pt cathode (AO-GF/Pt system). The results showed that hydrophilic GF (B-GF) owned higher sp³/sp² and more oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing functional groups than the hydrophobic GF (A-GF). Moreover, B-GF possessed higher oxygen evolution potential (1.12 V), more active sites and stronger ·OH generation capacity. Above mentioned caused that B-GF exhibited more superior properties for CIP removal. The best efficiencies (96.95%, 99.83%) were obtained in the AO-B-GF/Pt system at 6.25 mAcm⁻² after 10 min (k₁, 0.356 min⁻¹) and 60 min (k₂, 0.224 min⁻¹), respectively. Furthermore, nine degradation pathways of CIP in AO-B-GF/Pt system were summarized as the cleavage of the piperazine ring, cyclopropyl group, quinolone ring and F atom by ·OH. It provides new insights into the removal and degradation pathways of CIP with GF in AO system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aciprofloxacin 3acoumarin 3aecology 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3apiperazine 0aGraphite felt 0aAnodic oxidation 0aDegradation pathways1 aLai, Weikang1 aXu, Yanbin1 aXie, Guangyan1 aHou, Waner1 aZhanchang, Pan1 aKuang, Chaozhi1 aLi, Yuxin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 405 p.124262-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1242623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014100171300001600312520170000328592002802028650002902056650001302085650002102098650002502119650001102144650002402155650002002179650002602199650002202225650002302247650001902270650001302289650001902302650002602321650002202347650001902369650001902388650000902407650001102416650001802427651001402445653003302459653001802492653002302510653001102533653001302544653002602557653001902583700002702602700001702629700001902646700002002665700002202685773013302707856008602840852000902926655001202935IND60613593720221120225701.0190410e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061359372DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60029-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHERRERA, Ileana13aAn Invasive Succulent Plant (Kalanchoe daigremontiana) Influences Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Mineralization in a Neotropical Semiarid Zone  ap. 632-643.  aIt has long been recognized that plant invasions may alter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, but the direction and magnitude of such alterations have been rarely quantified. In this study, we quantified the effects caused by the invasion of a noxious exotic plant, Kalanchoe daigremontiana (Crassulaceae), on C and N mineralization and enzymatic and microbial activities in the soil of a semiarid locality in Venezuela. We compared soil parameters associated with these processes (C and N mineralization time and the cumulative values, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity, and activities of dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, glucosaminidase, and urease) between invaded and adjacent non-invaded sites. In addition, correlations among these parameters and the soil physical-chemical properties were also examined to determine if a positive feedback exists between nutrient availability and K. daigremontiana invasion. Overall, our results showed that C mineralization and transformation of organic compounds to NH4+ were favored at sites colonized by K. daigremontiana. With this species, we found the highest cumulative amounts of NH4+-N and C and the lowest mineralization time. These results could be explained by higher activities of urease and glucosaminidase in soils under the influence of K. daigremontiana. In addition, higher amounts of organic matter and moisture content in invaded soils might favor C and N mineralization. In conclusion, invasion of Neotropical semiarid zones by K. daigremontiana may influence the chemical and biological properties of the soils covered by this species, increasing nutrient bioavailability, which, in time, can facilitate the invasion process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKalanchoe daigremontiana 3aammonium 3abeta-glucosidase 3acacti and succulents 3acarbon 3aecological invasion 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescein diacetate 3aintroduced plants 3amicrobial activity 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anutrient availability 3aorganic compounds 3aorganic matter 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3aurease 3awater content 3aVenezuela 0aAkaike Information Criterion 0aC and N pools 0aenzymatic activity 0aNH4+-N 0aNO3−-N 0anutrient availability 0aplant invasion1 aFERRER-PARIS, José R.1 aBENZO, Diana1 aFlores, Saúl,1 aGARCÍA, Belkis1 aNassar, Jafet M.,0 tPedosphere.g2018 Aug., v. 28, no. 4 p.632-643dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60029-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245008400168300001600252520159400268592002801862650001401890650001201904650001501916650001701931650001601948650001601964650001301980650001401993650001702007650001002024651001802034653001802052653001302070653000902083700002302092700002102115700001402136700001802150773010302168856008102271852000902352655001202361IND4460156920221119164024.0151127e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446015692DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-10-00131.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinkholder, Kenton M10aSelection of Glyphosate-Resistant Annual Bluegrass (Poa annua) on a Golf Course  ap. 286-289.  aAnnual bluegrass is a pervasive weed on golf courses in the Transition Zone of the United States and is difficult to selectively remove. For years, superintendents have applied glyphosate on dormant zoysiagrass to remove cool-season weeds. In 2007, a population of annual bluegrass in Columbia, MO, was not controlled with glyphosate after more than 10 yr of continuous applications. Greenhouse studies were established to compare the response of suspect glyphosate-resistant (CCMO1) and -susceptible annual bluegrass to glyphosate. Seedling plants were treated with glyphosate from 0 to 6.27 kg ae ha⁻⁻¹. At 21 d after treatment, reductions in biomass for susceptible annual bluegrass reached a maximum at glyphosate rates of 0.78 kg ha⁻⁻¹ or higher. Comparatively, the biomass of CCMO1 plants was only reduced by 50%% at 0.78 kg ha⁻⁻¹, and reductions did not exceed 60%% at rates up to 6.27 kg ha⁻⁻¹, which is eight times the labeled rate. At rates necessary to reduce plant dry weights by 50%%, the resistance factor (RF) for CCMO1 was 5.2. Twenty-one days following biomass assessment, regrowth of plants was non-existent on susceptible plants at 0.78 kg ha⁻⁻¹ glyphosate or above, but CCMO1 plants reached 1.7 cm regrowth at the 6.27 kg ha⁻⁻¹ rate. Based on the regrowth, the RF for CCMO1 was 5.2. Results indicate a new species has been identified with resistance to glyphosate, and this represents the first report of glyphosate resistance in turfgrass.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; annual bluegrass, Poa annua L.

Results revealed Pickering emulsions with d3,2 of 5.4 μm and PDI of 0.3. Hesp was found to improve the physical stability of the emulsions, suggesting that ChiNP adsorb more efficiently, in the presence of Hesp. Films were produced by the casting method incorporating different emulsion’ levels (5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 g oil/100 g of gelatin). Microstructure analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images showed a similar droplets size and size distribution in the film matrix, endowing the films with homogeneous distributions of oil droplets over their 3D network architecture of films. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) suggested that this phenomenon might be related to Pickering stabilization effect of oil droplets incorporated into the film matrix. With increase of incorporation level, film’ surfaces were more heterogeneous. Interestingly, the incorporation of Pickering emulsions was effective to produce films with good compatibility between interface of oil droplets and gelatin matrix. Films showed less resistance to tension, and more flexibility. The water vapor barrier properties of films improved by increasing the incorporation level. X-ray analysis revealed a good compatibility among the composite films. Films incorporated with encapsulated hesperidin showed a noticeable antioxidant activity. These findings are important to better design composite active films incorporated with Pickering emulsions, in order to optimize film formulation in a rational manner towards their eventual application as food packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aantioxidant activity 3achitosan 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afood packaging 3agelatin 3ahesperidin 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3ascanning electron microscopes 3awater vapor 0aGelatin films 0aHesperidin 0aPickering emulsions 0aChitosan nanoparticles1 aLourenço, Rodrigo Vinicius1 aSobral, Paulo José do Amaral,0 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 Jan., v. 240 p.9-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04420naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138024004800179040001800227100001800245245016600263300001600429506002800445506003600473506007600509506003100585520239100616592002803007596004403035596004503079506003703124650002303161650000903184650001803193650002003211650002703231650001803258650001503276650001903291650001603310650001303326650001403339650001703353650001303370650001903383653001703402653001303419653001303432653002003445653003703465653001003502700001703512700001903529700002403548773011303572856008803685903002403773852000903797655001203806IND60557191420221207140149.0190405e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055719142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.09.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.09.0042doi7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.09.0042chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, M.L.10aGap junctional connexin messenger RNA expression in the ovine uterus and placenta: effects of estradiol-17β-treatment, early pregnancy stages, and embryo origin  ap. 104-112.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aGap junctions play a major role in direct, contact-dependent cell-cell communication, and they have been implicated in the regulation of cellular metabolism and the coordination of cellular functions during growth and differentiation of organs and tissues. Gap junctional channels, composed of connexin (Cx) proteins, have been detected and shown to be influenced by hormones (eg, estrogen and progesterone) in uterine and placental tissues in several species. We hypothesized that (1) the messenger RNA (mRNA) for Cx26, Cx32, Cx37, and Cx43 is expressed in the uterus of ovariectomized sheep treated with estradiol-17β (E2) and in ovine placenta during early pregnancy, (2) E2-treatment of ovariectomized ewes would cause time-specific changes in Cx26, Cx32, Cx37, and Cx43 mRNA expression (experiment 1), and (3) expression of these 4 Cx would vary across the days of early pregnancy (experiment 2) and will be affected by embryo origin (ie, after application of assisted reproductive technologies [ARTs]; experiment 3). Thus, we collected uterine tissues at 0 to 24 h after E2 treatments (experiment 1), and placental tissues during days 14 to 30 of early pregnancy after natural (NAT) breeding (experiment 2) and on day 22 of early pregnancy established after transfer of embryos generated through natural breeding (NAT-ET), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or in vitro activation (IVA, parthenotes; experiment 3). In experiment 1, the expression of Cx26, Cx37, and Cx43 mRNA increased (P < 0.05) and Cx32 mRNA decreased (P < 0.06) in both caruncular and intercaruncular tissues after E2 treatment. In experiment 2, during early pregnancy, there were significant changes (P < 0.01) across days in the expression of Cx26, Cx37, and Cx43 mRNA in the maternal placenta, accompanied by changes (P < 0.001) in Cx37 and Cx43 mRNA in the fetal placenta. In experiment 3, in maternal placenta, Cx32 mRNA expression was decreased (P < 0.001) in NAT-ET, IVF, and IVA groups compared to the NAT group; but in fetal placenta, Cx32 mRNA expression was increased (P < 0.05) in NAT-ET, IVF and IVF groups, and Cx26 mRNA expression was increased (P < 0.05) in IVA compared to NAT group. These data suggest that Cx26, Cx32, Cx37, and Cx43 play specific roles in E2-regulated uterine function and in placental development during early gestation both after natural mating and with application of ART.  aPublisher supplied data  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell communication 3aewes 3agap junctions 3agene expression 3ain vitro fertilization 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3anatural mating 3aovariectomy 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aproteins 3auterine tissue 0aGap junction 0aConnexin 0aPlacenta 0aEarly pregnancy 0aAssisted reproductive technology 0aSheep1 aRedmer, D.A.1 aReynolds, L.P.1 aGrazul-Bilska, A.T.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2017 Jan., v. 58 p.104-112dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl34945x0739-72407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012400164300001400288520157000302592002801872650002601900650001201926650001601938650003701954650001301991650001102004650001002015650001302025650004202038650002702080650002202107650003002129650001402159651001402173700001602187700001902203700001302222700002002235700001402255700001602269700001702285700001802302700002002320700002502340700001602365700001302381773008902394856008102483852000902564655001202573IND60477941220221117233652.0160508e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047794122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10126-015-9666-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Likun10aConstruction of the BAC Library of Small Abalone (Haliotis diversicolor) for Gene Screening and Genome Characterization  ap. 49-56.  aThe small abalone (Haliotis diversicolor) is one of the most important aquaculture species in East Asia. To facilitate gene cloning and characterization, genome analysis, and genetic breeding of it, we constructed a large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, which is an important genetic tool for advanced genetics and genomics research. The small abalone BAC library includes 92,610 clones with an average insert size of 120 Kb, equivalent to approximately 7.6× of the small abalone genome. We set up three-dimensional pools and super pools of 18,432 BAC clones for target gene screening using PCR method. To assess the approach, we screened 12 target genes in these 18,432 BAC clones and identified 16 positive BAC clones. Eight positive BAC clones were then sequenced and assembled with the next generation sequencing platform. The assembled contigs representing these 8 BAC clones spanned 928 Kb of the small abalone genome, providing the first batch of genome sequences for genome evaluation and characterization. The average GC content of small abalone genome was estimated as 40.33 %. A total of 21 protein-coding genes, including 7 target genes, were annotated into the 8 BACs, which proved the feasibility of PCR screening approach with three-dimensional pools in small abalone BAC library. One hundred fifty microsatellite loci were also identified from the sequences for marker development in the future. The BAC library and clone pools provided valuable resources and tools for genetic breeding and conservation of H. diversicolor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis diversicolor 3aabalone 3aaquaculture 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abreeding 3aclones 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular cloning 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3aEast Asia1 aYou, Weiwei1 aZhang, Xiaojun1 aXu, Jian1 aJiang, Yanliang1 aWang, Kai1 aZhao, Zixia1 aChen, Baohua1 aZhao, Yunfeng1 aMahboob, Shahid1 aAl-Ghanim, Khalid A.1 aKe, Caihuan1 aXu, Peng0 tMarine biotechnology.g2016 Feb., v. 18, no. 1 p.49-56dSpringer USx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-015-9666-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001900161245004900180300001600229500000900245500001500254520198000269592002802249650001402277650002202291650001002313650001402323650002102337650002202358650002102380650000902401651001302410651001202423653001502435700002402450773012102474852000902595856009802604655001202702IND8905450020221121035208.0191122e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890545002DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1989.0011183X002900040032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahn, Brain A.10aDistribution Pattern of Seed Yield in Cowpea  ap. 981-984.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aVertical distribution patterns of seed yield have not been reported for cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]. This study was conducted to describe the distribution of seed yield and yield components in several cowpca cultivars and to document possible cultivar differences. Ten cultivars were evaluated in 1985 at Fort Pierce, FL on an Oldsmar fine sand (sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Alfic Arenic Haplaquods) soil and Bixby, OK on a Severn very fine sandy loam [coarse-silty, mixed (calcareous), thermic Typic Udifluvent] soil. Nodal groups were created to facilitate interpretation of seed yield (total seed weight per plant) distribution patterns. Cultivars differed in pod number, seeds per pod, and average weight per individual seed at both locations and in seed yield in Florida. Seed yield was equally distributed between main stems and branches on an overall basis, but the nodal grouping analyses revealed cultivar differences. Over 50% of the seed yield came from pods originating from the main stem for ‘Elite’, ‘Crimson Purplehull’, ‘Encore’, ‘Texas Cream 12’, and ‘Pinkeye Purplehull’ at both locations. In contrast, over 50% of the seed yield came from pods originating from branchesm for ‘White Acre’, ‘Mississippi Cream’, ‘Corona’, and ‘Epoch’ at both locations. Except for Crimson PurplehuH in Oklahoma, each cultivar had over 50% of its seed yield originating in Nodal Group I (Nodes 1 to 6 in Florida, Nodes 1 to 7 in Oklahoma). Except for Elite in Oklahoma, most of the seed yield in Nodal Group I came from pods originating from branches. In contrast, most of the seed yield in the upper nodal groups came from pods originating from the main stem for each cultivar at both locations.

Approaches to visualize the effect of porous media wettability on water films surrounding particles are rarely available in the literature. The aim of this study is therefore (1) to visualize the effect of wettability on area and connectivity of the water phase and (2) to develop a segmentation strategy to enable water films and bulk water to be differentiated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wettability of silica sand was rendered by silanization using dichlorodimethylsilane. The resulting contact angle was measured using the sessile drop method. Furthermore, wettability was characterized by the water penetration time test in air-dry samples and at a volumetric water content of 8 vol.%. Sulforhodamine B was used to stain distilled water at a concentration of 40 mg/l. By means of the Wilhelmy plate method, the influence of the dye on the liquid surface tension was tested. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to visualize the area and connectivity of the fluorescent-dyed water phase and the thickness of water films in untreated and silanized samples at water contents of 8, 16, and 32 vol.%. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The silanization significantly increased the contact angle of silica sand, whereas the surface tension of the dye solution did not differ significantly from that of undyed water. CLSM visualized the distribution of water, focused across the surface grain layer. Thresholding of fluorescence signal in two-dimensional intensity projections enables the discrimination between film and bulk water. It was shown that even subcritical water repellency (contact angle <90) leads to a decrease in area and connectivity of the water phase by affecting film instead of bulk water. CLSM detects decreasing effects of wettability with increasing water content, which were no longer significant at a water content of 32 vol.%. CLSM was found to be more sensitive for detecting the effects of wettability than the water drop penetration time test. CONCLUSIONS: CLSM provides new insight into wettability-dependent water configuration. One advantage over conventional microscopy arises from the capability to visualize water focused over the pore space. Compared to other three-dimensional imaging techniques, the advantage of CLSM is its simplicity. If only the optically accessible upper layer of the porous media is of interest, sample preparation, measurements, and image analysis can easily be carried out with a cost- and time-saving setup.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilica 3aimage analysis 3asurface tension 3acontact angle 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afluorescence 3asoil 3aparticle films 3aporous media 3awater content 3agrains 3adyes 3awettability 3asand 3amicrobial activity 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy1 aRüehlmann, Joerg1 aGoebel, Marc-Oliver1 aBachmann, Joerg0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2012 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.75-85dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-011-0395-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011600168300001400284520151100298592002801809650001201837650001001849650001801859650001801877650001601895650001801911650001801929650001801947650002401965650002401989650001002013650001902023650002002042650001602062650001602078650001602094650001602110653001902126653001902145653001702164653001802181653002802199653002002227700001502247700001402262700001702276700001602293773010902309856008702418852000902505655001202514IND60610214420221121140727.0190318e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061021442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzcelik, M.10aImpact of hydrocolloid addition and microwave processing condition on drying behavior of foamed raspberry puree  ap. 83-91.  aIn this study, foamed raspberry puree was dried by microwave-assisted freeze drying (MWFD). The combined use of microwaves and a foamed structure was intended to accelerate the drying process, while creating an innovative product structure with intense aroma impact for consumption as a snack. The influence of potato protein as foaming agent, maltodextrin as foam stabilizer and microwave (MW) power on the drying characteristics of raspberry foams during MWFD was investigated. Conventional freeze drying (FD) experiments were performed as a reference. MD concentration was shown to significantly influence product temperature. As higher MD concentrations yielded smaller bubbles and a more uniform bubble size distribution, lower drying temperatures were needed to reach the same final moisture content.Varying MW power did not significantly influence the drying time. MWFD at 1.0 W g−1 yielded a 3–4-fold decrease in total drying time as compared to FD. The addition of 10% protein led to the most gentle drying at high MW power input due to structural changes enabling a lower resistance against water vapor mass transfer. There was a high correlation between the foam characteristics and the drying behavior. An overrun above 450% led to gentle drying at all tested microwave power input levels. Foam bubble size and bubble size distribution correlated well with drying velocity. Overall, MWFD was shown to be a much faster and more gentle alternative to FD for the production of fruit foams.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3afoams 3afreeze drying 3afruit growing 3afruit puree 3ahydrocolloids 3amaltodextrins 3amass transfer 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3aodors 3apotato protein 3aprotein content 3araspberries 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3awater vapor 0aRaspberry foam 0aPotato protein 0aMaltodextrin 0aFreeze-drying 0aMicrowave freeze drying 0aDrying kinetics1 aAmbros, S.1 aHeigl, A.1 aDachmann, E.1 aKulozik, U.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 Jan., v. 240 p.83-91dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01399naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010900163300002200272520041100294592002800705650001100733650002300744650002200767650001300789650001300802650001400815700001700829700002900846773012700875856007401002852000901076655001201085IND60669499520221118003329.0190920e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066949952DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21947g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Ritambhara10aFormation of unusual dithiaphlorins from condensation of 2,5-bis(arylhydroxymethyl)thiophene and pyrrole  ap. 102765-102771.  aThe first example of an unusual 21,23-dithiaphlorin containing pyrrole and aryl groups at the sp³meso carbon that is present between the pyrrole and thiophene rings was isolated from the condensation of 2,5-bis(arylhydroxymethyl) and pyrrole under mild acid catalyzed conditions.

METHODS: The study was conducted in 12 large roots of a rain-fed olive orchard, for 6 months without significant rain, when the predawn leaf water potential decreased to −2.4 MPa, and immediately following the first autumn rains. RESULTS: Detailed numerical modelling of the CAG method allowed verification of the response of the measurement system to a range of drivers, improving the linear range of the calibration response function, which has remained stable over the observations period. On average, reverse flow was observed during 30% of the summer nights and, in a conservative estimate, it increased to about 5% of total daily root flow before first autumn rain. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse flow accounted on average for 2.6% of the total daily root flow, enabling upper roots to stay active during the very dry late-summer period. In qualitative terms, our results confirm the CAG method as a reliable tool to identify reverse flow and quantify HR when it occurs.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFRH/BD/66967/2009cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (PT)  aProject PTDC/AAC-AMB/100635/2008cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aOlea europaea 3aautumn 3acalibration 3aleaf water potential 3amathematical models 3aolives 3aorchards 3arain 3aroots 3asummer1 aGreen, Steve1 aConceição, Nuno1 aFernández, E.q(Enrique),0 tPlant and soil.g2018 Apr., v. 425, no. 1-2 p.21-41dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-018-3585-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011600156300002000272520222900292592002802521650001502549650001502564650001702579650002002596650002202616650001702638650002102655650001202676650002002688650001102708650001802719650001302737650002402750650002202774650002602796700003102822700002202853700002802875773012502903856007403028852000903102655001203111IND60669457920221119051233.0190920e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066945792DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20252c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoddi, Siva10aPhoto-driven near-IR fluorescence switch: synthesis and spectroscopic investigation of squarine-spiropyran dyad  ap. 97681-97689.  aWith the objective of developing near-infrared fluorescence switch molecules for potential applications, synthesis of new dyad with two methyl 3-(3′,3′-dimethyl-6-nitrospiro[chromene-2,2′-indolin]-1′-yl)propanoate (6), spiropyran (SP), units as the photochromic acceptors and a near-infrared fluorescence probe, (E)-4-((1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indol-1-ium-2-yl)methylene)-2-((E)-(1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3,3-dimethylindolin-2-ylidene)methyl)-3-oxocyclobut-1-en-1-olate (SQ), (3) as fluorescent donor are described. Two SP units are attached to the two indole nitrogen of squarine core with almost no conjugation with the SQ unit. The spectroscopic properties of the newly synthesized dyad, SP–SQ–SP(7), and corresponding model compounds (SP, SQ) have been studied in acetonitrile solution, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer matrices and in nanoparticle form dispersed in aqueous medium. These dyes (3 and 7) exhibited absorption in the range 550–670 nm, with significant absorption coefficients (10⁻⁵ M⁻¹ cm⁻¹) in the ACN. The fluorescence emission spectra of these dyes cover very broad range from 630 to 750 nm and fluorescence quantum yields are of the order of 0.2 in ACN solution. External stimulations (ultraviolet light and visible light) generate reversible changes in the structure of 7, resulting in changes in the absorption spectra due to the presence of the two spiropyran units. The absorption spectrum of the MC, a ring open form of SP, in dyad SP–SQ–SP(7) has large spectral overlap with the fluorescence spectrum of the SQ unit. Thus, the fluorescence intensity of dyad 7 is modulated by reversible conversion among the two states of the photochromic spiropyran units and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the MC form and the SQ unit. High-contrast “on/off” fluorescence switching is successfully achieved with remarkably fatigue resistance in solution, in polymer film and in nanoparticle form of dyad (7). The described results indicate that this system may represent an efficient fluorescent switch molecule in potentially rewritable high-density optical data or image storage utilizing near-infrared luminescence intensity readout schemes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aacetonitrile 3aenergy transfer 3afilms (materials) 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aindoles 3alight intensity 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apolyethylene glycol 3aspectral analysis 3aultraviolet radiation1 aRamakrishna, Bheerappagari1 aVenkatesh, Yeduru1 aBangal, Prakriti Ranjan0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 5, no. 118 p.97681-97689dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra20252c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011800165300001600283520074500299592002801044650001801072650001401090650003101104650001201135650001601147650001301163650001701176650001001193650001801203650001701221653000901238653001701247653001501264653001201279700001801291700001501309700001801324773010001342856008101442852000901523655001201532IND60557191820221120161124.0190405e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055719182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2016.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaochang10aCharacterization of the microbiota in lightly salted bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) fillets stored at 4 °C  ap. 106-111.  aThe microbiota of unsalted and salted (dry-cured with 2% salt) bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) fillets during storage at 4 °C were identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis. Eleven genera were present in the initial microbiota of bighead carp fillets, where Acinetobacter, Aeromonas and Kocuria were the dominant bacteria. As storage time progressed, the microbial composition of both unsalted and salted fillets became less diverse. Additionally, differences in microbiota were observed between these two treatments. For unsalted bighead carp fillets, Aeromonas became the dominant genus at the end of storage and Pseudomonas was found less commonly. For salted fillets, Pseudomonas was the only bacteria identified at the end of storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aAeromonas 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aKocuria 3aPseudomonas 3abacteria 3afish fillets 3agenes 3aribosomal RNA 3astorage time 0aSalt 0aBighead carp 0aMicrobiota 0aStorage1 aZhang, Yuemei1 aLi, Dapeng1 aLuo, Yongkang0 tFood microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 62 p.106-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2016.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245009300179300001600272500000900288500001500297520179500312592002802107650001402135650002002149650002102169650002802190650001302218650002802231650001802259650002302277653001702300653002602317700001802343773012002361852000902481856009802490655001202588IND8904204220221123041645.0191122e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890420422DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1989.0011183X002900030033x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViands, D.

A cultivar susceptible to anthracnose, Race 1 (caused by Colletotrichum trifolii Bain) yielded more forage than did two resistant cultivars under field conditions when Verticillium wilt (caused by Verticillium albo-atrum Reinke & Berth.) was severe in the field stands. Suspected negative association between resistances to these two diseases prompted two experiments under environmentally controlled conditions to explore this hypothesis. In an alfalfa population with variability for both disease resistances, no relationship was found (r = −0.07, P > 0.05) between resistances to the two diseases evaluated independently on different ramets of 58 replicated clones from stem cuttings. In a second population having more variability for resistance to anthracnose than the first population, no relationship was detected (r = −0.05, P < 0.05) among 75 half-sib progenies. Selecting the most resistant plants for one disease usually did not significantly alter the resistance level to the second disease. Therefore, breeders need not be concerned about these inadvertent changes if population size is sufficient to avoid genetic drift. Because the Verticillium wilt resistance in both populations was derived from ‘Vertus’, this conclusion should not be generalized for all sources of resistance.

Understanding these factors and how they are interrelated can help managers prevent undesirable ecological impacts, especially in areas without formal trails and visitor sites. This study examines the relationship between levels of visitor use and spatial patterns of visitor behavior at a variety of backcountry recreation destinations. Current assumptions in both the literature and simulation modeling efforts assume that visitor behavior either does not change with use level or that visitors are more likely to disperse at high levels of visitor use. Using visitor counts and GPS tracks of visitor behavior in locations where visitors could disperse off-trail, we found that visitors' spatial behavior does vary with visitor use level in some recreation settings, however the patterns of visitor behavior observed in this study are sometimes contrary to current generalizations. When visitor behavior does vary with use level, visitors are dispersing more at low levels of visitor use not when use level is high. Overall, these findings suggest that in certain situations the amount of visitor use at a recreation destination may be a less important driver of ecological change than visitor behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aglobal positioning systems 3arecreation areas 3asimulation models 3asocial factors 0aGPS tracking 0aVisitor behavior 0aRecreation management 0aDispersed recreation 0aVisitor use levels1 aMonz, Christopher0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 170 p.79-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245006800179300001800247500000900265500001500274520119700289592002801486650001401514650001301528650001801541650001401559650002001573653001001593700001901603700001801622700001801640773012401658852000901782856009801791655001201889IND8906317920221119163057.0191122e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890631792DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1989.0011183X002900050022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaxena, K.

Millsp.] cultivars have excessive vegetative growth and are not amenable to efficient crop management practices such as foliar insecticide application and mechanized field production. This study was conducted at the ICRISAT Center in India to characterize three easily distinguishable dwarf pigeonpea phenotypes (D₆, PD₁, and PBNA) with respect to some morphological traits and to study the inheritance patterns for dwarfing genes. Six crosses involving the dwarf lines and tall cultivars were studied. In 1986, the parents, F₁, and F₂ generations were grown and in the following year, testcrosses and F₃ progenies were evaluated along with their respective parents. Each population was phenotypically classified relative to parental type as tall or dwarf. The chi-square analyses showed that the dwarf phenotype in each of the three lines was controlled by a single recessive gene in homozygous state. The D₆ and PD₁ lines had similar alleles (t₃t₃) whereas PBNA had a different allele (tʰ₃tʰ₃) for dwarfness, which was recessive to the D₆/PD₁ allele, thus constituting a multiple allelic series.

Three different types of biochars, i.e., pistachio shells (PI), pecan shells (PE) and sawdust (SD) are used as feedstock in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) of a type: Biochar|Co–CeO₂/YSZ/Ag|Air. All samples were characterized by means of chemical composition (ultimate/proximate analysis), mercury porosimetry, N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms (BET method), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), to obtain a close correlation between cell performance and biochar characteristics. The electrochemical measurements reveal that the optimum performance, in terms of maximum power density (Pₘₐₓ), is obtained for the PI biochar, which demonstrated a power output of 15.5 mW cm⁻² at 800 °C, compared to 14 and 10 mW cm⁻² for PE and SD biochars, respectively. The obtained cell performance results are interpreted on the basis of biochar physicochemical characteristics and AC impedance spectroscopy studies. The superior performance of PI biochar is attributed to a synergistic effect of several physicochemical characteristics, involving the porosity, the acidity, the volatile matter, the carbon and hydrogen content as well as the population of oxygenated surface functionalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afeedstocks 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3apecan shells 3apistachios 3aporosimetry 3aporosity 3aproximate composition 3asawdust 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry1 aKaklidis, Nikolaos1 aMarnellos, George E.1 aZaharaki, Dimitra1 aKomnitsas, K.q(Kostas),0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 28, v. 5, no. 90 p.73399-73409dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra13409a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245009200207300002000299506007600319520071100395592002801106506003701134650002001171650002501191650001401216650002001230650001401250650001101264650001101275651001201286653002001298653002001318653001901338653001301357700002301370700002001393700001501413700001901428700002001447700002301467700002701490700002301517700001901540700001801559700002201577700002201599700002401621700002601645700002101671700002501692700001901717700002501736700001701761700002401778700002201802700001701824700002601841700002001867700002201887700002101909700001901930700002501949700001901974773017601993856007902169852000902248655001202257IND60173852520221207112913.0150603e20131022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017385252DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13086321102doi7 aPMC38086462pmcid7 a240821202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolt, Kathryn E.10aTracking the establishment of local endemic populations of an emergent enteric pathogen  ap. 17522-17527.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aShigella sonnei is a human-adapted pathogen that is emerging globally as the dominant agent of bacterial dysentery.

In this study, the effects of the running-in process and temperature on the lubricating performance of CPSO were investigated. The superlubricity of Si₃N₄/sapphire lubricated with CPSO was realized at >190 °C after H⁺-ion running-in. The mechanism of this high-temperature superlubricity was investigated by determining the stable adsorption configurations and adsorption energies of CPSO on different surfaces using density functional theory calculations. Compared with that on the Si₃N₄ surface, the adsorption capacity of CPSO on the hydroxylated SiO₂ surface generated by H⁺-ion running-in increased, whereas the steric hindrance decreased. The viscosity–temperature curve of CPSO was measured, wherein the viscosity and pressure–viscosity coefficient of CPSO considerably decreased with increasing temperature, leading to high-temperature superlubricity in a wide speed/load range. This is the first paper to report oil-based superlubricity at temperatures of 190 °C, or even higher-temperature conditions. Furthermore, it provides guidance for the use of ceramic–CPSO systems in high-temperature conditions, including in the aerospace industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a51425502cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a52175176cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2202020cNatural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipalitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004826 3aadsorption 3aceramics 3adensity functional theory 3afriction 3ahydroxylation 3aindustry 3aoils 3asilicone 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aBai, Pengpeng1 aMeng, Yonggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8274-51311 aMa, Liran1 aTian, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7742-56110 tLangmuir.g2022 Aug. 02, v. 38, no. 32 p.10043-10051dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c015233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245009200205300001800297506007600315520081800391592002801209506003701237650001301274650002001287650001801307700002001325700002101345773011001366856007401476852000901550655001201559IND60478927020221207123414.0160116e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047892702DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.123592doi7 aPMC47156542pmcid7 a262430502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabourin, Jeremy A.12aA permutation approach for selecting the penalty parameter in penalized model selection  ap. 1185-1194.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a simple, computationally efficient, permutation‐based procedure for selecting the penalty parameter in LASSO‐penalized regression.

We briefly discuss connections between permutation selection and existing theory for the LASSO. In addition, we present a simulation study and an analysis of real biomedical data sets in which permutation selection is compared with selection based on the following: cross‐validation (CV), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), scaled sparse linear regression, and a selection method based on recently developed testing procedures for the LASSO.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiometry 3adata collection 3alinear models1 aValdar, William1 aNobel, Andrew B.0 tBiometrics.g2015 Dec., v. 71, no. 4 p.1185-1194dInternational Biometric Society, etc.]x0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.123593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245009200208300002000300520144000320592002801760650001501788650001101803650001201814650001401826650003001840650001101870650001301881650001801894650001401912650001101926650002301937650001901960650001201979700002501991700002202016700002502038700006102063700002702124700002502151700006202176773013802238856008002376852000902456655001202465IND60649680620221122190710.0190705e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064968062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b032742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShields, Ashley E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1008-524214aThe Impact of Coordination Environment on the Thermodynamic Stability of Uranium Oxides  ap. 15985-15995.  aAmorphous uranium oxides are known to arise via industrial processes relevant to the nuclear fuel cycle yet evade rigorous structural characterization. A promising approach is to develop statistical relationships between uranium–oxygen coordination environments and thermodynamic stability from which general statements about the likelihood of observing particular U–O arrangements can be made. The number of known crystalline uranium oxides is insufficient to build statistical relationships. We have developed a database of theoretical compounds using genetic algorithms with the density functional theory as a foundation to analyze coordination geometries in the uranium–oxygen phase space. We draw fundamental insights into the nature of uranium–oxygen interactions by correlating total energy with the coordination environment. The most stable configuration of U cations with O anions is in an environment with coordination numbers 5–8 in a cubic configuration. Higher and lower coordination numbers are observed only in metastable phases. General trends are observable in the relationships between the coordination number, density, and uranium fraction in each structure. The new insight into uranium coordination enabled by these analyses is foundational for further studies into the characteristic properties of individual uranium oxide materials and for elucidation of potential oxidation pathways for uranium metal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanions 3acations 3adatabases 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3ageometry 3anuclear fuels 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3aphysical chemistry 3athermodynamics 3auranium1 aMiskowiec, Andrew J.1 aMaheshwari, Ketan1 aKirkegaard, Marie C.1 aStaros, Daniel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4317-35991 aNiedziela, Jennifer L.1 aKapsimalis, Roger J.1 aAnderson, Brian B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0675-97500 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 June 05, v. 123, no. 26 p.15985-15995dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b032743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245010300160520185800263592002802121650001202149650002002161650001802181650002902199650002102228650001202249650001502261650004302276650001602319650003302335650001002368650001602378650002802394650001202422651001302434773011702447856007502564852000902639655001202648IND60649730420221117235359.0190705e20161208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064973042DNAL7 a10.3390/land50400432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeus, Dorothea10aIntegration of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat Data for Land Cover and Forest Mapping in Northern Tanzania  aLand cover and forest mapping supports decision makers in the course of making informed decisions for implementation of sustainable conservation and management plans of the forest resources and environmental monitoring. This research examines the value of integrating of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat data for improved forest and land cover mapping in Northern Tanzania. A separate and joint processing of surface reflectance, backscattering and derivatives (i.e., Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Radar Forest Deforestation Index (RFDI), quotient bands, polarimetric features and Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures) were executed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The classification accuracy was assessed using a confusion matrix, where Overall classification Accuracy (OA), Kappa Coefficient (KC), Producer’s Accuracy (PA), User’s Accuracy (UA) and F<inf>1</inf> score index were computed. A two sample t-statistics was utilized to evaluate the influence of different data categories on the classification accuracy. Landsat surface reflectance and derivatives show an overall classification accuracy (OA = 86%). ALOS PALSAR backscattering could not differentiate the land cover classes efficiently (OA = 59%). However, combination of backscattering, and derivatives could differentiate the land cover classes properly (OA = 71%). The attained results suggest that integration of backscattering and derivative has potential of utilization for mapping of land cover in tropical environment. Integration of backscattering, surface reflectance and their derivative increase the accuracy (OA = 97%). Therefore it can be concluded that integration of ALOS PALSAR and optical data improve the accuracies of land cover and forest mapping and hence suitable for environmental monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adecision making 3adeforestation 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aforest resources 3aforests 3aland cover 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apolarimetry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aradar 3areflectance 3asupport vector machines 3atropics 3aTanzania0 tLand.g2016 Dec. 08, v. 5, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land50400433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245015100168300001400319520205700333592002802390650001902418650002102437650001102458650001802469650001002487650001502497650001702512650001902529650002102548650002002569650001102589650002102600650001902621650001302640650001202653650001702665650001902682650001902701653001502720653002002735653002302755653002402778653001202802653001302814700002402827773011302851856008402964852000903048655001203057IND60535451620221119180844.0190403e20150531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053545162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYarami, Najmeh10aPhysiological growth and gas exchange response of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) to irrigation water salinity, manure application and planting method  ap. 43-51.  aThe objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of irrigation water salinity, cow manure levels and different planting methods on saffron growth rate and gas exchange. A split-split plot arrangement was conducted in randomized complete block design with irrigation water salinity levels (0.45 (fresh water, S1), 1.0 (S2), 2.0 (S3), and 3.0 (S4) dSm−1) as the main plot, cow manure levels (30 (F1) and 60 (F2) Mgha−1) as the subplot and planting method (basin (P1) and in-furrow (P2)) as the sub-subplot in three replications. Results showed that initial amount of planted corms were degraded by using saline water (EC higher than 2.0dSm−1) in the basin planting method and under F1 and F2 cow manure levels in consecutive growing seasons; however, we observed an acceptable increase in corm growth in high salinity levels (S3 and S4) under the in-furrow planting method. Assessment of the ratio of corm DW to the leaf DM showed that corms propagation were higher in the first year; however, in the second year higher weight proportions of dry matter were allocated to the leaves. Maximum saffron LAI and crop growth rate (CGR) decreased significantly as about 26% by using the highest water salinity level and these parameters increased as 37 and 61%, respectively by using the in-furrow planting method. Higher cow manure (F2) also increased LAI and CGR by 16 and 13%, respectively. Results of gas exchange parameters showed that photosynthesis rate (An) decreased as about 32% in the highest water salinity level. Higher manure application increased the An as about 18%. Also, An increased significantly by 29% under the in-furrow planting method compared with that in the basin. An was 17% higher in the second year than that in the first year and the conversion rate of photosynthetic production to shoot dry weight for developed saffron increased by about 47% due to leaf area index increase. High salt sensitivity of saffron could be remediated by using the in-furrow planting method and higher cow manure application rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocus sativus 3aapplication rate 3abasins 3acattle manure 3acorms 3afreshwater 3agas exchange 3agrowing season 3airrigation water 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3amanure spreading 3aphotosynthesis 3aplanting 3asaffron 3asaline water 3asalt tolerance 3awater salinity 0aCow manure 0aGrowth analysis 0aIn-furrow planting 0aPhotosynthesis rate 0aSaffron 0aSalinity1 aSepaskhah, Ali Reza0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 May 31, v. 154 p.43-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007100148245008700219300001600306520181100322592002802133650001102161650001202172650001602184650000902200650002402209650000902233650000902242650001602251650001602267650001002283650002502293651001002318651001302328651001002341700002402351773013302375856008302508852000902591655001202600IND60751216320221122103521.0220225e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075121632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-021-03767-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoldesenbet, Tekalegn Ayele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1287-194910aAnalysis of climatic trends in the upper Blue Nile basin based on homogenized data  ap. 767-780.  aThe headwater region of the upper Blue Nile is the main source of the Nile water for the three Eastern Nile countries, namely Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt. Climate-related studies for the region is thus paramount. However, previous studies for the region used non-homogenous data, and did not remove all the significant autocorrelations in trend analysis. Therefore, this study analyzed the trend using gap-filled and homogenized meteorological data over the period 1980 − 2017. Using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test adjusted by effective sample size, the influence of all significant positive and negative autocorrelations on the trend was removed. Sen’s slope was used to determine the magnitude of trends. The tests were applied to minimum and maximum temperatures, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR), and total precipitation as well as seasonal and annual extreme climate indices. In general, the climate in the study region has become wetter and warmer. As for extreme temperature, the hot ends of the daily temperature distribution have altered more rapidly than the cold ends. Accordingly, the DTR exhibited a consistent increasing trend across the stations. The rainfall showed increases in maximum 1 − day precipitation amount, maximum 5 − day precipitation amount, number of heavy precipitation days, total annual rainfall, and extremely wet days. As trend magnitudes of the homogenized series differed from those of the original series, the results that emerged from the previous hydroclimate-related studies for the region using non-homogenized data should be revised. This study has significant implications for water use efficiency and adaptation to climate risk in the three riparian countries, given the recently commenced water resources projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3acold 3ameteorological data 3arain 3arisk 3asample size 3atemperature 3awater 3awater use efficiency 3aEgypt 3aEthiopia 3aSudan1 aElagib, Nadir Ahmed0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2021 Oct., v. 146, no. 1-2 p.767-780dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-021-03767-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016200167300001600329520160200345592002801947596008601975596002202061596007102083650002502154650001902179650003002198650001702228650001002245650001002255650002102265650001702286650001602303650001402319650002102333650002602354650001102380700005902391700001802450700001902468700001702487700001802504700001702522773011802539856008302657852000902740655001202749IND60776458220221120131119.0220506e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077645822DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-022-00952-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLailaja, V.

The risks associated with current clinical preparations demand screening for novel ASNases. Accordingly, the study was conducted to shortlist ASNases having clinically safer profiles from a novel niche, namely, microbes in the gut and hemolymph of apparently healthy Scylla serrata. A four-step strategic approach incorporating the essential requirements for clinically safer profiles was followed. The initial step through plate assay showed five (9.61%) potential ASNase producers. The relative prevalence of ASNase producers was higher in hemolymph (13.33%) than gut (4.5%). The positive isolates were identified as Priestia aryabhattai, Priestia megaterium, Bacillus altitudinis, Shewanella decolorationis, and Chryseomicrobium amylolyticum. Quantitative profiles revealed high ASNase production (114.29 to 287.36 U/mL) without any optimization, with an added advantage of the extracellular production. The second step for substrate specificity studies revealed the absence of L-glutaminase and urease activities in ASNases from C. amylolyticum and P. megaterium, the most desirable properties for safe clinical applications. This is the first report of glutaminase and urease-free ASNase from these two bacteria. The third step ensured type II nature of selected ASNases, the targeted form in clinical applications. The fourth step confirmed the activity and stability in human physiological conditions. Altogether, the results revealed two potential ASNases with clinically compatible profiles.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 441/2020/KSCSTEcKerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment  aMBT/HLT/23cCMFRI  aCSIR-UGC JRFcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India 3aBacillus altitudinis 3aScylla serrata 3aShewanella decolorationis 3aasparaginase 3ablood 3acrabs 3adigestive system 3adrug therapy 3aglutaminase 3ahemolymph 3ahuman physiology 3asubstrate specificity 3aurease1 aSumithra, T.

In our study, plant starch residue analysis suggests that the occupants of Pigeon Mountain (Locality QG10) exploited several edible plant resources including cereals, legumes, nuts, and underground storage organs (USOs). A post-hunting-gathering living style could be observed, with advanced plant processing techniques, but without any cultivation. Here we propose an Organized Food Supply system, to interpret the development of cereal utilization in this part of North China in prehistory. In this system, the occupants gathered various edible plant materials, including a large proportion of cereals, returned to their base camp, processed and consumed them but left a surplus for the future consumption and logistic needs for each fieldwork team. On this model, they were reaping wild plants but were not sowing them as future crops. Among the food materials, cereals are easily prepared, stored, and transported, and were thus one of the first choices of high-mobility fieldwork teams. This strategy is more significant in arid or semi-arid environments because of the difficulty of instant food acquisition, and subsequently influenced the occupants’ exploitation of plant resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3adiet 3afood availability 3afood plants 3agrains 3alegumes 3amodels 3anuts 3apigeons 3asemiarid zones 3asowing 3astarch 3astorage organs 3awild plants 3aChina 0aNorthwest China 0aPigeon mountain site 0aPlant residues 0aPaleolithic-Neolithic transition 0aAncient plant utilization1 aTian, Chuan1 aPeng, Fei1 aGuo, Jialong1 aWang, Huimin1 aZhou, Zhenyu1 aGao, Xing0 tQuaternary international.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 559 p.110-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245018500171300001600356520173700372592002802109650002102137650001502158650002702173650002302200650001702223650002202240650002102262650001902283650002002302650001102322650001602333650001502349650002502364653002702389653000802416653002702424653002602451653002802477653002902505700001602534700001802550700001802568700002202586773010502608856008402713852000902797655001202806IND60545850420221122085615.0160903e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054585042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivyalakshmi, P.10aInfluence of mechanical disintegration on the microbial growth of aerobic sludge biomass: A comparative study of ultrasonic and shear gap homogenizers by oxygen uptake measurements  ap. 180-185.  aWastewater treatment plant incorporates physical, chemical and biological processes to treat and remove the contaminants. The main drawback of conventional activated sludge process is the huge production of excess sludge, which is an unavoidable byproduct. The treatment and disposal of excess sludge costs about 60% of the total operating cost. The ideal way to reduce excess sludge production during wastewater treatment is by preventing biomass formation within the aerobic treatment train rather than post treatment of the generated sludge. In the present investigation two different mechanical devices namely, Ultrasonic and Shear Gap homogenizers have been employed to disintegrate the aerobic biomass. This study is intended to restrict the multiplication of microbial biomass and at the same time degrade the organics present in wastewater by increasing the oxidative capacity of microorganisms. The disintegrability on biomass was determined by biochemical methods. Degree of inactivation provides the information on inability of microorganisms to consume oxygen upon disruption. The soluble COD quantifies the extent of release of intra cellular compounds. The participation of disintegrated microorganism in wastewater treatment process was carried out in two identical respirometeric reactors. The results show that Ultrasonic homogenizer is very effective in the disruption of microorganisms leading to a maximum microbial growth reduction of 27%. On the other hand, Shear gap homogenizer does not favor the sludge growth reduction rather it facilitates the growth. This study also shows that for better microbial growth reduction, floc size reduction alone is not sufficient but also microbial disruption is essential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aaerobiosis 3achemical oxygen demand 3agrowth retardation 3ahomogenizers 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3aoperating costs 3aoxygen 3aultrasonics 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAerobic sludge biomass 0aCOD 0aUltrasonic homogenizer 0aShear gap homogenizer 0aSludge growth reduction 0aDegree of disintegration1 aMurugan, D.1 aSivarajan, M.1 aSaravanan, P.1 aLajapathi Rai, C.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2015 Nov., v. 121 p.180-185dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013000167300001800297520181600315592002802131650002702159650001702186650001902203650001302222650002002235650001102255650000902266650001202275650002002287773010202307856008502409852000902494655001202503IND60532018320221122153439.0160726e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053201832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.5b002192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guangyu10aMolecular Basis for Fe(III)-Independent Curcumin Potentiation of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Activity  ap. 2828-2840.  aCurcumin potentiates the phosphorylation-dependent activity of human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in Fe³⁺-dependent and Fe³⁺-independent manners. Although the Fe³⁺-dependent curcumin potentiation results from removal of endogenous inhibitory Fe³⁺ at the interface of the regulatory (R) domain and intracellular loop (ICL) 3, the molecular mechanism of Fe³⁺-independent curcumin potentiation is still unknown. Here, HEK-293T cells cultured in an Fe³⁺-containing medium were transiently transfected with CFTR constructs, and the role of a highly conserved ICL1/ICL4 interface and a stimulatory phosphorylation site S795 or S813 at the C-terminus of the R domain in this potentiation pathway was investigated. The results showed that highly conserved aromatic and positively charged residues at the ICL1/ICL4 interface and phosphorylation site S813 were sensitive to curcumin regardless of whether Fe³⁺ and nucleotide-binding domain 2 were removed. More importantly, spontaneous disulfide cross-linking between curcumin-sensitive ICL1 and S795 was observed to be enough to promote channel opening as curcumin did. Therefore, the phosphorylated R domain, once released from ICL3, may function as a length- and gating-regulatory cross-linker between two transmembrane domains to promote the stimulatory interactions between the R domain and the ICL1/ICL4 interface. Curcumin may potentiate CFTR activity not only by removing inhibitory Fe³⁺ to release the R domain from ICL3 but also by stabilizing the stimulatory R–ICL1/ICL4 interactions. Therefore, the future potentiators with two linked aromatic rings could utilize this potentiation pathway to bypass the need for ATP to rescue the activity of cystic fibrosis mutants with an ATP-dependent gating defect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acrosslinking 3acultured cells 3acurcumin 3acystic fibrosis 3ahumans 3airon 3amutants 3aphosphorylation0 tBiochemistry.g2015 May 12, v. 54, no. 18 p.2828-2840dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.5b002193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04068naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015000168300001800318520220400336592002802540650002202568650001502590650001302605650001702618650000902635650002002644650001302664650003002677650001602707650001302723650001502736650001802751650000702769650000902776650002402785650001102809650000902820650001902829650000902848650001502857650002802872650001502900651000902915653001902924653002502943653002102968653001802989653002403007700001403031700002103045700002503066700001503091700002703106700002603133700002603159700001903185773011903204856008603323852000903409655001203418IND60788967920221120044609.0220818e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078896792DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2021.18922122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yunzhi10aDeep learning and boosting framework for piping erosion susceptibility modeling: spatial evaluation of agricultural areas in the semi-arid region  ap. 4628-4654.  aPiping erosion is one of the water erosions that cause significant changes in the landscape, leading to environmental degradation. To prevent losses resulting from tube growth and enable sustainable development, developing high-precision predictive algorithms for piping erosion is essential. Boosting is a classic algorithm that has been successfully applied to diverse computer vision tasks. Therefore, this work investigated the predictive performance of the Boosted Linear Model (BLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Boosted Generalized Linear Model (Boost GLM), and Deep Boosting models for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in Zarandieh Watershed located in the Markazi province of Iran. A piping inventory map including 152 piping erosion locations was prepared for algorithm training and testing. 18 initial predisposing factors (altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from river, drainage density, distance from road, rainfall, land use, soil type, bulk density, CEC, pH, clay, silt, sand, topographical position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI)) was derived from multiple remote sensing (RS) sources to determine the piping erosion prone areas. The most significant predisposing factors were selected using multi-collinearity analysis which indicates linear correlations between predisposing factors. Finally, the results were evaluated for Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive values (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV), and Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve. The best Sensitivity (0.80), Specificity (0.84), PPV (0.85), NPV (0.79), and ROC (0.93), were obtained by Deep Boosting model. The results of the piping erosion susceptibility study in agricultural land use showed that 41% of agricultural lands are very sensitive to piping erosion. This outcome will enable natural resource managers and local planners to assess and take effective decisions to minimize damages to agricultural land use by accurately identifying the most vulnerable areas. Hence, this research proved Deep Boosting model’s ability for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in comparison to other popular methods such as BLM, BRT, and Boost GLM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3abulk density 3aclay 3acomputer vision 3adrainage 3aenvironmental degradation 3ainventories 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alinear models 3apH 3arain 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3asand 3asemiarid zones 3asilt 3asoil types 3asustainable development 3awatersheds 3aIran 0aPiping erosion 0aagriculture land use 0amachine learning 0adeep boosting 0aZarandieh watershed1 aChen, Wei1 aJanizadeh, Saeid1 aBhunia, Gouri Sankar1 aBera, Amit1 aPhạm, Quó̂c Bảo,1 aLinh, Nguyen Thi Thuy1 aBalogun, Abdul-Lateef1 aWang, Xiaojing0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Aug. 18, v. 37, no. 16 p.4628-4654dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.18922123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01196naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100003000153245008500183300001600268520040100284592002800685650002000713700001900733773011100752852000900863856008200872655001200954991560247460742620221122135002.0181030e197710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7791159922DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517577047010042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrančíiak, Jindřich V.14aThe Measurement of Swelling of Wool Fibers in Solvents by Laser-Beam Diffraction  ap. 662-665.  aThe diffraction of monochromatic light from a laser has been used for the measurement of the diameter of single wool fibers in liquids and mixtures of liquids.

Traditional taxonomy based on morphological characters can be misled by the presence of phenotypic plesiomorphism or adaptative convergence. The use of multiple locus genetic data appears thus as a powerful tool for recognizing species boundaries. In this study, we used six nuclear introns and two mitochondrial markers to conduct a phylogenetic study of the Myotis nattereri species complex in the Western Palearctic. We combined tree-based and non-tree-based analyses, and also used concatenated phylogenetic methods of the separated nuclear and mitochondrial dataset as well as a recent coalescence-based multilocus approach. The strong concordance between the results of the analyses conducted confirms that M. nattereri is a paraphyletic group that is composed of four well-differentiated lineages in the study area. In the framework of the unified species concept, these four clades can be confidently considered as four valid species. This recognition of new cryptic species in the Western Mediterranean region shows that the biodiversity of this well-studied area is still not fully understood.  aPublisher supplied data 3ataxonomy 3aloci 3aPalearctic region 3adata collection 3aChiroptera 3abiodiversity 3aintrons 3aparaphyly 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aChiropteraxgenetics 2aCluster Analysis 2aGenetic Locixgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGeography 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aMitochondriaxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoftware 2aSpecies Specificity 3aMediterranean region 0aArctic regions. 0aMediterranean Region 0aPalaearctic region1 aIbáñez, C.1 aJuste, J.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2011 Dec., v. 61, no. 3 p.888-898dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01707naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245012300205300001800328500001900346520052700365592002800892650001400920650002800934650001700962650002000979700005300999700001601052700001401068700001501082700005801097773012201155856008301277852000901360655001201369IND60713738020221119131604.0201023e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071373802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c029782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Guo-Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1342-621710aChiral Hydroxytetraphenylene–Boron Complex Catalyzed Asymmetric Diels–Alder Cycloaddition of 2′-Hydroxychalcones  ap. 8023-8027.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a(S)-2,15-Cl₂-DHTP–boron complex catalyst for the asymmetric Diels–Alder cycloaddition of 2′-hydroxychalcones and dienes was developed and tested.

Traditionally, wetlands are preserved by establishing nature reserves within them. However, the driving forces of estuarine wetland degradation change at different temporal and spatial scales, rendering it necessary to evaluate the entire river–delta–wetland system. We analyzed the links between management of the Yellow River (YR) and estuarine wetland conservation in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We measured changes in river runoff and sediment discharge from 1950, and spatial changes in the tail channels from 1855. Changes in the wetland areas of the entire delta, the natural reserves, and the river buffer areas were calculated. Finally, the effects of ecological water supplementation of the YR, mandated in 2008 by the Chinese government to protect estuarine wetlands, were also analyzed. The results indicated that not only the reductions in river runoff and sediment discharge, but also shifts in the tail channels, influenced estuarine wetlands. In addition, ecological water supplementation from the YR have improved wetland health. We suggest that increasing the connectivity between old and new rivers is important to improve the integrity of estuarine wetland ecosystems. Linking river management to estuarine wetland conservation would aid in the planning and improvement of the wetland network in the delta.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aplanning 3ariparian buffers 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3awetland conservation 3awetlands 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aRiver management 0aEstuarine wetland conservation 0aEcological water supplementation 0aWetland network 0aThe Yellow River Delta1 aLi, Yunzhao1 aWu, Ching-Ching,1 aGao, Meng1 aWu, Xiaoqing1 aBi, Xiaoli0 tOcean & coastal management.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 146 p.43-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245011900177300001800296520131900314592002801633650001201661650001501673650001101688650001301699650001701712650001001729650002301739650002501762650001701787650001901804650001101823700001601834773010301850856008901953852000902042655001202051IND60534251520221118173802.0160802e20150521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053425152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b002442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZandavi, Seyed
Hadi10aCharacterization of the Pore Structure and Surface Properties of Shale Using the Zeta Adsorption Isotherm Approach  ap. 3004-3010.  aThe determination of the specific surface area and pore structure parameters of natural materials have been a long-standing issue. We propose a method for determining the specific surface area and pore size distribution that is based on the zeta adsorption isotherm and apply that method for each of two hydrocarbon vapors, octane and heptane, adsorbing on two types of shale, as-received and milled shale. We determined the specific surface areas of both materials, approximate the pores as cylindrical, and determine the average pore mouth radius. The standard deviation in the mean values of the specific surface areas and average pore radius determined with each of the two vapors is less than 3%. The experimental isotherms on the as-received shale indicate the existence of a pronounced adsorption–desorption hysteresis loop that results from the mesoporous structure of the material. We previously showed that liquid forms in the pores because of coalescence of molecular clusters inside the pores. In this study, we show that the pore emptying in the as-received shale is delayed because of the pore blocking effect. The zeta isotherm theory and the necessary conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium along with the measured amount adsorbed are used to determine the distribution in the pore mouth radii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheptane 3ahysteresis 3aoctane 3aporosity 3aporous media 3ashale 3asorption isotherms 3astatistical analysis 3asurface area 3athermodynamics 3avapors1 aWard, C.

This instability can initiate and develop cancer. This study evaluated genomic stability in methotrexate and anthocyanin-treated mammary adenocarcinoma model. Seventy albino mice were divided into seven groups: negative control, anthocyanin, methotrexate, Ehrlich’s solid tumor; Ehrlich’s solid tumor and methotrexate; Ehrlich’s solid tumor and anthocyanin; and Ehrlich’s solid tumor, methotrexate, and anthocyanin groups. RESULTS: Tumor weight and size were evaluated. Serum arylesterase activity was low in all the induced tumors and those treated with anthocyanin, methotrexate, or both. Poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose] polymerase activity was high, and glutathione S-transferase activity was low in the tumors treated with anthocyanin, methotrexate, or both, compared with that of the untreated tumor. There was an increase in DNA damage in the mice with solid tumors and those injected with methotrexate or methotrexate and anthocyanin, compared with that in the untreated mice. CONCLUSIONS: There was a decrease in genetic instability and DNA damage in the tumor-bearing mice treated with anthocyanin, with a concomitant increase in nuclear poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose] polymerase activity, compared with those of the untreated group. Anthocyanin exerted positive effects in the treatment of mammary adenocarcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aadenocarcinoma 3aalbino 3aanthocyanins 3aarylesterase 3ablood serum 3agenetic instability 3agenetic stability 3agenomics 3aglutathione transferase 3amethotrexate 3amodels 3anutrition1 aIbrahim, Rana M.1 aEl-hefnawy, Gad B.1 aIbrahim, Wafaa M.1 aAli, Ehab M.0 tGenes & nutrition.g2022 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.6-6dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001235x1555-89327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12263-022-00709-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011200175520108100287592002801368650001201396650001401408650002201422650001701444650001901461650001301480650001001493650003201503653001101535653002401546653001901570653002001589653001801609653001701627700001501644700001801659700001601677700001501693773010801708856008601816852000901902655001201911IND60772205220221119112603.0220426e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077220522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1193612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Calderón, P.12aA structural study of the self-association of different starches in presence of bacterial cellulose fibrils  aA multi-analytical study was performed to analyse the effect of bacterial cellulose (BCF) on the self-association of starches with different amylose content (wheat, waxy-maize), assessing macrostructural properties (rheology, gel strength) and some nano and sub-nano level features (small and wide-angle X-ray scattering). Although pasting viscosities and G′ were significantly increased by BCF in both starches, cellulose did not seem to promote the self-association of amylose in short-range retrogradation. A less elastic structure was reflected by a 2–3-fold increase in loss factor (G″/G′) at the highest BCF concentration tested. This behavior agreed with the nano and sub-nano characterisation of the samples, which showed loss of starch lamellarity and incomplete full recovery of an ordered structure after storage at 4 °C for 24 h. The gel strength data could be explained by the contribution of BCF to the mechanical response of the sample. The information gained in this work is relevant for tuning the structure of tailored starch-cellulose composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3acellulose 3acellulose fibrils 3agel strength 3aretrogradation 3arheology 3awheat 3awide-angle X-ray scattering 0aStarch 0aBacterial cellulose 0aRetrogradation 0aViscoelasticity 0aNanostructure 0aGel strength1 aSimone, E.1 aTyler, A.I.I.1 aEnrione, J.1 aFoster, T.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 July 15, v. 288 p.119361-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1193613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014800164300001100312520137000323592002801693596005901721596005901780596007301839596005401912596005801966596007202024596007202096650002102168650001302189650001802202650002302220650002502243650001002268650001602278650002402294650001702318650001502335650002802350650001502378650000702393650001302400650003202413650001502445650002502460700001302485700001402498700001602512700001302528700001602541700005802557773011802615856008302733852000902816655001202825IND60712773120221120213015.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071277312DNAL7 a10.1186/s13068-020-01734-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Mingcan10aPre-concentration of microalga Euglena gracilis by alkalescent pH treatment and flocculation mechanism of Ca3(PO4)2, Mg3(PO4)2, and derivatives  ap. 98.  aBACKGROUND: Microalgae are widely be used in carbon sequestration, food supplements, natural pigments, polyunsaturated fatty acids, biofuel applications, and wastewater treatment. However, the difficulties incurred in algae cell separation and harvesting, and the exorbitant cost required to overcome these challenges, are the primary limitations to large-scale industrial application of microalgae technology. RESULTS: Herein, we explore the potential of inducing flocculation by adjusting the pH for pre-concentrating Euglena gracilis. Our results demonstrate that flocculation can be induced by increasing the medium pH to 8.5; however, most of the algae cells were broken by increasing the pH > 10. Magnesium phosphate, calcium phosphate, and their derivatives precipitation jointly led to flocculation, although calcium phosphate and its derivatives precipitation had a greater effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that pH treatment-induced flocculation is efficient and feasible for the pre-concentration of E. gracilis under a pilot-scale culture system. Moreover, it also maintained the microalgae cells’ integrity, chlorophyll production, and increased paramylon production. These findings provide a theoretical basis for reducing the cost of large-scale E. gracilis harvesting; as well as provide a reference for harvesting other microalgae.  aPublisher supplied data  a31670116cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41876188cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGui Ke AA18242047cGuangxi Innovation Drive Development Special Fund  a2018YFA0902500cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2014ZT05S078cGuangdong Innovation Research Team Fund  aJCYJ20160308095910917cShenzhen Grant Plan for Science & Technology  aJCYJ20170818100339597cShenzhen Grant Plan for Science & Technology 3aEuglena gracilis 3abiofuels 3abiotechnology 3acalcium phosphates 3acarbon sequestration 3acells 3achlorophyll 3adietary supplements 3aflocculation 3aharvesting 3aindustrial applications 3amicroalgae 3apH 3apigments 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aseparation 3awastewater treatment1 aLi, Jing1 aQin, Huan1 aLei, Anping1 aZhu, Hui1 aHu, Zhangli1 aWang, Jiangxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9917-067X0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.98-98dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-020-01734-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245011000178300001800288520114300306592002801449653002301477653003701500653003601537653002301573653001301596700002001609773009201629856008601721852000901807655001201816IND60555347820221119023209.0161103e20160922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055534782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chembiol.2016.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKudithipudi, Srikanth10aApproaches and Guidelines for the Identification of Novel Substrates of Protein Lysine Methyltransferases  ap. 1049-1055.  aProtein lysine methylation is emerging as a general post-translational modification (PTM) with essential functions regulating protein stability, activity, and protein-protein interactions. One of the outstanding challenges in this field is linking protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) with specific substrates and lysine methylation events in a systematic manner. Inability to validate reported PKMT substrates delayed progress in the field and cast unnecessary doubt about protein lysine methylation as a truly general PTM. Here, we aim to provide a concise guide to help avoid some of the most common pitfalls in studies searching for new PKMT substrates and propose a set of seven basic biochemical rules: (1) include positive controls; (2) use target lysine mutations of substrate proteins as negative controls; (3) use inactive enzyme variants as negative controls; (4) report quantitative methylation data; (5) consider PKMT specificity; (6) validate methyl lysine antibodies; and (7) connect cellular and in vitro results. We explain the logic behind them and discuss how they should be implemented in the experimental work.  aPublisher supplied data 0alysine methylation 0aprotein lysine methyltransferase 0apost-translational modification 0aenzyme specificity 0aproteome1 aJeltsch, Albert0 tCell Chemical Biology.g2016 Sept. 22, v. 23 p.1049-1055dElsevier Ltdx2451-94567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2016.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007700154300001400231520113300245592002801378650001301406650001501419650001101434650001301445650001301458700001601471700002201487700001601509700001501525773013801540856007401678852000901752655001201761IND60765219820221121233150.0220422e20120207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076521982DNAL7 a10.17221/4881-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerák, D.10aKinematical characteristic of mechanical frictional variable speed drive  ap. 61-68.  aThe paper describes a new system of mechanical spherical conical friction drive. In the present a row of simple friction, belt, chain, wave and differential variable speed drives is published. For the required range of speed variation they are altogether unfit. The currently used power transmissions are of low efficiency (60&ndash;70%). Therefore the better power transmission efficiency is required. The possibility of multicontact power transmission appears as the most suitable principle of the power transmission. Using the designed function model, which was made according to the small tractor producers requirements, the real output kinematical characteristic was measured. It is derived the complete drive conversion unit kinematics and the theoretical kinematical characteristic design. The theoretical design is compared with the real characteristic determined by measuring using the test station. From the measured values we determined that the geometrical characteristic, i.e. the relation between output speed and ring position, corresponds in the ring position range (2.8&divide;14) mm to the theoretical premise.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3akinematics 3amodels 3aresearch 3atractors1 aŠleger, V.1 aChotěborský, R.1 aHouška, K.1 aJanča, E.0 tResearch in Agricultural Engineering.g, v. 52, no. 2 p.61-68dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21420x1212-91517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4881-rae3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010000157300002200257520111900279592002801398650002101426650001301447650001301460650002801473650002101501650001701522650001101539650001301550650002201563650001401585650002201599650001301621700001301634700001601647773012701663856007401790852000901864655001201873IND60669495120221118002723.0190920e20151214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066949512DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21777f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Fangxin10aResearch progress on design strategies, synthesis and performance of LiMn₂O₄-based cathodes  ap. 105248-105258.  aSpinel LiMn₂O₄ (LMO)-based composites, due to their combination of low toxicity, abundant natural resources, and excellent electrochemical performance, are regarded as promising candidate cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. Current energy storage demands are not being met with existing materials, however, because of their defects, such as fast capacity fading, low rate capability, and low specific capacity in practical applications. Manganese dissolution during electrochemical processes bears the major responsibility for capacity loss, apart from the electrolyte factor. Low electrical conductivity, low ionic diffusion efficiency, and large structural variation have adverse effects on the electrochemical performance of materials. With respect to these drawbacks, significant progress has been made recently on optimizing the performance of LMO-based cathode materials. In this work, we review recent progress in 1 structural design, designing composites with graphene/carbon nanotubes, crystalline doping, and coatings for improving the electrochemical performance of these cathode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acathodes 3acoatings 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3amanganese 3anatural resources 3atoxicity1 aGuo, Wei1 aMa, Jianmin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Dec. 14, v. 5, no. 127 p.105248-105258dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21777f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009300164300001600257520188600273592002802159650001602187650002002203650002602223650002502249650000902274650001002283650002002293650001102313650001102324650001402335650002302349650001102372650001602383650001802399650002302417653001602440653001702456653001402473653002402487700001702511700001802528700001902546700005502565773010002620856008102720852000902801655001202810IND60557192720221120232158.0190405e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055719272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2016.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jung Eun10aMicrobial decontamination of onion powder using microwave-powered cold plasma treatments  ap. 112-123.  aThe effects of microwave-integrated cold plasma (CP) treatments against spores of Bacillus cereus and Aspergillus brasiliensis and Escherichia coli O157:H7 on onion powder were investigated. The growth of B. cereus, A. brasiliensis, and E. coli O157:H7 in the treated onion powder was assessed during storage at 4 and 25 °C, along with the physicochemical and sensory properties of the powder. Onion powder inoculated with B. cereus was treated with CP using helium as a plasma-forming gas, with simultaneous exposure to low microwave density at 170 mW m−2 or high microwave density at 250 mW m−2. High microwave density-CP treatment (HMCPT) was more effective than low microwave density-CP treatment (LMCPT) in inhibiting B. cereus spores, but induced the changes in the volatile profile of powder. Increase in treatment time in HMCPT yielded greater inhibition of B. cereus spores. Vacuum drying led to greater inhibition of spores of B. cereus and A. brasiliensis than hot-air drying. HMCPT at 400 W for 40 min, determined as the optimum conditions for B. cereus spore inhibition, initially reduced the numbers of B. cereus, A. brasiliensis, and E. coli O157:H7 by 2.1 log spores/cm2, 1.6 log spores/cm2, and 1.9 CFU/cm2, respectively. The reduced number of B. cereus spores remained constant, while the number of A. brasiliensis spores in the treated powder increased gradually during storage at 4 and 25 °C and was not different from the number of spores in untreated samples by the end of storage at 4 °C. The E. coli counts in the treated powder fell below the level of detection after day 21 at both temperatures. HMCPT did not affect the color, antioxidant activity, or quercetin concentration of the powder during storage at both temperatures. The microwave-integrated CPTs showed potential for nonthermal decontamination of onion powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aantioxidant activity 3acold 3acolor 3adecontamination 3ahelium 3aonions 3aquercetin 3asensory properties 3aspores 3atemperature 3avacuum drying 3avolatile compounds 0aCold plasma 0aOnion powder 0aMicrowave 0aFoodborne pathogens1 aOh, Yeong Ji1 aWon, Mee Yeon1 aLee, Kwang-Sik1 aMin, Sea C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1312-358X0 tFood microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 62 p.112-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2016.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245009400168300001600262520107100278592002801349650002601377650001301403650002601416650001501442650000901457650001301466650001901479650001901498700002101517700002101538700002501559700002101584700002201605700002201627700003101649700002501680773013001705856007501835852000901910655001201919IND60536801820180718000000.0160807e20141014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053680182DNAL7 a10.1021/ez500164v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon der Heyden, Bjorn P.10aUbiquitous Presence of Fe(II) in Aquatic Colloids and Its Association with Organic Carbon  ap. 387-392.  aDespite being thermodynamically less stable, small ferrous colloids (60 nm to 3 μm in diameter) remain an important component of the biogeochemical cycle at the Earth’s surface, yet their composition and structure and the reasons for their persistence are still poorly understood. Here we use X-ray-based Fe L-edge and carbon K-edge spectromicroscopy to address the speciation and organic–mineral associations of ferrous, ferric, and Fe-poor particles collected from sampling sites in both marine and freshwater environments. We show that Fe(II)-rich phases are prevalent throughout different aquatic regimes yet exhibit a high degree of chemical heterogeneity. Furthermore, we show that Fe-rich particles show strong associations with organic carbon. The observed association of Fe(II) particles with carboxamide functional groups suggests a possible microbial role in the preservation of Fe(II). These finding have significant implications for the behavior of Fe(II) colloids in oxygenated waters, and their role in different aquatic biogeochemical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acolloids 3aenvironmental science 3afreshwater 3airon 3amoieties 3aorganic carbon 3athermodynamics1 aHauser, Emily

Therefore, we monitored intake of folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin D and iron, their status markers, and diet quality from preconception to the second trimester of pregnancy, and we examined whether these dietary factors were associated with glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. We included 105 women aged 18&ndash;40 years with a desire to get pregnancy or who were already <24 weeks pregnant. Women at increased gestational diabetes (GDM) risk were oversampled. Measurements were scheduled at preconception (n = 67), and 12 (n =53) and 24 weeks of pregnancy (n =66), including a fasting venipuncture, 75-grams oral glucose tolerance test, and completion of a validated food frequency questionnaire. Changes in micronutrient intake and status, and associations between dietary factors and glucose homeostasis, were examined using adjusted repeated measures mixed models. Micronutrient intake of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin D and related status markers significantly changed throughout pregnancy, which was predominantly due to changes in the intake of supplements. Micronutrient intake or status levels were not associated with glucose homeostasis, except for iron intake (FE &micro;g/day) with fasting glucose (&beta; = &minus;0.069 mmol/L, p = 0.013) and HbA1c (&beta; = &minus;0.4843 mmol, p = 0.002). Diet quality was inversely associated with fasting glucose (&beta; = &minus;0.006 mmol/L for each DHD15-index point, p = 0.017). It was shown that micronutrient intakes and their status markers significantly changed during pregnancy. Only iron intake and diet quality were inversely associated with glucose homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood composition 3afasting 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3agestational diabetes 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3amodels 3anutritional adequacy 3apregnancy 3apyridoxine 3avitamin B12 3avitamin D 3awomen1 aGeelen, Anouk 1 aSamlal, Rahul  A.

Evidence from the Asia-Pacific region and North America  aThis paper explores how sustainability influences financial returns and economic development in the Asia-Pacific region and North America, utilizing real data empirically. It is controversial that sustainable activities are related to financial performance. For clarification, we tested hypotheses analyzing sustainability index, seven stock markets, financial data such as ROI, ROIC, and ROA from eleven companies, and GDP/GNI per capita, based on the Asia-Pacific region and North America. The results indicate that both financial return for companies and economic development in the two regions are positively germane to sustainable investment. Besides, we found evidence that sustainable investment impacts economic development based on variance decomposition analysis, depending on GDP per capita between the two regions. This implication will be interesting for both practitioners and researchers regarding the measurement of sustainable performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic development 3afinance 3astock exchange 3avariance 3aNorth America1 aLee, Sang Myung,0 tSustainability.g2018 Mar. 21, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100409093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245009200200506007600292520178500368592002802153506003702181650001502218650001102233650000902244650001002253650002002263650001202283650001802295650002002313650002402333650001802357650001602375650001102391650001302402650001002415650001402425650001202439650001002451650001302461650001602474650002402490650001702514650001302531650002702544650001002571650001202581700001602593700001802609700001502627700001702642700001302659700002002672700001602692700001402708700001902722700001702741700002402758700001702782773012102799856007302920852000902993655001203002IND60653004320221207082557.0190713e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065300432DNAL7 a10.3390/v110605152doi7 aPMC66313942pmcid7 a311674782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmer, Muhammad 10aGenomic, Morphological and Biological Traits of the Viruses Infecting Major Fruit Trees  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBanana trees, citrus fruit trees, pome fruit trees, grapevines, mango trees, and stone fruit trees are major fruit trees cultured worldwide and correspond to nearly 90% of the global production of woody fruit trees. In light of the above, the present manuscript summarizes the viruses that infect the major fruit trees, including their taxonomy and morphology, and highlights selected viruses that significantly affect fruit production, including their genomic and biological features. The results showed that a total of 163 viruses, belonging to 45 genera classified into 23 families have been reported to infect the major woody fruit trees. It is clear that there is higher accumulation of viruses in grapevine (80/163) compared to the other fruit trees (each corresponding to less than 35/163), while only one virus species has been reported infecting mango. Most of the viruses (over 70%) infecting woody fruit trees are positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA), and the remainder belong to the -ssRNA, ssRNA-RT, dsRNA, ssDNA and dsDNA-RT groups (each corresponding to less than 8%). Most of the viruses are icosahedral or isometric (79/163), and their diameter ranges from 16 to 80 nm with the majority being 25&ndash;30 nm. Cross-infection has occurred in a high frequency among pome and stone fruit trees, whereas no or little cross-infection has occurred among banana, citrus and grapevine. The viruses infecting woody fruit trees are mostly transmitted by vegetative propagation, grafting, and root grafting in orchards and are usually vectored by mealybug, soft scale, aphids, mites or thrips. These viruses cause adverse effects in their fruit tree hosts, inducing a wide range of symptoms and significant damage, such as reduced yield, quality, vigor and longevity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAphidoidea 3aCitrus 3aMusa 3aVitis 3aadverse effects 3abananas 3acitrus fruits 3across infection 3adouble-stranded RNA 3afruit growing 3afruit trees 3afruits 3agenomics 3ahosts 3alongevity 3amangoes 3amites 3aorchards 3apome fruits 3asingle-stranded DNA 3astone fruits 3ataxonomy 3avegetative propagation 3avigor 3aviruses1 aLiu, Jiwen 1 aYou, Huafeng 1 aXu, Chuan 1 aDong, Kaili 1 aLuo, Ni 1 aKong, Linghong 1 aLi, Xuepei 1 aHong, Ni 1 aWang, Guoping 1 aFan, Xudong 1 aKotta-Loizou, Ioly 1 aXu, Wenxing 0 tViruses.g2019 June 04, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110605153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005100151245010300202520118100305592002801486650000801514650002001522650001401542650001301556650001401569653001301583653001601596653005801612653002701670653002801697700001501725700001701740700001801757700001201775700001601787773009301803856008601896852000901982655001201991IND60735636420221117015458.0211123e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073563642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1224322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Man1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7133-913810aSimultaneous detection of tumor-related mRNA and miRNA in cancer cells with magnetic SERS nanotags  aThe design of simultaneous detection method has broad prospects for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Herein, we reported a low cost and sensitive SERS sensing platform for simultaneous p21 mRNA and miRNA-21 detection based on duplex-specific nuclease signal amplification (DSNSA) plus multifunctional Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ magnetic nanoparticles (Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ MNPs). Here, Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ MNPs were used as a separation substrate, and Au@AgNPs served as stable and ultrasensitive SERS nanotags. Firstly, Au@AgNPs and Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ MNPs were attached to both ends of capture probe (CP) by covalent bonds. Under the assistance of the target p21 mRNA and miRNA-21, DNA (CP) of the DNA-RNA heteroduplexes could be specifically degraded by DSN and the SERS nanotags that were released from the surface of Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ MNPs. Meanwhile, the target p21 mRNA and miRNA-21 were released and then involved in the next round of signal reactions. The proposed strategy allowed quantitative detection of p21 mRNA and miRNA-21 and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.12 fM and 0.17 fM, respectively. This method gives a great potential for multiplex detection of biological molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adetection limit 3amagnetism 3amicroRNA 3aprognosis 0ap21 mRNA 0amicroRNA-21 0aDuplex-specific nuclease signal amplification (DSNSA) 0aSimultaneous detection 0aThe SERS-Based platform1 aLi, Jingya1 aZhang, Xiang1 aYao, Mingming1 aLi, Pan1 aXu, Weiping0 tTalanta.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 232 p.122432-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1224323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01396naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245005900212300001600271520047700287592002800764650001800792650001400810650001100824700002100835700002400856773008800880856008200968990002301050852000901073655001201082IND60095058720221116160220.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009505872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diff.2012.06.0032doi7 aPMC34432922pmcid7 a227902082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaschko, Sarah D.10aMolecular mechanisms of external genitalia development  ap. 261-268.  aExternal genitalia development occurs through a combination of hormone independent, hormone dependent, and endocrine pathways.

These effects may be produced mathematically through the combination of a biochemically based submodel of CO₂ fixation in leaf chloroplasts with a physically based submodel of CO₂ and H₂O diffusion through leaf surfaces and atmospheric boundary layers. Water-deficit effects may be represented in both submodels. The behavior of a combined model was tested against data recorded under atmospheric CO₂ concentrations of 330 and 660 μmol mol⁻¹ in the Soil—Plant—Atmosphere Research Units at the University of Florida. The model reproduced changes in the quantum requirements of CO₂ fixation and in diurnal CO₂ fluxes of soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] leaves at these different concentrations. Simulated CO₂ fixation at midday responded more to increased CO₂ concentration at high irradiance (22.9 vs. 42.0 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ at 1050 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) than at low (17.1 vs. 19.7 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ at 330 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹), as found experimentally. Under water deficits (leaf water potential ψₗ = −1.55 MPa), light saturation of CO₂ fixation occurred at lower irradiance, again consistent with experimental findings. Interaction between the water deficit effects in each submodel allowed the combined model to simulate a higher sensitivity of CO₂ fixation at 660 μmol mol⁻¹ (41.1 vs. 19.3 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) than at 330 (22.9 vs. 14.2 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) when ψₗ was reduced to −1.55n from −0.60 MPa, as observed experimentally. The theoretical basis for CO₂ effects on photosynthesis is well established, allowing them to be reproduced with confidence in the absence of water deficits. However, the theoretical basis for water deficit effects on photosynthesis is incomplete, such that the reproduction of CO₂ effects on photosynthesis in the presence of water deficits must still be regarded as speculative.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3asimulation models 3aGlycine max 3agas exchange 3aleaf water potential 3aclimate change 3aphotosynthesis 0amathematical models0 tCrop science.g1992 Nov., v. 32, no. 6 p.1313-1321dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200060003x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03281naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002900161245009300190300001600283500000900299520212900308592002802437650002302465650001602488650001502504650001602519650001202535650001602547650002402563650001402587651001002601700002502611700002202636700002102658773012102679852000902800856009802809655001202907IND9300454620221119151126.0191122e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930045462DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040018x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahalakshmi, Viswanathan10aPerformance and Stability of Pearl Millet Topcross Hybrids and Their Variety Pollinators  ap. 928-932.  aepub  aA majority of farmers in the arid and semiarid regions of Africa and South Asia continue to cultivate their local landraces of pearl millet [Pennlsetum glaucum (L.) IL Br.], rather than improved varieties. The reasons for this preference for local landraces may include their better yield stability and adaptation to environmental stress, although their grain yield potential is often lower than that of the new varieties. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the yield potential of such landcrases could be improved without seriously affecting their stability and adaptability, by using them as pollinators in topcross hybrids. Three pollinator groups (five accessions per group) reflecting three levels of breeding effort were crossed on two malesterile lines selected to specifically advance time to flowering and to increase individual grain mass. Top crosses and their pollinators were evaluated in India, during the rainy season at three locations (ICRISAT Center, 17.50° N, 78.47° E; Anantapur, 14.68° N, 77.62° E; Fatehpur, 27.17° N, 75.13° E) in 1988 and 1989 and at Hisar (29.15° N, 75.73 ° E) in 1989, and during the dry season in irrigated and stress conditions at ICRISAT also in 1988 and 1989. Mean grain yields ranged from 66 to 477 g m⁻². The adaptability, stability, and responsiveness of the top crosses and their pollinators were compared using joint regression analysis. Analyses of adaptability, based on the predicted grain yield of top crosses and their pollinators in two low yielding environments, indicated that the top crosses were either equal or superior to their pollinators. Analysis of stability based on the deviations from regression indicated that the top crosses were either as stable, or more so than their pollinators. Analyses of responsiveness, as measured by the regression coelticient, indicated that the top crosses were more responsive to improved environmental conditions than their pollinators. The results suggest that rapid improvement in adapted inndraces is possible through their use as topcross hybrids in pearl millet.

However, for physiological interpretations and ease of implementation it is of interest to know whether different rates of mechanical stimulation can produce similar results. We hypothesized that relatively low frequency mechanical stimulation (0.01Hz) can inhibit adipogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells, even in a potent adipogenic differentiation medium. C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in adipogenic medium under control (non-mechanically stimulated) conditions and under oscillatory surface stretch with 10% amplitude and 0.01Hz frequency for 6h per day for up to 5 days. Cell population was assessed by counting and adipogenic differentiation was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) after 3 and 5 days. Involvement of the ERK signaling pathway was assessed by Western blot. Low frequency mechanical stimulation significantly decreased expression of PPARγ after 3 days and FABP4 after 3 and 5 days versus non-stimulated culture. ERK signaling was decreased in mechanically-stimulated culture, indicating a role in the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation. Application of this study: Low frequency mechanical stimulation may provide a technically simple means for control of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in cell-based therapies, particularly for inhibition of differentiation toward undesired adipogenic lineages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadipogenesis 3abone formation 3acultured cells 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astem cells1 aRosenzweig, Derek H.1 aQuinn, Thomas M.0 tDifferentiation.g2012 Apr., v. 83, no. 4 p.179-184dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2011.12.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04723naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166520316200293592002803455650001203483650001703495650001903512650001803531650001303549650001503562650001603577650001503593650002003608650002403628650002203652650001603674650001503690650001003705650001603715651001103731651000903742651001703751653001903768653003503787653002203822653000903844653000803853653001503861653000903876653001003885700003003895700002003925700002203945773011103967856008204078852000904160655001204169IND60735633220221117014905.0211009e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073563322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2021.1124312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLos, Sietse O.10aDetection of signals linked to climate change, land-cover change and climate oscillators in Tropical Montane Cloud Forests  aTropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) form biodiverse communities that are characterized by frequent occurrence of low-level clouds from which they capture a substantial proportion of their precipitation — here referred to as occult precipitation. TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5∘ S to 23.5∘ N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures — the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier — informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products — to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 × 10⁶ km² ± 0.5 × 10⁶ km²). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the ‘lifting cloud-base hypothesis’ in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in ~20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 ∘C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the ‘lifting cloud hypothesis’, imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia — mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aagroforestry 3aclimate change 3adeforestation 3adewpoint 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aland cover 3aland management 3ameteorological data 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3atopography 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aIndian Ocean 0aClimate change 0aTropical Montane Cloud Forests 0aCloud-base height 0aENSO 0aIOD 0aReanalysis 0aTRMM 0aMODIS1 aStreet-Perrott, F.

The impact of the type of glycosidic linkage by testing four sucrose isomers, as well as the monomer composition and degree of polymerization on sweetness properties were determined. Data from the sensory panel combined with principal component analysis (PCA) concludes that chain length was the most relevant factor in determining the sweetness potential of a carbohydrate. Thus, disaccharides had higher sweetness values than trisaccharides which, in turn, exhibited superior sweetness than mixtures of oligosaccharides having DP above 3. Furthermore, a weak non-significant trend indicated that the presence of a ketose sugar moiety led to higher sweetness. The novel prebiotics tested in this study had between 15 and 25% of relative sweetness, in line with other commercial prebiotics, and samples varied in their extent of off flavour. Therefore, these findings suggest a potential use for clean tasting prebiotics as partial sugar replacers, or in combination with high intensity sweeteners, to provide a well-balanced sweetness profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglycosidic linkages 3aisomers 3amoieties 3aoff flavors 3apolymerization 3aprebiotics 3aprincipal component analysis 3asensory evaluation 3asucrose 3asweeteners 3asweetness 3atrisaccharides 0aSweetener 0aEnzymatic synthesis 0aSensory evaluation 0aFree sugar substitute 0aNon-digestible oligosaccharides1 aHernandez-Hernandez, Oswaldo1 aKolida, Sofia1 aMoreno, F.

We evaluated the efficacy of broadcasted coyote Canis latrans group‐yip calls and gray wolf C. lupus lone howls to elicit vocal responses from 18 GPS‐collared coyotes on 144 occasions in Michigan's Upper Peninsula during August‐September 2009 and June‐September 2010‐2011. We evaluated coyote responses to each call type using mixed‐effects logistic regression models with time (month), residency status (resident or transient), presence in wolf territory, sex, distance, movement and call type as fixed effects hypothesized to influence coyote vocal response rates. The individual coyote and year were included as random effects. Overall, call type, sex and presence of wolf territory did not affect coyote response rates; however, coyotes did not respond to wolf calls broadcasted at distances of > 2.0 km. Resident coyotes were three times more likely to respond than transients and the greatest overall response rates occurred in August. We conclude that eliciting coyote vocalizations where wolves are present will not bias responses, and we recommend eliciting coyote vocalizations using recorded coyote group‐yip howls during July‐September to estimate the species' presence or density.  aPublisher supplied data  cMichigan Department of Natural Resources  cSafari Club International (SCI) Foundation  cMichigan Involvement Committee of SCI  aW‐147‐RcFederal Aid in Restoration Act  cMississippi State University's Forest and Wildlife Research Center 3aCanis latrans 3aCanis lupus 3aregression analysis 3aresearchers 3avocalization 3awolves 3aMichigan1 aBelant, Jerrold L.1 aBeyer, Dean E., Jr.cJr.0 tWildlife biology.g2013 Mar., v. 19, no. 1 p.41-47dNordic Council for Wildlife Research (NKV)wJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2981/12-0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245013900165520139300304592002801697650002501725650001301750650002001763650000901783650001201792650001501804650001301819650002401832650000901856650001301865650000901878650001801887650000901905650001001914650001801924650000901942700003001951700001901981700002302000700002602023700002002049700001802069700002002087700001802107700001702125700002202142700001902164700001902183773012102202856007802323852000902401655001202410IND60794157820221122175647.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079415782DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111828682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhandari, Sneh D.10aAmino Acid Fingerprinting of Authentic Nonfat Dry Milk and Skim Milk Powder and Effects of Spiking with Selected Potential Adulterants  aA collaborative study was undertaken in which five international laboratories participated to determine amino acid fingerprints in 39 authentic nonfat dry milk (NFDM)/skim milk powder (SMP) samples. A rapid method of amino acid analysis involving microwave-assisted hydrolysis followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (UHPLC-UV) was used for quantitation of amino acids and to calculate their distribution. The performance of this rapid method of analysis was evaluated and was used to determine the amino acid fingerprint of authentic milk powders. The distribution of different amino acids and their predictable upper and lower tolerance limits in authentic NFDM/SMP samples were established as a reference. Amino acid fingerprints of NFDM/SMP were compared with selected proteins and nitrogen rich compounds (proteins from pea, soy, rice, wheat, whey, and fish gelatin) which can be potential economically motivated adulterants (EMA). The amino acid fingerprints of NFDM/SMP were found to be affected by spiking with pea, soy, rice, whey, fish gelatin and arginine among the investigated adulterants but not by wheat protein and melamine. The study results establish an amino acid fingerprint of authentic NFDM/SMP and demonstrate the utility of this method as a tool in verifying the authenticity of milk powders and detecting their adulteration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3aarginine 3adried skim milk 3afish 3agelatin 3ahydrolysis 3amelamine 3amicrowave treatment 3amilk 3anitrogen 3apeas 3arapid methods 3arice 3awheat 3awheat protein 3awhey1 aGallegos-Peretz, Tiffany 1 aWheat, Thomas 1 aJaudzems, Gregory 1 aKouznetsova, Natalia 1 aPetrova, Katya 1 aShah, Dimple 1 aHengst, Daniel 1 aVacha, Erika 1 aLu, Weiying 1 aMoore, Jeffrey C.1 aMetra, Pierre 1 aXie, Zhuohong 0 tFoods.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111828683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245015600176300001800332520058500350592002800935650001600963650002100979650002601000650002501026650001001051700002201061700006401083773012101147856008401268852000901352655001201361IND60755671420220219000000.0211105e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075567142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c033232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallagher-Duval, Shawn10aFunctionalized Polyhydroquinolines from Amino Acids Using a Key One-Pot Cyclization Cascade and Application to the Synthesis of (±)-Δ⁷-Mesembrenone  ap. 8606-8611.  aSubstituted polyhydroquinolines are ubiquitous skeletal cores found in drugs and bioactive natural products.

Thus, the physicochemical characteristics and aroma patterns of edible insect oils were confirmed; the results could be used to develop new edible insect oils to increase food utilization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aProtaetia 3aTenebrio molitor 3aTrypoxylus dichotomus 3aedible insects 3aloss modulus 3aodors 3astorage modulus 0aEdible insect 0aInsect oil 0aAroma pattern 0aDifferential scanning calorimetry 0aFatty acid1 aKim, Tae-Kyung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6349-43141 aCha, Ji Yoon1 aYong, Hae In1 aKang, Min-Cheol1 aJang, Hae Won1 aChoi, Yun-Sang0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 167 p.113888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245019700209300001600406520135200422592002801774650001701802650002201819650001501841650001301856650001401869650001201883650001001895650001101905650001401916650001101930650001301941650000901954650001401963650001401977650001301991650002002004650000902024650001402033650001302047650001302060650001102073650000902084653001602093653001102109653001202120653001802132653002302150700002402173773012102197856008102318852000902399655001202408IND60609554520221122214335.0200819e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060955452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.07.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgobese, Nomali Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7360-534010aPotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) nutritional changes associated with French fry processing: Comparison of low-temperature long-time and high-temperature short-time blanching and frying treatments  ap. 448-455.  aSix potato cultivars (Fianna, Innovator, Mondial, Navigator, Panamera and Savanna) were evaluated for moisture, colour, oil, protein and mineral element changes associated with French fry processing. Processing involved blanching French fry strips at 75 °C for 10 min (low-temperature long-time [LTLT] blanching) or 85 °C for 5 min (high-temperature short-time [HTST] blanching), before frying them at 160 °C for 2 min (LTLT frying) or 180 °C for 1 min (HTST frying). The results revealed that genotype and the blanching and frying treatments significantly affected the nutritional value of potatoes. Savanna showed the smallest changes, which generally did not differ among treatments, while nutritional changes varied widely in the other cultivars. Cultivars exhibited a reduction in moisture (30–60%), lightness (≤40%), Fe and Al (<150%). However, an increase in oil (8000–19307%), protein (≤110%) and mineral elements, such as Ca, Zn, Cu, P, K, Mg, Na and Mn (<150%), was detected. This increase was mainly attributed to moisture loss associated with the blanching step. HTST blanching resulted in the highest oil absorption in Fianna, Innovator and Panamera, compared to LTLT blanching. These results indicate that the nutritional value of French fries mainly depends on cultivar and the blanching parameters used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrench fries 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aabsorption 3aaluminum 3ablanching 3acalcium 3acolor 3acopper 3acultivars 3afrying 3agenotype 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aminerals 3anutritive value 3aoils 3apotassium 3apotatoes 3asavannas 3asodium 3azinc 0aFried foods 0aFrying 0aMondial 0aNutrient loss 0aProcessed potatoes1 aWorkneh, Tilahun S.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Nov., v. 97 p.448-455dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.07.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245005700158300001400215500002000229520111700249592002801366650001501394650002301409650001601432650001001448650000901458650001201467650001101479650001301490650001701503650001301520650001101533650001401544650002001558650001901578650001501597700001801612700002201630773013601652856007101788852000901859655001201868IND60130843820221119135138.0220424e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013084382DNAL7 a10.2981/12-0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThurfjell, Henrik10aEffects of hunting on wild boar Sus scrofa behaviour  ap. 87-93.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPredation risk may affect space use and foraging patterns of prey animals, with strong down‐stream effects on diet composition and ecological interactions. Wild boar Sus scrofa is a notorious crop raider but also a popular game species, yet little is known about how risk perception of human hunting affects wild boar space use. We studied the effects of human hunting on the movement of GPS‐collared female wild boar. We found that the hunting method affected whether the wild boar fled or hid. After fleeing into refuge ranges, wild boar moved less and preferred habitats that provided cover and forage such as mast or crops. This suggests that the wild boar tried to reduce the risk of being detected, and possibly also that they avoided competition with resident wild boar in the refuge by using forage that could not be monopolised. The type of hunting thus strongly affected the type of avoidance behaviour displayed by wild boar, with implications for their movement and space use. This suggests that adjusting hunting method to season could be an important management tool for minimising crop losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aavoidance behavior 3acrop losses 3acrops 3adiet 3afemales 3aforage 3aforaging 3agame animals 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3apredation 3arisk perception 3arisk reduction 3awild boars1 aSpong, Göran1 aEricsson, Göran,0 tWildlife biology.g2013 Mar., v. 19, no. 1 p.87-93dNordic Council for Wildlife Research (NKV)wJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2981/12-0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245007200179300001600251500000900267520200000276592002802276650002202304650001702326650001102343650002602354650001502380650001402395650001202409650002602421650003702447650002302484650001102507650001302518651001002531700002502541773012102566852000902687856009802696655001202794IND9300454820221119151256.0191122e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930045482DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Edward10aPairwise Rank Superiority of Winter Wheat Genotype for Spring Stand  ap. 938-942.  aepub  aRank statistics can be used as a simple method of summarizing multienvironment data when the assumptions of uniform variances and main effects across environments are violates. A pairwise rank superiority measure is described for analysis of genotypes across environments when usual statistical measures are invalid or too complex for clear data presentation. Eight years of spring stand data for five winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell.) genotypes were summarized from two locations with intermittent infection by snow mold [Typhula spp. and Microdochium nivale (Ces. ex Beri. & Vogl.) Samuels & Hailer Fusarium nivale Fr Cesati] using ranking of pairs of cultivars to measure relative superiority across environments. For each cultivar pair, a snow mold tolerant cultivar was compared with a susceptible check or another tolerant cultivar. The percent of trials in which a tolerant genotype was superior to the comparison genotype was compared with the null hypothesis of equal performance for each genotype. The snow mold tolerant hard red winter wheat ‘Survivor’ was found to be superior to ‘Manning’, a locally adapted hard red winter wheat, in 78.8% of the trials in which significant stand reduction had occurred. Survivor was significantly superior to Manning for the ability to establish a spring stand based on a t-test comparison to the null hypothesis of 50% (P < 0.01). Survivor was also superior to the hard red winter wheat cultivars Blizzard and Weston when significant stand reductions occurred, but Survivor was not superior to the soft white winter wheat cultivar Spragne. Measuring the frequency of superior performance within a set of environments with similar stress allows relatively simple cultivar recommendations to be made to growers despite the presence of genotype × environment interactions.

In most cases, FGFs and BMPs have opposing effects, and specific developmental outcomes arise out of a balance between the two growth factors. We and others have previously demonstrated that signaling pathways activated by FGFs and BMPs interact via inhibitory crosstalk. Here we demonstrate a role for the BMP effector TGF-β Activated Kinase 1 (TAK1) in the maintenance of Smad1 activity in Xenopus embryos, via the inhibition of erk MAPK. Up- or downregulation of TAK1 levels produces an inverse alteration in the amount of activated erk MAPK. The inhibition of erk MAPK by TAK1 is mediated by p38 and a corresponding decrease in phosphorylation of MEK. TAK1 morphant embryos show a decrease in the nuclear accumulation of Smad1. Conversely, reduction of erk MAPK activity via overexpression of MAP Kinase Phosphatase1 (MKP1) leads to an increase in nuclear Smad1. Both TAK1 morphant ectoderm and ectoderm treated with FGF show a decrease in the expression of several Smad1-inducible genes. Neural-specific gene expression is inhibited in isolated ectoderm coexpressing noggin and TAK1, suggesting that TAK1 is sufficient to inhibit neural specification. Introduction of TAK1 morpholino oligonucleotide expands the expression of organizer genes, disrupts formation of the boundary between organizer and non-organizer mesoderm, and increases the spatial range of MAPK activation in response to localized FGF. Our results indicate that inhibitory interactions between FGF and BMP4 effector pathways increase the robustness of BMP signaling via a feed-forward mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus 3agene expression 3agenes 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3atransforming growth factor beta 3avertebrates1 aGoswami, Mousumi1 aTalley, Julia1 aChesser-Martinez, Patricia L.1 aLou, Chih-Hong1 aSater, Amy K.0 tDifferentiation.g2012 Apr., v. 83, no. 4 p.210-219dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01434naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009800167300001400265520045500279592002800734650001700762650001600779650001600795650001700811650000900828650001000837650001200847650002500859651001300884773012000897856008201017852000901099655001201108IND60681027320221123005642.0200113e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068102732DNAL7 a10.1177/0898756489006002012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeard, Gary B.10aAnterior Crossbite: Interceptive Orthodontics for Prevention, Maryland Bridges for Correction  ap. 14-17.  aDisplacement of teeth (malocclusions) in companion animals becomes important when it results in occlusal traumas and tooth attrition, or soft tissue damage.

The permeability of the TFC membrane was smaller by an order of magnitude than that of the substrate, which was due to the formation of a thick barrier layer. The structure of the barrier layer was controlled via the addition of cyclic ethers (dioxane, oxolane and trioxane). By increasing the polarity of cyclic ethers, the thickness of the barrier layer and the dense layer was reduced due to the piperazine concentration in the organic phase. Comparing with oxolane and trioxane, the addition of dioxane resulted in a narrower pore size as that of the conventional IP process, which was ascribed to the narrow IP reaction zone via the immiscibility of interface. With the addition of dioxane up to 2wt%, the barrier layer became thinner, the pure water flux of the resultant membrane was improved and the dextran rejection was maintained. The novel hollow fiber NF membrane has a permeability of 16.6Lm⁻²h⁻¹bar⁻¹, a MWCO of 330Da and a tensile strength of 10.3MPa. This membrane had a higher rejection of total organic carbon and a lower rejection of total dissolved solids of the secondary effluent from a petrochemical industry plant, which proves the potential of this membrane in municipal, agricultural and industrial wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyclic ethers 3adextran 3adioxane 3aindustrial wastewater treatment 3ananofiltration 3aoil and gas industry 3aorganic carbon 3apermeability 3apiperazine 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3atensile strength 3athin film composite membranes 3atotal dissolved solids 0aNanofiltration membrane 0aThin film composite membrane 0aThermally induced phase separation 0aPolypiperazine amide 0aWastewater treatment1 aBian, Li-Xia1 aYuan, Hao-Ge1 aPang, Bo1 aLin, Ya-Kai1 aTong, Yu1 aBruggen, Bart van der,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3921-74721 aWang, Xiao-Lin0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 478 p.25-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245013600199500002000335520049100355592002800846596002200874596003200896650001000928650001900938650001600957700002000973773013400993856007401127852000901201655001201210IND60792642020221118053417.0220908e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079264202DNAL7 a10.1111/ens.125122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwasa, Mitsuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8944-931910aReview of the genera Norellisoma Hendel and Milania Šifner (Diptera: Scathophagidae) from Japan, with description of a new species  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Japanese species of the genera Norellisoma Hendel, 1910 and Milania Šifner, 2010 of the Scathophagidae are reviewed.

The aim of this study was to identify chromosome effects on some parameters associated with photosynthetic efficiency under low light. Photosynthetic activity was analyzed using a pulse.amplitude modulation fluorometer for the measurement of the photochemical quenching (Qₚ) and of the quantum efficiency of Photosystem II electron transport (ΦPSU) under an actinic light of 45 μmol m⁻²s⁻¹ on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants grown in pots under natural conditions. Reciprocal sets of chromosome substitution lines between the hard red winter wheat cultivars Wichita and Cheyenne were used to identify the chromosomes involved in the expression of these traits. The two parental cultivars were significantly different for Qₚ and ΦPSU Chromosome 3D affected ΦPSU at various stages of development when plants were exposed to low light intensities. Relationships between yield and photosynthetic efficiency under non saturating light have been postulated. Thus, chromosome 3D probably influences bread wheat productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3acultivars 3aphotosystem II 3achromosomes 3achromosome substitution 3asubstitution lines 3afluorescence 3ameasurement 3aelectron transfer 3aFrance1 aPlanchon, Claude1 aMorris, Rosalind0 tCrop science.g1992 July, v. 32, no. 4 p.958-961dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040024x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03519naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005000151245014700201520224100348592002802589650001202617650001602629650001602645650002202661650001302683653002202696653001902718653001802737653001902755653002602774700001802800700001802818700001902836700001302855700005702868773011302925856008603038852000903124655001203133IND60776114620221122185502.0220906e20220710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077611462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1319932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ge1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2190-699810aExperimental investigation of eco-friendly cryogenic minimum quantity lubrication (CMQL) strategy in machining of Ti–6Al–4V thin-wall part  aThe application of cutting fluid is the most direct and effective method for improving the productivity in machining difficult-to-cut materials. Besides the typical flood cooling method, advanced and eco-friendly solutions such as minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and cryogenic minimum quantity lubrication (CMQL) have been applied in green manufacturing processes to avoid the environmental and health issues associated with conventional cutting fluid. High-efficiency machining of thin-wall components is of significant importance to the aerospace and defence industries. However, the effects of CMQL in the thin-wall milling process have not been investigated, and the mechanisms of tool wear, chip evolution, stress distribution and part deformation are still unclear. To address this gap, this paper presents the investigation and corresponding analysis of CMQL in the machining of titanium thin-wall components. Comparative experiments were carried out under different cutting environments, including flood cooling, MQL and CMQL machining. The tool wear state, cutting force, chip morphology, surface quality and workpiece deformation were compared and analysed. Experimental results show that CMQL machining can significantly lower the cutting loads and deformation values of thin-wall parts, especially at higher spindle speed. Compared with flood and MQL machining, CMQL machining led to approximate 28.5% and 31.2% smaller cutting force at the spindle speed of 4500 rpm, and the maximum deformation in CMQL machining was decreased by 41.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the wear resistance of the cutting tool and surface quality is enhanced in comparison with flood cooling and MQL machining. It was shown that the machined surface under CMQL condition exhibited 34.5% and 45.8% lower surface roughness (Ra) compared to flood and MQL machining at the highest spindle speed. Overall, the experimental outcomes demonstrate the feasibility of CMQL in improving the machinability of thin-wall components made from difficult-to-cut material, owing to its superior lubrication and cooling functions. The cryogenic cooling action and induced thermal effect are especially beneficial to controlling the flexible deformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3adeformation 3alubrication 3asurface roughness 3atitanium 0aThin-wall milling 0aCMQL machining 0aMQL machining 0aTitanium alloy 0aCleaner manufacturing1 aLi, Guangxian1 aPan, Wencheng1 aRaja, Izamshah1 aWang, Xu1 aDing, Songlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2967-58590 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 July 10, v. 357 p.131993-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1319933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245006600178300001600244500000900260500001500269520156500284592002801849650001101877650001401888650002601902650002101928650003901949650001301988650002202001650001102023650001702034650002302051651001202074651001502086653001302101700001902114700002202133700002102155700001902176700002202195773012102217852000902338856009802347655001202445IND9300455120221119150929.0191122e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930045512DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstilai, Ali10aCorrelations and Path Analyses of Agronomic Traits in Guayule  ap. 953-957.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aSuccessful breeding of guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) for increased rubber yield requires knowledge about the traits that influence rubber production directly and indirectly. This study was undertaken to examine the interrelationships of several agronomic traits through path-coefficient analyses, to determine broad-sense heritability, and to estimate genetic advance under selection. Plant height, width, dry weight, rubber content, resin content, rubber yield, and resin yield from guayule selections planted at two locations (Riverside, CA, and Maricopa, AZ) were used for analyses. The guayule selections exhibited significant differences for all traits at both locations, except for plant dry weight and plant width at Maricopa. Broad-sense heritability estimates ranged from a low of 75.1% (for rubber content) to a high of 96.5% (for resin content) at Riverside, and from 6% (for plant width) to 93.1% (for resin content) at Maricopa. Expected netic advance ranged between 18% (for plant width) and 76% (for resin yield) at Riverside, and between 0.72% (for plant width) 41% (for resin content) at Maricopa. Rubber yield, the most critical trait for economic commercialization of guayule, showed expected genetic advance of 58% at Riverside and 37% at Maricopa. Path-coefficient analyses indicated plant height to be less important than plant width as a component of dry weight at Riverside. Dry weight and percent rubber content had positive direct effects on rubber yield and accounted for 99% of its variation at Riverside and 85% at Maricopa.  aPublisher supplied data 3arubber 3aphenotype 3aParthenium argentatum 3aagronomic traits 3aagricultural programs and projects 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3ayields 3aheritability 3aselection criteria 3aArizona 3aCalifornia 0abreeding1 aEhdaie, Bahman1 aNaqvi, Himayat H.1 aDierig, David A.1 aRay, Dennis T.1 aThomson, Anson E.0 tCrop science.g1992 July, v. 32, no. 4 p.953-957dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040023x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03214naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012200163300001600285520141700301592002801718650001701746650001801763650002601781650001701807650001501824650001901839650001901858650002101877650001301898650003901911650002101950650004801971650001602019650003302035650001502068650001202083650001402095650001202109653002502121653002302146653001502169653001302184700001302197700001802210700001402228700002002242700002002262700001202282700001202294700002102306700001602327700005802343773012102401856008102522852000902603655001202612IND60609554920221122214342.0200819e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060955492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Ai-Min10aEffects of proteolysis and transglutaminase crosslinking on physicochemical characteristics of walnut protein isolate  ap. 662-667.  aIn order to improve the functional properties of walnut protein isolate (WPI), the effect of partial hydrolysis with trypsin, crosslinking with transglutaminase (TGase), and combinations of both treatments on the physicochemical characteristics of WPI was investigated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated that WPI could be easily digested into smaller peptides by trypsin and could also be crosslinked into aggregates with high molecular weight. Hydrolyzing crosslinked WPI significantly increased its solubility from 9.73% to 54.54%. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that treatment with trypsin or TGase alone had a notable effect whereas the mixture of enzyme and TGase had a relatively lower effect on the microstructure of WPI. Hydrolysis did not affect the sulfhydryl (-SH) content while TGase crosslinking significantly reduced (-SH) content from 92.9 μmoL/g to 47.06 μmoL/g. Hydrolysis markedly increased the surface hydrophobicity (H₀), while crosslinking did not significantly change H₀. TGase treatment increased the viscosity of hydrolysates, but the viscosity of trypsin hydrolysates was not altered. Treatment of WPI with both TGase and trypsin showed the lowest initial G′ and G″ values due to the highest solubility. Thus, WPI with proteolysis and transglutaminase treatment has great potential for applications in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3afood industry 3afunctional properties 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein isolates 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aproteolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3atrypsin 3aviscosity 3awalnuts 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aProtein solubility 0aMorphology 0aRheology1 aJiao, Bo1 aLiu, Hong-Zhi1 aZhu, Song1 aShen, Min-jiang1 aFeng, Xiao-Long1 aHu, Hui1 aLiu, Li1 aFaiṣal, Shāh,1 aWang, Qiang1 aAdhikari, Benu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7571-79680 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Nov., v. 97 p.662-667dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245015300167520098500320592002801305650001501333650001401348650002101362650001201383650001601395650002801411650001101439650000901450650001301459651001701472653002501489653002601514653001501540653002501555653002001580700001501600700001501615700001601630700001901646700001801665700001401683700001801697700001601715773010601731856008801837852000901925655001201934IND60789998820221119231915.0220926e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078999882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1140522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Lulu10aOccurrence, allocation and geochemical controls for mercury in a typical estuarine ecosystem: Implications for the predictability of mercury species  aIn this study, surface seawater, bottom seawater and surface sediments were collected from the Yellow River Estuary Area (YREA) and the Laizhou Bay (LB) to investigate the occurrence, spatial distribution and geochemical control factors for total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in different phases. The geochemical characteristics of seawater and sediments suggested significant variances in the YREA and the LB. The high contamination of Hg in the YREA showed the discharge of the Yellow River (YR) contributed significantly to the Hg contamination in the LB. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was utilized to explore the complicated interactions between geochemical controls and methylation potentials in different phases. Although the ecological risk (ER) of Hg was not significant in this study area, the higher values of ER in the YREA suggested that the YR was the primary Hg contributor to LB.

Unfortunately, SPDs are incapable of converging on the distribution that generated a set of radiocarbon measurements, even when the number of observations is large. To overcome this problem, we propose a more principled alternative that combines finite mixture models and end-to-end Bayesian inference. Numerical simulations and an assessment of the statistical identifiability of our method demonstrate that it correctly converges on the generating distribution for two important models, exponentials and finite Gaussian mixtures, at least if the same statistical model is used to fit the data as was used to generate the data. To further validate this approach, we apply it to a set of radiocarbon dates from the Maya city of Tikal. We show that an end-to-end approach reconstructs with high accuracy expert demographic reconstructions based on settlement patterns and ceramics, but with more precise time-resolution and characterization of uncertainty than has heretofore been possible. Future work should consider alternatives to finite Gaussian mixtures for fitting the generating distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aarchaeology 3acarbon radioisotopes 3ahumans 3astatistical models 3auncertainty 0aRadiocarbon 0aBayesian statistics 0aEquifinality 0aTikal 0aMaya 0aDemography 0aSummed probabilities1 aCapriles Flores, José M.,1 aHoggarth, Julie A.1 aBocinsky, R.

Conversely, the anabolic effect of insulin is crucial for osteoblast function, as suggested by severe osteopenia and increased incidence of fracture in insulin-deficient diabetic patients. The Insulin Receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase, which is commonly expressed in the insulin-sensitive liver, muscle, and adipose tissues, is also found in animal and human bone. Here we show that in human bone two insulin receptor isoforms (IR-A and IR-B) are differently expressed. Mature human osteoblasts predominantly express IR-B, whereas IR-A is mainly expressed in osteoblast precursors, and IR-B/IR-A mRNA ratio significantly increases along the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal precursors. Moreover, transfected osteoprogenitors overexpressing IR-A show an increased proliferation rate. In contrast, when transfected with and overexpressing IR-B, their proliferation rate is reduced, corresponding to a more differentiated phenotype. In conclusion, the fine regulation of the expression of different isoforms of IR during osteogenic differentiation confirms the important role played by IR in bone homeostasis, providing the basis for new perspectives on the various involvements of IR isoforms in bone pathophysiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3abone formation 3aenergy metabolism 3agene overexpression 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptors 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aosteopenia 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3aphenotype 3atyrosine1 aPerut, Francesca1 aSalerno, Manuela1 aSciacca, Laura1 aBaldini, Nicola0 tDifferentiation.g2012 June, v. 83, no. 5 p.242-248dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2012.02.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245013600158300001600294500002000310520162100330592002801951596006301979596002102042596008502063596005702148596004602205596005202251650002402303650002702327650001502354650001502369650001102384650001202395650001802407650001002425650001302435650001002448650001802458650002302476650001202499650001502511650001502526650001702541700002202558700002402580700002702604773013802631856007102769852000902840655001202849IND60130844520221119135136.0220424e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013084452DNAL7 a10.2981/11-1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuller, Angela K.10aNest survival of wild turkeys Meleagris gallopavo silvestris in a mixed‐use landscape: influences at nest‐site and patch scales  ap. 138-146.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNest survival is a critical factor affecting avian demographics, and can be influenced by nesting chronology, fine scale nest‐site selection and broad‐scale landscape characteristics. We modeled the relative influences of nest age, temporal variation in nest success and habitat‐related covariates at two spatial scales (nest‐site and patch scale) on daily nest survival during incubation for eastern wild turkeys Meleagris gallopavo silvestris in a mixed‐use landscape. Daily survival rate of turkey nests during incubation increased as percent understory cover (vegetation < 1 m tall) increased and decreased with increasing density of woody shrubs and saplings and herbaceous stems < 1 m tall (understory vegetation density) around the nest. We suggest that nest survival may be dependent on a balance of sufficient understory cover around nests to provide concealment for hens and nests, but with understory vegetation density below levels that reduce the hen's ability to detect a predator or to escape after detecting a potential threat. The balance between sufficient understory cover and limited density of understory vegetation occurred where understory (< 1 m tall) cover exceeded 50% and understory vegetation density was < 25 stems/m². Models that included variables related to the patch scale (e.g. fragmentation, edge and dominant land‐cover class in a patch) did not receive strong support, demonstrating the relative importance of finer scale nest‐site variables over patch‐scale variables in determining survival of wild turkey nests in our highly variable mixed‐use landscape.  aPublisher supplied data  cConnecticut Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation  cWildlife Forever  cThe University of Maine and Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection  aR‐49‐W‐21cFederal Aid in Wildlife Restoration  aMEO‐9660‐05cMcIntire‐Stennis Grant  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aMeleagris gallopavo 3ademographic statistics 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3asaplings 3astems 3asurvival rate 3atemporal variation 3aturkeys 3aunderstory 3avegetation 3awoody plants1 aSpohr, Shelley M.1 aHarrison, Daniel J.1 aServello, Frederick A.0 tWildlife biology.g2013 June, v. 19, no. 2 p.138-146dNordic Council for Wildlife Research (NKV)wJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2981/11-1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245008500176520110600261592002801367650001201395650002501407650001401432650001201446650001101458650001101469650001401480650000901494650001401503650002101517650001601538650001401554650000901568651001701577651001501594653001601609653001101625653001501636653001101651653001401662653001401676653003301690700002101723700005601744700002101800700002301821700006701844773010601911856008802017852000902105655001202114IND60789998920221119233001.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078999892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1140532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnnasawmy, Pavanee10aTrace elements and δ15N values in micronekton of the south-western Indian Ocean  aTrace elements and δ¹⁵N values were analysed in micronekton (crustaceans, fishes and squids) sampled in the south-western Indian Ocean. Myctophids were associated with high concentrations of arsenic at La Pérouse and MAD-Ridge seamounts, and with lead and manganese at MAD-Ridge and in the Mozambique Channel. The difference in cadmium, copper and zinc concentrations between micronekton broad categories reflected differing metabolic and storage processes. When significant, negative relationships were found between micronekton body size and trace element concentrations, which can possibly be attributed to differing metabolic activity in young and old individuals, dietary shifts and/or dilution effect of growth. No relationships were found between trace element concentrations and δ¹⁵N values of micronekton (except cobalt which decreased with increasing δ¹⁵N values), since most trace elements are not biomagnified in food webs due to regulation and excretion processes within organisms. All trace element pairs were positively correlated in fishes suggesting regulation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abiochemical pathways 3abody size 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aexcretion 3alead 3amanganese 3amarine pollution 3amicronekton 3aseamounts 3azinc 3aIndian Ocean 3aMozambique 0aCrustaceans 0aFishes 0aMyctophids 0aSquids 0aBody size 0aSeamounts 0aPrincipal Component Analysis1 aBustamante, Paco1 aPoint, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5218-77811 aChurlaud, Carine1 aRomanov, Evgeny V.1 aLamboy, Nathalie Bodin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8464-02130 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Nov., v. 184 p.114053-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1140533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001600273520124700289592002801536650001301564650001601577650001701593650001501610650001301625650001101638650002201649650001901671650001501690650002301705650002001728650001101748650001201759650002701771650001401798653001401812653002601826653001901852653002101871653001501892700001901907700001701926700001801943700001701961773012101978856008102099852000902180655001202189IND60609555020221122214405.0200819e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060955502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.07.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEom, Haeyoung10aDevelopment of a starch/gum-based edible coating for rice cakes to retard retrogradation during storage  ap. 516-522.  aA starch/gum blend as an edible coating solution for rice cakes was developed to retard starch retrogradation. It was prepared by blending waxy corn starch (WCS) with edible gums, such as gellan gum (GG) and sodium alginate (SA). The rice cakes were coated with starch/gum blends to preserve moisture and water holding capacity. After storing the rice cakes for 4 d at 25 °C and 45% relative humidity condition, moisture loss values from the uncoated and (1 g WCS + 1.25 g GG)/100 mL coated rice cakes were 3.36 ± 1.51% and 1.08 ± 1.08%, respectively. Hardness of the uncoated rice cakes (225.21 ± 76.54 N) was significantly higher than that of the rice cakes coated with (1 g WCS + 1.25 g GG)/100 mL (144.45 ± 48.97 N). Furthermore, the retrogradation rate (k) of the uncoated rice cakes (k = 0.452) exceeded that of the (1 g WCS + 1.25 g GG)/100 mL coated ones (k = 0.408) by 9.73%. Better sensory evaluation results were reported after (1 g WCS + 1.25 g GG)/100 mL blend coating than uncoated control. Taken together, newly developed edible coating with the (1 g WCS + 1.25 g GG)/100 mL blend was effective in retarding the retrogradation of the rice cakes and maintaining their texture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acorn starch 3aedible films 3agellan gum 3ahardness 3amixing 3arelative humidity 3aretrogradation 3arice cakes 3asensory evaluation 3asodium alginate 3astarch 3atexture 3awater holding capacity 3awaxy corn 0aRice cake 0aStarch retrogradation 0aEdible coating 0aWaxy corn starch 0aGellan gum1 aChang, Yoonjee1 aLee, Eun-sil1 aChoi, Hee-Don1 aHan, Jaejoon0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Nov., v. 97 p.516-522dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002200161245005400183300001600237500000900253500001500262520129600277592002801573650001601601650002201617650001201639650000901651650001201660650002701672650002301699650001201722650001301734650001301747650001201760650003701772650001501809651001301824653001301837653001901850773012101869852000901990856009801999655001202097IND9300455320221119151222.0191122e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930045532DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevine, Thomas E.10aGenetic Linkage Tests for the Rj4 Gene in Soybean  ap. 961-964.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe Rj4 allele in soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., conditions an ineffective nodulation response primarily with bradyrhizobial strains classified as Bradyrhizobium elkanii, which are less efficient in N₂ fixation with soybean, thus protecting the plant from many of these strains. The diminishing frequency of the RJ4 allele with agronomic selection poses the question of possible linkage with genes of negative agronomic selective value. Little is known of the linkage relationships of the Rj4 locus. This report analyzes genetic linkage tests of the Kj4 locus with 12 other loci: F, Frl, Fr2,1, LI, Ln, P, Wl, Y9, Y10, Y12, and YJ7. Segregating F₂ and F₃, progeny of several crosses were used to generate data for analysis. The Rj4 assays were conducted by planting seeds in sterile vermiculite and inoculating with broth cultures of strain USDA 61 from the Beltsville Rhizobium Culture Collection and examining the roots after 2 to 4 wk culture in the greenhouse. Other traits were scored either in the field or in the greenhouse. Chisquare was used to test for linkage, and the product method or method of maximum likelihood was used to estimate recombination. Only the Y17 locus showed evidence of genetic linkage with Rj4. The estimated recombination of Y17 and Rj4 was 46 ± 2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3anitrogen fixation 3aalleles 3aloci 3ahybrids 3aBradyrhizobium elkanii 3alinkage (genetics) 3atesting 3acrossing 3agenotype 3aprogeny 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3anodulation 3aMaryland 0agenetics 0aBradyrhizobium0 tCrop science.g1992 July, v. 32, no. 4 p.961-964dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040025x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02903naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002900180245010400209506007600313520152800389592002801917506003701945650001401982650001401996650001902010650002102029650002502050650000902075650001102084650001102095650001302106650001702119650001302136650001302149700002202162700002502184700002502209700002102234773012002255856007302375852000902448655001202457IND60653002220221207092044.0190713e20190530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065300222DNAL7 a10.3390/v110604962doi7 aPMC66311092pmcid7 a311512512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnosi Tuipulotu, Daniel 14aThe Adenosine Analogue NITD008 has Potent Antiviral Activity against Human and Animal Caliciviruses  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe widespread nature of calicivirus infections globally has a substantial impact on the health and well-being of humans and animals alike. Currently, the only vaccines approved against caliciviruses are for feline and rabbit-specific members of this group, and thus there is a growing effort towards the development of broad-spectrum antivirals for calicivirus infections. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of the adenosine analogue NITD008 in vitro using three calicivirus model systems namely; feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and the human norovirus replicon. We show that the nucleoside analogue (NA), NITD008, has limited toxicity and inhibits calicivirus replication in all three model systems with EC<inf>50</inf> values of 0.94 &mu;M, 0.91 &micro;M, and 0.21 &micro;M for MNV, FCV, and the Norwalk replicon, respectively. NITD008 has a similar level of potency to the most well-studied NA 2&prime;-C-methylcytidine in vitro. Significantly, we also show that continual NITD008 treatment effectively cleared the Norwalk replicon from cells and treatment with 5 &micro;M NITD008 was sufficient to completely prevent rebound. Given the potency displayed by NITD008 against several caliciviruses, we propose that this compound should be interrogated further to assess its effectiveness in vivo. In summary, we have added a potent NA to the current suite of antiviral compounds and provide a NA scaffold that could be further modified for therapeutic use against calicivirus infections.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVesivirus 3aadenosine 3aanimal viruses 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3acats 3ahumans 3amodels 3areplicon 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3avaccines1 aFumian, Tulio  M.1 aNetzler, Natalie  E.1 aMackenzie, Jason  M.1 aWhite, Peter A.,0 tViruses.g2019 May 30, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110604963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014600170300001600316520148900332592002801821650001301849650002501862650001401887650001501901650001501916650001201931650000901943650001801952650001201970650001301982653001201995653001202007653001302019653001402032653001302046700002202059700001602081700002202097700002102119700002402140700002802164773011202192856008402304852000902388655001202397IND60604837320221122030740.0180718e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060483732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimura, Masaoki10aHydraulically irreversible membrane fouling during coagulation–microfiltration and its control by using high-basicity polyaluminum chloride  ap. 115-122.  aThe extent of hydraulically irreversible membrane fouling in a coagulation–filtration system depends on several factors, including properties of the coagulant. Effects of polyaluminum chloride (PACl) coagulant properties, specifically basicity and sulfation, were investigated by conducting long-term direct filtration experiments. Elemental analysis determined Al and Si to be the major foulants, though the Si/Al ratios of the foulants differed from those of coagulated floc particles. While floc particle size depended on the concentrations of sulfate ions and polymeric species in the PACls, floc-size changes did not affect transmembrane pressure (TMP) buildup and thus did not affect irreversible fouling. Differences in PACl basicity, which affected the distribution of aluminum species, resulted in changes to the degree of irreversible fouling.Pretreatment with high-basicity (71%) PACl was superior to pretreatment with normal-basicity (51%) PACl in reducing irreversible fouling and attenuating TMP buildup during filtration. Higher basicities resulted in less Al breakthrough and a decrease in the Si/Al ratio of the foulants. However, TMP buildup was the same for PACls with basicities of 71% and 90%; therefore, TMP buildup is not simply related to Al breakthrough and deposition. Increasing the basicity of PACls would be an effective way to reduce the amount of foulant deposited on the membrane by decreasing the amount of aluminum that passes through the membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aartificial membranes 3achlorides 3acoagulants 3afiltration 3afouling 3aions 3aparticle size 3asilicon 3asulfates 0aCeramic 0aFoulant 0aSilicate 0aCoagulant 0aBasicity1 aMatsui, Yoshihiko1 aSaito, Shun1 aTakahashi, Tomoya1 aNakagawa, Midori1 aShirasaki, Nobutaka1 aMatsushita, T.q(Taku),0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 477 p.115-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013000166300001800296520088100314592002801195650001501223650001201238650001001250650001601260650001301276650003101289650000901320650001501329650002001344650001101364650003701375700002001412700002101432700001801453773012601471856007401597852000901671655001201680IND60656564420221120125341.0190814e20120531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065656442DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay05848k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajizadeh, Salahaddin10aSilver nanoparticles in the presence of Ca²⁺ as a selective and sensitive probe for the colorimetric detection of cysteine  ap. 1747-1752.  aA sensitive and selective cysteine colorimeric sensor based on the interaction between cysteine, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and calcium ions has been developed. In the presence of Ca²⁺ and NaCl, cysteine could rapidly induce the aggregation of AgNPs, thereby resulting in a yellow-to-red color change. The presence of 10 mM NaCl in the samples decreases the electrostatic repulsion and accelerates the aggregation of AgNPs. Results demonstrated that other amino acids cannot change the color of AgNPs solution in the same conditions, probably due to the absence of the thiol groups, suggesting the selectivity of the proposed method toward cysteine. The color change was monitored by naked eye and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The ratio of absorption at 524 to 396 nm (A₅₂₄/A₃₉₆) is linearly dependent on the cysteine concentration in the range of 0.25–10 μM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acalcium 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acysteine 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aions 3ananosilver 3asodium chloride 3athiols 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aFarhadi, Khalil1 aForough, Mehrdad1 aMolaei, Rahim0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 May 31, v. 4, no. 6 p.1747-1752dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ay05848k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010600173300001600279520108200295592002801377650002501405650001101430650001201441650002101453650001301474650001201487653003001499653003301529653002101562653001801583653001801601773011201619856008401731852000901815655001201824IND60604837420221122003359.0180718e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060483742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaroshchuk, Andriy10aOptimal hydrostatic counter-pressure in Pressure-Retarded Osmosis with composite/asymmetric membranes  ap. 157-160.  aPressure-Retarded Osmosis (PRO) is a method for converting salinity gradients to energy. In this process, a hydro-static counter-pressure is applied to retard osmotic flow through a semi-permeable membrane and gain mechanical energy. The maximum power output is known to occur at counter-pressures that are about one half of osmotic pressure in the draw solution.In this communication we obtain an explicit criterion for the optimal hydrostatic counter-pressure and use it for a parametric analysis of its dependence on such system parameters as the properties of membrane active and support layers and solute concentrations in the draw and feed solutions. In particular, we show that besides the draw concentration this pressure noticeably depends on the feed concentration. This finding is important for the design of PRO modules where this concentration can considerably change along the module. In addition, we demonstrate that the optimal counter-pressure can be noticeably reduced by decreasing the S-parameter, which is important for the design of optimal PRO membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3aenergy 3aosmosis 3aosmotic pressure 3asalinity 3asolutes 0aPressure-Retarded Osmosis 0aHydrostatic counter-pressure 0aOsmotic pressure 0aDraw solution 0aFeed solution0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 477 p.157-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245009700161520102500258592002801283650001101311650002001322650002301342650002501365650002501390650001601415650001501431700002401446700001901470773012101489856007801610852000901688655001201697IND60794158920221123002950.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079415892DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111828742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wenhao 10aUse of Ultrasonic Cleaning Technology in the Whole Process of Fruit and Vegetable Processing  aIn an era of rapid technological development, ultrasound technology is being used in a wide range of industries.

The energy efficiency of these systems can be improved using control algorithms to determine appropriate operating points. The problem that arises is that computed operating points deviate from real operating points. This is due to deviations of the affinity laws, inaccurate information about pump characteristics, and plant behavior. In order to address this problem, we will present model-free optimization methods that can optimize various pump systems during ongoing operation. First, we will classify different pump systems. Based on this categorization, we will then analyze characteristic systems with regard to their energetic optimum. The resulting findings will enable us to identify suitable optimization algorithms. These model-free optimization algorithms take the form of an extremum seeking control in combination with a Kalman filter, the Nelder Mead algorithm, and a dynamic optimization method. After describing these algorithms, we will optimize and validate three sample classes of pump systems using the respective appropriate optimization strategy. The three classes represent a single-pump system, a multiple parallel pump system and a pump storage system. We can see that all optimization strategies achieve the energetic optimum. We can identify savings of between 7.9% and 50%, depending on the system in question. Finally, we will present a best-fit model-free optimization strategy for each class, and system operators can employ this strategy to ensure energy-optimized operation of their specific system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectric power 3aenergy efficiency 3asystem optimization 0aImproving energy efficiency 0aCentrifugal pump systems 0aModel-free optimization 0aOn-line optimization 0aOptimal control strategies1 aSchmidt-Vollus, Ronald1 aSchlücker, Eberhard0 tApplied energy.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 304 p.117311-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1173113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245014000164300001400304520150900318592002801827650001201855650002401867650001001891650001701901650000901918650001701927650001301944650001001957650001301967650001501980650001101995650001302006650001702019650001802036650002102054650002002075650001202095653001302107653002302120653002702143653001602170653001302186653001402199653002102213653001802234653002002252653002402272700002702296700002102323773011302344856007702457852000902534655001202543IND60681028020221123005600.0200113s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068102802DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2019-01092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuhl, Patrick J.10aUsing stable isotopes of plasma, red blood cells, feces, and feathers to assess mature-forest bird diet during the post-fledging period  ap. 39-46.  aPost-fledging use of early successional habitat by mature-forest birds is well-documented, but the important trophic factors driving this association remain poorly understood. We used stable isotope analysis of plasma, red blood cells, feces, and feathers to determine foraging preferences of three mature-forest bird species captured in 8-year-old clearcuts during the post-fledging period. We did not identify a significant source contribution in any consumer tissue combination using MixSIAR posterior distributions, but the position of consumer tissues in bivariate isotope mixing space suggested that all three mature-forest bird species acted as generalist insectivores during the post-fledging period. Furthermore, estimates of the proportional contribution of fruit to the overall diet were <0.13 for all Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)) tissue types, despite observational evidence of frugivory. We observed significant differentiation in core-niche-space estimates between the two obligate insectivores (Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla (Linnaeus, 1766))), suggesting that clearcuts provided adequate habitat to support the different foraging strategies and invertebrate preferences of both species. By using tissues with short turnover rates to address post-fledging trophic associations of mature-forest birds, we provide a comparison of isotopic values of multiple consumer tissue types in this context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPiranga 3aSeiurus aurocapilla 3abirds 3ablood plasma 3adiet 3aerythrocytes 3afeathers 3afeces 3aforaging 3afrugivores 3afruits 3ahabitats 3ainsectivores 3ainvertebrates 3aisotope labeling 3astable isotopes 3atissues 0aclearcut 0aearly successional 0aHelmitheros vermivorum 0aniche space 0aOvenbird 0aPasserine 0aPiranga olivacea 0apost-fledging 0aScarlet Tanager 0aWorm-eating Warbler1 aFlaherty, Elizabeth A.1 aDunning, John B.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2020, v. 98, no. 1 p.39-46dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2019-01093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011200170300001600282520103400298592002801332650001301360650002001373650001601393650004301409650001801452650001201470650000701482650001301489653002601502653001201528653001401540653005001554653001501604700001701619700001901636700001601655700002001671700001701691700001601708773010001724856008701824852000901911655001201920IND60591059720221122005449.0190516e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059105972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.02.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jicheng10aSimultaneous determination of four sesame lignans and conversion in Monascus aged vinegar using HPLC method  ap. 133-139.  aA simple, accurate and specific high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed and validated for simultaneous determination of sesamol, sesamin, asarinin and sesamolin in Monascus aged vinegar. The effects of acid hydrolysis and four heating treatments on the components content in Monascus aged vinegar were discussed. The results showed that the isomerisation of sesamin to asarinin, and decomposition of sesamolin to sesamol significantly increased, regardless of heating or acid hydrolysis. Thermal processes and acid hydrolysis increased the content of sesamol and asarinin, respectively, but severe thermal processes resulted in the loss of total sesame lignans. Sesamol and asarinin reached the highest (2.720 ± 0.202 μg/mL and 2.064 ± 0.075 μg/mL) for autoclaving (125 °C, 15 min) and acid hydrolysis (25 °C, 15 min, nature pH), respectively. Therefore, autoclaving and acid hydrolysis were considered as the optimal way to obtain higher content of sesamol and asarinin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonascus 3aacid hydrolysis 3aautoclaving 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aisomerization 3alignans 3apH 3avinegars 0aMonascus aged vinegar 0aSesamin 0aSesamolin 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 0aConversion1 aChen, Yazhen1 aTian, Jingjing1 aGe, Huifang1 aLiang, Xiaofeng1 aXiao, Jianbo1 aLin, Hetong0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 256 p.133-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.02.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245009900177300001400276500001900290520130300309592002801612650001901640650002201659650002001681650001901701650002001720650000901740650001201749650002001761650001701781650000901798650001201807650003301819650001001852650002001862650001301882650002401895651001601919700003001935700002301965773011201988856008302100852000902183655001202192IND60735634420221117015751.0210615e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073563442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurggraaf, Nikita Diante10aAnalysis of 7866 feline and canine uroliths submitted between 2014 and 2020 in the Netherlands  ap. 86-93.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnalysis of large datasets of uroliths is necessary to illustrate the prevalence and risk factors of urolithiasis. Furthermore, it may help to improve treatment and prevention of urolithiasis. In this study, 7866 uroliths (44.5% feline and 55.5% canine) from veterinary practitioners in the Netherlands between 2014 and 2020 were analysed. Between 2014 and 2020 the distribution over the different types of uroliths remained similar over time. Female cats, obese cats, Domestic Shorthair cats, female dogs, and large breed dogs had an increased risk for struvite. Neutered cats, all cat breeds except Domestic Shorthair, neutered dogs, male dogs, intact male dogs, and small breed dogs had an increased risk for calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Cystine and urate were found predominantly in male dogs. Dalmatians were at highest risk for urate urolithiasis. The findings of this study in the Netherlands were similar to findings in previous studies from different countries. However, urate urolithiasis in the English Cocker Spaniel and cystine urolithiasis in the Yorkshire Terrier were new associations. Body condition score, information about recurrence of urolithiasis, medical history, and diet history should be included in submission sheets in the future to explore other possible associations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCocker Spaniel 3aYorkshire Terrier 3abladder calculi 3abody condition 3acalcium oxalate 3acats 3acystine 3adata collection 3adiet history 3adogs 3afemales 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amales 3amedical history 3aresearch 3aveterinary medicine 3aNetherlands1 aWestgeest, Daphne Barbara1 aCorbee, Ronald Jan0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2021 July, v. 137 p.86-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245019200172300001600364520117500380592002801555650000901583650002201592650001101614650001501625650001801640650001301658650002101671650001601692653001801708653002701726653002001753653002301773653002401796700006501820700001801885773011701903856008702020852000902107655001202116IND60644183220221121180521.0190923e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064418322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarandi, Sepehr13aAn efficient auxiliary power generation system for exploiting hydrogen boil-off gas (BOG) cold exergy based on PEM fuel cell and two-stage ORC: Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic viewpoints  ap. 502-518.  aA heat recovery system is employed for power generation from a PEM fuel cell’s waste heat. The proposed system involves the parallel organic Rankine cycle for utilizing the provided heat and hydrogen boil-off gas (BOG) stream as a heat sink for the cycle. Also, this stream generates power by using an expander and prepares some chilled water that enhances system performance. The PEM fuel cell as the major component of the system is modeled and then the parallel two-stage ORC (PTORC) and BOG streams are analyzed in points of the energy and exergy view. Exergoeconomic concept is applied to evaluate the economic view of the system besides energy and exergy analyses. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed by system key parameters which provided some valuable information to comprehend the performance of the overall system. The results show that the proposed system can generate 1353 kW power. Exergoeconomic factor, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the overall system are computed to be 26.21%, 58.15%, and 36.64%, respectively. Also, it is concluded that the higher current density and lower operating temperature, will raise the total cost rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3afuel cells 3aheat recovery 3ahydrogen 3apower generation 3atemperature 0aPEM fuel cell 0aParallel two stage ORC 0aExergoeconomics 0aBoil-off gas (BOG) 0aWaste heat recovery1 aMohammadkhani, Farzad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3399-30991 aYari, Mortaza0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 195 p.502-518dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010200165300002000267520127200287592002801559650002201587650001501609650002201624650002001646650001301666650001601679650001101695650002301706650001501729700006201744773014801806856007601954852000902030655001202039IND60699380020200904000000.0200617e20200512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069938002DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c020972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpenter, John E.10aHeterogeneous Interactions Promote Crystallization and Spontaneous Resolution of Chiral Molecules  ap. 10755-10768.  aPredicting the crystallization of chiral molecules from solution is a major challenge in the chemical sciences. In this paper, we use molecular dynamics computer simulations to study the crystallization of a family of coarse-grained models of chiral molecules with a broad range of molecular shapes and interactions. Our simulations reproduce the experimental crystallization behavior of real chiral molecules, including racemic and enantiopure crystals, as well as amorphous solids. Using efficient algorithms for the packing of shapes, we enumerate millions of low-energy crystal structures for each model and analyze the thermodynamic landscape of polymorphs. In agreement with recent conjectures, our analysis shows that the ease of crystallization is largely determined by the number of competing polymorphs with low free energy. We find that this number and, hence, crystallization outcomes depend on molecular interactions in a simple way: Strongly heterogeneous interactions across molecules promote crystallization and favor the spontaneous resolution of racemic mixtures. Our results help rationalize a number of experimental observations and can provide guidance for the design of molecules and experimental conditions for desired crystallization outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aalgorithms 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aenantiomers 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aprediction1 aGrunwald, Michael,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2186-16620 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 May 12, v. 142, no. 24 p.10755-10768dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c020973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245013700159520105600296592002801352650001601380650002701396650001801423650001901441650001801460650001901478650001101497650001401508650001101522650001901533650002101552650001801573700001501591700001901606700001901625773012101644856007801765852000901843655001201852IND60794159220221122005036.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079415922DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111828812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao 10aExtraction of a Triterpene Solution and Evaluation of the Hypolipidemic Efficacy of the Pleurotus tuber-regium (Fr.)

In this study, the total triterpenes of the Pleurotus tuber-regium (Fr.) Sing Sclerotium (PTRSS) were extracted, and their hypolipidemic effects were also investigated. The infrared spectra showed that the total triterpenes were consistent with the characteristic structures of the total triterpenes before and after purification. The binding abilities of total triterpenes to sodium glycocholate, sodium taurocholate, and sodium cholate were investigated, and all of them had a good binding ability to cholate. In vivo experiments showed that zebrafish tolerated the total triterpenes from the mushroom nuclei at a maximum concentration of 500 µg/mL. A correlation analysis showed that the total triterpenes from the mushroom nuclei reduced the lipid accumulation in zebrafish induced by a high-fat diet, and the lipid-lowering effect showed a correlation with dose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aPleurotus tuber-regium 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3ahigh fat diet 3alipemic effect 3alipids 3amushrooms 3asodium 3asodium cholate 3ataurocholic acid 3atriterpenoids1 aLiu, Yuan 1 aLan, Yuanhong 1 aYuan, Jianing 0 tFoods.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111828813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245007200179300001600251500000900267500001500276520202900291592002802320650001902348650001602367650001902383650002802402650001502430650001302445650002002458650002302478650002002501653001002521653002102531773012102552852000902673856009802682655001202780IND9300455620221119151023.0191122e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930045562DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, W.

Men-.] genotypes can have different levels of specific dry matter accumulation rate (SDMAR) and specific seed density (SSD) under greenhouse growing conditions, but the relevance of these measures for field-grown plants is not known. The objectives of this research were to interrelate these measures as they reflect characteristics of the developing soybean seed and to determine their association with seed-yield potential. As the seed matured, SSD increased ⊄0.01 g cm⁻³ d⁻¹. Differences in this rate of change were positively associated with SDMAR. Genotypes selected for increased, as compared with decreased, seed-filling duration had lower SDMAR and lower rate of change in SSD (decreased seed maturation rate) and greater seed yield under favorable field conditions. However, the yield advantage was lost under environments having drought stress during the reproductive period. Selections for high seed protein content exhibited an apparent increased seed-maturation rate and a reduced seed yield. Divergent selection for SSD produced major shifts in SSD at the 55% seed-filling stage. In contrast, the modified reproductive period selections and the seed protein selections had only secondary differences for SSD at that seed-filling stage, indicating that the low SSD selections initiated delayed seed maturation at an earlier stage of seed development. While the low SSD selections had the reduced seed-maturation rates, they did not express the expected yield advantage. Under drought stress, they exhibited lower seed number and seed yield than the modified reproductive period and high SSD selections. The stage of maturity for initiating delayed maturation appeared important. The proposed desirable genotype maintained specific dry matter accumulation rate during early seed fill but shifted to reduced seed maturation rate at a later stage of seed development.

SEM spectra indicated that the cross section of the hollow fiber membrane had an asymmetrical structure that consisted of a dense outer surface acting as a selectively layer, a spongy-like transition layer, and finger-like microvoids close to the inner surface. The average pore size and molecular weight cut-off, which were estimated using the solute rejection method, were 0.404nm and 904Da, respectively. The PFOS rejection experiments were carried out at the trans-membrane pressures ranging from 4×10⁵Pa to 1.0×10⁶Pa and PFOS concentrations from 50μg/L to 500μg/L. In all cases, the PFOS rejections were found to be increased as the PFOS concentration increased. The impact of the pH value and Ca²⁺ concentration of the feed solution on the PFOS rejections was studied in detail. The PFOS rejections improved from 91.17% to 97.49% with an increase in pH from 3.2 to 9.5 at 4×10⁵Pa. An increase of Ca²⁺ concentration from 0.1mM to 2mM enhanced PFOS rejection from 97.10% to 99.40% at a trans-membrane pressure of 4×10⁵Pa. The sorption/desorption experiments indicated that the amount of PFOS adsorbed on the membrane surface was five times higher in the presence of Ca²⁺ (2mM). AFM experiments also demonstrated that the membrane surface was rough with the addition of Ca²⁺. Hence, the presence of Ca²⁺ enhanced the PFOS adsorption in the membrane surface and caused more pore blockage of the membrane. As such, the declination in the water flux and augmentation in the PFOS rejection were observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aartificial membranes 3acalcium 3adesorption 3amolecular weight 3ananofiltration 3apH 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolutes 3aspinning 0aNanofiltration 0aHollow fiber membrane 0aPFOS removal1 aZhao, Changwei1 aLi, Pei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1548-42181 aLi, Ye1 aWang, Jun0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 477 p.74-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006800174300001600242520107900258592002801337650001301365650001401378650001601392650000901408650002501417650001601442651001801458653001301476653001601489653002501505653002001530653001901550700002101569773009201590856008401682852000901766655001201775IND60547532420221120095427.0160903s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054753242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2013.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Paola, Francesco10aCoupled Spatial Distribution of Rainfall and Temperature in USA  ap. 178-187.  aIn the last decades, the international scientific literature has focused on the assessment and quantification of trends in average temperature and rainfall, underlining changes in time and space sometimes relevant. The changes concern the yearly average values, the seasonal distribution, the daily values, with marked differences both at a continental and national scale.In this paper, with reference to a database containing the records of about 8000 thermometric stations and 12000 rainfall stations for the period 1895-1997 for the USA, available on the website of the Institute for Mathematics Applied to Geosciences (http://www.image.ucar.edu/Data/US.monthly.met/), an analysis on the spatial correlation between the yearly average rainfall hc and the mean of the yearly average ground temperature T was performed. In particular, with the aid of the copula distribution function, a stochastic model to define the conditional probability distribut *ion P(hc(mm)|T(°C)) was developed, analyzing the dependence of the yearly average rainfall on the thermometric changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adatabases 3aprobability 3arain 3astochastic processes 3atemperature 3aUnited States 0aRainfall 0aTemperature 0aSpatial distribution 0aCopula function 0aClimate change1 aGiugni, Maurizio0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2013, v. 19 p.178-187dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245004900166300001600215500002900231520077800260592002801038650000901066650001101075650002201086650001701108650001301125650001701138773012401155856008001279852000901359655001201368IND60688632120221121125733.0200416e20020801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068863212DNAL7 a10.1080/09614502201496902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelleher, David10aOrganisational learning: A borrowed toolbox?  ap. 312-320.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aLearning organisations and their focus on fundamental change have been seen as having considerable potential for making organisations more gender equitable and improving their capacity to undertake development or human rights work that is not gender biased.

An understanding of VZV neurotropism in humans has long been hampered by the lack of an adequate animal model. For example, experimental inoculation of VZV in small animals including guinea pigs and cotton rats results in the infection of ganglia but not a rash. The severe combined immune deficient human (SCID-hu) model allows the study of VZV neurotropism for human neural sub-populations. Simian varicella virus (SVV) infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely resembles both human primary VZV infection and reactivation, with analyses at early times after infection providing valuable information about the extent of viral replication and the host immune responses. Indeed, a critical role for CD4 T-cell immunity during acute SVV infection as well as reactivation has emerged based on studies using RM. Herein we discuss the results of efforts from different groups to establish an animal model of VZV neurotropism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCercopithecine alphaherpesvirus 9 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 3 3aMacaca mulatta 3aSigmodon 3aanimal diseases 3aanimal models 3aanimal viruses 3acarrier state 3aganglia 3aguinea pigs 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3avirus replication1 aGershon, Anne 1 aGershon, Michael 1 aCohen, Jeffrey  I.1 aArvin, Ann 1 aZerboni, Leigh 1 aZhu, Hua 1 aGray, Wayne 1 aMessaoudi, Ilhem 1 aTraina-Dorge, Vicki 0 tViruses.g2019 May 31, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110605023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245008200212300002000294520129800314592002801612650000801640650001301648650001401661650001701675650002601692650002201718650001601740650001401756650001301770650002101783650002101804650001401825650001001839651001801849700002001867700002201887700001801909700002501927700002301952700002301975773013101998856008402129852000902213655001202222IND60659465120221119170231.0190823e20190717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065946512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b016382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKammer, Michael N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7912-845010aQuantification of Opioids in Urine Using an Aptamer-Based Free-Solution Assay  ap. 10582-10588.  aThe opioid epidemic continues in the United States. Many have been impacted by this epidemic, including neonates who exhibit Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). Opioid diagnosis and NAS can be negatively impacted by limited testing options outside the hospital, due to poor assay performance, false-negatives, rapid drug clearance rates, and difficulty in obtaining enough specimen for testing. Here we report a small volume urine assay for oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, noroxycodone, norhydrocodone, and norfentanyl with excellent LODs and LOQs. The free-solution assay (FSA), coupled with high affinity DNA aptamer probes and a compensated interferometric reader (CIR), represents a potential solution for quantifying opioids rapidly, at high sensitivity, and noninvasively on small sample volumes. The mix-and-read test is 5- to 275-fold and 50- to 1250-fold more sensitive than LC-MS/MS and immunoassays, respectively. Using FSA, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and their urinary metabolites were quantified using 10 μL of urine at 28–81 pg/mL, with >95% specificity and excellent accuracy in ∼1 h. The assay sensitivity, small sample size requirement, and speed could enable opioid screening, particularly for neonates, and points to the potential for pharmacokinetic tracking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3afentanyl 3ahospitals 3aimmunoassays 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3anarcotics 3aneonates 3aoligonucleotides 3apharmacokinetics 3ascreening 3aurine 3aUnited States1 aKussrow, Amanda1 aGandhi, Ilavarasi1 aDrabek, Rafal1 aBatchelor, Robert H.1 aJackson, George W.1 aBornhop, Darryl J.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 July 17, v. 91, no. 16 p.10582-10588dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b016383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245010300160300001600263520114600279592002801425650002701453650001601480650001301496650001101509650001201520650002301532650001401555650001001569650002201579650001001601651001001611653001401621653002701635653002201662653001001684653001601694700002001710700001901730773008501749856007801834852000901912655001201921IND60128293620221122033049.0151115e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012829362DNAL7 a10.3106/041.038.03062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Gen10aRelative Skull Growth of the Sperm Whale, Physeter macrocephalus, with a Note of Sexual Dimorphism  ap. 177-186.  aBy using skulls of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), we analyzed the relative growth of skull length in relation to that of body length. We also analyzed the growth of various parts of the skull in relation to skull length. We used data of 3 males and 1 female collected off the coast of Japan and those of 4 males reported previously. In males, the proportion of skull length to body length increased with growth from 26% (body length, 10 m) to 32% (body length, over 16 m, most of which were considered as physically mature). In contrast, the proportion reached less than 25% in the physically mature female. In males, the relative length of the rostrum and the mandible to skull length increased with growth, and the posterior margin of the occipital bone tended to protrude posteriorly. This posterior protrusion could be considered as a secondary sexual dimorphism observed only in the skull of physically mature males. These characteristics would be associated with sex differences and deep diving as well as to the life style and breeding strategy of sperm whales, a species in which males physically compete for breeding rights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyseter macrocephalus 3abody length 3abreeding 3acoasts 3afemales 3agender differences 3alifestyle 3amales 3asexual dimorphism 3askull 3aJapan 0aallometry 0aPhyseter macrocephalus 0asexual dimorphism 0askull 0asperm whale1 aZenitani, Ryoko1 aKato, Hidehiro0 tMammal study.g2013 Sept., v. 38, no. 3 p.177-186dUniBio Pressx1343-41527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3106%2F041.038.03063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010200167300001600269520171900285592002802004650003402032650001002066650002102076650001802097650003102115650001602146650001802162650001702180650001802197650003002215650002402245650001402269650000902283650001302292650002802305650001402333653001502347653002802362653001802390700006102408700002002469700001902489700002102508700001902529700001902548700001902567773011502586856008202701852000902783655001202792IND60716391220221118110205.0201202e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071639122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgr.2017.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min Kyoung10aAntinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of ginsenoside Rf in a rat model of incisional pain  ap. 183-191.  aGinseng saponin has long been used as a traditional Asian medicine and is known to be effective in treating various kinds of pain. Ginsenoside Rf is one of the biologically active saponins found in ginseng. We evaluated ginsenoside Rf’s antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects, and its mechanism of action on adrenergic and serotonergic receptors, in an incisional pain model.Mechanical hyperalgesia was induced via plantar incision in rats followed by intraperitoneal administration of increasing doses of ginsenoside Rf (vehicle, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, and 2 mg/kg). The antinociceptive effect was also compared in a Positive Control Group that received a ketorolac (30 mg/kg) injection, and the Naïve Group, which did not undergo incision. To evaluate the mechanism of action, rats were treated with prazosin (1 mg/kg), yohimbine (2 mg/kg), or ketanserin (1 mg/kg) prior to receiving ginsenoside Rf (1.5 mg/kg). The mechanical withdrawal threshold was measured using von Frey filaments at various time points before and after ginsenoside Rf administration. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect, serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrotizing factor-α levels were measured.Ginsenoside Rf increased the mechanical withdrawal threshold significantly, with a curvilinear dose–response curve peaking at 1.5 mg/kg. IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrotizing factor-α levels significantly decreased after ginsenoside Rf treatment. Ginsenoside Rf’s antinociceptive effect was reduced by yohimbine, but potentiated by prazosin and ketanserin.Intraperitoneal ginsenoside Rf has an antinociceptive effect peaking at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Anti-inflammatory effects were also detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPanax 3aanalgesic effect 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood serum 3adose response 3aginsenosides 3ainterleukin-6 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amechanism of action 3aneoplasms 3apain 3aresearch 3asomatosensory disorders 3ayohimbine 0aanalgesics 0aantiinflammatory agents 0apostoperative1 aKang, Hyun-Chung,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2844-58801 aBaek, Chong Wha1 aJung, Yong Hun1 aWoo, Young Cheol1 aChoi, Geun Joo1 aShin, Hwa Yong1 aKim, Kyung Soo0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2018 Apr., v. 42, no. 2 p.183-191dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2017.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009900171300001600270520205200286592002802338650001702366650001302383650001502396650002002411650002002431650001102451650001202462650001202474650002302486650002002509650000902529650002102538650000902559650001802568650001202586650001002598651001602608653003102624653003502655653002202690700001902712700002102731700001902752700001902771773011302790856008302903852000902986655001202995IND60535439020221123011002.0190403e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053543902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2014.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassey, Joseph H.10aFarmer adaptation of intermittent flooding using multiple-inlet rice irrigation in Mississippi  ap. 297-304.  aAlthough intermittent flooding of rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been shown to significantly reduce irrigation demand, farmer adoption is limited in the United States where continuous flooding remains standard practice. This limited extent of adoption stems in part from a number of scalability and agronomic concerns. This study used replicated trials established in farmer-managed fields to determine if intermittent flooding can be successfully adapted to commercial-scale rice production in Mississippi. When intermittent flooding was coupled with multiple-inlet rice irrigation (MIRI), the quantities and qualities of yields were maintained or increased for five commercial rice varieties and one hybrid, relative to continuously-flooded controls. Only CL151 exhibited a decrease in total head rice when milled, this after being subjected to five or more wetting and drying cycles over ≈80 day flood periods. Water use over three years averaged 32% less than comparable MIRI systems not using intermittent flooding. These results demonstrate that intermittent flooding can be successfully adapted by producers to commercial-scale and that 600mm irrigation is an achievable goal for rice grown on clay soils in Mississippi. The positive yield responses of CL162 to intermittent flooding and pre-flood urea-nitrogen support research showing that rice benefits from carefully managed wetting- and drying-periods when used in conjunction with effective pest management. The success of these producers at adapting intermittent rice flooding to commercial scale can be attributed in part to their having comprehensive weed and disease management programs, proficiency in using MIRI, and reliable irrigation systems with ample well capacities that allowed rapid flood establishment. Even partial adoption of intermittent rice flooding can increase rainfall capture and reduce demand for irrigation. In turn, this could help to alleviate overdraft of the Mississippi River Valley Alluvial aquifer, a resource of national and international significance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aaquifers 3aclay soils 3acrop production 3adisease control 3adrying 3afarmers 3ahybrids 3airrigation systems 3apest management 3arain 3aresearch support 3arice 3aurea nitrogen 3avalleys 3aweeds 3aMississippi 0aIntermittent rice flooding 0aMultiple-inlet rice irrigation 0aFarmer adaptation1 aWalker, Tim W.1 aAnders, Merle M.1 aSmith, M.

Various strategies for adaptation to climate change have been proposed. In this paper we examine the prospects of what we call the ‘transgenic adaptation strategy’, i.e. the appeal to use transgenic seeds to adapt to climate change, through the lens of smallholder maize farming in Mexico. Landraces are the bedrock of maize production in Mexico. We consider how maize farmers may respond to climate change and the effects of those responses on crop diversity. In this paper, we argue that the promotion of the transgenic adaptation strategy is problematic for biological and social reasons. Smallholder livelihoods in southern Mexico could suffer a disproportionate negative impact if transgenic technology is privileged as a response to climate change. Agroecological and evolutionary approaches to addressing the effects of climate change on smallholder agriculture provides an alternative adaptive strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop production 3afarmers 3afarms 3alandraces 3alivelihood 3aseeds 3aMexico1 aPerales, Hugo R.1 aWainwright, Joel D.0 tGlobal environmental change.g2012 May, v. 22, no. 2 p.495-504dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012400155520107100279592002801350650001701378650001101395650002001406650002301426651001001449651001301459700001201472773012801484856007301612852000901685655001201694IND60652043620221118212618.0190712e20170921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065204362DNAL7 a10.3390/su91016812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jiabin10aDoes a Certain Rule Exist in the Long-Term Change of a City’s Livability? Evidence from New York, Tokyo, and Shanghai  aLivability is the ultimate goal of city development. However, the question of whether the changing pattern of a city’s livability follows a certain rule or not has seldom been argued. To address the question, three cities, including New York, Tokyo, and Shanghai are selected for case studies. Based on a proposed assessment framework, the long-term trend and determinants of three cities’ livability are quantified and investigated. The results suggest that the livability of three cities demonstrates a similar changing pattern during the last decades, with the level going through a three-staged N-curve development, increasing at the beginning, then declining in the mid-term, and rebounding afterward. It implies that the staged development rule should be followed when constructing a livable city. Efforts should be targeted towards the most underlying aspects in different periods. The empirical analysis of the three cities ascertains the existence of a development rule regarding livability, and suggests many potential uses for decision-making support.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3adecision making 3aempirical research 3aChina 3aNew York1 aHan, Ji0 tSustainability.g2017 Sept. 21, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su91016813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245006300162300002000225520166100245592002801906650000801934650001501942650001801957650002101975650001601996650002202012650001002034650001602044650001902060650001902079650001702098650000902115650001202124650001702136650001802153650001502171650001102186650001502197650002002212650002402232650001302256650001702269700001802286700001602304700001302320700001502333700001202348700001702360700001702377700001602394773011302410856008602523852000902609655001202618IND60530046920221120235903.0160720e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053004692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b025232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jie10aOne-Step Protein Conjugation to Upconversion Nanoparticles  ap. 10406-10413.  aThe emerging upconversion nanoparticles offer a fascinating library of ultrasensitive luminescent probes for a range of biotechnology applications from biomarker discovery to single molecule tracking, early disease diagnosis, deep tissue imaging, and drug delivery and therapies. The effective bioconjugation of inorganic nanoparticles to the molecule-specific proteins, free of agglomeration, nonspecific binding, or biomolecule deactivation, is crucial for molecular recognition of target molecules or cells. The current available protocols require multiple steps which can lead to low probe stability, specificity, and reproducibility. Here we report a simple and rapid protein bioconjugation method based on a one-step ligand exchange using the DNAs as the linker. Our method benefits from the robust DNA–protein conjugates as well as from multiple ions binding capability. Protein can be preconjugated via an amino group at the 3′ end of a synthetic DNA molecule, so that the 5′ end phosphoric acid group and multiple phosphate oxygen atoms in the phosphodiester bonds are exposed to replace the oleic acid ligands on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles due to their stronger chelating capability to lanthanides. We demonstrated that our method can efficiently pull out the upconversion nanoparticles from organic solvent into an aqueous phase. The upconversion nanoparticles then become hydrophilic, stable, and specific biomolecules recognition. This allows us to successfully functionalize the upconversion nanoparticles with horseradish peroxidise (HRP) for catalytic colorimetric assay and for streptavidin (SA)–biotin immunoassays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3abiotechnology 3achemical bonding 3acolorimetry 3adisease diagnosis 3adrugs 3ahorseradish 3ahydrophilicity 3aimage analysis 3aimmunoassays 3aions 3aligands 3aluminescence 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3aphosphoric acid 3arare earth elements 3asolvents 3astreptavidin1 aChen, Yinghui1 aLiu, Deming1 aRen, Wei1 aLu, Yiqing1 aShi, Yu1 aPiper, James1 aPaulsen, Ian1 aJin, Dayong0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 87, no. 20 p.10406-10413dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b025233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245014000197300001500337520190300352592002802255650001302283650001202296650002402308650002002332650002402352650001702376650002802393650001902421650001302440650000902453650002702462650001802489700002602507700002302533773015202556856006902708856009902777990002302876852000902899655001202908IND60644018620221119070004.0190514e20160620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064401862DNAL7 a10.3791/539122doi7 aPMC49932462pmcid7 a274037232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiomek, Gabriela10aMeasurement of calcium fluctuations within the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cultured smooth muscle cells using fret-based confocal imaging  ap. e53912.  aMaintenance of steady-state calcium (Ca2+) levels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is vital to their overall health. A significant portion of intracellular Ca2+ content is found within the SR stores in VSMCs. As the only intracellular organelle with a close association to the surrounding extracellular space through plasma membrane-SR junctions, the SR can be considered to constitute the first line of response to any irregularity in Ca2+ transients, or stress experienced by the cell. Among its many functions, one of the most important is its role in the transmission of Ca2+-regulated signals throughout the cell to induce further cell-wide reactions downstream. The more common use of cytoplasmic Ca2+ indicators in this regard is overall insufficient for research into the highly dynamic changes to the intraluminal SR Ca2+ store that have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for the direct and clear measurement of luminal SR Ca2+. This tool is useful for investigation into the nuanced changes in SR Ca2+ that have significant subsequent effects on the normal function and health of the cell. Fluctuations in SR Ca2+ content specifically can provide us with a significant amount of information pertaining to cellular responses to disease or stress conditions experienced by the cell. In this method, a modified version of a SR-targeted Ca2+ indicator, D1SR, is used to detect Ca2+ fluctuations in response to the introduction of agents to cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Following incubation with the D1SR indicator, confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based imaging are used to directly observe changes to intraluminal SR Ca2+ levels under control conditions and with the addition of agonist agents that function to induce intracellular Ca2+ movement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acalcium 3aconfocal microscopy 3aenergy transfer 3aextracellular space 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3aimage analysis 3amyocytes 3arats 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 3asmooth muscle1 avan Breemen, Cornelis1 aEsfandiarei, Mitra0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 June 20, , no. 112 p.e53912-e53912dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/539123Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53912/measurement-calcium-fluctuations-within-sarcoplasmic-reticulum  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03669naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245009900200300001800299506007600317520178800393592002802181506003702209650002802246650002602274650001102300650001302311650001202324650002202336650002202358650001402380650001902394650002402413650001602437650002302453650001702476650001802493650001402511650001102525650001402536700002302550700002002573700001702593700001802610700002402628700002102652700002202673700002402695700002202719700002102741700002102762700002402783700002002807773013002827856007702957852000903034655001203043IND60132380420221207113629.0150505e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013238042DNAL7 a10.1128/mBio.00019-132doi7 aPMC35658302pmcid7 a233864322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Xu-Xia10aStructural and Functional Analysis of the Pore-Forming Toxin NetB from Clostridium perfringens  ap. e00019-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClostridium perfringens is an anaerobic bacterium that causes numerous important human and animal diseases, primarily as a result of its ability to produce many different protein toxins. In chickens, C. perfringens causes necrotic enteritis, a disease of economic importance to the worldwide poultry industry. The secreted pore-forming toxin NetB is a key virulence factor in the pathogenesis of avian necrotic enteritis and is similar to alpha-hemolysin, a β-barrel pore-forming toxin from Staphylococcus aureus . To address the molecular mechanisms underlying NetB-mediated tissue damage, we determined the crystal structure of the monomeric form of NetB to 1.8 Å. Structural comparisons with other members of the alpha-hemolysin family revealed significant differences in the conformation of the membrane binding domain. These data suggested that NetB may recognize different membrane receptors or use a different mechanism for membrane-protein interactions. Consistent with this idea, electrophysiological experiments with planar lipid bilayers revealed that NetB formed pores with much larger single-channel conductance than alpha-hemolysin. Channel conductance varied with phospholipid net charge. Furthermore, NetB differed in its ion selectivity, preferring cations over anions. Using hemolysis as a screen, we carried out a random-mutagenesis study that identified several residues that are critical for NetB-induced cell lysis. Mapping of these residues onto the crystal structure revealed that they were clustered in regions predicted to be required for oligomerization or membrane binding. Together these data provide an insight into the mechanism of NetB-mediated pore formation and will contribute to our understanding of the mode of action of this important toxin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium perfringens 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanions 3abacteria 3acations 3acrystal structure 3aelectrophysiology 3ahemolysis 3alipid bilayers 3amechanism of action 3amutagenesis 3anecrotic enteritis 3apathogenesis 3aphospholipids 3areceptors 3atoxins 3avirulence1 aPorter, Corrine J.1 aHardy, Simon P.1 aSteer, David1 aSmith, A.

Co²⁺ was linked onto HRP/ABEI/Co²⁺-CaCO₃ MPs through both coordination and electrostatic interactions, while ABEI and HRP were encapsulated into HRP/ABEI/Co²⁺-CaCO₃ MPs via electrostatic interaction and adsorption. The as-prepared HRP/ABEI/Co²⁺-CaCO₃ MPs possessed a spherical shape with a mean size of 1.3 ± 0.3 μm and porous structure. They exhibited highly intensive “glow-type” CL emission, which was visible by naked eyes in a dark room for 10 h. The HRP/ABEI/Co²⁺-CaCO₃ with dual catalytic system produced more intensive “glow-type” CL emission in the first 3 h as compared with ABEI/Co²⁺-CaCO₃ and HRP/ABEI/CaCO₃, both of which merely possessed a single catalyst in their systems. Moreover, the CL intensity of HRP/ABEI/Co²⁺-CaCO₃ MPs during the first hour outperforms all the previously reported long-lasting chemiluminescence-functionalized micro/nanomaterials (CF-M/NMs), such as the firefly-mimicking intensive and long-lasting ABEI/Co²⁺/chitosan hydrogels. The outstanding CL performance of HRP/ABEI/Co²⁺-CaCO₃ MPs is attributed to high loading of CL reagents and catalysts in CaCO₃ MPs and high catalytic efficiency and good stability of the dual catalytic system consisting of Co²⁺ complex and HRP. The HRP/ABEI/Co²⁺-CaCO₃ MPs are neutral materials with highly intensive and persistent emission as well as good biocompatibility, rendering them excellent biomaterials for various bioassays. We envisage that this excellent material holds great promise in vast application fields, such as bioassays, bioimaging, environmental monitoring, and life science etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abioassays 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acalcium carbonate 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemiluminescence 3achitosan 3acobalt 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahydrogels 3amicroparticles 3ananomaterials 3aperoxidase1 aShen, Wen1 aCui, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4769-94640 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 July 18, v. 91, no. 16 p.10614-10621dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b017743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245006200162300001800224520057300242592002800815650003700843650002800880650002100908650000900929650001300938650002300951650001300974700002600987700001801013700001701031700002301048700002001071773009901091856007501190852000901265655001201274IND60576505320171214000000.0170804e20120313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057650532DNAL7 a10.1021/la204713s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfonso, Mónica

(Coleoptera: Tenebrionidaea) isolated from peanut in post-harvest in Benin. Chemical analysis of essential oils by GC and GC-MS indicated that, in the volatile extracts, different groups of terpene and terpenoid were present. The results of contact toxicity tests indicated that at a concentration of 0.5 µl of essential oil/g of peanut the mortality rate of Tenebroides mauritanicus (L.) is 100% after 24 h for the essential oil of Hyptis suaveolens, while it is still at 20% for the essential oil of Ocimum canum. Results also indicated that Hyptis suaveolens oil has a high repellent activity, when compared to the essential oil of Ocimum canum. This essential oil with high repellent and insecticidal properties represents a novel approach in the protection of grains against T. mauritanicus and the reduction of post-harvest losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyptis suaveolens 3aOcimum americanum 3aTenebroides mauritanicus 3achemical analysis 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrains 3ainsecticidal properties 3aleaves 3amortality 3aoils 3apeanuts 3apostharvest losses 3aterpenoids 3atoxicity testing 3aBenin1 aChougourou, Daniel1 aSoumanou, Mohamed M.0 tJournal für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit.g2019 Mar., v. 14, no. 1 p.25-30dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000096x1661-57517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00003-018-1195-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245014800199500002000347520156300367592002801930596007801958596006802036650002002104650001802124650001902142650001202161650001902173650001302192650001502205650001902220650001302239650001102252650001402263650002102277650001502298651001002313651001802323700001502341700005802356773013602414856007702550852000902627655001202636IND60782309820221116155552.0220707e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078230982DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JF0057672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Ruohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0303-311810aIncision History of the Three Gorges, Yangtze River Constrained From Inversion of River Profiles and Low‐Temperature Thermochronological Data  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe reconstruct the incision history of bedrock rivers based on inverse modeling of the long profile of a river channel and the low‐temperature thermochronological data. Our approach first infers an erodibility‐dependent incision history through a linear inversion of the channel elevations of the river. Then to calibrate the reconstructed incision history in the geological timescale, we constrain the erosional efficiency by optimizing the erosion process of the river catchment using a Bayesian analysis, such that the exhumation and cooling paths of bedrocks in the catchment conform to the observed thermochronological ages. We apply this approach to estimate the incision history of the Three Gorges, Yangtze River in East Asia. We modeled the incision histories of three tributaries on the mainstem Yangtze River near the eastern end of the Three Gorges area, assuming that the gorge incision was driven by increased upstream drainage area of the Upper Yangtze (Scenario 1) or local tectonic uplift (Scenario 2). The results of both scenarios suggest an early Miocene onset of the incision of Three Gorges, that is, 18 ± 6 Ma or 21 ± 4 Ma, respectively. During the Pliocene, our models suggest a significant decrease in the gorge incision rate. By comparing the estimated gorge incision history to the late Cenozoic denudation of the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the regional climate change, we suggest that the incision of the Three Gorges has been heavily affected by the development of the Upper Yangtze River and the East Asian monsoon.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019‐00243cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a1961134031cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) 3aBayesian theory 3aMiocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3abedrock 3aclimate change 3adrainage 3ageophysics 3amonsoon season 3aresearch 3arivers 3atectonics 3athermochronology 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aYang, Rong1 aYuan, Xiaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0568-90250 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Mar., v. 126, no. 3 p.e2020JF005767-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JF0057673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014100167300002000308520094000328592002801268650001601296650002101312650001601333650000901349650001901358650001101377650001301388650002201401650001801423650001701441650001101458700001501469700001701484773011301501856008601614852000901700655001201709IND60530047320221121000452.0160720e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053004732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b025592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Xiaoqing10aThiols-Induced Rapid Photoluminescent Enhancement of Glutathione-Capped Gold Nanoparticles for Intracellular Thiols Imaging Applications  ap. 10230-10236.  aThe rapid detection and imaging of intracellular thiols is of great importance during the occurrence and development of some chronic diseases. Here we demonstrate the rapid thiols-induced photoluminescence (PL) enhancement of the low luminescent glutathione (GSH) stabilized Au nanoparticles, AuGSH (low). The dynamic PL investigation reveals that the PL enhancement fits a first-order reaction model. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic and mass spectroscopic results indicate that AuGSH (low) are mainly comprised of “thiols-insufficient” Au species and the additional thiols can efficiently attach to the “unsaturated” surface of Au nanoparticles, accompanied by significant PL enhancement. The noncytotoxic AuGSH (low) probe can be successfully applied for imaging of intracellular thiols. Generally, this work illustrates the great prospects of facile-prepared AuGSH (low) as a candidate for thiols labeling and imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3achronic diseases 3aglutathione 3agold 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3ananogold 3aphotoluminescence 3arapid methods 3aspectroscopy 3athiols1 aJiang, Hui1 aWang, Xuemei0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 87, no. 20 p.10230-10236dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b025593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245009500165300001400260520168400274592002801958650001501986650001402001650002002015650002402035650001202059650002602071650001102097650002602108650001602134650001502150650002102165650002602186650001302212650001402225650002502239653001302264653001502277653002302292653001602315653001502331700001802346773011402364856008402478852000902562655001202571IND60535439620221122234906.0190403e20150131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053543962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2014.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahil, M.H.10aEffects of different irrigation regimes on yield and water use efficiency of cucumber crop  ap. 10-15.  aThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of four irrigation regimes on yield, growth parameters and water use efficiency of cucumber crop under greenhouse cultivation. A field experiment was carried out at the experimental farm of Palestine Technical University Kadoorie, located at Tulkarm, Palestine. Cucumber seedlings were planted on 14 February 2012 in greenhouse at a rate of 1500 seedlings per 1000 square meters. Four irrigation regimes were examined during the growing period as follows: farmer irrigation (FI), tensiometer based irrigation (TI), irrigation at full ETc data (ETc), and irrigation at 70% of ETc (70% ETc). Plant data were collected during the growing period for evaluating the total yield, plant height, number of harvested fruits per plant, weight of harvested fruits per plant, dry matter of above and under ground parts.The results indicated that the 70% ETc treatment obtained the highest crop yield followed by ETc, FI, and TI treatments, respectively. On average, cucumber yield under 70% ETc treatment was 24%, 6% and 4% higher than that under TI, FI and ETc treatments, respectively. At the end of harvesting stage plant height, above-ground dry matter obtained by 70% ETc treatment was higher than the other treatments. The smallest plant height and dry matter was obtained under TI treatment. Results also indicated that, when using scheduled irrigation methods large amount of water were saved and found to be 139, 104 and 26mm for TI, 70% ETc and ETc treatments, respectively, compared to FI treatment. The highest water use efficiency (WUE) was obtained under 70% ETc treatment followed by ETc, TI and FI treatments, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3acucumbers 3adata collection 3ademonstration farms 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3afruits 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3aharvesting 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3awater use efficiency 0aCucumber 0aGreenhouse 0aEvapotranspiration 0aTensiometer 0aDry matter1 aQanadillo, A.0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Jan. 31, v. 148 p.10-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2014.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245017400159300001300333520135900346592002801705650002301733650002301756650001701779650001201796650001401808650002201822650002601844650001301870650001501883650001501898650000901913650002501922650001301947653002301960653001101983653002001994653002202014653002602036700002202062700001902084700002202103700002402125773008102149856007802230852000902308655001202317IND60128294520221120111547.0151115e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012829452DNAL7 a10.3106/041.039.01022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Jun J.12aA Few Decades of Habitat Fragmentation has Reduced Population Genetic Diversity: A Case Study of Landscape Genetics of the Large Japanese Field Mouse, Apodemus speciosus  ap. 1-10.  aThe effects of a few decades of habitat fragmentation on the population genetic diversity of the large Japanese field mouse, Apodemus speciosus, in the forest region around Fukuyama University was assessed with approximate 300 bp nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial D-loop region. Two independently isolated internal populations within the campus showed a smaller number of haplotypes and lower haplotype and nucleotide diversity indices compared to those inhabiting a wide external forest area. Based on the Hst index, significant genetic differentiation was observed between geographically closely residing external and internal populations but not between distantly residing external populations, suggesting the presence of strong physical barriers between the external and internal populations. Fine-scale changes in the landscape configuration recorded in aerial photographs of Fukuyama University revealed plausible physical barriers and a correlation between isolation time and genetic diversity. The results suggest that the population genetic properties of forest dwelling mammals are sensitive to a few decades of short-term forest fragmentation created by artificial construction. Exploitation by humans should be conducted in harmony with wildlife ecology, such as by maintaining corridors, to achieve a wide habitat area for gene flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus speciosus 3aaerial photography 3acase studies 3aforests 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3ahaplotypes 3alandscapes 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3awildlife 0aApodemus speciosus 0aD-loop 0aextinction risk 0agenetic diversity 0ahabitat fragmentation1 aKawakami, Tsukasa1 aTasaka, Yurina1 aTamenishi, Masaya1 aYamaguchi, Yasunori0 tMammal study.g2014 Mar., v. 1, no. 39 p.1-10dUniBio Pressx1343-41527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3106%2F041.039.01023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245010600210300002000316520156400336592002801900650002501928650002301953650001001976650001501986700002602001773013102027856008402158852000902242655001202251IND60659466020190927000000.0190823e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065946602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b018722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowak, Paweł M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9006-574210aWhat Color Is Your Method? Adaptation of the RGB Additive Color Model to Analytical Method Evaluation  ap. 10343-10352.  aEvaluation of an analytical method is a fundamental problem in analytical chemistry, and it is never straightforward. In this article, we show a perspective for facing this issue using an original tool. We propose a model that allows one to evaluate any analytical method/procedure in a global manner. It refers to the RGB additive color model and uses three primary colors to represent three main attributes of the evaluated method: analytical performance – Red, compliance with the “green” chemistry principles – Green, and productivity/practical effectiveness – Blue. A final color of the method results from the additive synthesis of the primary colors. To simplify classifications, we propose the set of nine final colors of the method (white, magenta, cyan, yellow, red, green, blue, colorless/gray, and black). The model provides also a quantitative parameter, named the “method brilliance”, which integrates all primary colors and treats them with varying importance, adjusted to the evaluation context and subjective user preferences. The evaluation is performed using standard Excel worksheets interpretable “at-a-glance” and adjustable to the particular method specifications. We discuss the opportunities offered by this model, potential obstacles, and related countermeasures, as well as future perspectives for its utilization. The paper shows also examples of using the model for the evaluation of real methods. We believe that the model can be applied not only in analytical science but also in other chemical subdisciplines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanalytical methods 3acolor 3acompliance1 aKościelniak, Paweł,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 July 15, v. 91, no. 16 p.10343-10352dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b018723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011200171300001400283520104800297592002801345650004401373650001501417650001101432650001201443650001301455650002001468650001701488650004101505650002101546650001301567650001201580650001101592650001301603650001601616650002001632650001401652650001601666650002301682653003601705653003001741653001301771653001201784653001901796700001401815700001301829700001601842700001401858700001501872700001601887700001601903700001701919773010401936856008702040852000902127655001202136IND60629276320221119020851.0190409e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062927632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhiqiang10aThermal characteristics and product formation mechanism during pyrolysis of penicillin fermentation residue  ap. 46-54.  aThis work studied thermal characteristics and product formation mechanism during pyrolysis of penicillin fermentation residue (PR). Results showed that PR pyrolysis proceeded in four stages. The kinetic triplet of each stage was calculated using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, and integral master-plot methods. The kinetic model for stage 1 was the three-dimensional diffusion model, the simple reaction order model for stage 2 and stage 4, and the nucleation-growth model for stage 3. FTIR analysis suggested that the intensities of absorption peaks of NH, CO, CH, CN, and CO in chars weakened gradually with increasing temperature, corresponding to the production of CH4, CO, NH3, and HCN. GC-MS results indicated that the high protein content in PR resulted in a high fraction of nitrogenated compounds (amides and amines, nitriles, and N-heterocyclic species) in bio-oil. The formation mechanism of these compounds was discussed. Besides, bio-oil also contained large quantities of oxygenated compounds and a few hydrocarbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aamines 3aammonia 3abiofuels 3acarbon monoxide 3afermentation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrogen cyanide 3akinetics 3amethane 3amodels 3anitriles 3apenicillins 3aprotein content 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermal properties 0aPenicillin fermentation residue 0aPyrolysis characteristics 0aKinetics 0aBio-oil 0aGC-MS analysis1 aHongchen,1 aXing, Yi1 aLi, Zaixing1 aLi, Yifei1 aYang, Jian1 aFeng, Lihui1 aHu, Jiashuo1 aSun, Haipeng0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Apr., v. 277 p.46-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245015800206300001200364520122500376592002801601596007101629650001901700650001801719650001101737650003101748650001201779650001001791650001801801650001301819650001001832650001401842700003101856700006201887700005601949700006102005773012302066856008102189852000902270655001202279IND60632743120221121231337.0190316e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063274312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-018-0213-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHroneš, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0380-929X10aFemale-biased sex ratio despite the absence of spatial and niche segregation between sexes in alpine populations of dioecious Salix lapponum (Salicaceae)  ap. 1-9.  aDioecious plants often exhibit deviations from expected 1:1 sex ratios. Genus Salix is a notable example of the female-biased sex ratio. Quite surprisingly, there are very few studies retesting observed bias patterns from the different parts of the species range. We have determined whether isolated subalpine populations of Salix lapponum exhibit a biased secondary sex ratio, measured the size of the plants, and tested the spatial and ecological correlations of the bias at fine and broad scales. Males were generally taller than females, suggesting that a different allocation of resources may occur in both sexes. Despite this, we found consistent female bias with females on average twice as common as males in most populations studied. No correlations of sex ratio with elevation as a proxy of environmental harshness and proportion of non-flowering individuals were found. Additionally, no differences in spatial sex segregation and microhabitat preferences were found between males and females at a fine scale within the studied populations. Our results suggest that the biased sex ratio in S. lapponum is not environment-dependent and probably originates during early stages of ontogenetic development (seeds).  aPublisher supplied data  aIGA PrF-2018-001cInternal Grant Agency of the Palacký University 3aSalix lapponum 3aalpine plants 3adioecy 3aecological differentiation 3afemales 3amales 3amicrohabitats 3aontogeny 3aseeds 3asex ratio1 aHrachová Macurová, Soňa1 aHradílek, Zbyněk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6724-99651 aHekera, Petr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4226-59501 aDuchoslav, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8553-82260 tAlpine botany.g2019 Apr., v. 129, no. 1 p.1-9dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000045x1664-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-018-0213-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245008300210300001800293506007600311520241600387592002802803506003702831650001902868650001802887650001202905650001902917650001302936650001002949650004202959650001703001650001103018650001703029650001503046650001503061650001103076650001403087650001303101650001803114700001903132700001703151700002103168700002303189700002003212700001903232700002003251700002303271700001803294773011003312856007703422852000903499655001203508IND60132381020221207113556.0150505e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013238102DNAL7 a10.1128/mBio.00366-122doi7 aPMC35515452pmcid7 a233226362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuinane, Caitriona M.10aMicrobial Composition of Human Appendices from Patients following Appendectomy  ap. e00366-12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe human appendix has historically been considered a vestige of evolutionary development with an unknown function. While limited data are available on the microbial composition of the appendix, it has been postulated that this organ could serve as a microbial reservoir for repopulating the gastrointestinal tract in times of necessity. We aimed to explore the microbial composition of the human appendix, using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region. Seven patients, 5 to 25 years of age, presenting with symptoms of acute appendicitis were included in this study. Results showed considerable diversity and interindividual variability among the microbial composition of the appendix samples. In general, however, Firmicutes was the dominant phylum, with the majority of additional sequences being assigned at various levels to Proteobacteria , Bacteroidetes , Actinobacteria , and Fusobacteria . Despite the large diversity in the microbiota found within the appendix, however, a few major families and genera were found to comprise the majority of the sequences present. Interestingly, also, certain taxa not generally associated with the human intestine, including the oral pathogens Gemella , Parvimonas , and Fusobacterium , were identified among the appendix samples. The prevalence of genera such as Fusobacterium could also be linked to the severity of inflammation of the organ. We conclude that the human appendix contains a robust and varied microbiota distinct from the microbiotas in other niches within the human microbiome. The microbial composition of the human appendix is subject to extreme variability and comprises a diversity of biota that may play an important, as-yet-unknown role in human health. IMPORTANCE There are currently limited data available on the microbial composition of the human appendix. It has been suggested, however, that it may serve as a “safe house” for commensal bacteria that can reinoculate the gut at need. The present study is the first comprehensive view of the microbial composition of the appendix as determined by high-throughput sequencing. We have determined that the human appendix contains a wealth of microbes, including members of 15 phyla. Important information regarding the associated bacterial diversity of the appendix which will help determine the role, if any, the appendix microbiota has in human health is presented.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinobacteria 3aFusobacterium 3aGemella 3aProteobacteria 3abacteria 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3amicrobiome 3aniches 3apathogens 3apatients 3aribosomal RNA1 aTadrous, Amany1 aFouhy, Fiona1 aRyan, C.

The gradient pumping system consisted of two nanoflow pumps controlled by micro stepper motors, a mixer connected to a serpentine tube, and a high-pressure valve. The gradient system weighed only 4 kg (9 lbs) and could generate up to 55 MPa (8000 psi) pressure. The system could operate using a 24 V DC battery and required 1.2 A for operation. The total volume capacity of the pump was 74 μL, and a sample volume of 60 nL could be injected. The system provided accurate nanoflow rates as low as 10 nL/min without employing a splitter, making it ideal for capillary column use. The gradient dwell volume was calculated to be 1.3 μL, which created a delay of approximately 4 min with a typical flow rate of 350 nL/min. Gradient performance was evaluated for gradient step accuracy, and excellent reproducibility was obtained in day-to-day experiments (RSD < 1.2%, n = 4). Linear gradient reproducibility was tested by separating a three-component pesticide mixture on a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) monolithic column. The retention time reproducibility was very good in run-to-run experiments (RSD < 1.42%, n = 4). Finally, excellent separation of five phenols was demonstrated using the nanoflow gradient system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aethylene glycol 3aliquid chromatography 3apesticides 3aphenols 3apolyethylene glycol 3apumps 3aserpentine1 aPlistil, Alex1 aBarnett, Hal E.1 aTolley, H.

How to identify and protect the significant evidence of dynamic landscapes is a question that must be answered by each cultural community. This article establishes a decipherment process—an operational guide for landscape assessment in China. This is a methodology using European methods integrated with traditional Chinese ways of landscape appreciation, providing an effective approach to translate the cultural landscape framework into the conservation inventory. Using Slender West Lake as a case study, the decipherment process has expanded the existing landscape investigation theory using the factor of artistic conception to integrate intangible values into the assessment process. It has also established a unit-based method to classify and represent historic landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acultural landscape 3ainventories 3alakes 3aChina 0aHistoric landscape 0aLandscape assessment 0aConservation 0aShanshui 0aSlender West Lake1 aSim, Jeannie1 aLawson, Gillian0 tLandscape research.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 41, no. 1 p.95-112dRoutledgex1469-97107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2015.10414683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245011600154300001600270520176900286592002802055650002502083650002002108650000802128650002402136650001102160650001702171650002502188650001502213650001402228650001802242650001902260650001102279650001002290650001602300650004202316650001302358650001802371650001402389650002902403653000802432653001202440653001302452653001702465653001602482653001802498653003702516700002102553700003002574700002702604700002702631700002402658773011302682856007202795852000902867655001202876IND60782310320221116160001.0220707s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078231032DNAL7 a10.1071/FP213152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemati, Iman10a<i>DELAY OF GERMINATION 1</i> (<i>DOG1</i>) regulates dormancy in dimorphic seeds of <i>Xanthium strumarium</i>  ap. 742-758.  aSeed dormancy ensures plant survival but many mechanisms remain unclear. A high-throughput RNA-seq analysis investigated the mechanisms involved in the establishment of dormancy in dimorphic seeds of Xanthium strumarium (L.) developing in one single burr. Results showed that DOG1 , the main dormancy gene in Arabidopsis thaliana L., was over-represented in the dormant seed leading to the formation of two seeds with different cell wall properties. Less expression of DME /EMB1649 , UBP26 , EMF2, MOM, SNL2, and AGO4 in the non-dormant seed was observed, which function in the chromatin remodelling of dormancy-associated genes through DNA methylation. However, higher levels of ATXR7 /SDG25, ELF6 , and JMJ16/PKDM7D in the non-dormant seed that act at the level of histone demethylation and activate germination were found. Dramatically lower expression in the splicing factors SUA, PWI , and FY in non-dormant seed may indicate that variation in RNA splicing for ABA sensitivity and transcriptional elongation control of DOG1 is of importance for inducing seed dormancy. Seed size and germination may be influenced by respiratory factors, and alterations in ABA content and auxin distribution and responses. TOR (a serine/threonine-protein kinase) is likely at the centre of a regulatory hub controlling seed metabolism, maturation, and germination. Over-representation of the respiration-associated genes (ACO3 , PEPC3 , and D2HGDH) was detected in non-dormant seed, suggesting differential energy supplies in the two seeds. Degradation of ABA biosynthesis and/or proper auxin signalling in the large seed may control germinability, and suppression of endoreduplication in the small seed may be a mechanism for cell differentiation and cell size determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA methylation 3aRNA 3aXanthium strumarium 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3acell differentiation 3acell walls 3achromatin 3ademethylation 3aendopolyploidy 3aenergy 3agenes 3agermination 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahistones 3aseed dormancy 3aseed size 3atranscription (genetics) 0aABA 0a<i>DOG1 0adormancy 0aphytohormone 0arespiration 0atranscriptome 0a<i>Xanthium strumarium</i></kwd>1 aSedghi, Mohammad1 aHosseini Salekdeh, Ghasem1 aTavakkol Afshari, Reza1 aNaghavi, Mohammad Reza1 aGholizadeh, Somayeh0 tFunctional plant biology.g2022, v. 49, no. 8 p.742-758dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP213153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245009500216300001600311506007600327520146300403592002801866506003701894650001601931650002301947650001601970650001201986650001601998650001802014650001702032650001702049650001102066650001402077650000902091653001702100653001602117653001602133653001002149653001602159700001402175700003302189773017602222856008102398852000902479655001202488IND60566590320221207124227.0180905e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056659032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjm.2016.01.0082doi7 aPMC48745872pmcid7 a269912952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNongmaithem, Nabakishor10aScreening of Trichoderma isolates for their potential of biosorption of nickel and cadmium  ap. 305-313.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFourteen Trichoderma isolates were evaluated for their tolerance to two heavy metals, nickel and cadmium. Three isolates, MT-4, UBT-18, and IBT-I, showed high levels of nickel tolerance, whereas MT-4, UBT-18, and IBT-II showed better tolerance of cadmium than the other isolates. Under nickel stress, biomass production increased up to a Ni concentration of 60ppm in all strains but then decreased as the concentrations of nickel were further increased. Among the nickel-tolerant isolates, UBT-18 produced significantly higher biomass upon exposure to nickel (up to 150ppm); however, the minimum concentration of nickel required to inhibit 50% of growth (MIC50) was highest in IBT-I. Among the cadmium-tolerant isolates, IBT-II showed both maximum biomass production and a maximum MIC50 value in cadmium stress. As the biomass of the Trichoderma isolates increased, a higher percentage of nickel removal was observed up to a concentration of 40ppm, followed by an increase in residual nickel and a decrease in biomass production at higher nickel concentrations in the medium. The increase in cadmium concentrations resulted in a decrease in biomass production and positively correlated with an increase in residual cadmium in the culture broth. Nickel and cadmium stress also influenced the sensitivity of the Trichoderma isolates to soil fungistasis. Isolates IBT-I and UBT-18 were most tolerant to fungistasis under nickel and cadmium stress, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrichoderma 3abiomass production 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3acorrelation 3aculture media 3aheavy metals 3amicrobiology 3anickel 3ascreening 3asoil 0aHeavy metals 0aBiosorption 0aTrichoderma 0aMIC50 0aFungistasis1 aRoy, Ayon1 aBhattacharya, Prateek Madhab0 tBrazilian journal of microbiology.g2016 Apr.,  June, v. 47, no. 2 p.305-313dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de MicrobiologiawJournal:23437x1517-83827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjm.2016.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245015200208300001400360520169800374592002802072596004502100596005702145650001702202650001802219650001302237650001102250650001102261650002802272650002102300650001602321650001502337650001902352650001902371650001302390650001302403650001902416650002202435650001002457650001102467650001302478650001102491650001602502651001002518700001502528773012502543856008202668852000902750655001202759IND60632743520221121220719.0190316e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063274352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-019-00217-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmagai, Yukihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0912-718210aResponses of photochemical efficiency and shoot growth of alpine dwarf-pine Pinus pumila to experimental warming, shading, and defoliation in Japan  ap. 43-52.  aGlobal warming accelerates shrub expansion in high-latitude and high-elevation ecosystems. Over the last several decades, alpine dwarf-pine Pinus pumila has expanded its range in northern Japan because of enhanced shoot growth under warm climatic conditions. In alpine regions, local environmental conditions and the length of the growing season, vary depending on the topography, elevation, and snowmelt time. This leads to spatially varying shoot performances that are co-affected by climatic change. We applied a warming, shading, and defoliation treatment to assess how temperature and carbon relations in interaction with habitat type (elevation and snowmelt time) affect shoot growth and photochemical efficiency of needles in this species. Photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was maximized during peak growth in the middle of growing season (mid-July–mid-August), and it increased in the shading and warming treatments especially in the early and late season. Shoot growth increased only in the warming treatment, and was not affected by shading and defoliation. These results indicate that shoot growth of alpine dwarf-pine is limited by low temperature, but not by carbon assimilation, i.e., growth is sink- rather than source-limited. Furthermore, the seasonal trend of photochemical efficiency shifted to the late season at higher elevations, and the recovery time of photochemical efficiency took longer in the late-snowmelt habitat, where the growing season was short. Therefore, warmer summers and longer snow-free periods are likely to enhance the growth and areal expansion of alpine dwarf-pine at the expense of the adjacent, species-rich, low-stature alpine plant communities.  aPublisher supplied data  aD-0904cMinistry of the Environment (JP)  a24570015cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aPinus pumila 3aalpine plants 3aaltitude 3abotany 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3aclimatic factors 3adefoliation 3aecosystems 3aglobal warming 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3aphotochemistry 3aplant communities 3ashade 3ashrubs 3asnowmelt 3asummer 3atemperature 3aJapan1 aKudo, Gaku0 tAlpine botany.g2019 Apr., v. 129, no. 1 p.43-52dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000045x1664-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-019-00217-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002400172245017000196300001600366520204300382592002802425650001302453650001402466650001102480650001102491650001102502650001002513650001602523650001902539650001902558650001802577650002602595650002402621650002402645650002502669651001102694653002302705653003102728653002002759653001602779653002302795653001102818700002802829700001802857700002002875773010202895856008702997852000903084655001203093IND50060362020221118040755.0160902e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006036202DNAL7 a231866172pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanagiotou, Ioannis10aCity breathability as quantified by the exchange velocity and its spatial variation in real inhomogeneous urban geometries: An example from central London urban area  ap. 466-477.  aThe breathability capacity and its spatial variation within an inhomogeneous urban area is investigated by examining the air flow and the induced flow exchange processes inside a real neighbourhood area of central London. The variation of the exchange velocity (as an index of city breathability) is interpreted in association with the local urban geometrical parameters and hence geometrical inhomogeneity. Numerical studies addressing flow exchange processes in urban areas have addressed so far rather idealised homogeneous geometries (e.g. Hamlyn and Britter, 2005; Salizzoni et al., 2009; Buccolieri et al., 2010; Hang et al., 2009 and 2010). This work analyses the results obtained from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation study using a Reynolds–Average–Navier–Stokes (RANS) solver to study the flow and induced exchange processes in the area around the Marylebone Road and Gloucester Place intersection modelled at a 1:200 scale, with the wind direction blowing in the direction of the Marylebone street axis. Flow visualisations from the numerical results confirm that the particular building shapes and street canyon geometries determine the shape and size of vortical structures that are present in the flow field and thereby the exchange processes with the flow above. By considering appropriate control volumes enclosing each building, the exchange velocities, UE, were deduced and found to range between 0.5% and 13% of the characteristic velocity above the urban canopy Uref, which was referenced at a height 2.5 times of the building height. The range of the exchange velocity coefficient UE/Uref is higher than that observed in idealised regular cube arrays, mainly due to the enhanced flow mixing associated with the inhomogeneity of the urban geometry and particularly with tall buildings. This work may provide useful insight to urban designers and planners interested in examining the variation of city breathability as a local dynamic morphological parameter with the local building packing density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3abuildings 3acanopy 3acities 3amixing 3aroads 3aurban areas 3awind direction 2aAirxstandards 2aAir Movements 2aArchitecture as Topic 2aComputer Simulation 2aModels, Theoretical 2aUrbanizationxtrends 0aLondon 0aCity breathability 0aUrban pollution dispersion 0aCFD simulations 0aEntrainment 0aUrban canopy layer 0aDAPPLE1 aNeophytou, Marina K.-A.1 aHamlyn, David1 aBritter, Rex E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Jan. 01, v. 442 p.466-477dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04245naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147024002200166024001900188040001800207100002300225245009200248300001800340506007600358520269100434592002803125506003703153650001303190650001203203650001803215650002103233650001503254650002403269650002203293650001403315650001103329650001703340650000903357650001403366650001503380650001303395650001403408650001103422650002003433650002103453700002503474700002003499773011003519856007703629852000903706655001203715IND60132381520221207083302.0150505e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013238152DNAL7 a10.1128/mBio.00420-122doi7 aPMC35605262pmcid7 a233623182pmid7 aPMC35605262pmcid7 a233623182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSummers, Zarath M.10aCultivation of an Obligate Fe(II)-Oxidizing Lithoautotrophic Bacterium Using Electrodes  ap. e00420-12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFe(II)-oxidizing aerobic bacteria are poorly understood, due in part to the difficulties involved in laboratory cultivation. Specific challenges include (i) providing a steady supply of electrons as Fe(II) while (ii) managing rapid formation of insoluble Fe(III) oxide precipitates and (iii) maintaining oxygen concentrations in the micromolar range to minimize abiotic Fe(II) oxidation. Electrochemical approaches offer an opportunity to study bacteria that require problematic electron donors or acceptors in their respiration. In the case of Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, if the electron transport machinery is able to oxidize metals at the outer cell surface, electrodes poised at potentials near those of natural substrates could serve as electron donors, eliminating concentration issues, side reactions, and mineral end products associated with metal oxidation. To test this hypothesis, the marine isolate Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1, a neutrophilic obligate Fe(II)-oxidizing autotroph, was cultured using a poised electrode as the sole energy source. When cells grown in Fe(II)-containing medium were transferred into a three-electrode electrochemical cell, a cathodic (negative) current representing electron uptake by bacteria was detected, and it increased over a period of weeks. Cultures scraped from a portion of the electrode and transferred into sterile reactors consumed electrons at a similar rate. After three transfers in the absence of Fe(II), electrode-grown biofilms were studied to determine the relationship between donor redox potential and respiration rate. Electron microscopy revealed that under these conditions, M. ferrooxydans PV-1 attaches to electrodes and does not produce characteristic iron oxide stalks but still appears to exhibit bifurcate cell division. IMPORTANCE Electrochemical cultivation, supporting growth of bacteria with a constant supply of electron donors or acceptors, is a promising tool for studying lithotrophic species in the laboratory. Major pitfalls present in standard cultivation methods used for metal-oxidizing microbes can be avoided by the use of an electrode as the sole electron donor. Electrochemical cultivation also offers a window into the poorly understood metabolism of microbes such as obligate Fe(II), Mn(II), or S ⁰ oxidizers by replacing the electron source with the controlled surface of an electrode. The elucidation of redox-dependent behavior of these microbes could enhance industrial applications tuned to oxidation of specific metals, provide insight into how bacteria evolved to compete with oxygen for reactive metal species, and model geochemical impacts of their metabolism in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acell division 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aferric oxide 3airon 3amanganese 3ametabolism 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aredox potential 3arespiratory rate1 aGralnick, Jeffrey A.1 aBond, Daniel R.0 tmBio.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.e00420-12-e00420-12dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx2150-75117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00420-123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013400158300001800292520136400310592002801674650001401702650000901716650001201725650003401737650001701771700002201788700001401810700001901824773009901843856007501942852000902017655001202026IND60576506320221121035504.0170804e20120313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057650632DNAL7 a10.1021/la204986n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakayama, Miki10aFormation of Rectangular Packing and One-Dimensional Lines of C60 on 11-Phenoxyundecanethiol Self-Assembled Monolayers on Au(111)  ap. 4694-4701.  aThe behavior of C₆₀ molecules deposited onto 11-phenoxyundecanethiol (phenoxy) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) is studied using ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV-STM) and spectroscopy. We observe that after thermally annealing between 350 and 400 K in vacuum a combination of hexagonally close-packed islands, rectangularly packed islands, and isolated single lines of C₆₀ is observed when the C₆₀ is initially deposited on an unannealed phenoxy SAM. However, only rectangularly packed islands are found when they are deposited on a preannealed phenoxy SAM. We determine the rectangular packing to have a (2√3 × 4) rectangular unit cell with respect to the underlying Au(111) substrate. This type of C₆₀ structure has not been observed previously for multicomponent self-assemblies on a surface. We discuss the possible causes for the formation of this structure as well as the differences between starting on an unannealed SAM and an annealed one. This study demonstrates the capability of functionalized alkanethiol SAMs to control the growth and structure of C₆₀ islands during annealing depending on the structural changes of the SAM itself; by preannealing the SAM, the motion of the C₆₀ can be confined and unique structures resulting from interactions between the SAM molecules and C₆₀ can be produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3agold 3aislands 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3aspectroscopy1 aKautz, Natalie A.1 aWang, Tuo1 aSibener, S.

Multiplex PCR assays for enteroaggregative STEC O104:H4 targeted the stx2, aggR, and wzx104 genes, and for STEC O104 targeted the stx1-2, ehxA, and wzx104 genes. After incubating artificially contaminated sprouts at 4°C for 48h and overnight enrichment in modified buffered peptone water with pyruvate supplemented with three antibiotics (mBPWp), the pathogens were detected in all samples inoculated at a level of ca. 100CFU/25g. Several samples inoculated at lower concentrations of ca. 10CFU/25g were negative by the PCR assays, and this could have been due to cells not surviving or not being able to recover after the stress treatment at 4°C for 48h. For isolation of the pathogens, immunomagnetic separation (IMS) using magnetic beads coated with antibodies against O104 were employed, and this was followed by plating the beads onto mRBA and CHROMagar STEC O104 for isolation of E. coli O104:H4 and mRBA and CHROMagar STEC for isolation of E. coli O104:H7. Presumptive colonies were confirmed by agglutination using latex particles attached to antibodies against serogroup O104 and by the multiplex PCR assays. The methodologies described in this study for detection of enteroaggregative STEC O104:H4 and STEC O104 include the use of IMS and latex reagents for serogroup O104, and they enhance the ability to detect and isolate these pathogens from sprouts and potentially other foods, as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3aShiga-like toxin 2 3aagglutination 3aantibiotics 3aantibodies 3afenugreek 3afoods 3agenes 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3alatex 3amilk 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apyruvic acid 3aserotypes 2aAnethum graveolensxmicrobiology 2aAnimals 2aFood Microbiology 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aImmunomagnetic Separation 2aMedicago sativaxmicrobiology 2aMultiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aShiga-Toxigenic Escherichia colixisolation & purificationxphysiology. 3aEurope 0aEurope 0aShiga toxin-producing E. coli O104 0aSprouts 0aDetection 0aImmunomagnetic separation 0aAntibodies 0aLatex beads1 aFratamico, Pina M.1 aRubio, Fernando1 aGlaze, Thomas1 aBagi, Lori K.1 aAlbonetti, Sabrina0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Mar. 03, v. 173 p.99-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012300165520197600288592002802264650001202292650002402304650002302328650001302351650002202364650001502386650001502401650002902416650002202445650001902467650002102486650001902507650001502526650001202541650001902553650001002572650002102582650001502603653001802618653001502636653002402651653003602675653002102711700001702732700001802749700002402767700001702791700001302808773011802821856008602939852000903025655001203034IND60718546520221122053822.0210506e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071854652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1116472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jun10aDynamics of community structure and bio-thermodynamic health of soil organisms following subtropical forest succession  aSoil organisms play essential roles in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes, but our understanding of the dynamics of these communities during forest succession remains limited. In this study, the dynamics of soil organism communities were measured along a 3-step succession sequence of subtropical forests (i.e., a conifer forest, CF; a mixed conifer and broad-leaved forest, MF; and a monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, BF). The eco-exergy evaluation method was used as a complement to the classic community structure index system to reveal the holistic dynamics of the bio-thermodynamic health of soil organism communities in a forest succession series. Association between the self-organization of soil organisms, soil properties, and plant factors were explored through redundancy analyses (RDA). The results indicated that the biomass of soil microbes progressively increased in the dry season, from 0.75 g m⁻² in CF to 1.75 g m⁻² in BF. Microbial eco-exergy showed a similar pattern, while the community structure and the specific eco-exergy remained constant. Different trends for the seasons were observed for the soil fauna community, where the community biomass increased from 0.72 g m⁻² to over 1.97 g m⁻² in the dry season, but decreased from 3.94 g m⁻² to 2.36 g m⁻² in the wet season. Faunal eco-exergies followed a similar pattern. Consequently, the average annual biomass of the soil faunal community remained constant (2.17–2.39 g m⁻²) along the forest succession sequence, while the significant seasonal differences in both faunal biomass and eco-exergy observed at the early successional stage (CF) were insignificant in the middle and late forest successional stages (MF and BF). Both the dynamics of soil microbes and soil fauna were tightly correlated with tree biomass and with soil physicochemical properties, especially soil pH, moisture, total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and organic matter content.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3adeciduous forests 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental management 3aforest succession 3amonsoon season 3anitrate nitrogen 3aorganic matter 3asoil fauna 3asoil pH 3atotal nitrogen 3atrees 3atropical forests 3awet season 0aSoil microbes 0aSoil fauna 0aCommunity structure 0aThermodynamic self-organization 0aEcosystem health1 aLu, Hongfang1 aLin, Yongbiao1 aCampbell, Daniel E.1 aCai, Hongyue1 aRen, Hai0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 280 p.111647-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1116473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245009100152520142900243592002801672650001201700650001501712650002201727650002001749650002001769650001201789650001601801650001701817651001001834700001601844700001701860700001501877700001501892773012701907856007302034852000902107655001202116IND60652044920221118212145.0190712e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065204492DNAL7 a10.3390/su91017862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ye10aIntegrating Cellular Automata with the Deep Belief Network for Simulating Urban Growth  aSustainable urban development is a focus of regional policy makers; therefore, how to measure and understand urban growth is an important research topic. This paper quantified the amount of urban growth on land use maps that were derived from multi-temporal Landsat images of Jiaxing City as a rapidly-growing city in Zhejiang Province from 2000–2015. Furthermore, a new approach coupled the heuristic bat algorithm (BA) and deep belief network (DBN) with the cellular automata (CA) model (DBN-CA), which was developed to simulate the urban expansion in 2015 and forecast the distribution of urban areas of Jiaxing City in 2024. The BA was proposed to obtain the best structure of the DBN, while the optimized DBN model considered the nonlinear spatial-temporal relationship of driving forces in urban expansion. Comparisons between the DBN-CA and the conventional artificial neural network-based CA (ANN-CA) model were also performed. This study demonstrates that the proposed model is more stable and accurate than the ANN-CA model, since the minimum and maximum values of the kappa coefficient of the DBN-CA were 77.109% and 78.366%, while the ANN-CA’s values were 63.460% and 76.151% over the 200 experiments, respectively. Therefore, the DBN-CA model is a potentially effective new approach to survey land use change and urban expansion and allows sustainability research to study the health of urban growth trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3aneural networks 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aZhang, Feng1 aDu, Zhenhong1 aYe, Xinyue1 aLiu, Renyi0 tSustainability.g2017 Oct. 02, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su91017863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245010500216300001600321506007600337520140900413592002801822506003701850650000801887650004801895650001601943650000901959650003801968650001002006650003002016650002202046650001402068650001402082650001702096650000902113650002602122650003002148650001302178650001502191651001402206653004802220653003002268653000802298653001502306700002402321700002202345700002002367700002002387700003202407700002502439773017602464856008102640852000902721655001202730IND60566590820221207132246.0180905e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056659082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjm.2016.01.0132doi7 aPMC48746122pmcid7 a269912902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilardoni, Liliana Rosa10aMycobacterium paratuberculosis detection in cow's milk in Argentina by immunomagnetic separation-PCR  ap. 506-512.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to standardize a diagnosis procedure to detect Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) DNA in raw cow milk samples under field conditions. A procedure that combines both immunomagnetic separation and IS900-PCR detection (IMS-IS1 PCR) was employed on milk samples from 265 lactating Holstein cows from Map infected and uninfected herds in Argentina. IMS-IS1 PCR results were analyzed and compared with those obtained from milk and fecal culture and serum ELISA. The extent of agreement between both tests was determined by the Kappa test. IMS-IS1 PCR showed a detection limit of 10¹ CFU of Map/mL of milk, when 50:50 mix of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used to coat magnetic beads. All of the 118 samples from the Map uninfected herds were negative for the set of the tests. In Map infected herds, 80 out of 147 cows tested positive by milk IMS-IS1 PCR (55%), of which 2 (1.4%) were also positive by milk culture, 15 (10%) by fecal culture, and 20 (14%) by serum ELISA. Kappa statistics (95% CI) showed a slight agreement between the different tests (<0.20), and the proportions of agreement were ≤0.55. The IMS-IS1 PCR method detected Map in milk of the cows that were not positive in other techniques. This is the first report dealing with the application of IMS-IS1 PCR in the detection of Map in raw milk samples under field conditions in Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3ablood serum 3acows 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherds 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3alactating females 3alactation 3amagnetism 3amicrobiology 3amilk 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3araw milk 3astatistics 3aArgentina 0aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 0aImmunomagnetic separation 0aPCR 0aCow's milk1 aFernandez, Barbara,1 aMorsella, Claudia1 aMéndez, Laura,1 aJar, Ana María1 aPaolicchi, Fernando Alberto1 aMundo, Silvia Leonor0 tBrazilian journal of microbiology.g2016 Apr.,  June, v. 47, no. 2 p.506-512dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de MicrobiologiawJournal:23437x1517-83827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjm.2016.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013400175300001600309520129400325592002801619650000801647650001301655650001501668650001301683650001001696650001101706650000901717650001301726650002001739650001501759653001901774653001401793653001201807653001901819653002501838653006101863700001701924700002201941773011601963856008602079852000902165655001202174IND60782310920221116160104.0220707e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078231092DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2022.20456482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaharana, Jayashree12aA Brief Overview of the Degradation of Cyanides and Phenols in the Environment With Reference to the Coke Oven Industry Discharge  ap. 619-630.  aThe main elements of mother earth, like air, water, and soil, are constantly being poisoned due to inadequate waste treatment and the lack of such technologies. Few chemicals such as cyanides and phenols are not environmentally benign, yet they can be spontaneously removed in nature unless their amount is overwhelming. Therefore, these compounds must be treated in the waste/wastewater at the point of discharge. However, many of the physical and chemical waste treatment technologies are expensive, require high maintenance, and are unsustainable because of the formation of other life-threatening chemical by-products. When released into the environment, cyanide and phenol often enter into the ecosystem and disturb all trophic levels. When these chemicals are allowed to degrade themselves in nature, the ecosystem breaks them down into nontoxic organic constituents. Many microbes like bacteria, algae, and fungi have been reported to detoxify these pollutants with their enzymatic action without any toxic by-products. This review highlights the fact that only a few genera and species of microorganisms have been exploited for this purpose. So far very few studies have been carried out on defining the role of uncultured microorganisms in the cyanide and phenol cycles in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acyanides 3aecosystems 3aindustry 3aovens 3aphenol 3asoil 3atoxicity 3awaste treatment 3awastewater 0aBiodegradation 0acoke-oven 0acyanide 0amicroorganisms 0awastewater treatment 0aMicroorganisms in Mining and Industrial Waste Management1 aPandey, Sony1 aDhal, Nabin Kumar0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2022 July 1, v. 39, no. 7 p.619-630dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12314x1521-05297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2022.20456483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245007700210300001400287520096700301592002801268650002301296650001801319650001501337650000901352650002101361650001101382650004401393650002901437650001901466650001801485650002301503650001001526653002901536653001901565653002301584653003701607653001901644700001401663700001901677700002301696700001801719700001201737773010401749856008701853852000901940655001201949IND60629277120221119021103.0190409e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062927712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Guangyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9059-899810aWater dynamics during solid-state fermentation by Aspergillus oryzae YH6  ap. 68-76.  aWater is crucial for microbial growth, heat transfer and substrate hydrolysis, and dynamically changes with time in solid-state fermentation. However, water dynamics in the solid substrate is difficult to define and measure. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance was used to monitor water dynamics during the pure culture of Aspergillus oryzae YH6 on wheat in a model system to mimic solid starter (Qu or Koji) preparation. During fermentation, overall water content gradually decreased from 0.84 to 0.36 g/g, and water activity decreased from 0.99 to 0.93. Water content in different state (bound, immobilized and free) changed differently and all moved to more “bound” direction. The internal water distribution over the substrate matrix also showed a faster reduction inward both in the radical and axial direction. Our findings provide the prerequisites for optimal processes where water dynamics in solid-state fermentation can be monitored and controlled.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aheat transfer 3ahydrolysis 3akoji 3amicrobial growth 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolid state fermentation 3awater activity 3awater content 3awater distribution 3awheat 0aSolid-state fermentation 0aWater dynamics 0aAspergillus oryzae 0aNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 0aWater activity1 aZhu, Yang1 aRinzema, Arjen1 aWijffels, René H.1 aGe, Xiangyang1 aXu, Yan0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Apr., v. 277 p.68-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01438naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007500170300001800245520049900263592002800762650001500790650001400805650003000819700001500849700001900864700005100883773012100934856008401055852000901139655001201148IND60755669620221121035858.0211105e20211011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075566962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c032212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Gao-Liang10aKinetic Resolution of Sulfinamides via Asymmetric N-Allylic Alkylation  ap. 8499-8504.  aAn efficient kinetic resolution of sulfinamides via an asymmetric N-allylic alkylation reaction was realized using hydroquinine as a catalyst under mild conditions.

Density functional theory calculations provide convincing evidence for the interpretation of stereoselection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory1 aLu, Chenxi1 aCheng, Jin-Pei1 aLi, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6020-91700 tOrganic letters.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 23, no. 21 p.8499-8504dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c032213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245009700177300001600274520131100290592002801601650001201629650001801641650001801659650001501677650003101692650002701723650001501750650003301765650001901798650002301817650001701840653002201857653001601879653000901895653002901904653002101933700002601954700006001980700001702040773012102057856008102178852000902259655001202268IND60609553020221122025102.0200819e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060955302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaub-Ekgreen, Maria Helbo10aNon-destructive measurement of salt using NIR spectroscopy in the herring marinating process  ap. 610-616.  aThe salt content is one of the most important quality and safety parameters in the manufacturing process of marinated herring, which needs to be controlled during processing. Standard methods are often destructive and time consuming, and therefore a nondestructive and fast method is needed. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was measured on marinade samples from the herring marinating process in order to investigate the potential of NIR as a fast method to determine the salt content in marinade and in fish. The spectral region 1100–1300 nm had the highest positive correlation with the measured salt values. A principal component analysis performed on the NIR spectra showed that the first principal component described the evolution of the spectra according to the determined salt values. A partial least-squares regression model between the selected region of the NIR spectra and the salt content of the fish gave a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and a prediction error (RMSECV) of 0.41 g/100 g with the prerequisite that salt concentration in fish and marinade was in equilibrium. The results indicate that NIR spectroscopy can be used as a fast and non-destructive method for assessing the salt concentration in fish during the herring marinating process in order to ensure product safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aherring 3aleast squares 3amanufacturing 3amarinating 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anondestructive methods 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproduct safety 3asalt concentration 3asalt content 0aMarinated herring 0aFood safety 0aSalt 0aMultivariate calibration 0aNIR spectroscopy1 aMartinez-Lopez, Brais1 aJessen, Flemming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9096-19961 aSkov, Thomas0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Nov., v. 97 p.610-616dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245005200166300001700218520067800235592002800913650002100941650001000962650001000972650001900982650002401001650001301025650001401038700002101052700001901073700002501092773008901117856008201206990002301288852000901311655001201320IND60095053620221116160430.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009505362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diff.2011.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuat, Martial10aHedgehog trafficking, cilia and brain functions  ap.

On the other hand, variability and intermittency of these clean resources are the important disadvantages for determining the reliable operation of electrical grids. Thus, using the uncertainty modeling techniques seems necessary to have more practical values for the decision-making variables. The current paper demonstrates a novel architecture based on Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) to model the randomness of multiple Wind Farms (WFs) existing in electric power networks. Note that employing only the IGDT technique cannot consider the preferences defined by the decision-maker. In contrast, the proposed method tackles this issue by considering different values for radii of uncertainty related to the uncertain parameters. It has been proven that the presented approach is time-saving if compared with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and the Epsilon-constraint-based-IGDT. Moreover, the execution time of the presented methodology does not considerably depend on the number of WFs for a power system. It means that if the number of WFs increases in a particular case study, consequently, the execution time does not noticeably rise if compared with the MCS and the Epsilon-constraint-based-IGDT. Furthermore, the equivalent Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) of the original model is employed to guarantee the optimum solution. The performances of the presented methodology have been demonstrated by utilizing IEEE 30 BUS and IEEE 62 BUS systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMonte Carlo method 3acase studies 3aclean energy 3adecision making 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3amodels 3asustainable development 3auncertainty 3awind 0aUncertainty modelling 0aConservativeness factor 0aIGDT-Based approach 0aDecision-maker's preferences1 aShafie-khah, Miadreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1691-53551 aSiano, Pierluigi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 July 15, v. 358 p.131963-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1319633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008600157300001600243520101200259592002801271650000801299650002001307650003001327650001001357650002301367700001901390773012401409856007401533852000901607655001201616IND60656562020221121050155.0190814e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065656202DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay05801d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChim, Wilson10aRepeated capillary electrophoresis separations conducted on a commercial DNA chip  ap. 864-868.  aMulti-sample microchip capillary electrophoresis separations of a DNA sample (i.e. pUC18 DNA Hae III restriction digest) have been conducted on a commercial bioanalyzer. According to the vendor's specifications, a new chip must be used and the gel–dye mix must be used within 2 weeks for the best possible results. However, such a requirement of new chips and fresh reagents is quite costly, especially during preliminary research work, or instructional experiments in teaching labs. Therefore, we have developed a method to clean the microchip, so that the same DNA chip can be inspected and re-used. Our experimental data show that the CE separations conducted on a new chip and on a cleaned chip are comparable without loss in sizing accuracy and reproducibility. The gel–dye mix can also be used many times, longer than 2 weeks as specified by the vendor until the gel–dye changes color. This method will provide cost-saving advantage to laboratories during training and preliminary research work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA microarrays 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acolor 3acost effectiveness1 aLi, Paul C.

The caspid protein VP1 variation, A289T, is reportedly closely associated with less severe central nervous system (CNS) infections in humans. However, it is unclear whether VIM is associated with a reduction in CNS infections of EV-A71 in the presence of A289T. We investigated whether VIM served as a receptor for EV-A71 in the presence of an A298T substitution in VP1. EV-A71-289A and EV-A71-289T were used to infect human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, control human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), and VIM-knockout (KO) HBMECs and inoculated BALB/c mice, SV129 mice, and VIM-KO SV129 mice. Furthermore, we cloned VP1-289A-Flag and VP1-289T-Flag proteins for co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Analysis of viral function revealed that the capacity of viral attachment, replication, and protein synthesis and secretion decreased in HBMECs during an EV-A71-289A infection, the infectivity being higher than that of EV-A71-289T upon VIM-KO. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of brain tissue revealed that cerebral cortical damage was more extensive in EV-A71-289A than in EV-A71-289T infections in control SV129 mice; however, no significant difference was observed upon VIM-KO. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed an interaction between VP1 and VIM, which was attenuated in VP1 harboring A289T; however, this attenuation was reversed by VIM (1-58) peptide. The A289T variation of VP1 specifically decreased the virulence of EV-A71 in HBMECs, and the attenuated interaction between VP1 harboring the A289T variation and VIM essentially decreased the CNS infectivity of EV-A71 in vitro and vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterovirus A 3aanimal diseases 3abrain 3aendothelial cells 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amice 3apeptides 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3avimentin 3avirulence1 aCao, Yujuan 1 aSu, Weitao 1 aHuang, Shan 1 aLu, Weizhi 1 aZhou, Yezhen 1 aGao, Jing 1 aZhao, Wei 1 aZhang, Bao 1 aWu, Xianbo 0 tViruses.g2019 May 22, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110504673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245011100206506011700317506007600434520115800510592002801668506003701696650001701733650001001750650001201760650001801772650001801790650001501808650001101823650002001834650001001854650001701864653001001881653002501891653001301916653002801929653001801957700003601975773012502011856008202136852000902218655001202227IND60789997020221207094954.0220921e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078999702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKultys, Ewelina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4912-932610aEffect of using carrot pomace and beetroot-apple pomace on physicochemical and sensory properties of pasta  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBy-products of fruit and vegetable processing are characterised by a high content of biologically active compounds and dietary fibre, while at the same time they are often treated as production waste. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using carrot pomace and beetroot-apple pomace to increase the dietary fibre content of pasta. In this study, the proportion of 10, 20, and 30% of carrot pomace and beetroot-apple pomace was investigated. The results of the experiment indicate that it is possible to prepare pasta with vegetable pomace, which would be characterised by high technological, sensory, and nutritional properties. Pasta with 10% addition of carrot pomace was characterised by very good technological properties such as water absorption, swelling index, and increased dietary fibre. In addition, the pasta received a positive opinion in the consumer acceptance assessment test, which gives an optimistic outlook for the future of this type of product. The use of pomace in the production of pasta not only increases the nutritional value of the product but also contributes to reducing the phenomenon of food waste.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapple pomace 3abeets 3acarrots 3adietary fiber 3afiber content 3afood waste 3afruits 3anutritive value 3apasta 3awater uptake 0aPasta 0aValuable by-products 0aBiowaste 0aSustainable food system 0aDietary fibre1 aMoczkowska-Wyrwisz, Małgorzata0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 168 p.113858-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014800164520121200312592002801524650001501552650001501567650002001582650001201602650001101614650001201625650002101637650001101658650001101669650001601680650002001696653002301716653002701739653002401766653003901790700001801829700001801847700005501865700002201920700001901942700001201961773011301973856008602086852000902172655001202181IND60776112320221119234241.0220606e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077611232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1319672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hui10aTechnical and environmental feasibility of gas-solid decontamination by oxygen-enriched co-combustion of textile dyeing sludge and durian shell  aThe urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions entails a cleaner waste treatment technology. The oxy-fuel co-combustion can recover energy and reduce the waste stream. This study aims to fill the knowledge gaps about the impacts of atmosphere type, blend ratio, oxygen concentration, and their interactions on the co-combustion behaviors and products of durian shell (DS) and textile dyeing sludge (TDS). The higher oxygen concentration reduced the reaction temperature, advanced the inhibition temperature, and promoted the decomposition rate with no significant effect on the residual mass. The N₂ atmosphere resulted in a better co-combustion performance than did the CO₂ one. The increased addition of DS improved the co-combustion performance. At the same oxygen concentration, the maximum absorption intensity of CO was higher in the N₂/O₂ than CO₂/O₂ atmosphere. Similarly, the maximum absorption intensities of C-O(H) and C=O were higher in the CO₂/O₂ than N₂/O₂ atmosphere. The co-combustion did not increase the issues of slagging and scaling. The main components of DS, TDS, and their blend ash with 50% DS and 50% TDS included MgO, Fe₂O₃, and Fe₂O₃, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acombustion 3adecontamination 3adurians 3aenergy 3afabrics 3agreenhouse gases 3aoxygen 3asludge 3atemperature 3awaste treatment 0aCleaner production 0aSecond-generation fuel 0aInteraction effects 0aThermochemical conversion dynamics1 aLiu, Jingyong1 aHuang, Hongyi1 aWen, Yixing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0335-45201 aEvrendilek, Fatih1 aRen, Mingzhong1 aHe, Yao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 360 p.131967-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1319673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245014400168300001800312520225800330592002802588650000902616650001702625650001402642650002402656650001102680650001402691650002202705650001602727651001002743700001902753773011802772856004002890852000902930655001202939IND50089623020221122214531.0140514e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008962302DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.122812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh‐Harihar, Mousumi10aPhylogenetic and ecomorphological structure of assemblages of breeding leaf warblers (Phylloscopidae) along Himalayan elevational gradients  ap. 1193-1203.  aAIM: To understand the relative importance of ecological and biogeographical processes structuring assemblages of Himalayan leaf warblers (family Phylloscopidae), through an evaluation of (1) the patterns of species richness and phylogenetic community structure, (2) their environmental determinants, and (3) dispersion of morphological traits within communities. LOCATION: Elevational gradients across the east and the west Himalayas, India. METHODS: Species presences were assessed at 16 sites along eight elevational gradients. Phylogenetic conservatism was assessed in three functional morphological traits (body size, tarsus length, beak shape) and phylogenetic structure in terms of the net relatedness index (NRI) was quantified using a published phylogenetic tree. Site‐specific species richness and NRI were related to climatic variables and arthropod abundance. Morphological trait metrics were also calculated and the observed trait dispersion related to patterns of species richness and phylogenetic structure of the assemblages. RESULTS: The 16 assemblages, composed of two to eight species, ran the entire spectrum of significance in terms of their phylogenetic structure, resulting in many clustered assemblages at low elevations and a few overdispersed assemblages at higher elevations. Phylogenetic structure was not significantly correlated with species richness, although variation in both was largely explained by maximum temperature and arthropod abundance. At the regional scale, both trait filtering (beak shape) and trait convergence (tarsus length) seem to influence the distribution of species along the elevational gradients. Dispersion of body size metrics suggested filtering and competition as predicted by phylogenetic structure, while beak shape metrics suggested competitive interactions even in phylogenetically clustered assemblages. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The interaction of multiple assembly processes (competition, filtering and history) appears to structure the Himalayan leaf warbler assemblages. Phylogenetic community structure largely reflected the biogeographical history of species accumulation into the Himalayas, while processes structuring local assemblages were better explained by the dispersion of traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeak 3abiogeography 3abody size 3acommunity structure 3aleaves 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aIndia1 aEmerson, Brent0 tJournal of biogeography.g2014 June, v. 41, no. 6 p.1193-1203dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12281  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010200156300001800258520118200276592002801458650002201486650001601508650001701524650002101541650001501562650001701577650002001594700001501614700001501629700001201644700001601656700002001672773014201692856007401834852000901908655001201917IND60688628820221120075643.0200415e20200414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068862882DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta02032j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Jiaxin10aEffect of grain size on electrochemical performance and kinetics of Co₃O₄ electrode materials  ap. 7192-7196.  aCo₃O₄ has attracted extensive attention as an electrode material for pseudocapacitors due to its simple preparation process and high theoretical capacity (3560 F g⁻¹). Although the experimental specific capacitance is much lower than its theoretical value, in-depth research into its kinetics, which is urgently needed for further performance improvement, is still rarely seen. Here, Co₃O₄ electrodes with the same morphology but different grain sizes are prepared. The kinetic connection between grain size and electrochemical performance is investigated. It can be found that a smaller Co₃O₄ grain size is beneficial for immersion in the electrolyte, which can enhance the diffusive capacity. Furthermore, for the first time, using distribution of relaxation times (DRT) calculation, the relationship between the grain size and the reaction activation energy is studied. The results demonstrate that Co₃O₄ with a small grain size has a low activation energy of the charge transfer reaction and diffusion, which will make the redox reaction and diffusion in the Co₃O₄ electrode easier, thus leading to the improvement of the electrochemical performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acapacitance 3acobalt oxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aredox reactions1 aWu, Wenjie1 aWang, Qiao1 aYan, De1 aLiu, Guohan1 aPeng, Shanglong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Apr. 14, v. 8, no. 15 p.7192-7196dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta02032j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013500166520140000301592002801701650001501729650001301744650001601757650002201773650000901795650001601804650000701820650001601827653002401843653004201867653001801909653000901927653002501936700001601961700001301977700001701990700001502007700001402022773011402036856008602150852000902236655001202245IND60750905320221121124017.0220118e20220205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075090532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1272402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yibo10aSynergistic removal of Cr(VI) by S-nZVI and organic acids: The enhanced electron selectivity and pH-dependent promotion mechanisms  aThe effects of organic acids on hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) removal by reduced iron-based materials have been extensively studied. Nevertheless, the promotion mechanism from the perspective of the electron transfer process is still unclear. Herein, sulfidated nanoscale zero-valent iron (S-nZVI) and the selected organic acids, citric acid (containing both -OH and −COOH groups) and oxalic acid (containing only −COOH groups), showed significant synergistic promotion effects in Cr(VI) removal. The FeS and FeS₂ on S-nZVI surface could enhance the Cr(VI) reduction as the reductive entity and electron conductor. Furthermore, even though the reactivity of FeS with Cr(VI) is higher than that with FeS₂, the Cr(VI) removal efficiency by FeS₂ was much higher than that by FeS with organic acids. Under neutral and alkaline conditions (pH 6.0–8.0), organic acids promoted the diffusion, adsorption and complexation of Cr(VI) on S-nZVI surface, thus enhancing the electron selectivity towards Cr(VI). However, when the solution pH changed to acidic conditions (pH 4.0), organic acids facilitated the dissolution of Fe(II) ions from S-nZVI and enhanced the electron utilization towards Cr(VI) via the fast Fe(III) reduction process. This study provided a new insight into the Cr(VI) removal, which was beneficial to understand the application boundaries of S-nZVI for Cr(VI) remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achromium 3acitric acid 3aelectron transfer 3airon 3aoxalic acid 3apH 3aremediation 0aHexavalent chromium 0aSulfidated nanoscale zero-valent iron 0aOrganic acids 0aFeS2 0aElectron selectivity1 aWei, Xipeng1 aYin, Hua1 aZhu, Minghan1 aLuo, Haoyu1 aDang, Zhi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Feb. 05, v. 423 p.127240-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1272403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245007300185300001600258520093600274592002801210650002101238650002401259650001401283650001401297650001401311650002101325650001401346650002001360650001701380650001101397650001501408651001901423651002301442653001901465653002501484653002401509653002401533653001701557700002401574700003701598700003001635700003501665773009201700856008401792852000901876655001201885IND60547529620221120124249.0160903s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054752962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2013.04.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalindo Bect, Manuel Salvador,14aThe Use of Urban Wastewater for the Colorado River Delta Restoration  ap. 829-835.  aThe environmental changes due to the Colorado River damming, have affected the ecological functioning of the nursery river delta and consequently the population of fishermen that live of the natural marine resources of the upper Gulf of California. We propose the use of urban wastewaters as a source of nutrients to fertilize the estuary, increase the primary productivity and therefore increase the population size of the estuarine dependent species, which are important for the fisheries in the region. In this way, we could partially restore the delta's ecological functioning and thus solve environmental, social, and economic problems. With a wastewater flow of 800 l·s-1 from “Las Arenitas” treatment plant, we could increase the primary organic productivity and ~1000 metric tons (mT) of shrimp landings of the region. These calculations are just for one fishery, but in a magnitude that could also increase in others.  aPublisher supplied data 3adams (hydrology) 3aecological function 3aestuaries 3afisheries 3afishermen 3amarine resources 3anutrients 3apopulation size 3ariver deltas 3ashrimp 3awastewater 3aColorado River 3aGulf of California 0aColorado River 0aenvironmental impact 0arestoration program 0ainorganic nutrients 0aproductivity1 aRíos, Andrea Santa1 aAyón, José Martín Hernández-1 aHuerta-Diaz, Miguel Angel1 aDelgadillo-Hinojosa, Francisco0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2013, v. 18 p.829-835dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.04.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245012800199506007600327520114100403592002801544506003701572650001301609650001901622650001801641650001801659650002001677650002101697700002501718700002601743700002101769700002101790700002301811700002801834773012001862856007301982852000902055655001202064IND60653000020221207091339.0190713e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065300002DNAL7 a10.3390/v110504682doi7 aPMC65632252pmcid7 a311219412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommer, Julia 10aDon’t Shut the Stable Door after the Phage Has Bolted—The Importance of Bacteriophage Inactivation in Food Environments  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn recent years, a new potential measure against foodborne pathogenic bacteria was rediscovered&mdash;bacteriophages. However, despite all their advantages, in connection to their widespread application in the food industry, negative consequences such as an uncontrolled phage spread as well as a development of phage resistant bacteria can occur. These problems are mostly a result of long-term persistence of phages in the food production environment. As this topic has been neglected so far, this article reviews the current knowledge regarding the effectiveness of disinfectant strategies for phage inactivation and removal. For this purpose, the main commercial phage products, as well as their application fields are first discussed in terms of applicable inactivation strategies and legal regulations. Secondly, an overview of the effectiveness of disinfectants for bacteriophage inactivation in general and commercial phages in particular is given. Finally, this review outlines a possible strategy for users of commercial phage products in order to improve the effectiveness of phage inactivation and removal after application.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3adisinfectants 3afood industry 3afood production 3avirulent strains1 aTrautner, Christoph 1 aWitte, Anna  Kristina1 aFister, Susanne 1 aSchoder, Dagmar 1 aRossmanith, Peter 1 aMester, Patrick-Julian 0 tViruses.g2019 May 22, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110504683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01601naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245016600168300001800334520052700352592002800879650001400907650001800921650002500939650001600964650001600980700002400996700006501020773012101085856008401206852000901290655001201299IND60755670020220219000000.0211105e20211022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075567002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c032372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrenet, Erwann10aCrystallization-Induced Diastereomer Transformation of α-Bromo α′-Sulfinyl Ketones.

As an application, a diastereodivergent synthesis of enantiopure hemlock alkaloid (+)-α-conhydrine and its diastereomer (−)-β-conhydrine is also described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3adiastereomers 3adiastereoselectivity 3aenantiomers 3avalue added1 aGéant, Pierre-Yves1 aSalom-Roig, Xavier J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5638-44750 tOrganic letters.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 23, no. 21 p.8539-8542dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c032373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016600161506011700327506007600444520147100520592002801991506003702019650001802056650001902074650001802093650001902111650001402130650002602144650002602170650002802196650002402224650001502248650001702263650001602280650002102296653001702317653003102334653001302365653002402378653001502402700001202417700001802429700001502447700001502462700005702477773012502534856008202659852000902741655001202750IND60789997220221207094949.0220921e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078999722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Lu10aEffects of autochthonous starter cultures on bacterial communities and metabolites during fermentation of Yu jiangsuan, a Chinese traditional fermented condiment  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe study on the bacterial community structure and metabolite effects of fermentation of Yu jiangsuan（YJS）by autochthonous starter cultures has been rarely reported. In this study, the bacterial community structure and metabolites were dynamically explored by high-throughput sequencing and LC-MS/MS during the fermentation of Yu jiangsuan (YJS) by inoculation of autochthonous starter cultures. The results demonstrated that the presence of interactions between bacterial genera accelerated the fermentation process and caused an increase in bacterial diversity and metabolite production. Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla, while Weissella, Lactobacillus and Fructobacillus were the dominant genera. The growth of Cyanobacteria and Fructobacillus was reduced in the inoculated fermentation group (HY). Totally 47 major differential metabolites were screened. Pearson correlation analysis showed that seven major bacterial genera were significantly associated with 15 differential metabolites. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism exerted a vital influence in the formation of metabolites. Moreover, this study contributes to the investigation of the bacterial community structure and metabolite composition in the fermentation of YJS by inoculation with autochthonous starter cultures, and helps to illuminate the potential value of core functional bacterial genera in the industrial controlled production of YJS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyanobacteria 3aFructobacillus 3aLactobacillus 3aProteobacteria 3aWeissella 3aamino acid metabolism 3abacterial communities 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acommunity structure 3acondiments 3afermentation 3ametabolites 3astarter cultures 0aYu jiangsuan 0aHigh-throughput sequencing 0aLC-MS/MS 0aBacterial diversity 0aMetabolite1 aLiu, Lu1 aChen, Hongyan1 aZhang, Wei1 aHe, Laping1 aZeng, Xuefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6877-88450 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 168 p.113874-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007100164300001500235520172200250592002801972650001902000650001002019650002102029650002102050650001402071650001402085650001502099650002302114650001002137650001302147650001602160700001902176773008702195856008202282990002302364852000902387655001202396IND60095054120221116160309.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009505412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diff.2011.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, Sen10aStructure and function of vertebrate cilia, towards a new taxonomy  ap. S4-S11.  aIn this review, we propose a new classification of vertebrate cilia/flagella and discuss the evolution and prototype of cilia. Cilia/flagella are evolutionarily well-conserved membranous organelles in eukaryotes and serve a variety of functions, including motility and sensation. Vertebrate cilia have been traditionally classified into conventional motile cilia and sensory primary cilia. However, an avalanche of emerging evidence on the variations of cilia has made it almost impossible to classify them in a simple dichotomic manner. For example, conventional motile cilia are also involved in the sensation of bitter taste to facilitate the beating of cilia as a defense system of the respiratory system. On the other hand, the primary cilium, often regarded as a non-motile sensory organelle, has been revealed to be motile in vertebrate embryonic nodes, where they play a crucial role in the determination of left–right asymmetry of the body. Moreover, choroid plexus epithelial cells in the cerebral ventricular system exhibit multiple primary cilia on a single cell. Considering these lines of evidence on the diversity of cilia, we believe the classification of cilia should be based on their structure and function, and include more detailed criteria. Another intriguing issue is how in the evolution of cilia, their function and morphology are combined. For example, has motility been acquired from originally sensory cilia, or vice versa? Alternatively, were they originally hybrid in nature? These questions are inseparable from the classification of cilia per se. We would like to address these conundrums in this review article, principally from the standpoint of differentiation of the animal cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3achoroid plexus 3acilia 3aepithelial cells 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3aflagellum 3aorganelles 3arespiratory system 3ataste 3ataxonomy 3avertebrates1 aNarita, Keishi0 tDifferentiation.g2012 Feb., v. 83, no. 2 p.S4-S11dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2011.11.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01647naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013600172300001600308520057600324592002800900650002500928650001600953650002700969650001800996650001301014653001801027653001801045653002801063700002501091773011201116856008401228852000901312655001201321IND60604835220221121040439.0180718e20150215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060483522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorys, Przemyslaw13aAn analytical solution to the idealized batch pervaporation experiment: A way to determine the diffusion and partition coefficients  ap. 525-529.  aThe physicochemical basic laws and their suitable mathematical formulations form a frame of the batch pervaporation process, i.e. the cycled process of removing small traces of volatile impurities from large amounts of a volatile solvent, is described and analyzed in detail.The generic nature of the process, i.e. its exclusively transient behaviour is described as an IBV (initial boundary value) problem with a feed side boundary condition dependent on time.

Ruminant-derived meat, milk and dairy products are the predominant sources of cis-9,trans-11 CLA in the human diet. This study evaluated the processing properties, texture, storage characteristics, and organoleptic properties of UHT milk, Caerphilly cheese, and butter produced from a milk enriched to a level of cis-9,trans-11 CLA that has been shown to have biological effects in humans. Forty-nine early-lactation Holstein-British Friesian cows were fed total mixed rations containing 0 (control) or 45 g/kg (on dry matter basis) of a mixture (1:2 wt/wt) of fish oil and sunflower oil during two consecutive 7-d periods to produce a control and CLA-enhanced milk, respectively. Milk produced from cows fed the control and fish and sunflower oil diets contained 0.54 and 4.68 g of total CLA/100 g of fatty acids, respectively. Enrichment of CLA in raw milk from the fish and sunflower oil diet was also accompanied by substantial increases in trans C18:1 levels, lowered C18:0, cis-C18:1, and total saturated fatty acid concentrations, and small increases in n-3 polyunsatu-rated fatty acid content. The CLA-enriched milk was used for the manufacture of UHT milk, butter, and cheese. Both the CLA-enhanced butter and cheese were less firm than control products. Although the sensory profiles of the CLA-enriched milk, butter, and cheese differed from those of the control products with respect to some attributes, the overall impression and flavor did not differ. In conclusion, it is feasible to produce CLA-enriched dairy products with acceptable storage and sensory characteristics. 3acow feeding 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3asensory evaluation 3amilk composition 2aAnimals 2aButterxanalysis 2aCattle 2aCheesexanalysis 2aChemistry, Physical 2aDairy Productsxanalysis 2aDiet 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFish Oilsxadministration & dosage 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Preservation 2aFood, Fortifiedxanalysis 2aHot Temperature 2aLactation 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPlant Oilsxadministration & dosage 2aSensation 2aTaste1 aShingfield, K.

Cows were allocated to 1 of 4 experimental treatments (T1 to T4). In T1 and T2, the total mixed ration (TMR) contained either corn silage from the genetically modified (GM) variety Chardon Liberty Link, which is tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium, or its near isogenic nonGM counterpart, whereas the TMR used in T3 and T4 contained corn silage from the commercially available nonGM varieties Fabius and Antares, respectively. The objectives of the study were to determine if the inserted gene produced a marked effect on chemical composition, nutritive value, feed intake, and milk production, and to determine if transgenic DNA and the protein expressed by the inserted gene could be detected in bovine milk. The nutritive value, fermentation characteristics, mineral content, and amino acid composition of all 4 silages were similar. There were no significant treatment effects on milk yield, milk composition, and yield of milk constituents, and the dry matter (DM) intake of the GM variety was not significantly different from the 2 commercial varieties. However, although the DM intake noted for the nonGM near-isogenic variety was similar to the commercial varieties, it was significantly lower when compared with the GM variety. Polymerase chain reaction analyses of milk samples collected at wk 1, 6, and 12 of the study showed that none of the 90 milk samples tested positive, above a detection limit of 2.5 ng of total genomic DNA/mL of milk, for either tDNA (event T25) or the single-copy endogenous Zea mays gene, alcohol dehydrogenase. Using ELISA assays, the protein expressed by the T25 gene was not detected in milk. 3adairy cows 3aZea mays 3amilk proteins 3atransgenic plants 3amilk yield 2aAcetyltransferasesxanalysisxgenetics. 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDNA, Recombinantxanalysis 2aDiet 2aDrug Resistancexgenetics 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aHerbicides 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactation 2aMilkxchemistry 2aNutritive Value 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSilage 2aZea maysxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 3aUnited Kingdom 0amilk composition1 aJones, A.

It was hypothesized that the oil present in DGS would decrease milk fat yield. Four dietary treatments consisted of dried DGS replacing soybean meal and soybean hulls. The DGS inclusion rates as a percentage of dry matter (DM) were 0, 5, 10, and 15% DGS. To determine the role of oil in DGS, a fifth diet similar to 0% DGS with added corn oil (OIL) was included. Twenty multiparous Holsteins were assigned to a replicated, 5 x 5 Latin Square design with periods of 21 d. Diets were formulated to have similar crude protein and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration. Feeding OIL or 15% DGS resulted in similar production of milk, milk protein, and milk fat. Increasing dietary DGS linearly increased milk production and milk true protein yield. Adding corn oil increased milk yield and, although milk true protein yield also tended to increase with oil, milk true protein concentration decreased. The addition of DGS or OIL did not significantly change fat yield from 0% DGS; however, fat concentration in milk was significantly decreased by DGS due to increased fluid milk production. In diets containing approximately 28% NDF, cottonseed, blood and fish meal, feeding DGS to bring total dietary fatty acids to 5% of diet DM increased milk and milk protein yield without decreasing milk fat yield. Reduced proportions of shorter chain fatty acids and increased proportions of longer chain fatty acids in milk as dietary fatty acid content increased suggests that de novo fatty acid synthesis in the mammary gland was inhibited but this was offset by increased secretion of long-chain fatty acids, presumably absorbed from the diet. Therefore, our hypothesis that feeding corn oil either as DGS or as pure corn oil would decrease milk fat yield was not correct. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3afeed formulation 3amilk yield 3amilk fat 3afatty acid composition 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEdible Grain. 2aCorn Oilxadministration & dosage 2aDiet 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aEthanol 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFatty Acidsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aIndustry 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis1 aBertics, S.1 aArmentano, L.

Images of hooves were taken using infrared thermography to determine the temperatures of the coronary band and that of a control area above the coronary band. To adjust for skin (control) temperature, the difference ([Delta]T) between the coronary band and the control area was calculated. Effects of stage of lactation, that is, </=200 d in milk (DIM) vs. >200 DIM, on temperature of the coronary band, [Delta]T, and visual abnormalities were determined. Temperatures of the coronary bands of cows were greater for cows </=200 DIM (n = 17) than for cows (n = 15) in late lactation (25.5 ± 1.3 vs. 21.0°C). The [Delta]T was also greater for cows </=200 DIM compared with those >200 DIM (6.1 ± 0.8 vs. 3.3 ± 0.9°C). The [Delta]T was greater for lateral claws than for medial claws (5.2 ± 0.6 vs. 4.2 ± 0.6°C). Chi-square analysis revealed that the frequency of sole hemorrhages in hind lateral claws was significantly higher for cows </=200 DIM compared with those in late lactation. In contrast, underrun heel was more frequently observed among cows >200 DIM. Increased temperatures of the coronary band and [Delta]T in early/midlactation coincided with increased incidence of sole hemorrhages, but not to incidences of underrun heels. Because higher hoof temperatures occurred in cows </=200 DIM compared with cows later in lactation, measurement of hoof temperatures among cows in early lactation may be useful in monitoring hoof health. 3alactation stage 3alaminitis 3ainfrared photography 3aanimal health 3askin temperature 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperature 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aFemale 2aFoot Diseasesxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aHemorrhagexdiagnosis 2aHoof and Clawxblood supplyxphysiology. 2aInfrared Rays 2aLactationxphysiology 2aThermographyxmethodsxveterinary. 3aManitoba 0afoot diseases1 aPlaizier, J.

The approach utilizes Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression coupled with a reverse transcription-polydeoxyribonucleotide chain reaction assay to facilitate expression cloning of processed transcripts. Subsequent expression of intronless cDNAs in a suitable prokaryotic host provides for direct functional testing of the encoded gene product. The method was optimized by examining the expression of an intron-containing [beta]-glucuronidase gene agroinfiltrated into petunia (Petunia hybrida) leaves, and its utility was demonstrated by defining the function of two previously uncharacterized terpene synthases. A tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) terpene synthase-like gene containing six predicted introns was characterized as having 5-epi-aristolochene synthase activity, while an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene previously annotated as a terpene synthase was shown to possess a novel sesquiterpene synthase activity for [alpha]-barbatene, thujopsene, and [beta]-chamigrene biosynthesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant genetics 3acomplementary DNA 3aPetunia hybrida 3atransgenic plants 3aRNA splicing 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3aalkyl (aryl) transferases 3aintrons 3abeta-glucuronidase 3atobacco 2aAlternative Splicing 2aCarbon-Carbon Lyasesxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGlucuronidasexmetabolism 2aIntrons 2aPetuniaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0asesquiterpene synthase 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aSchoenbeck, Mark A.1 aGreenhagen, Bryan T.1 aTakahashi, Shunji1 aLee, Sungbeom1 aCoates, Robert M.1 aChappell, Joseph0 tPlant physiology.g2005 July, v. 138, no. 3 p.1322-1333dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.105.0593863Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20060104b20060202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/01/04  aOther US 7aarticle02805naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001800138245010500156300001800261500002400279500001500303520140000318650001501718650001501733650002401748650002401772650002201796650002001818650001201838650003401850650002201884650001801906650002401924650002201948650001601970650002401986650002402010651001202034651001202046653002902058700002402087773012002111852000902231930003302240945002502273946001302298655001202311IND4372521620221116152233.0050720e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437252162DNAL7 a160272092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2001 aBennewitz, J.10aEstimation of Extinction Probabilities of Five German Cattle Breeds by Population Viability Analysis  ap. 2949-2961.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe estimation of the expected loss of genetic diversity and marginal diversities in a set of breeds within a defined future time horizon requires initial estimates of breed extinction probabilities. In this study, the extinction probabilities of 5 German dual-purpose cattle breeds were estimated by population viability analysis. Regression was used to estimate the infinitesimal mean and variance of the population growth and this was based on the diffusion approximation of the density independent population growth (also known as the Dennis regression model). The annual number of milk-recorded cows in each breed was used as census data. Based on the regression results, the extinction probabilities and their confidence intervals were estimated for a wide variety of future time horizons using Monte Carlo time series simulations. The estimates of extinction probabilities were sensible, but in 2 cases they depended heavily on the time horizon considered. Additionally, the confidence intervals became very wide with an increased time horizon. We recommend the estimation of extinction probabilities for a set of future time horizons rather than for a single future time and the selection of an upper bound for this set that is not too large to be meaningful. The validity of the use of the number of milk-recorded cows as census data and of the model assumptions is discussed in detail. 3adairy cows 3aestimation 3amathematical models 3adual-purpose breeds 3agenetic variation 3apopulation size 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenetic Variation 2aLinear Models 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPopulation Growth 2aProbability 2aRegression Analysis 2aSpecies Specificity 3aGermany 0aGermany 0aanimal genetic resources1 aMeuwissen, T.

The in-use fuel consumption of non-road mobile machinery depends on the actual operation performed, including transient behaviour, rather than the static load distribution commonly used in steady-state-based fuel consumption models. A recent study has shown that during fast transients, measured fuel consumption is up to twice as high as during the corresponding steady-state load conditions. The purpose of this work was to develop a calculation model that includes the transient effects on the overall fuel consumption. The transient fuel consumption model was based on a semi-static model and extended with transient correction factors for both changes in engine speed and torque. A general conclusion of the work was that fuel consumption could be accurately estimated even during operations that are largely transient in nature. Moreover, the results showed that the model developed for transient fuel consumption could also be applied to emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. The average difference between recorded and calculated fuel consumption and emission amounts decreased from approximately 30% for the semi-static model alone down to about 5% when it was extended with the transient correction factors. 3aenergy use and consumption 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 0avehicles 0aequipment0 tBiosystems engineering.g2005 June, v. 91, no. 2 p.139-147dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03146naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001500119245008200134300001600216500002400232500001500256520184400271650002302115650001702138650001102155650002302166650001902189650001302208650002202221650002002243650001602263650001302279653003202292653002502324653002702349700001602376700001302392700001402405773009602419852000902515856009502524930003302619945002502652946001102677655001202688IND4372117620221116152427.0050708e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437211762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aHerold, B.10aSpectral measurements on 'Elstar' apples during fruit development on the tree  ap. 173-182.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMonitoring of apple fruit development on the tree is necessary for determination of optimum harvest date. The current method is to pick several times during fruit development fruit samples and to analyse them in a destructive way. Sufficient experience is necessary to correctly interpret the results of analyses. Appreciable errors can occur, if an apple cultivar shows high variability in fruit maturation. However, reduction of errors by taking enlarged samples is not viable. More reliable results could be expected if non-destructive continuous monitoring of the same fruits during fruit development on tree would be possible. Measurements of fruit ripening on the tree were carried out by using portable equipment with a miniaturised spectrophotometric module. By means of a specific glass-fibre probe, the partial light transmittance through fruit was detected in wavelength range from 500 to 1000 nm. Tests were performed on 'Elstar' apples in a commercial orchard during pre-harvest and harvest period 2003. From the spectral data, different indices were derived to characterise the fruit pigment change and maturity progress in comparison with conventional laboratory analyses for fruit maturity analysis. The portable spectrophotometer worked reliably and indicated sensitively changes of the spectral signature of apple fruit during the measuring period. Spectral indices as well as laboratory data demonstrated very high variance of maturity progress between individual 'Elstar' fruits. The spectral indices of each single fruit changed continuously over the time. The red-edge as well as a normalised chlorophyll index exhibited moderate decline, while a normalised anthocyanin index increased sigmoidally. The results obtained with these indices showed the potential of non-destructive fruit maturity monitoring on the tree. 3aspectrophotometers 3aharvest date 3aapples 3aportable equipment 3amaturity stage 3aripening 3aspectral analysis 3aMalus domestica 3ameasurement 3afruiting 0aportable spectrophotometers 0aoptimum harvest date 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aTruppel, I.1 aZude, M.1 aGeyer, M.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2005 June, v. 91, no. 2 p.173-182dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02504naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001400119245007800133300001600211500002400227520149000251650001201741650001801753650001401771650002201785650001601807650002701823700001501850700002001865773009601885852000901981856009501990930003302085945002502118946001102143655001202154IND4372117220221116152613.0050708e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437211722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aJha, S.N.10aDetermination of sweetness of intact mango using visual spectral analysis  ap. 157-161.  aIncludes references  aPreference for mangoes depends on aroma and sweetness. Evaluation of these parameters by present methods destroys the samples, takes more time and is not usable in continuous packing systems. In the present investigation, the potential of a non-destructive method for predicting sweetness in term of total soluble solids using a handheld colorimeter was explored. Spectra of 329 mango samples were acquired in the visual wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm and they were split into two sets, one of 165 samples for calibration and other of 164 samples for validation purposes. Calibration models of different ranges of wavelengths for prediction of total soluble solids by partial least-squares regression (PLS), principal component regression (PCR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods with respect to reflectance and its second-order derivatives, smoothing, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), were developed and tested with validation sample sets. The MLR model of original spectra in the wavelength range of 440-480 nm was found to be the best. The standard error of calibration (SEC), validation (SEP) and correlation coefficients were found to be 1.91 degrees Brix, 1.98 degrees Brix and 0.90, respectively. Similarity in SEC and SEP values and satisfactorily high correlations between predicted and measured values indicated that the developed model has potential for prediction of the total soluble solids of intact mango non-destructively using visual spectra. 3amangoes 3afruit quality 3asweetness 3aspectral analysis 3acolorimetry 3anondestructive methods1 aChopra, S.1 aKingsly, A.R.P.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2005 June, v. 91, no. 2 p.157-161dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02890naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245008500179300001600264520179400280650002302074650001202097650001102109650001302120650002302133650002702156650001902183650002602202650003102228650001402259651001202273700001702285700001502302773008502317852000902402930003302411945002502444946001102469655001202480IND4367749220221116152514.0050317e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436774922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNziguheba, G.10aSulphur immobilization and availability in soils assessed using isotope dilution  ap. 635-644.  aIncreasing recognition of S deficiency in soils has raised the need for understanding processes governing S cycling and availability in soils. However, the quantification of the two main processes of S cycling, i.e. mineralization and immobilization, remains difficult as these processes occur simultaneously. A modified isotope 35SO4 dilution technique was developed and used to measure the effect of sulphate (SO4) fertilization on S mineralization and immobilization in planted (pot experiment with ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.)) and unplanted soils (incubation). The immobilization and mineralization of S was calculated from the dynamics of stable and labelled S in soil KH2PO4 extracts containing an anion exchange membrane that concentrates SO4 and mainly excludes other S species. The mathematical analysis of the isotope dilution data differs from methods proposed earlier. The radiolabile S in unplanted soil (E value) and in ryegrass (L value) were used as a measure of total available S in soils. Sulphate immobilization rate significantly declined during incubation. Sulphate application reduced gross mineralization but surprisingly reduced SO4 immobilization. The E value significantly increased during the incubation in all soils as a result of gross mineralization, e.g. from 3.8 mg S kg(-1) at day 0 to 11.5 mg S kg(-1) at day 43 in the sandy soil with no sulphate addition. A full recovery in the E value of S added in (+S) treatments was achieved. Similarly, radiolabile S in the above-ground ryegrass biomass (L value) increased with S addition, with a full recovery of added S. The E and L values nearly fit a 1:1 line suggesting identical S dynamics in a planted and unplanted soil. The method proposed has operational advantages compared to methods used earlier. 3aLolium multiflorum 3agrasses 3asulfur 3asulfates 3asulfur fertilizers 3aimmobilization in soil 3amineralization 3anutrient availability 3aisotope dilution technique 3aequations 3aBelgium1 aSmolders, E.1 aMerckx, R.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2005 Apr., v. 37, no. 4 p.635-644x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050817b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/06/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03163naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002200178245015300200300001600353520168300369650002202052650001802074650001902092650001702111650001902128650001402147650002702161650001702188650001202205650002202217650001902239650002402258650001802282650001502300650002002315650002902335650002902364651001202393653002002405700001502425700001302440700001702453773008502470852000902555930003302564945002502597946001102622655001202633IND4367791220221116152558.0050321e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436779122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVandecasteele, B.10aRates of forest floor decomposition and soil forming processes as indicators of forest ecosystem functioning on a polluted dredged sediment landfill  ap. 761-769.  aResults of intensive monitoring of forest floor decomposition rates and soil forming processes after afforestation of a calcareous upland dredged sediment landfill with an oxidised surface soil are presented. Nutrient status of the sediment substrate favours tree growth and allows for afforestation and thus an integration in the landscape. Soil processes on the landfill resulted in small differences between the surface and the subsurface soil layer, although higher soil organic carbon and Cd concentrations in the surface soil were observed. So far, tree species had a minor impact on soil processes. Relative to the uncontaminated covered part of the site and to general references, forest floor decomposition was found to be relatively fast for sycamore maple and pedunculate oak. Despite the pollution status of the dredged sediment landfill, the sediment substrate was favourable for forest floor decomposition. This might indicate that the soil nutrition status and the high carbonate status override the negative impact of soil pollution with metals and other pollutants. Application of a covering layer composed of uncontaminated soil material resulted in lower Cd concentrations in earthworms, but concentrations were still higher than for references. We conclude from the observations that polluted but fertile soils allow for afforestation and for regular forest floor decomposition with normal or slightly elevated metal concentrations. Only long-term observations of such new forests will lead to a correct site-specific assessment of the actual ecological risks, but after 16 years of landfilling and 12 years of afforestation no adverse effects were observed. 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest litter 3abiodegradation 3aforest soils 3apolluted soils 3alandfills 3asediment contamination 3aheavy metals 3acadmium 3adredged materials 3asoil formation 3asoil organic matter 3aafforestation 3aearthworms 3arisk assessment 3aenvironmental indicators 3asoil chemical properties 3aBelgium 0aecological risk1 aVos, B. de1 aMuys, B.1 aTack, F.M.G.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2005 Apr., v. 37, no. 4 p.761-769x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050817b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/06/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02097naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245007100140300001600211520117200227650002301399650002401422650001401446650002001460650001801480650000901498650002101507650002701528700001501555700001401570773008501584852000901669930003301678945002501711946001101736655001201747IND4367329220221116152243.0050225e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436732922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKo, W.H.12aA simple method for detection of lipolytic microorganisms in soils  ap. 597-599.  aMedia selective for the isolation of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi were amended with 0.1% sunflower oil emulsified with 0.01% Tween 80. Lipase-producing microorganisms produced clear zones on these media. When lipase-producing bacteria were cultured on a polycarbonate membrane laid on the selective medium for bacteria, clear zones were produced on the medium when the membrane along with bacteria was removed. The agar disc cut from the clear zone also produced a clear zone when placed on the fresh medium, indicating that clear zone formation is the result of the activity of extracellular lipases. The largest population of lipase-producing microorganisms in an agricultural soil was actinomycetes followed by bacteria and fungi. Ranging from 12 to 75% of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi isolates from soils collected from three different locations were capable of producing lipases. In general, relatively small percentages of soil bacteria were lipase producers, and lipase producers were more common among soil actinomycetes and fungi. These three groups of microorganisms appear to be all important in decomposition of oils in organic matters in soils. 3aanalytical methods 3asoil microorganisms 3adetection 3aselective media 3asunflower oil 3aagar 3ain vitro culture 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aWang, I.T.1 aAnn, P.J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2005 Mar., v. 37, no. 3 p.597-599x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/03/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03106naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001400137245018300151300001600334500013200350500002400482500001500506520114400521650001701665650002701682650001201709650001201721650000901733650003201742650000901774650002201783650002701805650003101832650002001863650002401883650003201907650002001939650001801959651001501977653002801992653002502020653002502045700001802070700001802088700001702106700001402123700002102137700001702158700001702175700001802192700001602210773009402226852000902320856007002329930003302399945002502432946001102457655001202468IND4372093720221116152237.0050707e20050630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437209372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aM001 0aM1201 aMia, M.Y.10aDetection of hybridization between Chinese carp species (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Aristichthys nobilis) in hatchery broodstock in Bangladesh, using DNA microsatellite loci  ap. 267-273.  aPaper presented at the Eighth International Symposium on Genetics in Aquaculture held November 9-15, 2003, Puerto Varas, Chile.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHybridization between silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) has been reported to occur fairly frequently in commercial aquaculture hatcheries in Bangladesh. The consequences of hybridization for broodstock purity had not previously been investigated. Allelic variation at three microsatellite DNA loci isolated from silver carp routinely distinguished between silver carp and bighead carp. These markers were used in the analysis of samples collected from hatcheries in different regions of Bangladesh. Of 422 hatchery broodstock that were morphologically identified as silver carp, 8.3% had bighead allele(s) at one or more of the three microsatellite loci, while 23.3% of the 236 fish morphologically identified as bighead carp had silver carp allele(s) at one or more loci. The results suggested that while some of these fish might be F1 hybrids, others had more complex genotypes, suggesting further generations of hybridization or introgression between the species in hatcheries, with potentially damaging consequences for the integrity of these stocks and their performance in aquaculture. 3afish culture 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ahybrids 3aalleles 3aloci 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3acarp 3agenetic variation 3afreshwater aquaculture 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3afreshwater fish 3apopulation genetics 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aanimal genetics 3aintrogression 3aBangladesh 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aAristichthys nobilis1 aTaggart, J.B.1 aGilmour, A.E.1 aGheyas, A.A.1 aDas, T.K.1 aKohinoor, A.H.M.1 aRahman, M.A.1 aSattar, M.A.1 aHussain, M.G.1 aMazid, M.A.0 tAquaculture.g2005 June 30, v. 247, no. 1-4 p.267-273dElsevier Pub.

The mineralization rates of three MUs: Short (S), Medium (M), and Long (L) with different water solubilities were measured at two temperatures in a soil with low (fallow, F) and high (cover crop, CC) microbial activity. In the greenhouse study, the fate of fertilizer N was followed using 15N-urea and 15N-MU. The fertilizer N efficiency calculated for urea using the 15N mass balance approach was 93 and 85% compared with 65 and 67% for MU-S in F and CC soils, respectively. During six months of incubation, 52 and 63% of MU-S N was mineralized at 20 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The accumulated N data suggested that the degradation of all three MU types followed first-order reaction kinetics. The reaction rates were similar for all three MUs and increased with increasing temperature. However, fitting discrete, non-accumulated data revealed that MU mineralization is more complex and cannot be modeled with simple exponential decay equations. The size and activity of SMB did not affect the mineralization rate of MU-N under laboratory or greenhouse conditions. Interestingly, Activity Index (AI), defined as the slowly available pool of MU-N, was not a reliable indicator for the mineralization rate and plant availability of MU-N. 3amineralization 3aagricultural soils 3asoil temperature 3aurea formaldehyde 3afallow 3acover crops 3asoil microorganisms 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3abiodegradation 3aurea fertilizers 0aslow-release fertilizers 0amethylene urea1 aHorwath, W.R.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2004 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.25-35dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:FRES.0000012232.56756.f03Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-1314/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245007500195300001600270520172200286650002502008650002202033650001302055650001802068650002002086650001302106650001202119650001402131650001502145650001702160650002002177650001802197650001602215650001202231651002002243651003302263700002102296700001802317773008402335852000902419930003302428945002502461946001102486655001202497IND4369290920221116152438.0050426e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436929092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGeorge, T.S.10aBehaviour of plant-derived extracellular phytase upon addition to soil  ap. 977-988.  aThe behaviour of phytase after addition to three soil types with different sorption capacities was investigated. Phytase was collected from the roots of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana that express a phytase gene from Aspergillus niger. Phytase activity in solution and on the solid phase of the soil was monitored over time. Phytase added to the solution phase of a soil suspension (1:20, w/v) was almost completely lost within 10 min in all soil types, while phytase in non-soil controls remained active in solution. Phytase activity lost from solution was recovered on the soil solid phase, suggesting rapid adsorption of the enzyme. Adsorption of phytase was less in soil taken from the rhizosphere of transgenic plants expressing phyA, indicating that the rhizosphere environment may help maintain phytase activity in solution. The activity of adsorbed phytase declined with time at a rate 2-4 times slower than that in the absence of soil. Adsorption of phytase in soils was highest at pH 4.5, which is below the reported isoelectric point (pI) of the Aspergillus phytase. As soil pH increased, adsorption decreased until, at pH 7.5, all phytase was in solution. Where phytase remained in solution, activity was maintained for at least 8 d. In contrast, the activity of adsorbed phytase was increasingly inhibited with time, particularly at low pH. By increasing the pH in soil suspensions, phytase that had remained active on the soil solid phase for 28 d was almost totally desorbed. Rapid immobilisation of phytase in soil may limit its capacity to interact with phytate, and this may compromise the ability of transgenic plants which exude phytase from their roots to acquire P from endogenous soil phytate. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atransgenic plants 3aphytases 3aroot exudates 3asoil amendments 3aAlfisols 3aOxisols 3aSpodosols 3aadsorption 3asoil enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3asoil solution 3arhizosphere 3asoil pH 3aNew South Wales 3aAustralian Capital Territory1 aRichardson, A.E.1 aSimpson, R.J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2005 May, v. 37, no. 5 p.977-988x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20070927b20071002c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02946naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245011400159300001600273520187900289650002902168650002802197650001502225650001502240650001702255650000902272650001702281650002002298650001902318650001902337700002302356700001902379773008402398852000902482930003302491945002502524946001102549655001202560IND4369290320221116152531.0050426e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436929032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Experiments were carried out with Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea caliginosa in 24 perspex columns (phi 10 cm), filled with 20-23 cm non-polluted soil (OM 2%, clay 2.9%, pH 0.01 M CaCl2 6.4), that was covered by a 3-5 cm layer of aged zinc spiked soil (500 mg Zn/kg dry soil) and another 2 cm non-polluted soil on top. After 80 and 175 days, columns were sacrificed and each cm from the top down to a depth of 15 cm was sampled. Earthworm casts, placed on top of the soil, were collected. Each sample was analyzed for total and CaCl2-exchangeable zinc concentrations. Effects of earthworm bioturbation were most pronounced after 175 days. For A. chlorotica, total and CaCl2-exchangeable zinc concentrations in the polluted layers were lower with than without earthworms. Total zinc concentrations in the non-polluted layers were higher in columns with earthworms. Casts of A. chlorotica collected on the soil surface showed slightly higher total zinc concentrations than non-polluted soil. Casts were found throughout the whole column. For A. caliginosa there were no differences in total zinc concentration between columns with and without earthworms. CaCl2-exchangeable zinc concentrations in the polluted layers were lower for columns with earthworms. Casts were mainly placed on top of the soil and contained total zinc concentrations intermediate between those in non-polluted and polluted soil layers. This study shows that different endogeic earthworm species have different effects on zinc distribution and availability in soils. A. chlorotica transfers soil throughout the whole column, effectively mixing it, while A. caliginosa decreases metal availability and transfers polluted soil to the soil surface. 3aAllolobophora chlorotica 3aAporrectodea caliginosa 3aearthworms 3aworm casts 3abioturbation 3azinc 3aheavy metals 3abioavailability 3apolluted soils 3asoil pollution1 aGestel, C.A.M. van1 aEijsackers, H.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2005 May, v. 37, no. 5 p.917-925x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20070927b20071002c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03366naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179072000900188100001800197245010800215300001600323500002400339500001500363506007600378520114500454506003701599650002501636650002101661650002801682650002501710650001901735650001701754650001401771650002601785650001101811650002101822650005301843650001501896650004001911650005401951650003602005650002502041650004402066650003802110650002702148650004402175650003302219650004002252650003002292653001802322700001902340700001302359700001702372700001702389700002102406773009702427852000902524856007802533930003302611945002502644946001102669655001202680IND4372569920221207084834.0050720e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437256992DNAL7 a159441742pmid7 aPMC42468812pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mci1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF4001 aYoshinaga, K.10aMitochondrial behaviour in the early stages of ROS stress leading to cell death in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 337-342.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in triggering cell death. To visualize mitochondrial behaviour under ROS stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants possessing mitochondrial-targeted GFP (S65T) were studied. METHODS: Arabidopsis leaves were treated with ROS and ROS-inducing chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, paraquat and menadione. Microscopic observations were carried out using a confocal laser scanning microscope system, and electrolyte leakage was also monitored. KEY RESULTS: After treatment, mitochondria showed morphological changes from a bacillus-like to a round shape. The size of mitochondria treated with H₂O₂ decreased by half compared with controls. Concurrently, cytoplasmic streaming was blocked and mitochondria eventually swelled. Treatment of leaves with butanedione monoxime, an inhibitor of myosin ATPase, resulted in similar behaviour of mitochondria to that under ROS stress. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that morphological changes of mitochondria and cessation of cytoplasmic streaming may interact, and this phenomenon is one of the features of ROS stress-induced cell death.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3adevelopmental stages 3ahistochemistry 3amitochondria 3aapoptosis 3acytoplasmic streaming 3aleaves 3astress tolerance 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Death 2aCytoplasmic Streamingxdrug effects 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMitochondriaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMyosinsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aParaquatxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aVitamin K 3xpharmacology 0aplant anatomy1 aArimura, S.

Most studies have only used monosaline solutions, although these limit the extent to which one can interpret the results or relate them to field conditions. The aim of this work was to evaluate the germination of Prosopis strombulifera seeds under increasing salinity by using the most abundant salts in central Argentina in monosaline or bisaline iso-osmotic solutions, or in solutions of mannitol and polyethylene glycol. METHODS: Seeds were allowed to germinate under controlled conditions in a germination chamber at 30 ± 1 °C and at 80 % r.h. Salinizing agents were KCl, NaCl, Na₂SO₄, K₂SO₄, NaCl + Na₂SO₄ and KCl + K₂SO₄ and osmotic agents were polyethylene glycol 6000 and mannitol. Treatments for all osmotica consisted of 0·0, -0·4, -0·8, -1·2, -1·5, -1·9 and -2·2 MPa solutions. KEY RESULTS: The percentage of germination decreased as salinity increased. SO4(2-) in monosaline solutions, with osmotic potentials -1·2 MPa and lower, was more inhibitory than Cl⁻ at iso-osmotic concentrations. This SO4(2-) toxicity was alleviated in salt mixtures and was more noticeable in higher concentrations. K⁺ was more inhibitory than Na⁺ independently of the accompanying anion. CONCLUSIONS: Different responses to different compositions of iso-osmotic salt solutions and to both osmotic agents indicate specific ionic effects. This study demonstrates that the germination of P. strombulifera is strongly influenced by the nature of the ions in the salt solutions and their interactions. Comparative studies of Cl⁻ and [Formula: see text] effects and the interaction between SO4(2-) and Cl⁻ in salt mixtures indicate that extrapolation of results obtained with monosaline solutions in the laboratory to field conditions can be speculative.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aindigenous species 3aProsopis strombulifera 3aseed germination 3asalinity 3aosmotic pressure 3awater uptake 3asodium chloride 3apotassium chloride 3amannitol 3apolyethylene glycol 3adose response 2aChloridesxpharmacology 2aGerminationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMannitolxpharmacology 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aOsmotic Pressure. 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxpharmacology 2aPotassium Chloridexpharmacology 2aProsopisxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSulfatesxpharmacology 3aArgentina1 aLlanes, A.1 aReinoso, H.1 aReginato, M.1 aLuna, V.0 tAnnals of botany.g2005 Aug., v. 96, no. 2 p.261-267dAcademic Press [etc.]x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mci1733Available from publisher's Web site  a20050915b00000000c00000000  aINDdMKSe2005/09/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03341naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001500172245014400187300001600331520123100347650002201578650002201600650001401622650001701636650002001653650001601673650001301689650001101702650000901713650000901722650002501731650002001756650001001776650002001786650002401806650001801830650004401848650001501892650004401907650003801951650002901989650003802018650002802056650002102084650002702105650004202132650001802174650002702192650004802219650007102267653002302338653001402361700001702375700002102392700001302413773008102426852000902507856009402516930003302610945001302643946001102656655001202667IND2063072520221116152509.0980411e199704  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206307252DNAL7 a91770322pmid7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0291902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurepa, J.10aDifferential expression of CuZn- and Fe-superoxide dismutase genes of tobacco during development, oxidative stress, and hormonal treatments  ap. 463-470.  aChloroplasts of Nicotiana tabacum have two superoxide dismutases: a Fe- and a CuZn-containing enzyme, encoded by the nuclear genes sodB and sodCp, respectively. As a first step in studying the physiological function of these two enzymes, we compared the expression of sodB and sodCp in different plant organs, in response to hormonal treatments, and upon treatment with paraquat and Norflurazon. The sodCp transcript and active enzyme were detected only in young leaves of mature plants. The sodB transcript was more abundant in young compared to old leaves, but the enzymatic activity was higher in mature and senescent leaves. sodCp and sodB exhibited a different expression pattern upon treatment with abscisic acid, indole 3-acetic acid, kinetin, gibberellin, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate. Paraquat treatment caused a decrease in abundance of both transcripts, although the dose dependency of this decrease differed. Norflurazon-induced photooxidation resulted in a 10-fold increase of sodCp mRNA whereas the sodB transcript level was 25% higher than the control. These differences in expression might explain why both plastid-located superoxide dismutase enzymes are needed, particularly under stress conditions. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aplant development 3aoxidation 3achloroplasts 3agene expression 3anorflurazon 3aparaquat 3acopper 3azinc 3airon 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3astress response 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aChloroplastsxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aDNA, Plant 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidative Stress 2aParaquatxpharmacology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlants, Toxic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0agenetic regulation 0asod genes1 aHerouart, D.1 aMontagu, M. van.1 aInze, D.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1997 Apr., v. 38, no. 4 p.463-470x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0291903Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03744naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179072000900188100001600197245014500213300001600358500002400374500001500398520191300413650001502326650002302341650001602364650000902380650001402389650002302403650001802426650002802444650001402472650001902486650001702505650001502522653002802537653001902565653002502584653002202609653001602631653002702647653002402674653002002698700001802718700001702736773012602753852000902879856009202888856009302980930003303073945002503106946001103131655001203142IND4372127920221116152440.0050708e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437212792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2005.00271.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL001 0aF600 0aF3001 aJonsson, M.10aBehavioural responses in three ichneumonid pollen beetle parasitoids to volatiles emitted from different phenological stages of oilseed rape  ap. 363-369.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPollen beetles (Meligethes spp.; Coleoptera: Nitiduliae) are a major pest of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. (Brassicaceae) in northern Europe. Phradis interstitialis Thomson, P. morionellus Holmgr., and Tersilochus heterocerus Thomson (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) are among the most frequent pollen beetle parasitoids. These three species differ in temporal occurrence, as well as in preferred host stage. The behavioural responses of female parasitoids to odours from oilseed rape at bud and flowering stage were evaluated in two-choice experiments. The role of visual stimuli was examined by combining green and yellow colours with odour stimuli. All three species were attracted to odours from the bud stage of oilseed rape. Tersilochus heterocerus was attracted to odours of flowering rape, but the two Phradis species avoided the flower odours. However, when the odours of flowering rape were combined with yellow, and odours of the bud stage were combined with green, P. interstitialis was equally attracted to both stimuli, and T. heterocerus showed an increased preference for flower odours, while no effect of colours could be found in P. morionellus. The observed differences in responses between the parasitoids may reflect differences in their biology and may be involved in the niche segregation of these often coexisting species. The volatile blends released from the two phenological stages were identified and compared. Clearly, odours can be reliable cues for differentiating between oilseed rape in the bud and flowering stage. Of 20 identified compounds, 18 were released at a significantly higher rate from flowering plants. The terpenes sabinene, myrcene, limonene, and (E,E)-α-farnesene were the dominant volatiles in the bud and flower headspace. A group of aromatic compounds including benzaldehyde, methyl benzoate, and phenyl acetaldehyde were mainly released from flowering rape. 3aterpenoids 3avolatile compounds 3aparasitoids 3abuds 3aflowering 3aaromatic compounds 3aIchneumonidae 3atritrophic interactions 3aphenology 3aBrassica napus 3ahost seeking 3aMeligethes 0aTersilochus heterocerus 0avisual stimuli 0adevelopmental stages 0aniche segregation 0aplant odors 0aPhradis interstitialis 0aPhradis morionellus 0aplant volatiles1 aLindkvist, A.1 aAnderson, P.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2005 June, v. 115, no. 3 p.363-369dKluwer Academic Publishersx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2005.00271.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0013-8703/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080617b20080704c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/07/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03254naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154100001700163245014500180300001600325500002400341520146600365650002201831650001701853650001601870650002601886650002001912650001801932650002101950650001601971650002301987650002202010650002102032650004002053650001202093650002102105650002102126650002502147650001802172650003802190650001402228650002702242700001502269700001502284700001602299773010902315852000902424856007502433856011102508930003302619945002502652946001102677655001202688IND4372120020221116152452.0050708e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437212002DNAL7 a158389322pmid7 a10.1002/ps.10562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8201 aBrooks, A.S.12aA laboratory-based comparison of a molluscicide and an alternative food source (red clover) as means of reducing slug damage to winter wheat  ap. 715-720.  aIncludes references  aSlugs are major pests of many crops in the UK, including winter wheat, yet current methods of control are often unreliable. This study investigates the potential use of red clover, as an alternative food source, to reduce the amount of damage caused to winter wheat by the field slug, Deroceras reticulatum (Muller). Two laboratory-based studies, each conducted over a 7-day period, investigated the effects of red clover seedlings and commercial metaldehyde pellets on damage to winter wheat seeds and seedlings. The results indicate that metaldehyde applications, in the form of commercially available pellets, resulted in significantly greater protection to wheat seeds compared with red clover, whereas metaldehyde and red clover were equally as effective in reducing damage to wheat seedlings. A further laboratory experiment investigated the effect of two slug population densities (48 and 16 adults m(-2)) and high and low red clover seed rates (125% and 75% of a standard rate) on damage to wheat seeds. Results showed that, at the highest slug population density, red clover sown at 125% of the standard rate gave 99% protection to wheat seeds, compared with the 75% seed rate which gave 55%. At the lower slug population density, both seed rates of red clover resulted in similar levels of protection. Implications for the potential use of red clover as an alternative food source for reducing damage to winter wheat in field conditions are discussed. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3aplant pests 3aDeroceras reticulatum 3amollusc control 3amolluscicides 3aapplication rate 3ametaldehyde 3aTrifolium pratense 3aalternative hosts 3acultural control 2aAcetaldehydexanalogs & derivatives 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFood Preferences 2aMolluscaxphysiology 2aMolluscacides 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aTrifolium 2aTriticumxparasitology1 aWilcox, A.1 aCook, R.T.1 aCrook, M.J.0 tPest management science.g2005 July, v. 61, no. 7 p.715-720dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.10563Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdMKSe2005/07/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03630naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100002400181245012800205300001600333500002400349500001500373520160500388650002301993650002102016650001902037650001302056650002402069650002002093650001602113650001802129650001502147650002102162650002302183650002502206650001502231650003902246650003802285650003302323650002402356650003102380650001802411650003002429650001602459650003602475651001902511653001902530700002002549700002002569700001802589773010902607852000902716856007502725856011102800930003302911945002502944946001102969655001202980IND4372119920221116152137.0050708e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437211992DNAL7 a158220692pmid7 a10.1002/ps.10512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ200 0aH0001 aA.

A batch equilibrium technique was used to investigate sorption of the fungicide AEC623892 to intact and hydrogen-peroxide-treated whole soils and several particle-size fractions isolated from them. Sorption of AEC623892 to the soil as a whole was low. K(f oc) values measured in the whole soils were 169.2 and 41.9 ml g(-1) for Soil A and Soil B respectively. The highest values of K(f oc) were measured in soil particle-size fractions <53 micrometer (266.5 ml g(-1) in the 2-20 micrometer fraction of Soil A; 471.9 ml g(-1) in the 20-53 micrometer fraction of Soil B). Sorption was most irreversible in the 2-20 micrometer fractions. Overall, treatment of soil particle-size fractions with hydrogen peroxide resulted in lower values of K(f oc) (112.3 ml g(-1) in Soil A whole soil and 30.9 ml g(-1) in Soil B whole soil). In both soils, the maximum sorption among hydrogen-peroxide-treated samples was observed in the <2 micrometer fraction (166.6 and 311.0 ml g(-1) for Soil A and Soil B, respectively). Investigation of the mineralogical composition of the soils suggested that the clay mineralogy (dominated by kaolinite and illite) is less likely to account for the differences in sorption observed than differences in the characteristics of the soil organic matter. Thermal analysis of the different soil fractions indicated that hydrogen peroxide treatment preferentially removed aliphatic fractions of organic matter, but had less effect on lignin-like, aromatic fractions. 3aagricultural soils 3athermal analysis 3asoil pollution 3asorption 3asoil organic matter 3aclay loam soils 3ametabolites 3aparticle size 3amineralogy 3asandy loam soils 3afungicide residues 3achemical degradation 2aAdsorption 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aFungicides, Industrialxchemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexchemistry 2aMineralsxchemistry 2aNicotinic Acidsxchemistry 2aParticle Size 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aTemperature 2aortho-Aminobenzoatesxchemistry 3aUnited Kingdom 0asoil chemistry1 aLopez-Capel, E.1 aManning, D.A.C.1 aWilkins, R.M.0 tPest management science.g2005 July, v. 61, no. 7 p.705-714dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.10513Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDdMKSe2005/07/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03161naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245008900160300001800249500014900267520192200416650002402338650001102362650001502373650002202388650002002410650002102430650002502451650002102476650001802497650002402515650001202539700001802551700001602569773008802585852000902673930003302682945002502715946001102740655001202751IND4365408020221116152103.0041105e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436540802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMondini, C.10aEnzymatic activity as a parameter for the characterization of the composting process  ap. 1587-1594.  aPaper presented at the Second International Conference on Enzymes in the Environment: Activity, Ecology and Applications held July 2003, Prague.  aEnzymatic activity (EA) was explored as a possible tool for composting characterization. Three composts (yard wastes, cotton wastes and a mixture of the two) were sampled during different phases of the process and divided in two fractions. The first was immediately analysed for microbial biomass C (BC) and EAs (beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid and alkaline phosphatase). The second fraction was air-dried prior to analysis for the same EAs and for organic C (C(ORG)), total N (N(TOT)), dissolved organic C (DOC), extractable C (C(E)) and humic-like C (C(H)). B(C) decreased throughout the composting period (149 days), whereas EA in moist fractions stabilized between 50 (beta-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase) and 90 (arylsulphatase, acid phosphatase) days of composting. EA was always reduced by air-drying (beta-glucosidase: 40-80%; arylsulphatase: 10-50%; acid phosphatase: 10-70%; alkaline phosphatase: 50-90%), but this effect was less prominent as composting proceeded, especially for beta-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase. EA in air-dried samples displayed the same trend as in moist ones, except that there was a marked difference (47-66%) between initial and final activities of all four enzymes. EAs in air-dried compost and content of humic-like substances showed a similar trend: a marked increase in the first 90 days of the process and no significant variations afterwards. This suggests that the formation of humic-enzymatic complexes has taken place and indicates that this process occurs almost totally during the first stage of composting. EA steadiness in air-dried samples occurred concurrently with the achievement of compost stability, as indicated by the conventional indexes (i.e. C(H), C(ORG)/N(TOT)). Therefore, the development of a stable enzyme activity in air-dried compost could represent a simple measure of compost stabilization in routine analysis of composting process. 3ayard waste composts 3acotton 3acomposting 3acompost stability 3aenzyme activity 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abeta-glucosidase 3aarylsulfatase 3asoil microorganisms 3abiomass1 aFornasier, F.1 aSinicco, T.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.1587-1594x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20041228b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03149naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178072001700195100001900212245014400231300001800375520168000393650001502073650001702088650002402105650001602129650001502145650002602160650002002186650001502206650001902221650001302240650002202253650001602275650001502291650001302306650002102319650002002340650001302360650002402373651001102397700001502408700001802423773008802441852000902529930003302538945002502571946001102596655001202607IND4365415120221116152033.0041105e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436541512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFransson, A.M.14aThe wood-decaying fungus Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca increases P availability in acid forest humus soil, while N addition hampers this effect  ap. 1699-1705.  aWe evaluated the influence of the brown rot fungus Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca on P solubility in the humus layer of a podzolic forest soil. This fungus is known to exude large amounts of oxalic acid that may stimulate weathering of minerals and increase dissolution of humus, which in turn may increase P availability in the soil surrounding the fungus. Humus was inoculated using small wooden pieces colonised by the fungus. The presence of the fungus resulted in elevated concentration of PO4- in the humus solution. In a second experiment birch seedlings grown in the same humus were able to utilise the PO4- mobilised by the fungus to increase their internal P content. The factor determining this increased P uptake and the increased available P might be oxalate produced by fungus. The acid may directly dissolve P or change organic forms of P making it more susceptible to reaction with phosphatases. This fungal effect on P solubility diminished when N was added to the soil in the form of a slow release N fertilizer (methyl urea), or when a soil with a higher soil N concentration was used. We found a strong correlation between NH4+ concentration and total organic carbon in the soil solution at high NH4+ concentrations, suggesting the dissolution of humus as a result of the high NH4+ content in the solution. This study demonstrates that the wood-decaying fungus H. aurantiaca influences nutrient turnover in forest soil, and thereby nutrient uptake by forest trees. An intensified harvest of forest products such as whole tree harvesting may decrease the active biomass of the wood decomposers and may thereby change the availability of P and the leaching of N. 3aacid soils 3aforest soils 3asoil organic matter 3adecay fungi 3aphosphorus 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3asolubility 3abiodegradation 3anitrogen 3aenzyme inhibition 3aoxalic acid 3aphosphates 3aleaching 3aBetula pubescens 3aseedling growth 3anitrates 3areaction inhibition 3aSweden1 aValeur, I.1 aWallander, H.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.1699-1705x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20041229b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02724naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245007500160300001800235500014900253520138500402650001401787650001901801650002901820650001501849650002001864650002301884650002201907650002501929650002701954650001101981650002201992650002002014650001202034651001002046700001602056700001502072700001302087773008802100852000902188930003302197945002502230946001102255655001202266IND4365413120221116151939.0041105e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436541312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFreeman, C.12aA regulatory role for phenol oxidase during decomposition in peatlands  ap. 1663-1667.  aPaper presented at the Second International Conference on Enzymes in the Environment: Activity, Ecology and Applications held July 2003, Prague.  aUnique peatland properties, such as their ability to preserve intact ancient human remains (bog bodies) and to store globally significant quantities of atmospheric CO2, can be attributed to their low rates of enzymic decomposition. Peatland soils are normally devoid of molecular oxygen in all, but the uppermost layer, and thus enzymes such as phenol oxidase, which require molecular oxygen for their activity, are rarely active. Interestingly, even the activities of enzymes such as hydrolases that have no oxygen requirement, are also extremely limited in peatlands. Here, we show that those low hydrolase activities can be indirectly attributed to oxygen constraints on phenol oxidase. On addition of oxygen, phenol oxidase activity increased 7-fold, P<0.05, a response that allowed phenolic depletion in the peatland soil. Phenolic materials are highly inhibitory to enzymes and their lower abundance allowed higher hydrolase activities (beta-glucosidase 26%, P<0.05, phosphatase 18%, P<0.05, sulphatase 47%, P<0.01, xylosidase 16%, P<0.05 and chitinase 22%, P<0.05). Thus, oxygen constraints upon phenol oxidase activity promote conditions that inhibit decomposition. This mechanism has important implications for preservation of archaeological organic materials, sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and potentially in the preservation of food and treatment of water pollution. 3apeatlands 3abiodegradation 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3ahydrolases 3aenzyme activity 3aoxygen requirement 3aenzyme inhibition 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3acarbon 3afood preservation 3awater pollution 3aphenols 3aWales1 aOstle, N.J.1 aFenner, N.1 aKang, H.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.1663-1667x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20041228b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02703naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002000127245014400147300001800291520157500309650002301884650001801907650001601925650002201941650001501963650001601978650002401994650002402018650001502042650001702057651001502074700001802089700001702107700001502124773008802139852000902227930003302236945002502269946001102294655001202305IND4365420220221116151907.0041105e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436542022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDrenovsky, R.E.10aComparison of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and total soil fatty acid methyl esters (TSFAME) for characterizing soil microbial communities  ap. 1793-1800.  aPhospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and total soil fatty acid methyl esters (TSFAME), both lipid-based approaches used to characterize microbial communities, were compared with respect to their reliable detection limits, extraction precision, and ability to differentiate agricultural soils. Two sets of soil samples, representing seven crop types from California's Central Valley, were extracted using PLFA and TSFAME procedures. PLFA analysis required 10 times more soil than TSFAME analysis to obtain a reliable microbial community fingerprint and total fatty acid content measurement. Although less soil initially was extracted with TSFAME, total fatty acid (FA) content g-1 soil (DW) was more than 7-fold higher in TSFAME- versus PLFA-extracted samples. Sample extraction precision was much lower with TSFAME analysis than PLFA analysis, with the coefficient of variation between replicates being as much as 4-fold higher with TSFAME extraction. There were significant differences between PLFA- and TSFAME-extracted samples when biomarker pool sizes (mol% values) for bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi were compared. Correspondence analysis (CA) of PLFA and TSFAME samples indicated that extraction method had the greatest influence on sample FA composition. Soil type also influenced FA composition, with samples grouping by soil type with both extraction methods. However, separate CAs of PLFA- and TSFAME extracted samples depicted strong differences in underlying sample groupings. Recommendations for the selection of extraction method are presented and discussed. 3aagricultural soils 3aphospholipids 3afatty acids 3afatty acid esters 3aextraction 3amethodology 3asoil microorganisms 3acommunity structure 3abiomarkers 3asoil texture 3aCalifornia1 aElliott, G.N.1 aGraham, K.J.1 aScow, K.M.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.1793-1800x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20041229b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03490naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100002100195245010100216300001800317520203600335650002202371650001702393650001502410650001502425650001702440650002402457650002102481650001002502650002302512650002002535650001202555650002302567650002702590650002902617650003302646650001902679650002102698651001002719651002502729700001702754700002302771773008802794852000902882930003302891945002502924946001102949655001202960IND4365416120221116152213.0041105e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436541612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRutigliano, F.A.10aSoil microbial metabolism and nutrient status in a Mediterranean area as affected by plant cover  ap. 1719-1729.  aThe Mediterranean area of Southern Italy is characterized by different natural plant covers that mainly reflect different successional stages (i.e. low maquis, high maquis, Quercus ilex wood) and managed areas with introduced plant species (such as Pinus species). Soil properties could be affected by plant cover types as well as by plant species. Our objective was to determine the relationships of plant cover types and plant species with the chemical and biological characteristics of the soil. In four neighbouring areas with different plant cover types (low maquis, pure high maquis, high maquis with pines and pinewood, with pines planted by foresters in both cases), soil samples were collected under different plant species in order to evaluate the effect of plant cover types and plant species on soil properties. Soil samples were analyzed for nutrient content, microbial biomass, soil potential respiration and enzymatic activity (phosphatase, arylsulphatase, beta-glucosidase and hydrolase activities) as well as for pH, water holding capacity (WHC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Application of cluster analysis and principal component analysis to the data revealed that the plant cover type was the key factor influencing soil properties more than plant species. In fact, the largest differences were observed between pure high maquis soils and all other soils, with pure high maquis soils generally showing the highest values of WHC, CEC, nutrient content, organic and microbial C, soil respiration, phosphatase, arylsulphatase and beta-glucosidase activities. The significantly lower values of these variables in the low maquis relative to the pure high maquis probably reflect the effect of ecological succession on soil. The high maquis with pine, differing from the pure high maquis only for the presence or absence of pine, showed values of soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics similar to those found in the low maquis, thus suggesting that the presence of pine retards soil development. 3aground vegetation 3aforest soils 3ashrublands 3agrasslands 3aQuercus ilex 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 3aPinus 3aintroduced species 3aenzyme activity 3asoil pH 3adry matter content 3awater holding capacity 3acation exchange capacity 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil nutrients 3anutrient content 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aD'Ascoli, R.1 aVirzo De Santo, A.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.1719-1729x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20041229b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02209naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245012400196300001800320500001500338520086200353650002001215650001301235650001101248650001001259650001901269650002401288650002201312650001701334650002101351650002001372650002601392651001201418653001401430700001401444700001701458700001401475700001501489700001801504700001501522773008801537852000901625930003301634945002501667946001101692655001201703IND4365419420221116152212.0041105e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436541942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We investigated stable isotope ratios (15N/14N) in a diverse group of soil microarthropods, oribatid mites, to evaluate trophic niche differentiation. The natural variation of the stable isotopes 15N/14N was measured in 36 species/taxa from four beech and beech-oak forests. Signatures of delta15N formed a gradient spanning over 12delta units suggesting that (a) different species occupy different trophic niches and (b) oribatid mites span three to four trophic levels. This study for the first time documented strong trophic niche differentiation in decomposer microarthropods. The results suggest that trophic niche differentiation within taxonomic groups significantly contributes to the high diversity of soil animal taxa. 3asoil arthropods 3anitrogen 3aniches 3amites 3aSarcoptiformes 3asoil microorganisms 3aspecies diversity 3aforest soils 3afeeding behavior 3astable isotopes 3atrophic relationships 3aGermany 0aOribatida1 aMigge, S.1 aNorton, R.A.1 aScheu, S.1 aLangel, R.1 aReineking, A.1 aMaraun, M.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.1769-1774x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20041229b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02520naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245013100171300001400302520137200316650002201688650001501710650002101725650001001746650001701756650001601773650001801789650002301807650002001830653001601850700001501866700001401881773007901895852000901974856009401983930003302077945001302110946001102123655001202134IND2056174520221116152604.0970326e199701  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205617452DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0290832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitamura, S.10aAdaptive growth responses to osmotic stress of hypocotyl sections of Vigna unguiculata: roles of the xylem proton pump and IAA  ap. 44-50.  aThe growth responses to osmotic stress of hypocotyl sections of Vigna unguiculata were studied by the xylem perfusion method. Hypocotyl sections shrank upon exposure to osmotic stress. Sections showed no adaptive responses to osmotic stress when they were in an IAA-depleted condition as a result of perfusion with solutions that lacked IAA for 3-4 h. The correlation between the growth rate and the membrane potential of the xylem/symplast boundary (Vpx) was very limited in the absence of IAA. By contrast, hypocotyl sections showed distinct adaptive responses to osmotic stress after perfusion with solutions that contained 10 micromolar IAA. In the presence of IAA, Vpx increased in the negative direct on and growth resumed in spite of the osmotic stress. The growth rate was closely correlated with the xylem membrane potential. Hyperpolarization of the membranes of the xylem/symplast boundary always preceded the recovery of growth under osmotic stress. It appears that IAA is essential for the adaptive recovery of growth under osmotic stress and, moreover, that the xylem proton pump plays an indispensable role in modulating the growth of hypocotyl sections. This result confirms prediction of an earlier simulation study using the apoplast canal model [Katou and Furumoto (1986) Protoplasma 133: 174, Katou and Enomoto (1991) Plant Cell Physiol. 32: 343]. 3aVigna unguiculata 3ahypocotyls 3aosmotic pressure 3axylem 3awater uptake 3aproton pump 3adose response 3aindole acetic acid 3astress response 0agrowth rate1 aMizuno, A.1 aKatou, K.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1997 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.44-50x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0290833Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02974naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245008100168300001400249520168900263650002601952650001301978650001501991650001002006650001102016650001002027650000802037650001802045650001502063650001102078650002302089650003002112650001802142650003602160650002002196653003202216700001402248700001502262773007902277852000902356856009402365930003302459945001302492946001102505655001202516IND2056174120221116152700.0970326e199701  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205617412DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0290782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, J.10aHow do roots control xylem sap ABA concentration in response to soil drying?  ap. 10-16.  aMaize (Zea mays L.) and Leucaena leucocephala (a tropical tree) were subjected to different degrees of soil drying and changes in their root and xylem ABA concentrations were measured simultaneously. Additional treatments such as defoliation, light sheltering and stem girdling were applied so that phloem transport into roots was manipulated. When soil was dried, ABA concentration in xylem sap increased almost linearly with that of roots in both species. Such an increase was relatively plateaued at high root ABA concentrations, suggesting that severe soil drying might have hindered some parts of roots from delivering ABA into xylem flow. When 3H-ABA was loaded into roots and monitored for its disappearance, it was found that the capability of roots to catabolize ABA was much lower than that reported for leaves, with a half-life of 1.15 h and a considerable amount (46%) of fed 3H-ABA was remained unmodified during 21 h of incubation. Previous soil drying significantly reduced such a capability of catabolism and extended the half-life of fed 3H-ABA to 2.27 h, and the amount remaining unmodified was elevated to 50.7%. Defoliation and light-sheltering treatments significantly reduced xylem ABA concentration of waterstressed plants. Using stem girdling approach, it was estimated that about 25 to 30% of ABA in the xylem sap might come from shoot through phloem under soil drying condition. It was concluded that in addition to an enhanced ABA biosynthesis in roots during soil drying, a slowed ABA catabolism in roots and an increased import from shoots were also important contributions to the sensitive changes of xylem ABA concentration in response to such a stress. 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aZea mays 3asoil water 3aroots 3aphloem 3axylem 3asap 3aabscisic acid 3ametabolism 3ashoots 3anutrient transport 3asource-sink relationships 3awater content 3achemical constituents of plants 3astress response 0adehydration (physiological)1 aZhang, J.1 aWong, M.H.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1997 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.10-16x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0290783Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01833naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245012400168300001600292520050300308650002100811650001900832650001100851650001300862650000900875650001600884650002300900650001500923650002900938650001600967700001400983700001600997700001701013700001601030700001801046700001301064700001401077700001301091700001701104773008201121852000901203856009401212930003301306945001301339946001101352655001201363IND2056098720221116152840.0970324e199609  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205609872DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0290292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakao, N.10aDiscovery of natural photosynthesis using Zn-containing bacteriochlorophyll in an aerobic bacterium Acidiphilium rubrum  ap. 889-893.  aWe discovered natural photosynthesis using Zn-containing bacteriochlorophyll a in an acidophilic bacterium Acidiphilium rubrum.

Effects of the presence of membrane structure on the redox reactions at the QB site  ap. 976-982.  a2019-12-04  aReduction kinetics of chloro- or methyl-substituted benzoquinones (BQS) in spinach PSII membrane fragments or n-heptyl-beta D-thioglucoside-extracted PSII core complexes (HTG-PSII) was studied and compared to that in cyanobacterial PSII core complexes [Satoh et al. (1995) Plant Cell Physiol 36: 597]. It was found that the BQS accept electrons at two sites (the QB and PQ sites) in the both spinach preparations as in the cyanobacterial preparation. Maximum turnover rates (Vmax) and binding affinities (Km) of the two sites were estimated. Comparison of the values in PSII membrane fragments with those in HTG-PSII showed that removal of the membrane structure or light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complexes from the PSII core complexes had little effect on the characteristics of the QR site, indicating that the HTG-PSII have the intact QB site and are good materials to study the site. The Km and Vmax values were comparable to those in the cyanobacterial preparation. Low affinity (high Km values) and high Vmax values of methyl-substituted BQS to the QB site and almost the same rate of intrinsic electron flow through the QB site in the both spinach preparations further support the hypothesis that the plastoquinone (PQ) molecule at the QB site is not replaced by another PQ molecule but, after reduction, only its head group goes out of the QB pocket, and comes back after transferring the electrons and protons to a free PQ molecule [Satoh et al.

Following mechanical wounding simulating insect damage, PPO activity increased dramatically in wounded and unwounded leaves on wounded plants beginning at 24 and 48 h, respectively. A hybrid poplar PPO cDNA was isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined. On northern blots, PPO transcripts were detected within 8 h of wounding, and reached peak levels at 16 and 24 h in wounded and unwounded leaves, respectively. Methyl jasmonate spray and feeding by forest tent caterpillar also induced PPO expression. The induction of PPO was strongest in the youngest four leaves, which were generally avoided by caterpillars in free feeding experiments. This wound- and herbivore-induced expression of PPO in hybrid poplar supports the defensive role of this protein against insect pests.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3ainsect pests 3acomplementary DNA 3acatechol oxidase 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aMalacosoma disstria 3amechanical damage 3anucleotide sequences 3aabiotic stress 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenzyme activity 3adetection 3aPopulus generosa 3aleaves 3adefense mechanisms 2aAcetatesxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCatechol Oxidasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysis 2aEnzyme Induction 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aInsecta. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxylipins 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRNA, Plantxanalysis 2aTreesxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aPopulus interamericana 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af2636111 aYip, L.1 aPatton, J.J.1 aChristopher, M.E.0 tPlant physiology.g2000 Sept., v. 124, no. 1 p.285-295dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02263naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245012300158300001600281500001500297520107900312650004501391650003001436650002601466650002201492650003001514650002101544650001501565650002401580651001201604653002701616700001501643700001501658700001701673773008501690852000901775930003301784945002501817946001101842655001201853IND4366004420221116150358.0041210e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436600442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In 9 out of 10 soils S. meliloti was detected, whereas S. medicae was recovered from only 5 out of 10 soils. The cross-nodulation of three populations of M. truncatula grown on Bulla Regia soil, which contained naturally the two Sinorhizobium species, showed that M. truncatula population collected from Amra site was selective to S. meliloti at least in soil conditions. Forty-eight isolates of each Sinorhizobium species trapped by M. truncatula populations collected from Bulla Regia, Soliman and Rhayet sites on Bulla Regia soil were characterized by repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (REP-PCR) and showed a clear distinction between the two Sinorhizobium species and a higher diversity for S. meliloti. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ageographical distribution 3aSinorhizobium medicae 3agenetic variation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aEnsifer meliloti 3anodulation 3aMedicago truncatula 3aTunisia 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aMhamdi, R.1 aHuguet, T.1 aAouani, M.E.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 June, v. 36, no. 6 p.903-908x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02436naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245005700146300001600203500002400219520104600243650002201289650001201311650001301323650001601336650003001352650002001382650002601402650001901428650001201447650001301459650004901472650003801521650003101559650006401590650001201654653002301666653001401689773013301703852000901836856007601845930003301921945001301954946001101967655001201978IND2207807020221116150428.0001116e200009  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220780702DNAL7 a109858032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, J.K.A.10aAvian pneumovirus infections of turkeys and chickens  ap. 118-125.  aIncludes references  aAvian pneumoviruses (APVs) cause major disease and welfare problems in many areas of the world. In turkeys the respiratory disease and the effect on egg laying performance are clearly defined. However, in chickens, the role of APV as a primary pathogen is less clear, although it is widely believed to be one of the factors involved in Swollen Head Syndrome. The mechanisms of virus transmission over large distances are not understood, but wild birds have been implicated. APV has recently been reported in the USA for the first time and the virus isolated was a different type or possibly a different serotype from the APVs found elsewhere. Good biosecurity is crucial for controlling infection and highly effective vaccines are available for prophylaxis. Although different subtypes and possibly different serotypes exist, there is good cross protection between them. Diagnosis is usually based on serology using ELISAs, but the available kits give variable results, interpretation is difficult and improved diagnostic tests are required. 3adisease diagnosis 3aturkeys 3achickens 3aPneumovirus 3ageographical distribution 3adisease control 3abiological resistance 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDisease Transmission, Infectiousxveterinary 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aPneumovirusxpathogenicity 2aPneumovirus Infectionsxdiagnosisxpathologyxtransmission. 2aTurkeys 0aliterature reviews 0atreatment0 tVeterinary journal.g2000 Sept., v. 160, no. 2 p.118-125dHarcourtaVeterinary journal (London, England : 1997)x1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.harcourt-international.com/wbs/tvj3electronic resource  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02965naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245008700177300001600264500001500280520177000295650002902065650001802094650001902112650000902131650001702140650002402157650001202181650001502193650001402208650001702222650002002239650001902259651001102278653002402289700001702313700001502330773008402345852000902429930003302438945002502471946001102496655001202507IND4366001720221116150408.0041210e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436600172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Chemical methods have been devised to directly measure the biological available pools of trace metals, but such methods need to be validated against measured exposure of organisms in the soil. We studied acquired Zn- and Cd tolerance of the soil microbial community as a reporter of its exposure, and compared it with chemical determination of Zn and Cd in 10 soils differing in pH, organic matter content, texture, vegetation-/cultivation history and metal contamination. The tolerance was measured as LC50 (i.e. the metal concentration which inhibits 50% of the activity) in suspensions of extracted soil bacteria, by measuring the incorporation rate of [3H] thymidine at different metal concentrations. Chemical determination of Cd and Zn in soils included total concentrations by aqua regia extractions (AR), and total concentrations in extracted pore water (PW). In addition was the 'effective concentration' (C(E)) determined using the Diffusion Gradients in Thins films method (DGT). The LC50 values correlated better with PW (r2 = 0.90 for Cd and r2 = 0.97 for Zn) and C(E) (0.90 for Cd and 0.98 for Zn) compared to the correlation with AR (0.72 for Cd and 0.82 for Zn). After excluding a single extremely contaminated soil from the analysis, the correlation of LC50 with AR was much poorer (r2 = 0.03 (ns) for Cd and r2 = 0.48 for Zn), whereas correlations remained significant for both PW (0.90 for Cd and 0.87 for Zn) and C(E) (0.54 for Cd and 0.84 for Zn). In conclusion, PW fraction of Cd and Zn appear to be the best predictor of trace metal exposure of the soil microorganisms. 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil bacteria 3asoil pollution 3azinc 3aheavy metals 3asoil organic matter 3acadmium 3avegetation 3amortality 3asoil texture 3ametal tolerance 3apolluted soils 3aNorway 0asoil microorganisms1 aBakken, L.R.1 aMulder, J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.805-813x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02884naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245011900177300001800296520164600314650001701960650001401977650001901991650001902010650001502029650001902044650001902063650001502082650001802097650002402115650001802139650001602157650001402173650001802187650002102205700001602226700001902242773008702261852000902348930003302357945002502390946001102415655001202426IND4366003820221116150439.0041210e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436600382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBundy, J.G.10aCombined microbial community level and single species biosensor responses to monitor recovery of oil polluted soil  ap. 1149-1159.  aUnderstanding the effects of oil contamination on the composition and function of soil microbiota entails investigation of the effects of a mixture of hydrocarbons at the community level in a complex environmental matrix. One approach to this difficult problem is to ally a community-level fingerprinting approach with bioassays that have a physiological or functional implication. Two contrasting refined oils (paraffin and motor oil) were used to contaminate soil microcosms, and a simulated bioremediation treatment with nutrient-addition was applied. The indigenous microorganisms were monitored over 103 d using complementary community-level techniques (carbon source physiological profiling using Biolog microplates, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling). Changes in the toxicity of the applied oils were monitored using luminescent bacterial bioassays, including Vibrio fischeri and a hydrocarbon-degrading Pseudomonas putida strain. Distinct shifts in microbial community structure and C source utilization profiles were observed as a result of oil contamination. There was some evidence that bioremediated soils were returning to control values by the end of the experiment. This was supported by the bioassay results which showed an initial increase in toxicity as a result of the oil addition which had then decreased by the conclusion of the experiment. The two oils exhibited markedly different toxicity towards the bioassay organisms, with species-specific differences in response. This oil-specific difference was also found in the PLFA profiles which showed the two oil types selected different microbial communities. 3ahydrocarbons 3apetroleum 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3aoil spills 3abioremediation 3abiodegradation 3abiosensors 3asoil bacteria 3acommunity structure 3aphospholipids 3afatty acids 3abioassays 3asoil toxicity 3asoil respiration1 aPaton, G.I.1 aCampbell, C.D.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 July, v. 36, no. 7 p.1149-1159x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02577naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001100161245011000172300001800282520129700300650001701597650000901614650001001623650001101633650002001644650001901664650001901683650003101702650002401733650002101757650002501778650001801803650001701821650002701838650002101865650002601886650001601912700001301928773008801941852000902029930003302038945002502071946001102096655001202107IND4365503120221116150310.0041110e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436550312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The initial delta13C value of the experimental soil was - 25.8 per thousand, which was 6 per thousand less depleted in 13C than the plants grown under elevated CO2. Significant changes in delta13C of the soil organic C were detected after one growing season. The amount of new soil C input was estimated to be 0.9 t ha(-1) (or 2.1%) at 30 kg N ha(-1) and 1.8 t ha(-1) (4.1%) at 90 kg N ha(-1). Changes in soil delta13C suggested that the surface 5 cm of soil received more C input from plants than soils below. Laboratory incubation (25 degrees C) of soils from different horizons indicated that increased availability of the labile plant-derived C in the soil reduced decomposition of the native soil organic C. Provided the retardant effect of the new C on old soil organic C holds in the field in the longer-term, paddy soils will likely sequester more C from the atmosphere if more plant C enters the soil under elevated atmospheric CO2. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aroots 3acarbon 3arhizodeposition 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3asoil organic matter 3aisotope labeling 3acarbon sequestration 3aplant tissues 3aplant growth 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3anitrogen content 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3apaddy soils1 aYagi, K.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 36, no. 12 p.1967-1973x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050806b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/01/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03298naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245015700195300001800352520162800370650001901998650001902017650000902036650000902045650001202054650001702066650002402083650002002107650001602127650001902143650002402162650001702186650002202203650001102225650002102236650002002257650002002277650004702297650001202344650002302356650001902379651001302398653003702411700001602448700001802464700001702482700001602499700001502515773008802530852000902618930003302627945002502660946001102685655001202696IND4365502820221116150240.0041110e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436550282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSuhadolc, M.10aEffects of modified Pb-, Zn-, and Cd- availability on the microbial communities and on the degradation of isoproturon in a heavy metal contaminated soil  ap. 1943-1954.  aThe effects of modified heavy metal (HM) availability on the microbial community structure and on the microbe-mediated degradation of herbicide isoproturon (IPU) were evaluated in soil with a long-term HM contamination. The fate of 14C-ring labelled IPU was investigated for over 60 days under controlled microcosm conditions. Phosphate mineral apatite and a water solution of Pb, Zn, and Cd salts were previously homogeneously mixed into the soil material to reduce and to increase the proportion of bioavailable HM. respectively. The availability of Pb, Zn, and Cd was determined by HM fractionation and plant uptake 110 days after the addition of amendments, shortly before IPU addition. Apatite treatment reduced the availability of HM, but did not affect the microbial biomass and the microbial community structure on the genotype level (total soil DNA-RAPD). However, it changed the microbial community structure on the phenotype level, based on the composition of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) at the end of the degradation experiment. The degradation of IPU did not change. In contrast to apatite treatment, HM supplementation increased the bioavailability of Pb. Zn and Cd. which resulted in biomass reduction and changes of microbial community structure on the genotypic (total soil DNA-RAPD) and phenotypic (PLFA) level. Increased bioavailability of HM also significantly reduced the rate of IPU degradation and mineralisation. The total mineralisation over a period of 60 days decreased from 12 to 5% of initial 14C. Increased HM bioavailability did not influence the degradation pathways and kinetics of IPU. 3apolluted soils 3asoil pollution 3alead 3azinc 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3asoil microorganisms 3abioavailability 3aisoproturon 3abiodegradation 3acommunity structure 3abiodiversity 3agenetic variation 3acarbon 3aisotope labeling 3agrassland soils 3asoil amendments 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aapatite 3aDNA fingerprinting 3amineralization 3aSlovenia 0aphospholipid fatty acid analysis1 aSchroll, R.1 aGattinger, A.1 aSchloter, M.1 aMunch, J.C.1 aLestan, D.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 36, no. 12 p.1943-1954x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050806b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/01/03  aNon-US 7aarticle04046naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245014400176300001800320500001500338520233400353650003602687650001002723650001002733650002502743650001402768650002602782650002102808650002202829650002202851650001202873650001902885650001502904650001102919650001802930650004402948650001902992650002603011650002503037650002203062650002703084650001903111650001303130650002203143651001403165653002603179653001103205700001803216700001603234700001603250773008803266852000903354930003303363945002503396946001103421655001203432IND4365504220221116150250.0041110e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436550422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this study, 15 typical and/or native Australian plant materials were finely ground and incubated with a sandy soil at 25 degrees C and 55% water holding capacity without nitrogen (- N) or with nitrogen (+ N) addition (77 mg N kg(-1) soil as KNO3). The C mineralisation dynamics were monitored for 356 days and the initial biochemical characteristics of the plant materials were determined by NMR and wet-chemical analyses. Under the - N treatment, C mineralisation rates of the plant materials were positively correlated with their initial N contents during the first several weeks, and then negatively correlated with lignin and polyphenols contents during the late stages of incubation. Thus the ratios of lignin/N, polyphenols/N and (lignin + polyphenols)/N had more consistent correlation with the cumulative amounts of C mineralised throughout the incubation than did any single component. In terms of the C types determined by NMR analysis, the C mineralisation rates were initially related positively to carbonyl C contents, and then negatively to aryl and O-aryl C contents from day 3 onwards. Addition of NO3(-)-N accelerated C mineralisation during the early stages, but resulted in lower cumulative C mineralisation at the end of the incubation for most plant materials. Under the + N treatment, the decomposition rates were correlated with the contents of lignin and the sum of cellulose + acid detergent-extractable non-phenolic compounds, or with aryl, O-aryl and N-alkyl + methoxyl C contents. Regardless of the N treatment, the ratios of aryl/carbonyl, O-aryl/carbonyl and (aryl + O-aryl)/carbonyl C had the closest and most consistent correlations with the cumulative C mineralisation among all biochemical indices examined. A double exponential model with defined mineralisation rate constants for the active and slow pools was used to describe the C mineralisation dynamics. The biological meanings of the kinetically estimated active and slow pool sizes are interpreted and their relationships to the initial chemical/biochemical composition of the plant materials are explored. 3achemical constituents of plants 3awheat 3atrees 3acarbon sequestration 3asugarcane 3aSaccharum officinarum 3anitrogen content 3asoil biochemistry 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrasses 3amineralization 3aEucalyptus 3alignin 3aAcacia aneura 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asoil nutrients 3anutrient availability 3aStylosanthes humilis 3achemical analysis 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3abiodegradation 3akinetics 3aCenchrus ciliaris 3aAustralia 0aEucalyptus microcarpa 0aAcacia1 aBaldock, J.A.1 aDalal, R.C.1 aMoody, P.W.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 36, no. 12 p.2045-2058x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050806b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/01/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03361naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245009600195300001800291500001500309520198800324650002902312650002402341650001802365650002702383650001702410650001302427650001602440650001702456650002402473650001702497650002202514650002002536650002302556650002102579650002002600651001102620653002302631653002002654700001502674773008802689852000902777930003302786945002502819946001102844655001202855IND4365504420221116150218.0041110e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436550442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A significant amount of hydrolytic enzyme activity comes from extracellular (abiontic) activity that is bound and protected by soil colloids. This study was conducted to determine how management affects the kinetics of this enzyme (K(m). substrate affinity, and V(max), maximum reaction velocity) and its degree of stabilization on soil colloids. Soils were sampled from three sites in Oregon, with a paired comparison within each site of a native, unmanaged soil, and a matching soil under agricultural production (> 50 years). Microwave radiation (MW) stress was used to denature the beta-glucosidase fraction associated with viable microorganisms in these soils as an estimate of abiontic activity. Total activity and V(max) were decreased by both management and MW. The results showed that beta-glucosidase activity is sensitive to soil management on a variety of soils and environments (135 vs. 190, 80 vs. 111 and 80 vs. 134 microgram PNP g(-1) h(-1) for managed and unmanaged treatments, respectively, at the three study sites in Oregon). The evidence suggests that this sensitivity to management is not (or minimally) due to differences in isoenzymes (K(m) generally was unaffected) but rather due to an overall reduction in the amount of enzyme present (V(max) decreased) and that this reduction in activity is reflected more from the activity of enzymes in the stabilized fraction than that associated with viable microbial population. Although beta-glucosidase activity after MW irradiation appears to be limited as a soil quality indicator, it maybe useful as research tool to separate abiontic from microbial activity 'biomass' beta-glucosidase activity correlated with microbial biomass C (r = 0.42, P < 0.05) but MW irradiated, abiontic, activity did not (r = -0.20NS). 3asoil chemical properties 3amicrowave radiation 3asoil colloids 3afertilizer application 3asoil quality 3akinetics 3aheat stress 3asoil enzymes 3asoil microorganisms 3aforest soils 3aenzyme substrates 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial activity 3abeta-glucosidase 3agrassland soils 3aOregon 0asubstrate affinity 0asoil management1 aDick, R.P.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 36, no. 12 p.2089-2096x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050806b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/01/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03126naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100002000138245011000158300001800268500002400286520153000310650001501840650002001855650002201875650002501897650001701922650001201939650004301951650004601994650000902040650001102049650001502060650001102075650001402086650007202100650003402172650001502206650004102221650005602262650007102318651001302389700001802402773012002420852000902540930003302549945002502582946001302607655001202620IND4372519020221116150350.0050720e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437251902DNAL7 a160271832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aTikofsky, L.

Occasionally, STREP: canis is detected in milk from dairy cows. An outbreak of STREP: canis mastitis in a dairy herd is described. Based on results from bacterial culture and ribotyping, a cat with chronic sinusitis was the most likely source of the outbreak. Subsequent cow-to-cow transmission of STREP: canis was facilitated by poor udder health management, including use of a common udder cloth and failure to use postmilking teat disinfection. Infected cows had macroscopically normal udders and milk, but significantly higher somatic cell counts than STREP: canis-negative herd mates. The outbreak was controlled through antibiotic treatment of lactating cows, early dry-off with dry cow therapy, culling of infected animals, and implementation of standard mastitis prevention measures. Cure was significantly more likely in dry-treated cows (87.5%) and cows treated during lactation (67%) than in untreated cows (9%). Whereas mastitis due to group G streptococci or STREP: canis in dairy cows is usually limited to sporadic cases of environmental (canine or feline) origin, this case study shows that crossing of the host species barrier by STREP: canis may result in an outbreak of mastitis if management conditions are conducive to contagious transmission. In such a situation, measures that are successful in control of STREP: agalactiae can also be used to control STREP: canis mastitis. 3adairy cows 3abovine mastitis 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease transmission 3acase studies 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCat Diseasesxmicrobiologyxtransmission. 2aCats 2aCattle 2aCell Count 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMastitis, Bovinexmicrobiologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aMilkxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aRibotyping 2aSinusitisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aStreptococcusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 3aNew York1 aZadoks, R.

Seasonal fluctuations in the concentrations of extractable dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) compounds and extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial C and N, ergosterol, net and gross N mineralisation rates were investigated during two growing seasons along a natural peat N gradient in a drained peatland. Significant seasonal fluctuations in NH4(+) and DOC concentrations, microbial C and N, but not in ergosterol or microbial C-to-N ratios in the peat, were observed during the 1999 and 2000 growing seasons. The peat total N concentration affected extractable DON and DOC, but not DIN concentrations in the peat. A negative correlation was found between total N concentration in peat and microbial N and C, and a positive correlation between total N and ergosterol, in peat with N concentrations of up to 2%. Gross mineralisation rates did not show any correlation, whereas net mineralisation rates showed a significant positive correlation with the total N concentration of the peat in both 1999 and 2000. 3apeatlands 3aforest soils 3adrained conditions 3aseasonal variation 3amicrobial activity 3adissolved organic carbon 3anitrogen content 3adry matter content 3anitrogen 3amineralization 3aergosterol 3aFinland1 aSarjala, T.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2004 July, v. 36, no. 7 p.1047-1055x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/12/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02679naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178100002500187245006800212300001800280500002400298500001500322520127200337650001801609650001201627650001901639650001401658650001501672650001901687650002101706650001601727653002001743653001801763700001701781700002001798773018201818852000902000856008102009856004802090930003302138945002502171946001302196655001202209IND4372478920221116150513.0050720e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437247892DNAL7 a216461372pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.92.7.11522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF700 0aM001 0aF4001 aFeist, M.q(Monique)10aNew insights into Paleozoic charophyte morphology and phylogeny  ap. 1152-1160.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aExamination of Paleozoic charophyte fructifications using microscopy and high-resolution x-ray synchrotron microtomography has revealed that most of them have a utricle that forms a supplementary calcified cover around the gyrogonite. All Paleozoic families with utricles have been assigned to the Sycidiales. We consider the Moellerinaceae to occupy a central position in the phylogeny of the Charophyta. From these, one group of descendants constitutes the gyrogonites inside the utricles of the Sycidiales; a second descendant goup is thought to be the utricle-free ancestors of the Charales prior to inversion of spiralization and reduction in cell number. The Sycidiales have a multilayered wall and an internal vesicle, but their families are distinguished by diversity in orientation of external cells, complexity of the utricle wall, and in presence or absence of antheridia. The solidly packed structure of the utricle is believed to be an organ protecting the zygote against dessication. We interpret the morphological similarities between Paleozoic Sycidiales and Mesozoic Clavatoraceae, both with a utricle, as homoplasous rather than expressing a true phylogenetic relationship. We confirm that some umbellids might correspond to utricles of charophytes. 3aplant tissues 3afossils 3aplant taxonomy 3aphylogeny 3aCharophyta 3aultrastructure 3aplant morphology 3apaleobotany 0afructifications 0aplant anatomy1 aLiu, Junying1 aTafforeau, Paul0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2005 July, v. 92, no. 7 p.1152-1160dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.92.7.11523Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20051214b20060102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/25  aOther US 7aarticle03700naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100002100220245009300241300001600334500002400350500001500374520215800389650001502547650002202562650001602584650001602600650001702616650002402633650002202657650001402679650002302693650001902716650001702735651002202752653001502774653002202789700001602811700001502827773011502842852000902957856009202966856005503058939003303113945002503146946001103171655001203182IND4372296920221116150532.0050714e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437229692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01429.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We surveyed the insect fauna of Eucalyptus globulus (Myrtaceae) plantations and native Eucalyptus marginata dominated remnant woodland in south-western Australia, comparing edge to interior habitats, and plantations surrounded by a pastoral matrix to plantations adjacent to native remnants. We also surveyed insects in open pasture. Analyses focused on three major insect orders: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Plantations were found to support many forest-using insect species, but the fauna had an overall composition that was distinct from the remnant forest. The pasture fauna had more in common with plantations than forest remnants. Insect communities of plantations were different from native forest both because fewer insect species were present, and because they had a few more abundant insect species. Some of the dominant species in plantations were known forestry pests. One pest species (Gonipterus scutellatus) was also very abundant in remnant forest, although it was only recently first recorded in Western Australia. It may be that plantation forestry provided an ecological bridge that facilitated invasion of the native forest by this nonendemic pest species. Plantation communities had more leaf-feeding moths and beetles than remnant forests. Plantations also had fewer ants, bees, evanioid wasps and predatory canopy beetles than remnants, but predatory beetles were more common in the understory of plantations than remnants. Use of broad spectrum insecticides in plantations might limit the ability of these natural enemies to regulate herbivore populations. There were only weak indications of differences in composition of the fauna at habitat edges and no consistent differences between the fauna of plantations adjacent to remnant vegetation and those surrounded by agriculture, suggesting that there is little scope for managing biodiversity outcomes by choosing different edge to interior ratios or by locating plantations near or far from remnants. 3aColeoptera 3adeciduous forests 3aLepidoptera 3aHymenoptera 3ainsect pests 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aspecies diversity 3awoodlands 3aforest plantations 3ainsect ecology 3aforest pests 3aWestern Australia 0aEucalyptus 0acommunity ecology1 aFloyd, R.B.1 aWeir, T.A.0 tAustral ecology.g2005 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.103-117dBlackwell Science AsiawJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01429.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01429.x  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02955naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154100001800163245009500181300001600276500002400292520161700316650002401933650001801957650001901975650001101994650002602005650002702031650002002058650002102078650001802099650001802117700002502135773012002160852000902280856009402289856009302383930003302476945002502509946001102534655001202545IND4372352120221116150445.0050715e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437235212DNAL7 a10.1023/B:FRES.0000019042.19020.a32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ5001 aAgbenin, J.O.10aDynamics of copper fractions and solubility in a savanna soil under continuous cultivation  ap. 117-125.  aIncludes references  aAn understanding of the influence of soil management practices on the distribution, form and solubility of trace metals in soils is required to formulate appropriate guidelines for the applications of organic manures and inorganic fertilizers for sustainable soil fertility and environmental protection. The distribution, forms and solubility of Cu were investigated in a savanna soil under long-term cultivation and varying management practices which included fertilization with NPK, farmyard manure (FYM), NPK+FYM and a control which received neither NPK nor FYM for 50 years. Total Cu varied between 5 and 13 mg kg(-1). Long-term application of FYM and FYM+NPK significantly increased DTPA extractable Cu in the surface horizon, and in the subsurface horizon in FYM fertilized fields. Averaged across the sampling depths, cultivation and management history did not affect the concentration of DTPA extractable Cu, water-soluble Cu, organically complexed Cu and residual Cu. But fertilization with FYM and FYM+NPK significantly increased organically complexed Cu in the surface layer as compared to NPK fertilization. Solubility equilibria studies indicated that Cu(2+) activities in soil solution approached an apparent equilibrium with cupric ferrite (CuFe2O4), suggesting that the control on Cu(2+) solubility was either a CuFe2O4 or a Cu solid with solubility similar to cupric ferrite. The soil management practices involving combined application of inorganic fertilizers and farmyard manure did not seem to pose any risk of inducing Cu deficiency, but sole application of inorganic NPK poses such a risk. 3acontinuous cropping 3asavanna soils 3asoil fertility 3acopper 3anutrient availability 3afertilizer application 3aNPK fertilizers 3amanure spreading 3asoil solution 3afractionation1 aFelix-Henningsen, P.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2004 Feb., v. 68, no. 2 p.117-125dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:FRES.0000019042.19020.a33Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-1314/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02905naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100002500181245010200206300001600308500002400324500001500348520135200363650001901715650002301734650001601757650002101773650001301794650002101807650001501828650001901843650001101862650002501873651001401898653001501912653002701927700001901954700002401973700001701997773012002014852000902134856009402143856009302237930003302330945002502363946001102388655001202399IND4372352020221116150449.0050715e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437235202DNAL7 a10.1023/B:FRES.0000019040.02605.ee2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF500 0aF1201 aGutierrez-Boem, F.H.10aLate season nitrogen fertilization of soybeans: effects on leaf senescence, yield and environment  ap. 109-115.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNitrogen demand from soybean seeds during seed filling is very high and has been proposed as the cause of nitrogen remobilization and leaf senescence. Previous research has not shown consistent effects of late season fertilization on seed yield, while its effects on leaf senescence have not been evaluated. Two field experiments were performed to determine the effects of a late season N fertilization on leaf senescence and fall, seed yield and its components, and residual soil nitrate, and to evaluate the potential risk of groundwater contamination. Two rates of nitrogen (50 and 100 kg N ha(-1)) were applied at the R3 and R5 development stages. Nitrogen fertilization, either at R3 or R5, increased soil nitrate availability during the seed-filling period. Seed yield, seed number and protein content were not affected by N fertilization. The addition of 100 kg N ha(-1) produced a small delay of 1-2 days in the leaf fall, and slightly increased seed size (3.6%). Our results suggest that increasing soil N availability during the seed-filling period is not an effective way to delay leaf senescence or to increase seed growth and yield of soybean. Nitrogen fertilization increased the level of residual nitrate in the top soil at one site (the one with lowest seed yield), increasing the risk of nitrate leaching during subsequent fallow. 3afilling period 3aapplication timing 3aGlycine max 3afertilizer rates 3asoybeans 3anitrate nitrogen 3acrop yield 3asoil fertility 3aleaves 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aArgentina 0asenescence 0afertilizer application1 aScheiner, J.D.1 aRimski-Korsakov, H.1 aLavado, R.S.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2004 Feb., v. 68, no. 2 p.109-115dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:FRES.0000019040.02605.ee3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-1314/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02705naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001600203245013800219300001300357500002400370520131400394650001701708650001701725650003001742650001301772650001201785650002001797650001901817650002201836650001201858651001501870700001801885700001901903773011201922852000902034856009202043856005502135939003302190945002502223946001102248655001202259IND4372296220221116150517.0050714e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437229622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01408.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Diversity and distribution of lotic midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) in the Australian Wet Tropics  ap. 1-13.  aIncludes references  aWe examined broad scale patterns of diversity and distribution of lotic Chironomidae (Diptera) within the Wet Tropics bioregion of northern Queensland, Australia. Field surveys across broad latitudinal and altitudinal gradients within the Wet Tropics revealed a fauna of 87 species-level taxa in 49 genera comprising three main elements: a small genuinely tropical fraction, and larger cosmopolitan and Gondwanan components. The latter group originated when Australia, as part of the ancient Gondwana supercontinent, was situated over Antarctic latitudes with a cooler, wetter climate than today. In the Wet Tropics, cool Gondwanan taxa occurred predominantly in upland and shaded lowland sites, but no species appeared narrowly temperature restricted, and there was no faunal zonation with altitude. Most chironomid species occurred at all latitudes within the Wet Tropics, with no evidence for an enduring effect of the historical rainforest contractions on current-day distribution patterns. These findings contrast with those for aquatic faunas elsewhere in the world and for the terrestrial Wet Tropics fauna. We relate this to the generally broad environmental tolerances of Australian chironomids, and comment on why the latitudinal diversity gradient does not apply to the Australian chironomid fauna. 3aChironomidae 3azoogeography 3ageographical distribution 3aaltitude 3astreams 3aaquatic insects 3ainsect ecology 3aspecies diversity 3atropics 3aQueensland1 aPearson, R.G.1 aCranston, P.S.0 tAustral ecology.g2005 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.1-13dBlackwell Science AsiawJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01408.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01408.x  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03300naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001600119245010800135300001600243500002400259500001500283520169500298650001601993650001502009650002302024650001102047650001802058650001802076650001402094650001902108650001902127650002402146650001102170650001102181650003002192650002302222650001102245650001302256650001202269650001902281650001602300651002202316653002002338653001702358700001702375700001702392700001702409700002002426773010802446852000902554856008802563930003302651945002502684946001302709655001202722IND4372239120221116150523.0050713e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437223912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aDavis, G.B.10aMeasurement and modeling of temporal variations in hydrocarbon vapor behavior in a layered soil profile  ap. 417-426.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFine-scale measurement of gasoline vapors, major gases (O2, CO2, N2, and CH4), residual nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) gasoline, and soil physical properties has allowed detailed assessment of the role of soil layering and seasonal variability on hydrocarbon vapor fate and biodegradation. In this study we conducted coring and static depth profile monitoring at the end of summer and end of winter for a layered sandy vadose zone in Perth, Western Australia. Transient on-line monitoring of vapors and O2 was also performed with in situ multilevel volatile organic compound (VOC) and O2 probes. For high soil moisture contents at the end of winter, vapors were shown to accumulate beneath a compacted, cemented layer approximately 0.3 m below the ground surface, and O2 penetrated only to depths of 0.4 m below ground. At the end of summer, when soil moisture was lower, O2 penetrated to depths of up to 1.5 m, and hydrocarbon vapors remained at or below this depth. Regardless of seasonal changes, sharp separations were seen between the depth of O2 penetration from the ground surface and the depth of penetration of the vapors upward from the hydrocarbon-contaminated zone. Modeling of steady-state O2 profiles indicated that a number of simple O2 consumption models might apply, including point-sink, distributed zero-order, or distributed first-order models, each leading to different biodegradation rates. Combining independent data with modeling helped determine the most appropriate model, and hence estimates of O2 consumption and hydrocarbon biodegradation. Also, reliable estimates of the biodegradation rate could only be calculated after consideration of the layered features. 3asandy soils 3asoil depth 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3agas emissions 3alayered soils 3apetroleum 3acarbon dioxide 3asoil pollution 3asoil microorganisms 3aoxygen 3awinter 3agroundwater contamination 3asoil water content 3avapors 3anitrogen 3amethane 3abiodegradation 3avadose zone 3aWestern Australia 0agasoline vapors 0ahydrocarbons1 aRayner, J.L.1 aTrefry, M.G.1 aFisher, S.J.1 aPatterson, B.M.0 tVadose zone journal.g2005 May, v. 4, no. 2 p.417-426dSoil Science Society of Americax1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/4/2/2253Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/14  aOther US 7aarticle03478naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001500128245010700143300001600250500002400266500001500290520210900305650003202414650001302446650001502459650002202474650001702496650002102513650002602534650001702560650001602577650001802593653002202611653003102633653001702664700001402681700002002695700001402715700001402729773009602743852000902839856007902848930003302927945002502960946001102985655001202996IND4372428920221116150431.0050719e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437242892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aX2001 aBoon, N.E.12aA tractor-mounted, automated soil penetrometer-shearometer unit for mapping soil mechanical properties  ap. 381-396.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA tractor-mounted, automated soil penetrometer-shearometer unit was designed and developed for the purpose of simultaneous in situ measurements of soil penetration resistance and shear stress. The automated soil penetrometer-shearometer unit utilises both commercial penetrometer and shearometer. The overall construction of the unit was made up of the main frame to support the moving carriage sub-assemblies, two moving carriage sub-assemblies to support penetrometer and shearometer, the gear driving mechanisms to support the traverse movements of the moving carriages, and the three-point hitch attachment to support the main frame and provide attachment to the tractor. The motion controls for the penetrometer-shearometer unit were performed by the programmable logic controller (PLC) unit and other external electronics and sensing devices. Two high-torque stepper motors were used to drive the penetrometer and shearometer moving carriages in the vertical axis direction while another one low-torque stepper motor was used to drive the rotating spindle of the shearometer. A personal computer data acquisition and differential global positioning system (DGPS) on-board tractor were used to assist in real-time measuring, displaying, and recording the tractor position, soil penetration resistance, and soil shear stress during the field sampling operation. Field test of the automated soil penetrometer-shearometer unit was conducted together with data collection on soil moisture content, terrain slope, and tractor-implement performance parameters. Spatial maps produced from the collected data showed considerable site-specific variation in the measured parameters over the field. Statistical analysis showed significant correlation between soil penetration resistance and shear stress and significant correlation between soil moisture content with penetration resistance and shear stress. Multiple regression equations were formulated using the stepwise analysis method to predict travel speed, implement draught and fuel consumption for mouldboard ploughing on Serdang sandy clay loam soil. 3asoil penetration resistance 3atractors 3aautomation 3acomputer analysis 3asoil surveys 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3ashear stress 3ameasurement 3apenetrometers 0ameasuring devices 0asoil mechanical properties 0ashearometers1 aYahya, A.1 aKheiralla, A.F.1 aWee, B.S.1 aGew, S.K.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2005 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.381-396dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103electronic resource  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03825naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001900189245015200208300001600360500002400376520177500400650001102175650001902186650001802205650001502223650001602238650001202254650001302266650002002279650002202299650001402321650001202335650002302347650002402370650006502394650001102459650004102470650001102511650002702522650005302549650000902602650001502611650002202626650004702648650002802695653002902723700001502752700002002767700002002787700001702807773009202824852000902916856009202925856008903017930003303106945002503139946001103164655001203175IND4372375420221116150512.0050718e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437237542DNAL7 a159103702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00367.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aRohrbach, B.W.10aEffect of vaccination against leptospirosis on the frequency, days to recurrence and progression of disease in horses with equine recurrent uveitis  ap. 171-179.  aIncludes references  aObjective To evaluate the effect of vaccination against leptospirosis on frequency and days to recurrence of uveitis and progression of disease in horses with equine recurrent uveitis (ERU). Animals Forty-one horses with ERU. Procedure Horses were randomly assigned to experimental (vaccinated) or control groups. Vaccine containing six serovars of Leptospira or placebo was administered, an ophthalmic examination performed and blood samples drawn on days 0, 28, 180 and 365. Antibody titers were measured against each serovar. Recurrence of uveitis was verified by ophthalmic examination. Results of the initial and final ophthalmic examinations were compared and progression of disease defined as an increase in extent of synechiae, or development of new or progression of an existing cataract. Results Vaccination increased the average geometric mean serum antibody titer from 225 on day 0, to 4077 and 593 on days 28 and 180, respectively. After the second vaccination, days to first recurrence was significantly longer (median 126 days; range 24-231 days) when compared with controls (median 86 days; range 14-192 days, P = 0.04). Recurrence of ERU was observed among 7/20 (35%) vaccinated horses and 12/21 (57%) controls; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.061, OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06, 1.07). More horses in the experimental group 13/20 (65%) experienced progression of disease when compared with controls 12/21(57%); however, this difference was statistically nonsignificant (P = 0.35). Conclusions Vaccine significantly increased days to recurrence, but failed to slow the progression of disease. These data do not support the use of vaccination against leptospirosis as adjunct therapy for the routine treatment of horses with ERU. 3ahorses 3ahorse diseases 3aleptospirosis 3aLeptospira 3avaccination 3arelapse 3acataract 3aimmune response 3amedical treatment 3aserotypes 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Vaccines 2aDisease Progression 2aEye Infections, Bacterialxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxprevention & control 2aHorses 2aLeptospiraximmunology 2aLeptospirosisxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aMale 2aRecurrence 2aTreatment Outcome 2aUveitisxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aVaccinationxveterinary 0aequine recurrent uveitis1 aWard, D.A.1 aHendrix, D.V.H.1 aCawrse-Foss, M.1 aMoyers, T.D.0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2005 , v. 8, no. 3 p.171-179dBlackwell Pubx1463-52167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00367.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.blackwell-science.com/products/journals/jnltitle.htm3electronic resource  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03361naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001800146245020000164300001600364500002400380520199400404650001702398650002002415650002202435650002302457650001602480650001502496650001502511650001602526650001702542650002202559653001502581653002302596700001702619700001402636773009602650852000902746856007902755930003302834945002502867946001102892655001202903IND4372429520221116150409.0050719e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437242952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aN200 0aJ300 0aX1001 aMouazen, A.M.13aAn automatic depth control system for online measurement of spatial variation in soil compaction. 4. Improvement of compaction maps by using a proportional integrative derivative depth controller  ap. 409-418.  aIncludes references  aThe spatial variation in soil compaction is inaccurately measured online (on-the-go, tractor-based continuous measurement) if the measured depth d is not controlled at minimum variations. A depth control system is needed for controlling the depth of the subsoiler used as a tool for online measurement of soil compaction indicated as dry bulk density rho(d). A proportional integrative derivative (PID) controller with a filter on the derivative-action that provided the best results in a previous part of this study was implemented. For continuous interpolation of online measured dry bulk density and sensor depth, kriging was performed with Variogram Estimation and Spatial Prediction with ERror (VESPER 1.6) software to develop maps with irregular grid of 0.3 m by 10 m. The VESPER 1.6 software was also used to generate the field maps of dry bulk density with 10 m by 10 m grid. To verify the online measured dry bulk density maps, the 10 m by 10 m online measured dry bulk density maps were compared with maps measured by the conventional core sampler method. Results showed that compaction maps developed with 10 m by 10 m grid were totally different from corresponding maps developed for continuous data of 0.3 m by 10 m grid. The PID controller considerably reduced the variation range in depth of the sensor. In comparison with the conventionally measured soil dry bulk density map, the spatial variation of online measured dry bulk density was improved when the PID controller was implicated. In addition, the PID controller with low soil moisture content variation led to a strong similarity between draught and soil dry bulk density. The automatic depth control system also assisted tracing the tramlines on compaction maps developed by elimination of possible variation in measured soil dry bulk density that could result from variable depth. The PID controller eliminated a partial similarity between compaction and depth maps that occurred without the depth control system. 3asoil surveys 3asoil compaction 3aspatial variation 3atillage implements 3acontrollers 3aautomation 3asoil depth 3ameasurement 3abulk density 3acomputer software 0asubsoilers 0aonline measurement1 aAnthonis, J.1 aRamon, H.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2005 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.409-418dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103electronic resource  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/03  aNon-US 7aarticle05216naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100001600198245009700214300001600311500002400327500001500351520307900366650002603445650002103471650004103492650000903533650002903542650002103571650002103592650001803613650002703631650001103658650001703669650001703686650002803703650001603731650002203747650001203769650002503781650003403806650000903840650004103849650005003890650005603940650002803996650002404024650002204048653001304070653002404083653001304107653001704120700001504137700001504152773009204167852000904259856009204268856008904360930003304449945002504482946001104507655001204518IND4372375220221116150506.0050718e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437237522DNAL7 a159103692pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00362.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL830 0aL832 0aL8331 aGrahn, B.H.10aQualitative tear film and conjunctival goblet cell assessment of cats with corneal sequestra  ap. 167-170.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjectives To evaluate the tear film qualitatively and conjunctival goblet cell numbers in cats with and without corneal sequestra. Animals studied and procedures This was a prospective evaluation of 11 cats with corneal sequestra and 14 control eyes that were either the contralateral normal eye when the sequestrum was unilateral or from control cats of similar age with no ocular disease. All cats in this study were examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist. The ophthalmic examinations included a neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, Schirmer tear tests, fluorescein staining, tear film break-up times, applanation tonometry, biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy. The palpebral conjunctiva at the dorsal nasal, ventral nasal, dorsal temporal and ventral temporal fornices were biopsied after topical anesthetic was applied to the cornea and conjunctiva. The conjunctival biopsies were fixed in formalin and sectioned routinely and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and periodic acid-Schiff. These slides were examined by light microscopy by a blinded examiner. Goblet cell numbers were compared to conjunctival basal epithelial cell numbers by region. The goblet cell numbers by region from the eyes with sequestra was statistically compared to those from eyes without sequestra, with a student's paired t-test. Conjunctival swabs were collected from the cats with corneal sequestra and submitted for polymerase chain reaction for Herpes felis, Chlamydia psiitticia, and Mycoplasma felis. The corneal sequestra were removed by surgical keratectomy and fixed and stained routinely, and examined by light microscopy. Results No neurologic abnormalities were detected in any of the cats. The Schirmer tear tests (eyes with sequestra 14 +/- 5.1 mm/min; normal eyes 15 +/- 6.8 mm/min) and intraocular pressures (eyes with sequestra 21 +/- 6.6; normal eyes 22 +/- 5.8) were within normal reference ranges for cats. Biomicroscopic examinations revealed varied sizes and depths of brown- and amber-colored corneal sequestra. No abnormalities were noted on indirect ophthalmoscopic examinations. The tear film break-up time was 21 s (+/- 12) for the normal eyes (n = 14) and 14 s (+/- 13) in eyes with corneal sequestra (n = 11). The average goblet/epithelial cell ratios by region for the normal eyes and the eyes with sequestra respectively were 0.66, 0.56 for the dorsal nasal fornix, 0.68, 0.57 for the ventral nasal fornix, 0.63, 0.48 for the temporal dorsal fornix, and 0.55, 0.49 for the temporal ventral fornix. There were no significant differences in tear film break-up times and goblet cell numbers in eyes with corneal sequestra and those without sequestra. Three conjunctival swabs from two of 11 cats with sequestra were positive with PCR for Herpes felis virus. These included one cat with bilateral sequestra and one cat with unilateral corneal sequestrum. Conclusions The pathogenesis of feline corneal sequestra does not appear to be linked primarily to abnormal goblet cell numbers, qualitative tear film abnormalities, and accelerated tear film break-up time. 3adiagnostic techniques 3acorneal diseases 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3acats 3aFelid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aMycoplasma felis 3aepithelial cells 3amycoplasmosis 3aChlamydophila psittaci 3acornea 3apathogenesis 3acat diseases 3anervous system diseases 3aconjunctiva 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCat Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aCats 2aConjunctivaxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aCorneal Opacityxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aDiagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmologicalxveterinary 2aGoblet Cellsxpathology 2aProspective Studies 2aTearsxsecretion. 0aetiology 0aFelid herpesvirus 1 0asymptoms 0agoblet cells1 aSisler, S.1 aStorey, E.0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2005 , v. 8, no. 3 p.167-170dBlackwell Pubx1463-52167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2005.00362.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.blackwell-science.com/products/journals/jnltitle.htm3electronic resource  a20060929b20061003c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03123naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002100161245015500182300001600337500001500353520167000368650001702038650002302055650001302078650002202091650001602113650001202129650002102141650001802162650001402180650002002194650000902214650001402223650002802237650001502265650002702280650001802307651001002325653001602335653002602351700002302377700002202400700002202422773006902444852000902513930003302522945002502555946001302580655001202593IND4436087920221116150407.0100427e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443608792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Walp.] is an important component of most traditional cropping systems in the semiarid tropics. It provides both leaf vegetable and/or grain. Dual-purpose production of cowpea is most common in subsistence farming systems. Little is, however, known about the effects of cowpea leaf harvesting on tissue nitrogen composition and productivity of most cowpea-based cropping systems. A four-season study was carried out at the National Dry Land Research Center, Katumani, Kenya, to establish the effects of cowpea leaf harvesting initiation time and frequency on 1) tissue nitrogen content of cowpea and maize in a dual-purpose cowpea–maize intercropping systems; and 2) cowpea and maize yield and the overall productivity of a cowpea–maize intercrop measured by land equivalent ratio (LER). Cowpea leaf harvesting was initiated at 2, 3, or 4 weeks after emergence (WAE) and continued at 7- or 14-day intervals until onset of flowering. Cowpea tissue nitrogen content was highest in the control treatment and lowest in cowpea subjected to leaf harvesting from 2 WAE or at 7-day intervals, whereas maize tissue nitrogen content showed the reverse trend. Harvesting cowpea leaves from 3 WAE or at 7-day intervals gave the highest leaf vegetable yield, whereas grain yields were highest when no leaf harvesting was done. Maize yields were significantly improved by harvesting of leaves of the companion cowpea. Harvesting cowpea leaves for use as leaf vegetable increased productivity per unit area of land as measured by LER with the highest productivity achieved when leaf harvesting was initiated at 4 WAE or done at a 14-day interval. 3aharvest date 3atemporal variation 3aZea mays 3aVigna unguiculata 3agrain crops 3acowpeas 3anitrogen content 3aprofitability 3aflowering 3avegetable crops 3acorn 3afrequency 3adry matter accumulation 3acrop yield 3agreen leafy vegetables 3aintercropping 3aKenya 0afield crops 0aland equivalent ratio1 aItulya, Francis M.1 aAguyoh, Joseph N.1 aNgouajio, Mathieu0 tHortScience.g2010 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.369-375x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/18  aOther US 7aarticle03209naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100001300172245016400185300001800349520122700367650002401594650001601618650001401634650001901648650002201667650001601689650002501705650001601730650001301746650002001759650000801779650002101787650002101808650001901829650001101848650003601859650003301895650002101928650004201949650004201991650002302033650002102056650001602077650001302093650003202106650001102138650002902149650003502178650003302213650001902246653002302265653001502288700001302303773008302316852000902399856009402408930003302502945001302535946001102548655001202559IND2056967620221116150312.0970508e199612  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205696762DNAL7 a90329672pmid7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0290662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, N.10aDisruption analysis of the gene for a cold-regulated RNA-binding protein, rbpA1, in Anabaena: cold-induced initiation of the heterocyst differentiation pathway  ap. 1150-1160.  aA cold-regulated operon, rbpA1-rpsU, encodes an RNA-binding protein and a ribosomal protein in Anabaena variabilis M3. The level of expression of this gene cluster was about ten times higher at temperatures below 30 degrees C than at 38 degrees C. To study the role of the RbpA1 protein in vivo, we constructed insertional disruptants of rbpA1. These strains were totally devoid of RbpA1 protein but contained a normal level of the ribosomal protein S21, a product of the rpsU gene. The disruptants were morphologically normal at 38 degrees C, but at 22 degrees C they produced unusual cells at a low frequency. These cells were probably at an initial stage of proheterocyst formation. Various molecular events that are related to heterocyst initiation, namely, excision of the 11-kbp DNA element in nifD and the accumulation of transcripts of xisA and hetR, also occurred in the disruptants at 22 degrees C in the presence of nitrate ions, but these events did not occur in the presence of ammonium ions or at 38 degrees C. The results suggest that RbpA1 is required for enhanced repression of heterocyst initiation at low temperatures in the presence of nitrate. Possible mechanisms of the action of RbpA1 are discussed. 3aAnabaena variabilis 3aacclimation 3aribosomes 3aplant proteins 3aprotein synthesis 3acell growth 3acell differentiation 3atemperature 3anitrates 3agene expression 3aRNA 3abinding proteins 3aplant morphology 3acold tolerance 3aoperon 2aAnabaenaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCold Temperature 2aDNA Nucleotidyltransferasesxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Rearrangement 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMutagenesis 2aNitrogen 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aOperon 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aRibosomal Proteinsxgenetics 2aViral Proteins 0agenetic regulation 0arbpa1-rpsu1 aWada, A.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1996 Dec., v. 37, no. 8 p.1150-1160x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a0290663Available from publisher's Web site  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03148naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245009200168300001800260520182000278650001302098650002702111650001702138650002402155650000902179650001102188650001002199650001402209650001002223650002302233650001502256650001202271650001002283651001602293653002002309653001402329700001902343700001902362700001502381700001902396773011802415852000902533856009202542930003302634946001102667655001202678IND4424213220221116150248.0090807e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442421322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02228.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKELLY, D.W.10aHas the introduction of brown trout altered disease patterns in native New Zealand fish  ap. 1805-1818.  a1. It is well recognised that non-indigenous species (NIS) can affect native communities via the 'spillover' of introduced parasites. However, two other potentially important processes, the 'spillback' of native parasites from a competent NIS host, where the latter acts as a reservoir leading to amplified infection in native hosts, and the 'dilution' of parasitism by a NIS host acting as a sink for native parasites, have either not been tested or largely overlooked. 2. We surveyed the helminth parasite fauna of native New Zealand fish in Otago streams that varied in the abundance of introduced brown trout Salmo trutta, to look for evidence of spillback and/or dilution. Spillover is not an issue in this system, with trout introduced as parasite-free eggs. 3. Seven native parasite species were present across 12 sites; significant inverse relationships with an index of trout abundance (i.e. dilution) were documented for three species infecting the native upland bully Gobiomorphus breviceps, and one species infecting the native roundhead galaxias Galaxias anomalus. 4. An inverse relationship between bully energy status and infection intensity of one parasite species suggests that parasite dilution could have positive effects on bully populations. Our failure to detect similar relationships for the other parasites does not preclude the possibility that dilution is beneficial to native fish, since parasites may have subtle or unmeasured impacts. 5. The parasite dilution patterns reported are compelling in that they occurred across several native host and parasite species; as such they have important implications for invasion ecology, providing an interesting contrast to the largely negative impacts reported for NIS. Mechanisms potentially responsible for the patterns observed are discussed. 3aGalaxias 3aGobiomorphus breviceps 3aSalmo trutta 3aecological invasion 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afauna 3ahelminths 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3aparasitism 3astreams 3atrout 3aNew Zealand 0adilution effect 0aspillback1 aPATERSON, R.A.1 aTOWNSEND, C.R.1 aPOULIN, R.1 aTOMPKINS, D.M.0 tFreshwater biology.g2009 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.1805-1818dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02228.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b20091002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01835naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001100141245010600152300001800258500002400276520063300300650003400933650001500967650001500982650001500997650001701012650001701029650001201046650001201058650002601070650000901096650001601105650001901121650001701140700001101157700001301168700001401181700001401195773011401209852000901323856008101332655001201413IND4367901520221116150337.0050324s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436790152DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200305942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, G.10aBioavailability of humic substance-bound mercury to lettuce and its relationship with soil properties  ap. 1123-1139.  aIncludes references  aThe bioavailability of humic substance-bound mercury (HS-Hg) in relation to soil properties was investigated using lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. Angustana irish). Results showed fulvic acid-bound Hg (FA-Hg) was an important source of Hg for lettuce. The availability of added Hg to the lettuce depends on the supply power of added Hg and the absorption capacity of the lettuce. Acidic soil, light soil texture, and the amount of humic substances and available nutrients enhance Hg availability. This suggests that humic substance-bound Hg poses greater risk to human health through food chain in sandy, acidic, and fertile soils. 3aLactuca sativa var. angustana 3aabsorption 3aacid soils 3afood chain 3afulvic acids 3ahuman health 3alettuce 3amercury 3anutrient availability 3arisk 3asandy soils 3asoil fertility 3asoil texture1 aWu, H.1 aQing, C.1 aJiang, X.1 aZhang, J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 7-8 p.1123-1139dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200305943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04587naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245010700159300001800266500002400284500001500308520286600323650001403189650001503203650001803218650001403236650001503250650001203265650002303277650002103300650002203321650000903343650001103352650002003363650002803383650001503411650001503426650001703441650001303458650001003471650002603481650001403507650001503521650001803536650002503554650001503579650001303594650002103607650001403628650001203642650001103654650001003665651002403675653002503699700001603724773013103740852000903871856008103880655001203961IND4367901620221116150212.0050324s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436790162DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200305952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeibert, E.J.10aField pea growth and nutrient uptake: response to tillage systems and nitrogen fertilizer applications  ap. 1141-1165.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA two-year [1999, 2001] study of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) in rotation with small grain was conducted on a Fargo clay soil [fine, smetitic, frigid, Typic Epiaquert] to determine the influence of tillage system [fall PLOW, fall CHISEL PLOW, fall DISK, and NOTILL] and spring applied nitrogen fertilizer rates [0, 45, 90, and 135 kg ha(-1)] on dry matter production at three growth stages, and nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium [NPK] concentration and uptake. Plants were sampled at first flower [code 203] after 870 GDD and maximum dry matter production [code 208] after 1364 GDD. Seed was harvested for yield [code 303] after 1692 GDD. Dry matter production at flower stage 203 averaged 2400 kg ha(-1) the first year and 1960 kg ha(-1) the second year with the PLOW system producing the lowest dry matter in both years. Applications of nitrogen fertilizer at the high rate increased dry matter from 500 to 700 kg ha(-1). Dry matter at stage 208 in 2001 ranged from 4260 kg ha(-1) without fertilizer nitrogen applied, to 6360 kg ha(-1) with 135 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen fertilizer applied. In contrast to the earlier stage, the PLOW system produced the greatest total dry matter production at stage 208. Minimum pea seed yield, stage 303, averaged 2740 and 2410 kg ha(-1) without any nitrogen fertilizer applied in 1999 and 2001. Maximum seed yields at harvest [3530 kg ha(-1) in 1999 and 3140 kg ha(-1) in 2001] were obtained only when 135 kg ha(-1) nitrogen fertilizer was applied. Average seed yields were not always significantly different between tillage systems, but the CHISEL PLOW and DISK were consistently higher than PLOW or NOTILL at all nitrogen fertilizer rates. This research provided estimates of the amount of NPK nutrients required to maximize field pea production under various tillage systems and nitrogen fertilizer rates at various growth stages. When averaged across years, nitrogen fertilizer rates, and tillage systems, concentrations of N, P, and K were measured at 3.0, 0.30, and 2.6% at stage 203, with 2.4, 0.23, and 1.5% at stage 208 and finally the seed [stage 303] at 3.4, 0.38 and 1.2%. The pea plant required 0.031 kg N, 0.0032 kg P, and 0.027 kg K for each kilogram of plant dry matter produced by flowering stage 203. By stage 208 when the pea plant has reached maximum dry matter production, the nutrient requirement was 0.023 kg N, 0.0025 kg P, and 0.0162 kg K to produce 1 kg of plant material. By harvest, stage 303, the nutrients removed by the seed were 0.034 kg N, 0.0041 kg P, and 0.0115 kg K for each kilogram of seed produced. This study indicated that adequate nitrogen (derived from the soil, through N fixation or applied as fertilizer) was equally if not more important than tillage system and this management practice must be included in the overall plan for maxim field pea production in the Northern Great Plains. 3aflowering 3ano-tillage 3aPisum sativum 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3adiscing 3adry matter content 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3apeas 3afields 3anutrient uptake 3adry matter accumulation 3aEpiaquerts 3aharvesting 3aplant growth 3asampling 3aseeds 3anutrient requirements 3apotassium 3aseed yield 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aclay soils 3anitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3achiseling 3aflowers 3aspring 3aplows 3aGreat Plains region 0adevelopmental stages1 aUtter, R.A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 7-8 p.1141-1165dDekkerwJournal:jnl1842x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200305953Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04289naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245021500158300001800373500002400391520245300415650001502868650000802883650001502891650001502906650001402921650002102935650002102956650001602977650001402993650001903007650002703026650002603053650001303079650001303092650001403105650002403119650001703143650002503160650001203185650001603197650001103213650002003224650002003244650002003264650001803284650001703302650001903319650002403338650001103362650002503373650001603398650001803414651000903432700001703441773011503458852000903573856008103582655001203663IND4367902820221116150326.0050324s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436790282DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200375422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSameni, A.M.10aEffect of agricultural sulfur on characteristics of different calcareous soils from dry regions of Iran. II. Reclaiming effects on structure and hydraulic conductivity of the soils under saline-sodic conditions  ap. 1235-1246.  aIncludes references  aThe use of elemental sulfur (S) is of special interest in Iran since most soils are calcareous and elemental S, as a byproduct of the petroleum industries is readily available. Recently, the National Petrochemical Company (NPC) of Iran has produced an agricultural sulfur (A.S.) that contains 90% pure S and 10% bentonite, but its effects on structure and hydraulic conductivity of salt-affected calcareous soils has not been studied yet. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of A.S. on structure and hydraulic conductivity (HC) of soils under saline-sodic conditions. To six samples of surface (10-15 cm) calcareous soils of a dry region of southern Iran, equivalent rates of 0, 2, 4, and 6 t ha(-1) of A.S. were added, and the samples were incubated under room temperature and moisture content of field capacity. At the end of incubation time, the soils were air dried, ground, and passed through a 2-mm sieve. Columns of soil samples were saturated with solutions of 100 meq (NaCl + CaCl2) L(-1) with sodium adsorption ratios (SARs) of 5, 10, 15, and 20, and subsequently leached with distilled water. The "Sensitivity Index" or SI concept was used to obtain a very general index of the magnitude of structural deterioration and reduction in the HC of the tested soils. In general, (1) regardless of SAR level and A.S. rate, the SI values, the percentages of expansion and dispersion of the soil columns leached with different saline-sodic solutions, were different for tested soils. Increases in SAR level resulted in decreases in the SI values and initial height of soil columns; but although, increase in the SAR level from 5 to 10 resulted in decreases in the percentage of dispersion, there was no significant difference between the effect of SAR 10 and SARs 15 and 20. (2) Application of A.S. resulted in no significant (statistical) effect on the SI values of the tested soils, but was associated with (somehow) a modifying effect on the degrees of expansion and dispersion of the soil columns, which indicated the improving effect of A.S. application on the structure of tested soils under saline-sodic conditions. The multiple regression equation between SI values and swelling/dispersion processes, as well as the mineralogy of tested soils, all suggested that, the slaking of the structure (due to both swelling and dispersion processes) was responsible for reduction in the SI values (i.e., HC) of the tested soils. 3aadsorption 3aair 3aair drying 3aarid zones 3abentonite 3acalcareous soils 3acalcium chloride 3adispersions 3aequations 3afield capacity 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aindustrial byproducts 3aindustry 3aleaching 3apetroleum 3aregression analysis 3asaline soils 3asaturated conditions 3asieving 3asodic soils 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoil amendments 3asoil mineralogy 3asoil sampling 3asoil slaking 3asoil structure 3asoil surface layers 3asulfur 3aswelling (materials) 3atemperature 3awater content 3aIran1 aKasraian, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 9-10 p.1235-1246dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200375423Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03401naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245011800149300001600267500002400283520123900307650000801546650002501554650001101579650000901590650001601599650001701615650001101632650001601643650001701659650001401676650003901690650005201729650003201781650002901813650001301842650001301855650003701868650001201905650005501917650002101972650004101993650004102034650000902075650001102084650003702095650002202132650000902154650004302163650004302206650001602249650005302265650006402318650003502382650002602417650004502443650001302488650002502501700001602526700001702542700001802559700001902577773009802596852000902694655001202703IND4364504020221116150249.0040916s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436450402DNAL7 a151969032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoukopoulos, P.10aCharacterisation of three novel canine osteosarcoma cell lines producing high levels of matrix metalloproteinases  ap. 131-141.  aIncludes references  aThree canine osteosarcoma cell lines were established from spontaneous pelvic and radial osteosarcomas. The cell populations cultured exhibited characteristics of malignancy and consisted of adherent, pleomorphic, mostly large spindle-shaped or polyhedral cells, characterised by the presence of numerous cytoplasmic granules and vacuoles. The main ultrastructural features included the presence of abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and numerous cytoplasmic vesicles, deposit vacuoles and small cytoplasmic protrusions. Zymography showed that the cell lines produce high levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, enzymes directly involved in crucial aspects of the metastatic process. Consistent with their osteoblastic lineage and malignant phenotype, all cell lines were immunoreactive to vimentin, osteopontin, PCNA, p53, MMP-2 and MMP-9, while they were negative for cytokeratin, desmin, SMA, Factor VIII, NSE, GFAP, Rb and p21 protein. No retroviral particles or RNA were detected ultrastructurally or with RT-PCR, although the possibility of viral involvement in osteosarcoma cannot be excluded. The new cell lines provide excellent in vitro models that may allow further studies on the pathobiology of canine osteosarcoma to be undertaken. 3aRNA 3acytoplasmic granules 3adesmin 3adogs 3afactor VIII 3agelatinase A 3amodels 3aosteopontin 3aosteosarcoma 3aphenotype 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arough endoplasmic reticulum 3asodium monochloroacetate 3avacuoles 3avimentin 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBone Neoplasmsxenzymologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCytoplasmic Granulesxultrastructure 2aDog Diseasesxenzymologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aImmunophenotyping 2aMale 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 2xmetabolism 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 9xmetabolism 2aOsteopontin 2aOsteosarcomaxenzymologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSialoglycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 2aTumor Suppressor Protein p53xmetabolism 2aVacuoles 2aVimentinxmetabolism1 aO'Brien, T.1 aGhoddusi, M.1 aMungall, B.A.1 aRobinson, W.F.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2004 Oct., v. 77, no. 2 p.131-141dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245012900149300001600278500002400294520132700318650003301645650002501678650001701703650002701720650002201747650001401769650001401783650002401797650001201821650002401833650001201857650003001869650001101899650002601910650007001936650002702006650002202033650002802055650003702083650001402120650006402134650001002198650004002208700001502248700001602263700001302279700002102292700001602313700002302329700002402352773009802376852000902474655001202483IND4364504220221116150318.0040916s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436450422DNAL7 a151969052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohapatra, J.K.10aSequence variability in the structural protein-encoding region of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype Asia1 field isolates  ap. 153-161.  aIncludes references  aA total of 30 field isolates of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype Asia1 belonging to two different lineages and five isolates belonging to a divergent group as delineated earlier in 1D (encodingVP1 protein) gene-based phylogeny were sequenced in the structural protein (P1) coding region. Phylogenetic comparison of these isolates along with some of the published exotic sequences revealed the presence of five different lineages around the world. Similar grouping pattern was observed for the P1 region and 1D gene-based phylogeny, where the Indian isolates were clustered in two genetic lineages. The recently identified divergent group of virus falls into a separate sub-cluster. Similar grouping was also observed in L gene-based phylogeny. Comparison of amino acid sequences identified lineage-specific signature residues in all the structural proteins. Comparison of Asia1 field isolates at the identified key residues of other FMD viruses involved in the formation of the heparan sulfate-binding ligand confirmed many of them to be conserved and the presence of VP3(56) Arg suggested their cell culture adaptation. Although a considerable genetic variation was observed among the isolates of present study, all of them tested in micro-neutralization test were serologically related to the vaccine strain. 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aamino acid sequences 3acell culture 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeny 3aserotypes 3astructural proteins 3aviruses 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aCattle 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aFoot-and-Mouth Disease Virusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGenes, Viralxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeutralization Testsxveterinary 2aPhylogeny 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSwine 2aViral Structural Proteinsxgenetics1 aSanyal, A.1 aHemadri, D.1 aTosh, C.1 aSabarinath, G.P.1 aKumar, R.M.1 aVenkataramanan, R.1 aBandyopadhyay, S.K.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2004 Oct., v. 77, no. 2 p.153-161dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245010400144300001600248500002400264500001500288520107400303650001701377650001401394650005201408650001201460650003401472650000901506650002801515650005001543650003501593650001201628650001801640650005201658650001101710650007201721650001101793650002201804650001401826650003701840650006401877651002101941651001001962653003201972700001502004700001402019700001602033700001402049700001402063700001502077773009802092852000902190655001202199IND4364342620221116150336.0040909s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436434262DNAL7 a146728602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, J.S.10aComparative analysis on the 5'-untranslated region of bovine viral diarrhea virus isolated in Korea  ap. 157-163.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSamples of 249 bovine abortuses, one intestine, and four diarrheal stools from 254 cows were collected, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, virus isolation was preformed with PCR-positive samples, and then PCR product of 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of BVDV isolate was sequenced and analyzed. Among the samples collected, 20 (from 17 bovine abortuses, one intestine, and two diarrheal stools) were positive for BVDV RT-PCR; four BVDVs (from two bovine abortuses, one intestine, and one diarrheal stool) were isolated. When the four isolates were biotyped in cell culture, one BVDV isolate from a bovine abortus was cytopathic and the others were non-cytopathic. In addition, three isolates were genotyped as BVDV-1 and one isolate from a diarrheal stool as BVDV-2. In phylogenetic analysis, it suggested that the BVDV-2 isolate in Korea is closer to the North American strains than Asian strains. This is the first report on the identification and isolation of BVDV-2 in Korea. 3acell culture 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3acows 3a5' untranslated regions 2a5' Untranslated Regionsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAbortion, Veterinaryxvirology 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Diseasexvirology 2aCattle 2aDiarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viralxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxchemistryxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 3aKorean Peninsula 0aKorea 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aMoon, H.J.1 aLee, B.C.1 aHwang, W.S.1 aYoo, H.S.1 aKim, D.Y.1 aPark, B.K.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2004 Apr., v. 76, no. 2 p.157-163dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245010000143300001600243500002400259500001500283520063800298650002400936650001400960650002000974650001800994650001501012650001401027650001201041650001501053650001101068650003601079650001201115650003301127650001101160650003301171650001101204650002501215650005301240650004501293650000901338650003601347651001301383653001201396700001601408700001901424700001601443700001601459700001301475773009801488852000901586655001201595IND4364325420221116150229.0040908s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436432542DNAL7 a150469532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, T.10aMicrobiological and serological study of leptospirosis in horses at slaughter: first isolations  ap. 199-202.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA bacteriological survey of kidneys from 145 abattoir horses was performed, which resulted in the isolation of two Leptospira strains.

The goal of this work was to determine the trace element content [aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), lead (Pb), strontium (Sr), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn)] of a bulk senna sample that was procured for use as a study material in one such investigation. In addition, seven commercially available senna-based dietary supplements were purchased and analyzed along with the study material. Samples were digested using high-purity acids and oxidants and were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Differences between the trace element content of the analyzed products were observed. Lead was detected in three of the tested samples (ranging from 0.686 to 1.12 microgram g(-1)), and arsenic was detected in seven samples (ranging from 0.063 to 0.280 microgram g(-1)). Recovery data for fortified control samples and standard reference materials (NIST 1573a Tomato Leaves, NIST 1547 Peach Leaves) indicated accurate and precise method performance. 3aSenna (Fabaceae) 3aaccuracy 3aacids 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3abarium 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acopper 3adietary minerals 3adietary supplements 3airon 3alead 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aoxidants 3apeaches 3aprecision 3areference standards 3asodium 3aspectroscopy 3astrontium 3atomatoes 3avanadium 3azinc1 aRoss, G.T.1 aFernando, R.A.1 aBlake, J.C.1 aSparacino, C.M.1 aPellizzari, E.D.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 5-6 p.835-851dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200303613Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02396naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245008300157300001600240500002400256520103300280650002501313650002301338650001001361650001601371650001401387650002201401650001501423650001901438650001501457650002101472650001301493650002001506650001301526650001301539650001101552650002301563650000901586650001601595650000901611650001801620650001101638700001901649700001501668773012901683852000901812856008101821655001201902IND4367897420221116150429.0050324s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436789742DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200303522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsh, K.L.10aUse of diffusion for enzymatic determination of urea-nitrogen in soil extracts  ap. 691-702.  aIncludes references  aUrea-N in soil extracts is normally determined by colorimetric procedures using diacetyl monoxime, due in part to the use of a urease (urea amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.5) inhibitor to prevent urea hydrolysis during extraction. Alternatively, this determination can be done enzymatically if no inhibitor was employed in the preparation of extracts, in which case N-isotope analyses can be performed on urea as well as extractable NH4, NO3, and NO2. An accelerated diffusion method for determining exchangeable NH4 was employed to recover (urea + NH4)-N by heating 10-100 mL of soil extract at 45-50 degrees C for 1.75-8.5 h with jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) urease and MgO (50 mg of each). Studies using labeled urea showed greater than or equal to 98% recovery of 15N as urea, with virtually no recovery as NH4, even when filtration was delayed up to 1 h after shaking 2 M KCl soil suspensions. The procedure described provides a convenient alternative to colorimetry for research concerning transformations of urea-N in soils. 3aCanavalia ensiformis 3aammonium compounds 3abeans 3acolorimetry 3adiffusion 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afiltration 3aheat treatment 3ahydrolysis 3aisotope labeling 3aisotopes 3amagnesium oxide 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aoximes 3apotassium chloride 3asoil 3atemperature 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen 3aurease1 aMulvaney, R.L.1 aKhan, S.A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 5-6 p.691-702dDekkerwJournal:jnl1842x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200303523Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03333naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001100141245008000152300001600232500002400248520188600272650001502158650001702173650001502190650002102205650000902226650002002235650000902255650001302264650001202277650001602289650002002305650002302325650001902348650003102367650002602398650001702424650001902441650001902460650003002479650002202509650001502531650001802546650002702564651001002591700001202601773011202613852000902725856008102734655001202815IND4367897620221116150531.0050324s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436789762DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200303532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, S.10aEffect of fly ash on physical properties of Ultisols from subtropical China  ap. 703-717.  aIncludes references  aFly ash from coal-fired power generating plant was mixed with two acid clay loams (Typic Plinthudult and Typic Hapludults) from subtropical China at the rates of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50% by weight. The physical properties of fly ash-amended soils, including soil particle size distribution, microaggregate composition, water retention curve and modulus of rupture, were determined to evaluate the effect of fly ash application on soil physical properties. Results indicated that the application of fly ash affected the measured physical properties of soils. At application rate of 50% fly ash, there is significant increase in the percentage of 0.15-0.01 mm particles and decrease in clay content (<0.002 mm). Application of fly ash at high rates (30 and 50%) to the Soil 1 (Typic Plinthudult) caused a significant change in microaggregate size distribution of soil, while nonsignificant differences were observed in the rates of 5, 10, and 20% of fly ash. But no apparent effect of fly ash application on soil microaggregate size distribution was noted for the Soil 2 (Typic Hapludult) with high organic matter and free iron oxide contents. Fly ash application not only increased the water content at tensions of 0-0.1 MPa but also increased plant available water held at tensions of 0-1.2 MPa. Tests on fly ash-amended soils exceeding 10% showed that it significantly reduced the values of modulus of rupture in the soils. The presence of spherical cenosphere in fly ash, which have larger specific surface and characteristic hollow structure, resulted in increased water-holding capacity and reduction of modulus of rupture in fly ash-amended soils. All these results suggest that fly ash is useful in improving certain physical properties of Ultisols by changing soil structure, increasing the amount of plant available water and decreasing the cohesiveness of soil particles. 3aHapludults 3aPlinthudults 3aacid soils 3aapplication rate 3aclay 3aclay loam soils 3acoal 3acohesion 3afly ash 3airon oxides 3amicroaggregates 3amodulus of rupture 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size distribution 3aplant available water 3apower plants 3asoil structure 3asoil treatment 3asoil water characteristic 3asubtropical soils 3asubtropics 3awater content 3awater holding capacity 3aChina1 aZhu, L.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 5-6 p.703-717dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200303533Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02728naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245014000156300001600296500002400312520142600336650002001762650001901782650002101801650001401822650002901836650002801865650001401893650001201907650001501919650001901934650002001953650002001973650001301993650001402006650002102020650002802041700001802069773012902087852000902216856008102225655001202306IND4367897220221116150515.0050324s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436789722DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200303512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFongen, M.10aDetermination of fluoride in natural forest vegetation by fluoride selective electrode after rapid diffusion using hexamethyldisiloxane  ap. 679-690.  aIncludes references  aA home designed diffusion chamber was used during the isolation of fluoride from plant material. The chamber contained two beakers, one for the sample (milled plant material) and the other for the trapping solution (0.1 M NaOH). Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) in 3.5 M perchloric acid was added into the sample beaker through a septum, after the chamber was closed. Fluoride in the sample reacts with HMDS and forms the volatile trimethylfluorosilane (TMFS), which is trapped and hydrolyzed to fluoride. The diffusion time was 2 h and 20 samples were handled at the same time. The fluoride concentration was determined by a flow injection analysis (FIA) system using an ion selective electrode (about 50 samples/hour). The results by acid extraction were compared to the results obtained after an ashing/alkaline fusion. Both a certified sample of timothy grass (NIST 2695, high level) and more typical vegetation from forest were analyzed. For the timothy grass, the recovery increased from 48 to 84% when ashing/alkali fusion was used before the diffusion. However, higher recovery was not obtained by using ashing/alkaline fusion for the determination of fluoride in natural vegetation from forest. Acid extraction in combination with addition of HMDS was sufficient as pretreatment in these types of plant materials. The method was routinely used for the determination of fluoride both in research and forest monitoring. 3aPhleum pratense 3aacid treatment 3aalkali treatment 3adiffusion 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aflow injection analysis 3afluorides 3aforests 3ahydrolysis 3amineralization 3aperchloric acid 3aplants (botany) 3asampling 3asiloxanes 3asodium hydroxide 3aspecific ion electrodes1 aWickstrom, T.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 5-6 p.679-690dDekkerwJournal:jnl1842x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200303513Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02100naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006800126300001600194500002400210520105600234650000901290650001101299650001401310650002601324650002401350650001101374650002401385650001001409650001301419650001501432650001601447700001601463700001601479773013901495852000901634856009501643655001201738IND4367851120221116150506.0050322s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436785112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarayel, D.10aMathematical modelling of vacuum pressure on a precision seeder  ap. 437-444.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this research was to determine the optimum vacuum pressure of a precision vacuum seeder and to develop mathematical models by using some physical properties of seeds such as one thousand kernel mass, projected area, sphericity and kernel density. Maize, cotton, soya bean, watermelon, melon, cucumber, sugarbeet and onion seeds were used in laboratory tests. One thousand kernel mass, projected area, sphericity and kernel density of seeds varied from 4.3 to 372.5 g, 5-77mm2, 38.4-85.8% and 440-1310 kg m(-3), respectively. The optimum vacuum pressure was determined as 4.0 kPa for maize I and II; 3.0 kPa for cotton, soya bean and watermelon I; 2.5 kPa for watermelon II, melon and cucumber; 2.0 kPa for sugarbeet; and 1.5 kPa for onion seeds. The vacuum pressure was predicted by mathematical models. According to the results, the final model could satisfactorily describe the vacuum pressure of the precision vacuum seeder with a chi-square of 2.51 x 10(-3), root mean square error of 2.74 x 10(-2) and modelling efficiency of 0.99. 3acorn 3acotton 3acucumbers 3alaboratory techniques 3amathematical models 3aonions 3aphysical properties 3aseeds 3asoybeans 3asugar beet 3awatermelons1 aBarut, Z.B.1 aOzmerzi, A.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2004 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.437-444dPublished for Silsoe Research Institute by Academic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02298naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245009200176300001600268500002400284520126700308650000901575650001701584650001301601650002001614650002201634650001701656650001301673650001801686650001701704650001201721700001901733773013001752852000901882856005701891655001201948IND4451802320221116150227.0110401e199602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445180232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1996.tb00784.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasconcelos, H.L.14aThe effect of wilting on the selection of leaves by the leaf-cutting ant Atta laevigata  ap. 215-220.  aIncludes references  aUsing field assays of leaf preference, we tested the hypothesis that wilting affects the selection of leaves by the leaf-cutting ant Atta laevigata (Fr. Smith). Detached leaves were left to air-dry until noticeably wilted. The area removed by the ants from wilted leaves was significantly greater than the area removed from fresh leaves, this effect being observed in several plant species, in leaves of different age, and in assays with different ant colonies. Leaves collected from water-stressed plants were also preferred to leaves from non-stressed plants. A. laevigata was found to employ a two-stage, size-related, strategy when cutting plants. Larger workers climbed the plant stem and dropped whole leaves to the ground by severing their petioles; smaller workers cut the lamina of the dropped leaves. The ants frequently left dropped leaves on the ground, until the next foraging day or even later, when they were harvested in a wilted condition in preference to newly-dropped leaves. It is possible that during wilting some repellent substances evaporate or become less effective, thus enhancing leaf palatability. Alternatively or in addition, changes in nutrient and water content may have rendered wilted leaves more palatable to leaf-cutting ants. 3aAtta 3aant colonies 3aforaging 3ainsect behavior 3aleaf-cutting ants 3apalatability 3apetioles 3awater content 3awater stress 3awilting1 aCherrett, J.M.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1996 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.215-220dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw26091x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1996.tb00784.x 7aarticle02895naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245006300142300001600205500002400221520122100245650001101466650002001477650000901497650001501506650000901521650002001530650001001550650001101560650001401571650002201585650001201607650003201619650006501651650000901716650004401725650002401769650001101793650005301804650000901857650003501866650003801901650002201939650008501961650005202046700001502098700002002113700001302133700001802146700001402164700001802178700001402196773009802210852000902308655001202317IND4364304120221116150040.0040908s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436430412DNAL7 a131296702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavy, E.10aSpirocerca lupi in dogs: prophylactic effect of doramectin  ap. 217-222.  aIncludes references  aSpirocerca lupi is primarily a parasite of dogs, which typically causes oesophageal nodules, aortic aneurysms, and spondylitis. This study investigated the efficacy of doramectin as a prophylactic agent for canine spirocercosis. Five beagle dogs were injected subcutaneously with doramectin (400 μg/kg on 3 occasions 30 days apart q30d), while 5 other beagle dogs served as untreated controls. All dogs were inoculated with 40 infectious S. lupi larvae (L3) one month after the last doramectin treatment. All control dogs and 4/5 treated dogs became infected. Two control dogs died of ruptured aortic aneurysms, while no deaths occurred in treated dogs. Oesophageal nodules appeared 40-103 day later in treated as compared to control dogs, and eggs appeared in the faeces 49-106 day later in treated as compared to control dogs. The mean faecal egg count on day 223 in the treatment group was reduced by 99.77%. All control dogs had thoracic radiographic changes during the study, while only 2/5 study dogs showed radiographic changes. This study shows that although doramectin did not entirely prevent canine spirocercosis it reduced the clinical signs associated with infection and delayed and reduced egg output. 3aBeagle 3aSpirocerca lupi 3adogs 3adoramectin 3aeggs 3afecal egg count 3afeces 3alarvae 3aparasites 3aprotective effect 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacology 2aDog Diseasesxparasitologyxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aDogs 2aEndoscopy, Gastrointestinalxveterinary 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aIvermectinxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aRadiography, Thoracicxveterinary 2aRandom Allocation 2aSpirurida Infectionsxparasitologyxpathologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aThelazioideaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aHarrus, S.1 aMazaki-Tovi, M.1 aBark, H.1 aMarkovics, A.1 aHagag, A.1 aAizenberg, I.1 aAroch, I.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2003 Dec., v. 75, no. 3 p.217-222dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245018700145300001600332500002400348520161900372650001101991650001902002650001002021650001202031650000902043650002102052650002402073650001502097650001502112650001802127650001902145650001602164650001602180650002102196650001602217650001402233650001202247650004402259650007302303650004002376650002902416650003102445650003902476650000902515650002402524650001102548650003202559650000902591650003302600650002302633650003902656700001302695700001602708700001702724700001402741700001502755773009802770852000902868655001202877IND4364303620221116145758.0040908s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436430362DNAL7 a131296672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTidholm, A.10aEffect of thyroid hormone supplementation on survival of euthyroid dogs with congestive heart failure due to systolic myocardial dysfunction: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  ap. 195-201.  aIncludes references  aNineteen euthyroid dogs of 12 breeds with echocardiographic signs of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and radiographic and clinical signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study. The dogs received either thyroxine or placebo as an adjunct to digoxin, furosemide and propranolol. The group assignment of individual dogs and serum concentrations of thyroid hormones remained unknown to owners and investigators during the entire study period. Dogs were evaluated clinically and with electrocardiography (ECG), thoracic radiography, echocardiography and measurement of total thyroxine (tT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) before beginning of the trial, and then one week, 2 months, 6 months and yearly after initial examination, and, when applicable, at the time of euthanasia. End-point of the study was euthanasia (n=17) due to severe congestive heart failure or sudden death (n=2). Survival times ranged from 17 to 1030 days (median 187 days) in the placebo group, and from 18 to 1000 days (median 73 days) in the treatment group. There was no statistically significant difference in survival times between the treatment group and the placebo group (p=0.46). Post mortem and histopathologic examinations revealed the attenuated wavy fiber type of DCM in 11 dogs, and myocardial infarcts, arteriosclerosis and chronic valvular disease in one dog. In conclusion, there was a wide range in survival times of dogs treated with digoxin, furosemide and propranolol. Adding thyroid hormones to the treatment did not significantly influence survival. 3abreeds 3acardiomyopathy 3adeath 3adigoxin 3adogs 3aechocardiography 3aelectrocardiography 3aeuthanasia 3afurosemide 3aheart failure 3ahistopathology 3apropranolol 3aradiography 3athyroid hormones 3athyrotropin 3athyroxine 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Arrhythmia Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCardiomyopathy, Dilatedxbloodxdrug therapyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCardiotonic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aDigoxinxtherapeutic use 2aDiureticsxtherapeutic use 2aDog Diseasesxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aDogs 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aFurosemidextherapeutic use 2aMale 2aPropranololxtherapeutic use 2aThyrotropinxblood 2aThyroxinexbloodxtherapeutic use.1 aFalk, T.1 aGundler, S.1 aSvensson, H.1 aAblad, B.1 aSylven, C.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2003 Dec., v. 75, no. 3 p.195-201dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245005700144300001800201500010500219500002400324500001500348520114100363650003601504650001301540650001901553650001501572650002501587650002201612650002001634650003301654650002301687650004201710650003101752650002201783650002301805650004201828650003401870650004401904650002401948653001601972653001601988700001402004700001702018773009102035852000902126655001202135IND4364277120221116145850.0040907s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436427712DNAL7 a152764462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirano, H.10aTechnical aspects of functional proteomics in plants  ap. 1487-1498.  aIn the special issue: Proteomics (part 1) / edited by G.P.

This analysis is achieved by separation and identification of proteins, determination of their function and functional network, and construction of an appropriate database. Many improvements in separation and identification of proteins, such as two-dimensional electrophoresis, nano-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, have rapidly been achieved. Some new techniques which include top-down mass spectrometry and tandem affinity purification have emerged. These techniques have provided the possibility of high-throughput analysis of function and functional network of proteins in plants. However, to cope with the huge information emerging from proteome analyses, more sophisticated techniques and software are essential. The development and adaptation of such techniques will ease analyses of protein profiling, identification of post-translational modifications and protein-protein interaction, which are vital for elucidation of the protein functions. 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3achromatography 3aproteomics 3anucleotide sequences 3amass spectrometry 3aelectrophoresis 3aprotein-protein interactions 2aDatabases, Protein 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational. 2aProteomicsxmethods 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aIslam, N.1 aKawasaki, H.0 tPhytochemistry.g2004 June, v. 65, no. 11 p.1487-1498dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245013400156300001800290520119900308650004401507650001401551650002301565650002101588650001301609650004401622650001901666650002001685700002101705700002101726700001801747700002501765773014001790852000901930856007801939930003302017946001302050655001202063IND4435019520221116150057.0100402e20100501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443501952DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.239532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Kaizheng10aFacile one-pot synthesis and thermal cyclopolymerization of aryl bistrifluorovinyl ether monomers bearing reactive pendant groups  ap. 1887-1893.  aA diverse pool of aryl bistrifluorovinyl ether (BTFVE) compounds with reactive pendant groups were prepared in a facile, high yielding three step "one-pot" synthesis from commercial 4-bromo(trifluorovinyloxy)benzene. Monomers were confirmed from ATR-FTIR, ¹H, ¹³C, and ¹⁹F NMR, and HRMS analysis. Aryl BTFVE compounds were thermally polymerized to afford perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) aryl ether polymers with high number-average molecular weight (Mn) for homopolymers (17,050-27,090) and copolymers with 4,4′-bis(trifluorovinyloxy)biphenyl monomers (27,860-56,500). The PFCB aryl ether homo- and copolymers collectively possess high thermal stability (>299 °C in N₂) and are readily solution processable producing optically transparent films. The thermal polymerization was achieved and reactive moieties remained intact, aside from those functionalized with acrylates. In the case with acrylate functionalized polymers, orthogonal polymerization was achieved by first photopolymerizing the acrylates followed by thermal curing of the aryl trifluorovinyl ether endgroups. Preliminary results in this study produced the successful preparation of photodefinable PFCB aryl ether material. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacrylates 3acomposite polymers 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3astable isotopes1 aIacono, Scott T.1 aBudy, Stephen M.1 aJin, Jianyong1 aSmith, Dennis W.

PHPA homopolymers were obtained with high conversions and narrow molecular weight distributions over a wide range of target degrees of polymerization. Like its poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) isomer, PHPA homopolymer exhibits inverse temperature solubility in dilute aqueous solution, with cloud points increasing systematically on lowering the mean chain length. The nature of the end groups is shown to significantly affect the cloud point, whereas no effect of concentration was observed over the PHPA concentration range investigated. Various thermoresponsive PHPA-based diblock copolymers were prepared via one-pot syntheses in which the second block was either permanently hydrophilic or pH-responsive. Preliminary studies confirmed that poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(2-hydroxypropyl acrylate) (PEO₄₅-PHPA₄₈) and poly(2-hydroxypropyl acrylate)- poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHPA₄₉-PHEA₆₈)diblock copolymers formed well-defined PHPA-core micelles in 10 mM sodium nitrate solution at 40 °C and 70 °C with mean hydrodynamic diameters of 20 nm and 35 nm, respectively. In contrast, most other PHPA-based diblock copolymers investigated formed larger colloidal aggregates in 10 mM NaNO₃ solution at elevated temperatures. 3aaqueous solutions 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophilicity 3aisomers 3amicelles 3amolecular weight 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asodium nitrate 3asolubility 3atemperature1 aRosselgong, Julien1 aArmes, Steven P.1 aTirelli, Nicola0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 May 01, v. 48, no. 9 p.2032-2043dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.239733Available from publisher's Web site  a20100402b20100501c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02261naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245008200166300001600248520134300264650001801607650001001625650002201635650001301657650002101670650001401691650002201705773008501727852000901812856008201821930003301903946001101936655001201947IND4435012720221116150151.0100402e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443501272DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2009001802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRothschild, Lynn J.12aA powerful toolkit for synthetic biology: Over 3.8 billion years of evolution  ap. 304-313.  aThe combination of evolutionary with engineering principles will enhance synthetic biology. Conversely, synthetic biology has the potential to enrich evolutionary biology by explaining why some adaptive space is empty, on Earth or elsewhere. Synthetic biology, the design and construction of artificial biological systems, substitutes bio-engineering for evolution, which is seen as an obstacle. But because evolution has produced the complexity and diversity of life, it provides a proven toolkit of genetic materials and principles available to synthetic biology. Evolution operates on the population level, with the populations composed of unique individuals that are historical entities. The source of genetic novelty includes mutation, gene regulation, sex, symbiosis, and interspecies gene transfer. At a phenotypic level, variation derives from regulatory control, replication and diversification of components, compartmentalization, sexual selection and speciation, among others. Variation is limited by physical constraints such as diffusion, and chemical constraints such as reaction rates and membrane fluidity. While some of these tools of evolution are currently in use in synthetic biology, all ought to be examined for utility. A hybrid approach of synthetic biology coupled with fine-tuning through evolution is suggested. 3agene transfer 3agenes 3amembrane fluidity 3amutation 3asexual selection 3asymbiosis 3asynthetic biology0 tBioEssays.g2010 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.304-313dWiley-VCH Verlagx0265-92477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2009001803Available from publisher's Web site  a20100402b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01909naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245006200132300001800194300002500212520106000237650001601297650002201313650001601335650001601351651001801367653002701385653001801412773010201430852000901532939003301541945000801574946001301582655001201595991591844330742620221116150134.0810422e197912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE819165542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelichar, E.10aCapital gains versus current income in the farming sector  ap. 1085-1092.  ap. 1085-1092. Charts  aExtract: This paper examines the magnitude and causes of asset appreciation. It first notes that asset appreciation should be adjusted for general price inflation before it is compared with income. The comparable series, known as real capital gains, has been roughly equal to net farm income during this decade. Next, the primary origin of these significant real capital gains is traced to the fact that, contrary to the popular impression, the current return to farm assets has grown rapidly over the past twenty-five years, even when measured in constant dollars. It is then shown that, according to asset-pricing theory, a farm economy characterized by rapid growth in the real current return to assets will tend to experience large annual real capital gains and a low rate of current return to assets - which corresponds to actual experience in most years since the mid-1950s. This inescapable tendency has serious and paradoxical implications for the structure of agriculture and for farm policy, which are briefly sketched in the concluding remarks. 3afarm income 3aissues and policy 3afarm assets 3aland values 3aUnited States 0aagricultural structure 0aCapital gains0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1979 Dec., v. 61, no. 5 p.1085-1092x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810422c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle01954naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012600167300001500293500002400308500001500332520095300347650001301300650002101313650001101334650002601345650002401371650002501395651001201420653001401432700002201446773009101468852000901559856004801568655001201616IND4417079920221116150527.0090228e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441707992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-008-9069-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachmaier, Martin12aA conceptual framework for judging the precision agriculture hypothesis with regard to site-specific nitrogen application  ap. 95-110.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study we derive a test that aims to show that the economic optimum nitrogen applications in site-specific management zones are different. In addition, a confidence interval is derived for the difference between optima, and here we show that separate confidence intervals for either optimum are not as good as the former for judging the precision agriculture hypothesis. Both the test and the confidence interval for the difference are based on modeling the returns above N fertilizer cost by quadratic functions of the nitrogen rate. The data are from an N-rate trial at a heterogeneous field in Thalhausen, Germany. This trial could barely support the economic benefit of precision agriculture. A statistical proof that high- and low-yielding zones should be discriminated against just failed to meet the standard 5% level. We also discuss what design of nitrogen fertilizer levels should be used for the test and the confidence intervals. 3anitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3amodels 3aprecision agriculture 3aconfidence interval 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aGermany 0aeconomics1 aGandorfer, Markus0 tPrecision agriculture.g2009 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.95-110dSpringer USx1385-22567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-008-9069-x 7aarticle01673naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245002000140300001700160500001500177520083700192650002001029650001301049650000901062650001101071650001401082653001301096653002101109653001101130653001201141773009401153852001301247939003301260945000801293946001301301852000901314655001201323991591840660742620221116150853.0850222e198408  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850066922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCummings, Gilbert A.10aSeafood cookery  ap. 154, 156.  a2019-12-06  aThere are 2 types of seafood: the fin fish which have an internal skeleton, and shellfish which have a shell to contain their shape. Seafood is low in fat and high in protein, minerals, and vitamins; it is popular with nutrition-conscious consumers, is economical to buy, and is a profitable menu item. Baking and broiling are often used for high fat fish--salmon, tuna, and trout. These fish do not dry out as readily as the low fat fish. Sauteed fish is often coated with either a batter or seasoned bread crumbs. In deep fat frying, the batter is needed as a protective coating for retention of moisture. For poaching fish, milk, water, or a court bullion can be used, but the heat must be gentle so that the flesh will not be pulled apart by boiling. Steamed seafood permits the fish to be served nearer its natural state.

The laws are designed to eliminate employment-related decisions based on race, sex or national origin when these are irrelevant to job performance. A variety of costs for failure to abide by these laws is imposed. Compliance with recordkeeping activities is essential. They become the basis for complying with statutory regulations, preparation for fact-finding inquiries by agencies responsible for monitoring activities, and, if necessary, litigation procedures. A positive policy of fair and equal treatment of all employees and applicants for employment is management's most effective mechanism to assure compliance with the laws. The employer's intent to practice a policy of fair and equal treatment is the strongest argument against discrimination charges.

Most importantly the American guidelines were tested for clinical and cost effectiveness. The data presented show that the American Guidelines came closest to meeting the NHMRC criteria. These results suggest that the American Guidelines may best suit Australian requirements. 3abiomedical research 3acost effectiveness 3aguidelines 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition 3aNew Zealand 3aQueensland 0aclinical practice guideline 0adietetic practice1 aTapsell, Linda.0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2007 Mar., v. 64, no. 1 p.16-22dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1446-63687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2007.00078.x3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03524naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002400193245011200217300001600329520180600345650001402151650001502165650001402180650001202194650002002206650002802226650001102254650003302265650003302298650005202331650004902383650003002432650003602462650000902498650002402507650004102531650002502572650002402597650001202621650001402633653001302647653001202660700001502672700001602687773013402703852000902837856009202846930003302938946001102971655001202982IND4414712620221116150259.0090109e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441471262DNAL7 a190406142pmid7 aPMC26752502pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03821.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeddeb-Garnaoui, A.10aEffects of tropism and virulence of Leishmania parasites on cytokine production by infected human monocytes  ap. 199-206.  aThe nature of early interactions between Leishmania and macrophages which determine the outcome of infection can be related directly to parasite biological properties. Here we compared the capacity of L. major (Lm) strains, reported to be high (LmHV) and low virulent and (LmLV) in the mouse model and L. infantum (Li) strains, dermotropic (LiD) and viscerotropic (LiV), to infect and modulate cytokine production in human peripheral blood derived monocytes. Monocytes were infected with metacyclic promastigotes for 24, 48 and 72 h. Parasite burden was significantly higher in Lm- than in Li-infected monocytes. LmHV and LiD induced a significantly higher parasite burden than LmLV and LiV respectively. Cytokine production was evaluated in monocytes infected for 24 h. Contrary to interleukin (IL)-12p70, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and transforming growth factor-β production was increased significantly in infected monocytes with no differences between strains. Lm isolates induced significantly higher quantities of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α than Li isolates. Low levels of IL-10 were induced by all Leishmania strains and, interestingly, co-stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was accompanied by a dramatic increase in IL-10 production by infected monocytes. In conclusion, Lm isolates displaying different levels of virulence in mice exhibited significant differences in parasite burden but similar abilities to modulate cytokine production in human monocytes. Li strains showed weaker infectivity and TNF-α inducing-capacity compared with Lm strains. The dramatic increase of IL-10 production in infected monocytes co-stimulated by LPS may play a role in disease progression considering the presence of LPS during bacterial superinfections observed during human leishmaniasis. 3acytokines 3aLeishmania 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aHumans 2aInterferon-gammaximmunology 2aInterleukin-10xbiosynthesis 2aLeishmania infantumximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aLeishmania majorximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aLeishmaniasisximmunology 2aLipopolysaccharidesximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMonocytesximmunologyxparasitology. 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTropism 2aVirulence 0amonocyte 0atropism1 aZrelli, H.1 aDellagi, K.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 Feb., v. 155, no. 2 p.199-206dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03821.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03666naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245010200180300001600282520169300298650002601991650001202017650001202029650002202041650001502063650001102078650001102089650001302100650002602113650003502139650001402174650000902188650001302197650002002210650001402230650001502244650002402259650001002283650001702293650001502310653001502325653002402340653002202364653002702386653001902413700002002432700002302452700002702475700002402502700002402526700002602550700002502576700001902601700001902620700001602639700002002655700002202675700002402697773011402721852000902835856009202844930003302936946001102969655001202980IND4418901220221116150303.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441890122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01498.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan der Waal, Cornelis.10aWater and nutrients alter herbaceous competitive effects on tree seedlings in a semi-arid savanna  ap. 430-439.  a1. Globally, both climatic patterns and nitrogen deposition rates show directional changes over time. It is uncertain how woody seedlings, which coexist with herbaceous plants in savannas, respond to concurrent changes in water and nutrient availability. 2. We investigated competition effects between herbaceous vegetation and tree seedlings (Colophospermum mopane) under changed water and nutrient (fertilized) conditions in a garden experiment situated in a semi-arid savanna. 3. Herbaceous competition significantly suppressed woody seedling growth. The effect of herbaceous competition on woody seedling growth remained constant with both increasing water and nutrient availability. However, during a wet-season drought, herbaceous competition apparently caused premature leaf senescence in non-irrigated treatments. Fertilization exacerbated negative competition effects during the drought, while irrigation prevented leaf loss of tree seedlings in spite of herbaceous competition and fertilization. 4. Based on a conceptual model, we propose that the vigorous response of herbaceous plants to increased nutrient availability leads to faster depletion of soil water, which increasingly causes water stress in woody seedlings if the interval between watering events is prolonged, e.g. during wet-season droughts. 5. Synthesis. Our data support the notion that changes in drought frequency are of greater importance to woody recruitment success than changes in annual rainfall amount. Based on the water and nutrient interactions observed in our experiment, we suggest that the effect of increased nitrogen deposition on woody seedling recruitment is contingent on water availability. 3aColophospermum mopane 3adrought 3agardens 3aherbaceous plants 3airrigation 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3anutrients 3arain 3asavannas 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asoil water 3aspecies recruitment 3atrees 3awater stress 3awet season 0aherbaceous 0anitrogen deposition 0asemi-arid savanna 0atree-grass competition 0awoody seedling1 aKroon, Hans de.1 ade Boer, Willem F.1 aHeitkönig, Ignas M.A.1 aSkidmore, Andrew K.1 ade Knegt, Henrik J.1 avan Langevelde, Frank1 avan Wieren, Sipke E.1 aGrant, Rina C.1 aPage, Bruce R.1 aSlotow, Rob1 aKohi, Edward M.1 aMwakiwa, Emmanuel1 aPrins, Herbert H.T.0 tJournal of ecology.g2009 May, v. 97, no. 3 p.430-439dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01498.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01301naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245001200115300001200127300002700139520056300166650001200729650002800741650001300769650002000782650001700802650001900819773008500838852001300923939003300936945000800969946001300977852000900990655001200999991591832000742620221116150223.0851211e198410  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850083962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aCookies  ap. 134.  ap. 134, 138, 140. ill.  aThe growing popularity, types, and marketing of cookies are briefly discussed.

The discovery of a new genus and several species of whale bone-eating Osedax tubeworms (Annelida, Siboglinidae) a mere 6 years ago from the deep sea was itself noteworthy. But what the researchers peering into the video monitors aboard the Western Flyer could not have known at that moment was that in the gelatinous tubes of those worms clung even more peculiar forms: harems of tiny, paedomorphic males of Osedax, numbering in the hundreds at times. Whereas female tubeworms bore into the marrow of whale bones (possibly via enzymes from their endosymbiotic bacteria), the dwarf males secondarily colonize the tubes of the resident females. The number of males in a female's tube increases over time in a curvilinear fashion. Dwarf males are known from all Osedax species examined to date, yet the origin of the males was an open question. In this issue, Vrijenhoek et al. provide compelling evidence that dwarf males found in the tubes of female Osedax worms are derived from a common larval pool and are unlikely to be the sons of host females or the progeny of females in the local genetic neighbourhood. This study provides an important foundation for future work on the ecology and evolution of extreme male dwarfism in Osedax and sexual size dimorphism more generally. 3aAnnelida 3aCetacea 3apopulation genetics 0amale dwarf 0amarine larval ecology0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Oct., v. 17, no. 20 p.4395-4397dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03938.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03878naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245014300188300001400331520161300345650001201958650001101970650001401981650002201995650002802017650002002045650002202065650001502087650001902102650001502121650000902136650002702145650002202172650001202194650001802206650002402224650002102248650003702269650003302306650001402339650003302353650003002386650002202416650002502438650001302463650002502476650003702501650002802538650001402566650001102580650003902591650002402630651001002654651001002664653001202674653002502686653002602711700001802737700001802755700001602773700001902789700001502808700001702823773013502840852000902975856009202984930003303076946001103109655001203120IND4415337120221116150306.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441533712DNAL7 a192079332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2008.00759.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, B.P.10aRiverine status and genetic structure of Chilika buffalo of eastern India as inferred from cytogenetic and molecular marker-based analysis  ap. 69-79.  aThe present study aimed at assessing the status of the Chilika buffalo population of eastern India employing cytogenetic and molecular markers. The Chilika buffaloes investigated cytogenetically possess a somatic chromosome count of 50, identical to that of typical riverine buffaloes. Various diversity estimates, viz. observed number of alleles (4.68), effective number of alleles (2.79), and observed (0.487) and expected (0.602) heterozygosity across 25 heterologous microsatellite markers indicated the presence of a moderate level of genetic diversity in Chilika buffaloes, comparable with three other prominent Indian riverine buffalo breeds (Murrah, Nagpuri and Toda) included in this study. Across the four buffalo populations, mean estimates of F-statistics from Jackknifing over loci were significantly different from zero (p < 0.05), with FIT (total inbreeding estimate) = 0.315 ± 0.038, FIS (within-population inbreeding estimate) = 0.178 ± 0.038, and FST (population differentiation) = 0.166 ± 0.025. Inter-breed analysis reflected Chilika buffaloes to be genetically close to Nagpuri followed by Murrah and Toda buffaloes. Factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) revealed low breed-specific clustering of Chilika and Nagpuri buffaloes. Additionally, the neighbour-joining tree structure of mitochondrial DNA D-loop haplotypes indicated clear grouping of the Chilika haplotypes with the riverine buffalo. Thus the cytogenetic, microsatellite and mitochondrial data analysed in the present study classify Chilika buffalo of eastern India to be of the riverine type and not swamp-type buffalo. 3aalleles 3abreeds 3abuffaloes 3achromosome number 3acorrespondence analysis 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBuffaloesxgenetics 2aCluster Analysis 2aCytogenetic Analysisxveterinary 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRivers 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxveterinary 2aSpecies Specificity 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aChilika 0aIndian river buffalo 0amitochondrial markers1 aKataria, R.S.1 aBulandi, S.S.1 aPrakash, B.1 aKathiravan, P.1 aMukesh, M.1 aSadana, D.K.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2009 Feb., v. 126, no. 1 p.69-79dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2008.00759.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090123b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01769naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010200165300001400267520070800281650001500989650001201004650001901016650001201035650000901047650001601056650001401072653002401086700002301110700002101133700002401154773009101178852000901269856008501278930003301363946001101396655001201407IND4415707920221116150314.0090130e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441570792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10267-008-0443-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurihara, Yuko 10aHirsutella proturicola sp. nov. isolated from a proturan, Baculentulus densus (Protura, Hexapoda)  ap. 56-62.  aA new species of Hirsutella, H. proturicola, isolated from a subterranean proturan (Baculentulus densus; Protura, Hexapoda), is described and illustrated. Hirsutella proturicola is characterized by producing monoblastic phialides of 24-51.5 x 2.5-5 μm with a slightly roughened neck, fusiform and curved conidia of 9-18 x 2.5-4 μm that have a truncate base and a papillate projection often capped with sheath-like mucilage, and pluricellular, globose to subglobose chlamydospores of 21-48 x 21-41.5 μm.

The role of specific nitric oxide synthase isoforms in diabetes-associated nitrosative stress and nerve fibre dysfunction and degeneration remains unknown. This study evaluated the contribution of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to peroxynitrite injury to peripheral nerve and dorsal root ganglia and development of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Methods Control mice and mice with iNos (also known as Nos2) gene deficiency (iNos ⁻/⁻ ) were made diabetic with streptozotocin, and maintained for 6 weeks. Peroxynitrite injury was assessed by nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP-ribose) accumulation (immunohistochemistry). Thermal algesia was evaluated by paw withdrawal, tail-flick and hot plate tests, mechanical algesia by the Randall-Selitto test, and tactile allodynia by a von Frey filament test. Results Diabetic wild-type mice displayed peroxynitrite injury in peripheral nerve and dorsal root ganglion neurons. They also developed motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity deficits, thermal and mechanical hypoalgesia, tactile allodynia and ~36% loss of intraepidermal nerve fibres. Diabetic iNos ⁻/⁻ mice did not display nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP-ribose) accumulation in peripheral nerve, but were not protected from nitrosative stress in dorsal root ganglia. Despite this latter circumstance, diabetic iNos ⁻/⁻ mice preserved normal nerve conduction velocities. Small-fibre sensory neuropathy was also less severe in diabetic iNos ⁻/⁻ than in wild-type mice. Conclusions/interpretation iNOS plays a key role in peroxynitrite injury to peripheral nerve, and functional and structural changes of diabetic neuropathy. Nitrosative stress in axons and Schwann cells, rather than dorsal root ganglion neurons, underlies peripheral nerve dysfunction and degeneration. 0aiNOS 0aNerve conduction 0aNitrosative stress 0aPeripheral diabetic neuropathy 0aTactile allodynia 0aThermal algesia1 aPavlov, I.

We here review the use of wireless capsule endoscopy to quantitate and assess the nature of the small bowel damage caused by NSAIDs when taken short term and in patients on long-term NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. Methods Forty healthy volunteers underwent a baseline capsule endoscopy. After taking diclofenac slow-release 75 mg twice a day for a total of 14 days, both investigations were repeated. A further 120 patients on long-term NSAIDs (more than 3 months) and 40 on COX-2 inhibitors underwent a capsule endoscopy study. Sixty healthy patients acted as controls. Small bowel damage was categorized and quantitated. Results Short-term diclofenac: Capsule endoscopy demonstrated new pathology in 27 (68%) of subjects. The most common lesions were mucosal breaks, seen in 16 (40%), which were seen to be bleeding in 2 (5%). Long-term NSAIDs: The main pathology was related to mucosal breaks (29%); 3% had free luminal blood and 2% had strictures. The damage seen in 50% of patients on selective COX-2 inhibitors did not differ significantly (P < 0.5) from that seen with NSAIDs. Conclusions Capsule endoscopy demonstrates evidence of macroscopic injury to the small intestine, in up to 68% of volunteers, resulting from 2 weeks ingestion of slow-release diclofenac. Long-term use of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors causes comparable small bowel damage (50%-68%). 0aNSAID 0aNSAID enteropathy 0aCOX-2 inhibitor 0acapsule endoscopy0 tJournal of gastroenterology.g2009 Jan., v. 44, no. 19 p.64-71dJapan : Springer Japanx0944-11747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00535-008-2248-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01847naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245001100115300001200126300003700138500001500175520110200190650001901292650001801311653002201329653002001351653001401371773008401385852001301469939003301482945000801515946001301523852000901536655001201545991591827850742620221116144544.0850222e198408  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850066912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aCoffee  ap. 134.  ap. 134,136,142,144,146-147. ill.  a2019-12-06  aThe use of coffee is believed to have originated in Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) before 900 A.D.; the first documentation was discovered in Arab medical literature. There are 2 basic coffee strains: arabica, the original type from Ethiopia and Arabia, and robusta, a variety from Southern Africa. Most brands of coffee are blends of various beans. Roasting the coffee bean develops the flavor and aroma associated with fresh coffee; the degree of roasting also influences the color. There is no standard nomenclature for the roasts; they will often vary from roaster to roaster. Coffee is served in virtually every type of foodservice operation; it is a highly profitable beverage for the operator. Cost differential between the most expensive and least expensive foodservice blends is very small. Decaffeinated coffee is increasing in popularity in institutional service; instant coffee is not as frequently used in foodservice as in the home. Freeze drying, a relatively new development, produces a taste close to that of brewed, ground coffee. Suggestions for making good coffee are included.

ANIMALS Cadavers of twelve 1- to 5-year-old mixed-breed goats that had been euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital as part of an unrelated study. PROCEDURES Cadavers were randomly assigned to receive a nonpenetrating (n = 6) or penetrating (6) captive bolt. The head of 1 cadaver was imaged via CT and MRI. The muzzle of a device designed to administer either a penetrating or nonpenetrating captive bolt was then placed flush on the dorsal midline of each head at the level of the external occipital protuberance (poll) and aimed downward toward the cranialmost portion of the intermandibular space, and the assigned bolt was administered. Heads were removed, and CT and MRI of each head were performed. After imaging, each skull was transected along the sagittal plane to permit gross evaluation of central nervous tissue and obtain digital photographic images. In addition, 1 head that received a nonpenetrating captive bolt was further evaluated via blunt dissection and removal of adnexa from the external surface of the calvarium. RESULTS MRI, CT, and dissection of skulls revealed severe skeletal and soft tissue damage after impact with the penetrating and nonpenetrating captive bolts. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The nonpenetrating captive bolt appeared to cause damage similar to that of the penetrating captive bolt in the cranium and soft tissues of the head in caprine cadavers. This damage suggested that administration of a nonpenetrating captive bolt as described here may be an acceptable method of euthanasia in goats. 3abolts 3aeuthanasia 3agoats 3ahead 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amixed breeds 3aoverdose 3apentobarbital 3aphotographs 3askull1 aCaldwell, Marc1 aHecht, Silke1 aWhitlock, Brian K.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2017 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.151-157dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.78.2.151  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009100164300001600255520173200271650001502003650001902018650001502037650001502052650002202067650000902089650001902098650001702117650001802134650001602152650002202168650005202190700002102242700002202263700002202285700002002307773015202327856004402479852000902523655001202532IND60562187520221116144434.0170202e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056218752DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.78.2.1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Valerie M.10aEndothelial protein C receptor–dependent antichemotactic effects of canine protein C  ap. 186-194.  aOBJECTIVE To determine whether canine protein C (CnPC) had antichemotactic effects on canine neutrophils, whether endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) was expressed on canine neutrophils, and the role of EPCR in neutrophil chemotaxis. SAMPLE Neutrophils isolated from blood samples from healthy dogs (n = 6) and sick dogs with (2) or without (3) an inflammatory leukogram. PROCEDURES Neutrophils were analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR assay and flow cytometry for detection of EPCR mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Neutrophils were incubated with CnPC zymogen or canine activated protein C (CnAPC), with or without RCR-379 (an anti–human EPCR antibody). Neutrophils were then allowed to migrate through a filter membrane toward a chemokine. Untreated neutrophils served as positive control samples. Migration was quantified by fluorescence measurement, and chemotaxis index (Chx) values (fluorescence of test sample/fluorescence of positive control sample) were computed. RESULTS The cDNA for EPCR was amplified, and EPCR expression was detected on neutrophil surfaces. Obtained Chx values were significantly higher in cells treated with RCR-379 than in cells treated with CnPC or CnAPC alone. The Chx values for neutrophils treated with RCR-379 were not significantly different from 1, whereas those for neutrophils treated without RCR-379 were significantly less than 1. The effects of RCR-379 on neutrophil migration were independent of concentration or activation status of protein C. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Canine neutrophils expressed EPCR, and inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by CnPC and CnAPC depended on EPCR. Interventions with EPCR signaling may have therapeutic application in dogs. 3aantibodies 3ablood sampling 3achemokines 3achemotaxis 3acomplementary DNA 3adogs 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3amessenger RNA 3aneutrophils 3aprotein synthesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aCôté, Olivier,1 aBienzle, Dorothee1 aHayes, M.

It may be considered any item which one person cannot carry alone, or any piece of equipment that must be permanently connected to either water or electricity. Because food and equipment work together in the food service system, sales representatives are in an ideal position to anticipate their customers' equipment needs.

Intensive competition control during the early years after planting is a necessity. Close spacing is recommended, with gradual release of crop trees to promote high-quality stem development. For good hardwood growth on soils of marginal fertility or poor drainage or on sites where intensive management cannot be guaranteed, it is recommended that a mixture of several hardwood species be planted. 3aafforestation 3aagricultural land 3asite preparation 3aweed control 3aplant competition 3astand density 3aspatial distribution 3ahardwood0 tForestry chronicle.g1991 June, v. 67, no. 3 p.209-212wJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc67209-33Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02774naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016900174300001600343520129300359592002801652650001301680650002101693650001401714650001301728650002301741650001501764650001201779650001101791650001401802650001001816650001001826650001601836650001801852650002101870650001101891650001501902651001201917653002501929653001601954653001301970653002601983700001902009700001602028700001602044773011402060856008502174852000902259655001202268IND60695023720221119054729.0200515e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069502372DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2019.16743992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Brahim, Mounir10aComparison of spatial scale variability of shoot density and epiphytic leaf assemblages of Halophila stipulacea and Cymodocea nodosa on the Eastern Coast of Tunisia  ap. 413-426.  aA study was undertaken to compare the patterns of spatial variability, epiphytic percentage cover, and distribution of epiphytic fauna and flora between the two adjacent seagrasses Cymodocea nodosa and the invasive species Halophila stipulucea. Samples were taken at six stations separated by 600 m and exposed to different current conditions. The stations G2 and G5 were affected by a high current tide, while G4 was directly exposed to the northern marine currents. The station G3 was situated in the middle of a Posidonia oceanica bed and was less exposed to hydrodynamism, whereas the other stations were relatively protected. Results indicate that for both H. stipulacea and C. nodosa, shoot density and epiphytic cover biomass decreased when exposed to high levels of hydrodynamic activity. In terms of epiphytic leaf assemblages, our results showed significant differences for the two host plants in their mean cover and for the six stations at the largest and smallest spatial scale. Our observations highlight the dominance of Rhodophyta and the low number of epiphytic species and the epiphytic cover on H. stipulacea compared to C. nodosa. In addition, results indicate the absence of two taxa Hydrozoans and Annelida in the epiphytic assemblage of H. stipulacea leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnelida 3aCymodocea nodosa 3aHalophila 3aHydrozoa 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aRhodophyta 3abiomass 3acoasts 3aepiphytes 3afauna 3aflora 3ahost plants 3ahydrodynamics 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3aseagrasses 3aTunisia 0aHalophila stipulacea 0avariability 0aepiphyte 0amean percentage cover1 aMabrouk, Lotfi1 aHamza, Asma1 aJribi, Imed0 tPlant biosystems.g2020 May 3, v. 154, no. 3 p.413-426dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2019.16743993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245014800161300001600309520123300325592002801558650000801586650001501594650001501609650001601624650002001640650002101660650001501681650001101696650001901707650001301726653002501739653003001764653003101794653001301825653004201838700001701880700001801897700001401915700001501929773011101944856008302055852000902138655001202147IND60553605120221122211010.0180831e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055360512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Kai10aTarget-triggered catalytic hairpin assembly and TdT-catalyzed DNA polymerization for amplified electronic detection of thrombin in human serums  ap. 495-500.  aSpecific and sensitive detection of protein biomarkers is of great importance in biomedical and bioanalytical applications. In this work, a dual amplified signal enhancement approach based on the integration of catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated in situ DNA polymerization has been developed for highly sensitive and label-free electrochemical detection of thrombin in human serums. The presence of the target thrombin leads to the unfolding and capture of a significant number of hairpin signal probes with free 3′-OH termini on the sensor electrode. Subsequently, TdT can catalyze the elongation of the signal probes and formation of many G-quadruplex sequence replicates with the presence of dGTP and dATP at a molar ratio of 6:4. These G-quadruplex sequences bind hemin and generate drastically amplified current response for sensitive detection of thrombin in a completely label-free fashion. The sensor shows a linear range of 0.5pM–10.0nM and a detection limit of 0.12pM for thrombin. Moreover, the developed sensor can selectively discriminate the target thrombin against other non-target proteins and can be employed to monitor thrombin in human serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahumans 3apolymerization 3athrombin 0aSignal amplification 0aElectrochemical biosensor 0aCatalytic hairpin assembly 0aThrombin 0aTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase1 aDou, Baoting1 aYang, Jianmei1 aYuan, Ruo1 aXiang, Yun0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 87 p.495-500dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05178naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001800170245008000188300001400268500001500282520275800297592002803055650001603083650002303099650002103122650000903143650001203152650002203164650002003186650002003206650002303226650000903249650001203258650001903270650002003289650003803309650002003347650001303367650001103380650001103391650001403402650002003416650001403436650001203450650001903462650002003481650001503501650001403516650001203530650001803542650001203560650003303572650005903605650001103664650008303675650001103758650002503769650002303794650002603817650003203843650002903875650008503904650005303989650003004042651002704072653001604099653005504115700001404170773010404184856008704288852000904375655001204384IND4457669420221122071438.0141112e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445766942DNAL7 a214819602pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, L.R.10aCulling decisions of dairy farmers during a 3-year Salmonella control study  ap. 29-37.  a2019-12-06  aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica-serotypes lead to periodically increased morbidity and mortality in cattle herds. The bacteria can also lead to serious infections in humans. Consequently, Denmark has started a surveillance and control programme in 2002. The programme focuses on Salmonella Dublin which is the most prevalent and most persistent serotype in the Danish cattle population. A field study in 10 dairy herds with persistent Salmonella infections was carried out over three years to gain experience with control procedures including risk assessment, targeted control actions and test-and-cull procedures. From autumn 2003 until end of 2006 quarterly milk quality control samples from all lactating cows and biannual blood samples from all young stock above the age of three months were tested using an indirect antibody ELISA. The most recent and previous test results were used to categorise all animals into risk groups. These risk groups and all individual ELISA-results were communicated to the farmers as colour-coded lists four to six times per year. Farmers were advised to manage the risk of Salmonella transmission from cattle with repeatedly high ELISA results (flagged as “red”) or cows with at least one recent moderately high ELISA result (flagged as “yellow”) on the lists. Risk management included, e.g. culling or separation of the cows at calving. We analysed culling decisions using two models. For heifers a hierarchical multivariable logistic model with herd as random effect evaluated if animals with red and yellow flags had higher probability of being slaughtered or sold before first calving than animals without any risk flags. For adult cows a semi-parametric proportional hazard survival model was used to test the effect of number of red and yellow flags on hazards of culling at different time points and interactions with prevalence in the herd while accounting for parity, stage of lactation, milk yield, somatic cell count and the hierarchical structure of the data with animals clustered at herd level. This study illustrates how investigation of culling decisions made by herd managers when they have access to test-status of individual animals and overall apparent prevalence during control of an infection can lead to useful new knowledge. Overall herd managers were more likely to cull cattle with increasing number of yellow and red flags than animals with no flags. However, cattle were more likely to be culled with yellow and red flags during times with low or medium high within-herd seroprevalence than at times with high seroprevalence. These results are valuable knowledge for modelling and planning of control strategies and for making recommendations to farmers about control options.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy herds 3aat-risk population 3acluster analysis 3acows 3adairies 3aSalmonella Dublin 3adecision making 3aquality control 3asomatic cell count 3arisk 3aheifers 3ablood sampling 3arisk assessment 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3alactation stage 3amanagers 3aautumn 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3arisk management 3aserotypes 3acalving 3alogit analysis 3adisease control 3amilk yield 3amortality 3afarmers 3asalmonellosis 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aCarrier Statexepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aFemale 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aSalmonella enteritidisxisolation & purification 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 0aDenmarkxepidemiology. 0arisk groups 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin1 aDohoo, I.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2011 June 1, v. 100, no. 1 p.29-37dElsevier B.V.x0167-58777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016000166300001600326520166800342592002802010650002002038650001302058650001502071650001202086650001002098650001602108650002002124650002702144650001302171650002102184650001002205650000902215650001002224650003102234650001402265650001502279650003002294650001502324650002402339650001602363653001802379653002702397653003002424653002102454653002502475653002402500700002802524700002002552773011102572856008302683852000902766655001202775IND60553605220221122210926.0180831e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055360522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLow, Kim-Fatt12aA signal-amplified electrochemical DNA biosensor incorporated with a colorimetric internal control for Vibrio cholerae detection using shelf-ready reagents  ap. 256-263.  aA novel enzyme/nanoparticle-based DNA biosensing platform with dual colorimetric/electrochemical approach has been developed for the sequence-specific detection of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of acute diarrheal disease in cholera. This assay platform exploits the use of shelf-stable and ready-to-use (shelf-ready) reagents to greatly simplify the bioanalysis procedures, allowing the assay platform to be more amenable to point-of-care applications. To assure maximum diagnosis reliability, an internal control (IC) capable of providing instant validation of results was incorporated into the assay. The microbial target, single-stranded DNA amplified with asymmetric PCR, was quantitatively detected via electrochemical stripping analysis of gold nanoparticle-loaded latex microspheres as a signal-amplified hybridization tag, while the incorporated IC was analyzed using a simplified horseradish peroxidase enzyme-based colorimetric scheme by simple visual observation of enzymatic color development. The platform showed excellent diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (100%) when challenged with 145 clinical isolate-spiked fecal specimens. The limits of detection were 0.5ng/ml of genomic DNA and 10 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml of bacterial cells with dynamic ranges of 0–100ng/ml (R²=0.992) and log10 (1–10⁴ CFU/ml) (R²=0.9918), respectively. An accelerated stability test revealed that the assay reagents were stable at temperatures of 4–37°C, with an estimated ambient shelf life of 200 days. The versatility of the biosensing platform makes it easily adaptable for quantitative detection of other microbial pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3abacteria 3abiosensors 3acholera 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3adiarrhea 3aelectrochemistry 3afeces 3agold 3alatex 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ashelf life 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atemperature 0aDNA biosensor 0aColorimetric detection 0aElectrochemical detection 0aInternal control 0aSignal amplification 0aShelf-ready reagent1 aZain, Zainiharyati Mohd1 aYean, Chan Yean0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 87 p.256-263dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245007000152300001600222520127200238592002801510650002301538650002001561650003801581650002101619650002601640650002101666650001101687650001901698650001501717650001301732650003301745650001401778700001401792700001201806700001801818773010201836856007501938852000902013655001202022IND60578017920221117012727.0170811e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057801792DNAL7 a10.1021/ma402330a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Peng10aMesophase Separation and Rheology of Olefin Multiblock Copolymers  ap. 807-820.  aChain shuttling polymerization enables an efficient production of ethylene–octene block copolymers (OBCs) that combine different mechanical properties in a polymer chain. However, this method results in molecular weight polydispersity and multiblock chain structure. The melt-phase behavior and mesophase transition of the polydisperse OBCs with low octene content but different molecular weight and block composition were investigated by rheology, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), atomic force microscopic (AFM), polarized optical microscopy (POM), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Three rheological methods, namely the deviation of the scaling dependence of zero shear viscosity on molecular weight, the terminal behavior and the failure of time–temperature superposition (TTS), and two-dimensional rheological correlation spectrum, are used to reveal the mesophase separation with increasing sensitivity. The occurrence of mesophase separation transitions (MST) was observed in such low octene content and low molecular weight OBC systems, with much lower degree of segregation than the theoretical predictions in diblock copolymers. The extent of mesophase separation is further justified by its effect on subsequent crystallization behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3alight microscopy 3amechanical properties 3amolecular weight 3aolefin 3apolymerization 3aprediction 3arheology 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3aviscosity1 aShen, Wei1 aYu, Wei1 aZhou, Chixing0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 47, no. 2 p.807-820dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma402330a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01568naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100001900167245011700186300001600303520054300319592002800862653002000890653001700910653001500927700001800942700002100960700001800981773015500999856011501154852000901269655001201278IND60128964020221121003435.0151124e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012896402DNAL7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2005)21[243:ALOTMH]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajavel, A.

S81-S82.  aTo determine the impact of switching from a hard copy to an electronic textbook with inclusive access and adaptive learning experiences on the drop, fail, withdraw, incomplete (DFWI) rate in an online undergraduate introductory nutrition course.Earning a D, F, W, or I in a course has a negative effect on a student's progression towards completion of a degree. While enrollment in online courses continues to increase, student retention rates continue to decrease. One strategy suggested to increase retention, and by extension decrease DFWI rates, is using an electronic textbook with computer-based learning resources and activities that promote active learning.Undergraduate students enrolled in an online introductory nutrition course at a Midwestern urban university from August 2012-December 2018.From Fall 2012-Spring 2017, students used a hard copy textbook (HCT). Beginning Fall 2017, students used an interactive electronic textbook (ET) with inclusive (anytime/anywhere) access that included integrated videos, online ability to highlight/take notes, and online adaptive learning-by-doing activities (study guides, diet analysis, meal planning, etc). All semesters used publisher PowerPoint presentations and test bank.The data set, with prior approval from the university Institutional Research, Assessment and Testing team, was generated using university DFWI reports. Grade and academic level data from 1034 undergraduate introductory nutrition course students (n = 810; HCT, n = 224; ET) were examined.Students in the ET course had statistically significant lower DFWI rates (9.4 ± 2.0%; range 6.1-11.3%) than HCT students (19.8 ± 8.2%; range 9.9-35.1%), P < .05. There was no significant difference in the academic level between HCT and ET students.Electronic textbooks with inclusive (anytime/anywhere) access on multiple digital platforms facilitate incorporating adaptive learning experiences into courses. Nutrition educators should consider this strategy to foster active student engagement in mastering basic food and nutrition knowledge with the added benefit of decreasing DFWI rates.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adata collection 3adiet 3alearning 3ameal planning 3anutrition knowledge 3aonline courses 3astudents 3ateachers0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S81-S82dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015600171300001600327500001900343520153500362592002801897650001401925650001601939650001901955650001601974650001401990650000902004650002002013650001902033653001502052653003002067653002902097653002702126653001702153653001502170653001002185653001502195653002902210653002902239653002702268653001702295653001502312653001002327700001902337700002202356700002002378700001902398700002102417700002402438700001702462700001702479700002202496773011702518856008502635852000902720655001202729IND60695023920221119222512.0200515e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069502392DNAL7 a10.1080/1343943X.2015.11280862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdachi, Katsuki10aYield-enhancing and tuber-downsizing effects of transplantation cultivation method of case-held tuber seedlings in the sweet potato cultivar Beniharuka  ap. 125-131.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe developed transplantation cultivation method of case-held tuber seedlings (CTS), which was derived from direct planting method of seed tubers, and applied this method to the sweet potato cultivar Beniharuka. A plastic case made of polypropylene was designed for cultivation of CTS. Seed tubers of cultivar Beniharuka in the range of 30–80 g were cut in half. The half-cut tubers were placed inside the plastic cases, and the cases were filled with a commercial soil mix. The case-held tubers were incubated under natural sunlight in a glass house. After 3–4 wk, the CTS were transplanted into a field. Mother tuber (seed tuber) enlargement was suppressed by the plastic confinement of the cases, and daughter tubers were formed above the case as vine-root-originated tubers. In the field experiments in 2012 and 2013, daughter tuber yields were increased 19% and 21% by case-held tuber seedling transplanting (CTST) over conventional vine-planting (VP), the number of daughter tubers per plant in CTST were 36 and 68% higher than in VP, and the mother tuber yields were limited to 2.1 and 4.3% of the total fresh yield of mother and daughter tubers, respectively in 2012 and 2013. Application of CTST method to cultivar Beniharuka enhanced tuber yield, increased the number of daughter tubers per plant, downsized daughter tubers compared to VP, and mother tuber enlargement was suppressed by case-holding. The CTST method is expected to produce more and smaller good in shape tubers of cultivar Beniharuka compared to VP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3apolypropylenes 3aseed tubers 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3asweet potatoes 0aBeniharuka 0aCase-held tuber seedlings 0aMother tuber enlargement 0aPrototype plastic case 0aSweet potato 0aTransplant 0aYield 0aBeniharuka 0acase-held tuber seedling 0amother tuber enlargement 0aprototype plastic case 0asweet potato 0atransplant 0ayield1 aOmine, Masaaki1 aSugimoto, Mitsuho1 aIshii, Takanori1 aNiimi, Hiroshi1 aSuzuki, Takayuki1 aKamebayashi, Mitsuo1 aTakada, Miki1 aGotoh, Akira1 aYokoyama, Kyotaro0 tPlant production science.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 19, no. 1 p.125-131dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18963x1349-10087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1343943X.2015.11280863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245005300161300001800214500001100232520100100243592002801244650001701272650001701289650003201306650003101338650002101369650002201390650001401412650001301426700001501439700001701454700001501471700005601486773014501542856008201687852000901769655001201778IND60592056520221117070730.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059205652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-8858-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hui14aThe molecular basis for lipase stereoselectivity  ap. 3487-3495.  aReview  aLipases are among the most applied biocatalysts in organic synthesis to catalyze the kinetic resolution of a wide range of racemic substrates to yield optically pure compounds. Due to the rapidly increased demands for optically pure compounds, deep understanding of the molecular basis for lipase stereoselectivity and how to obtain lipases with excellent asymmetric selectivity have become one of primary research goals in this field. This review is focused on the molecular factors that have impacts on the stereoselectivity of lipases including the steric complementarity between the lipase topological structure and its substrate, the regional structural flexibility, the hydrogen bonds between the residues around the catalytic site and the tetrahedral intermediates, and the electrostatic interactions between surface residues. Moreover, the synergistic effects of these structural factors on the catalytic properties including stereoselectivity, activity, and stability are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abiocatalysts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3astereoselectivity 3asynergism 3atopology1 aMeng, Xiao1 aXu, Xiaoqing1 aLiu, Wenbo1 aLi, Shengying1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5244-870X0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Apr., v. 102, no. 8 p.3487-3495dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-8858-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010100166500001400267520115800281592002801439650002101467650001501488650003101503650001001534650001101544650001401555650001801569650002401587650001701611650001001628653001401638653001201652653001201664653001401676653003001690653002701720653000801747653000801755653000901763653001201772653000701784653000901791653000901800653001001809653000801819653001001827653001001837653000901847653001601856653001201872653000901884653001001893700001401903700001201917700001501929700001501944700001601959700001301975700001801988700005402006773008802060856008302148852000902231655001202240IND60705591820221122034412.0200907e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070559182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1450032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Huimin10aHPV11E7 inhibits IMQ-induced chemokine and colony-stimulating factor production in keratinocytes  aNAL-light  aImiquimod (IMQ) is approved as a first-line treatment for genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, the recurrence rate is very high. HPV E7 protein plays a critical role in HPV immune escape. However, the role of HPV11 E7 protein in genital warts recurrence during IMQ treatment is not clear. Here, we found that the expression profile of NHEK cells was obviously changed after IMQ treatment, and a large number of genes encoding cytokines and genes involved in cytokine-mediated signaling pathways and cellular metabolic signaling pathways were up- or downregulated. HPV11E7 overexpression inhibited the IMQ-induced production of of multiple chemokines and colony-stimulating factors in NHEK cells. Furthermore, we found that HPV11E7 could impair the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Therefore, our results suggested that HPV11 E7 diminishes the production of chemokines, colony-stimulating factors and other cytokines via inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway, which suppresses the therapeutic effect of IMQ and promotes the recurrence of diseases, such as condyloma acuminatum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3achemokines 3acolony-stimulating factors 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainfection 3akeratinocytes 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3awarts 0aImiquimod 0aHPV11E7 0aRNA-seq 0aChemokine 0aColony-stimulating factor 0aMAPK signaling pathway 0aIMQ 0aHPV 0aNHEK 0aRNA-seq 0aGO 0aKEGG 0arRNA 0aDAVID 0aFDR 0aq-PCR 0aGAPDH 0aCSF2 0aG-CSF, CSF3 0aIL-18BP 0aMKPs 0aDUSPs1 aZou, Ziqi1 aWu, Xia1 aXu, Yaohan1 aZhu, Jiang1 aZhou, Qiang1 aHan, Rui1 aSong, Yinjing1 aCheng, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1673-604X0 tGene.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 760 p.145003-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1450033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009900162300001300261520167100274592002801945653001101973653001801984653001002002653000902012773012302021856007802144852000902222655001202231IND60128571220221121234457.0151116e20081229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012857122DNAL7 a10.4003/006.026.02022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerb, Jeanne M.10aToward Developing Models to Study the Disease, Ecology, and Evolution of the Eye in Mollusca**  ap. 3-18.  aSeveral invertebrate systems have been developed to study various aspects of the eye and eye disease including Drosophila, Planaria, Platynereis, and most recently, the cubozoan jellyfish Tripedalia; however, molluscs, the second largest metazoan phylum, so far have been underrepresented in eye research. This is surprising as mollusc systems offer opportunities to study visual processes that may be altered by disease, vision physiology, development of the visual system, behavior, and evolution. Malacologists have labored for over a century as morphologists, systematists, physiologists, and ecologists in order to understand the structural and functional diversity in molluscs at all levels of biological organization. Yet, malacologists have had little opportunity to interact with researchers whose interests are restricted to the biology and development of eyes as model systems as they tend not to publish in the same journals or attend the same meetings. In an effort to highlight the advantages of molluscan eyes as a model system and encourage greater collaboration among researchers, I provide an overview of molluscan eye research from these two perspectives: eye researchers whose interests involve the development, physiology, and disease of the eye and malacologists who study the complete organism in its natural environment. I discuss the developmental and genetic information available for molluscan eyes and the need to place this work in an evolutionary perspective. Finally, I discuss how synergy between these two groups will advance eye research, broaden research in both fields, and aid in developing new molluscan models for eye research.  aPublisher supplied data 0aretina 0aphotoreceptor 0aopsin 0aPax60 tAmerican Malacological Bulletin.g2008 Dec. 29, v. 26, no. 1/2 p.3-18dAmerican Malacological Societyx0740-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4003%2F006.026.02023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010100168300001200269520210700281592002802388650002402416650002802440650001502468650002702483650003302510650001502543650001302558650001502571650001402586650002002600650001302620650001202633650001602645700001802661700002202679700002102701773014102722856008302863852000902946655001202955IND60648536520221118234918.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkhart, Sarah10aP111 Australian Nutrition and Dietetic Students’ Familiarity with Dimensions of Sustainability  ap.

Understanding the student perspective can provide interesting and important insights which may identify current curriculum needs and student knowledge gaps.To describe a cohort of Australian nutrition and dietetic (N&D) students’ familiarity with dimensions of sustainability.An observational cross-sectional study was undertaken using a self-administered online survey completed by 95 N&D students enrolled in a nutrition or dietetic undergraduate course at a regional Australian University.Familiarity with sustainability and related concepts of social development, environmental integrity, economic resilience and cross-cutting issues (relating to social, economic and environmental sustainability), were measured on a five-point Likert scale (1: very familiar - 5: not at all familiar). Descriptive statistics were calculated.Most students reported being very familiar (28%), quite familiar (45%), or familiar (23%) with the term sustainability. A greater proportion of students were very or quite familiar with the term environmental sustainability (75%), compared to economic (47%) and social (22%) sustainability. The sustainability related issue of widespread availability of highly processed foods (environmental integrity concept) and secure livelihoods (economic resilience concept) had the highest level of familiarity (90.5% and 80% very or quite familiar respectively), while least reported familiarity was living conditions of farm labourers (social development concept) and the use of food and agricultural policies (cross-cutting concept) (41% somewhat or not at all familiar respectively).Students reported varying levels of familiarity with terminology and concepts of sustainability. Identification of gaps and areas of student interest may assist with the design of curriculum and associated learning, teaching and assessment resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural policy 3across-sectional studies 3acurriculum 3adescriptive statistics 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afarm labor 3alearning 3alivelihood 3anutrition 3aprocessed foods 3astudents 3asurveys 3aterminology1 aJudith, Maher1 aVerdonck, Michele1 aAshford, Theresa0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S82-S82dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008900166300001600255520146300271592002801734650001501762650001501777650001401792650001201806650002501818650002901843650003101872650001801903650002401921650001901945650001501964650000901979650001401988650001802002650001902020650000702039650001502046653001502061653001502076653001302091653001502104653001302119653001002132653001502142653002902157653002202186653001802208700002002226700001802246700002102264700002502285700002602310700002202336700001702358773012502375856008202500852000902582655001202591IND60599310520221120075931.0180702e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059931052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObeid, Layaly10aAdsorption of a cationic surfactant by a magsorbent based on magnetic alginate beads  ap. 182-189.  aAdsorption of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), a cationic surfactant, by magnetic alginate beads (MagAlgbeads) was investigated. The magnetic adsorbent (called magsorbent) was prepared by encapsulation of magnetic functionalized nanoparticles in an alginate gel. The influence on CPC adsorption of several parameters such as contact time, pH and initial surfactant concentration was studied. The equilibrium isotherm shows that adsorption occurs through both electrostatic interactions with charge neutralization of the carboxylate groups of the beads and hydrophobic interactions inducing the formation of surfactant aggregates in the beads. The dosage of calcium ions released in the solution turns out to be a useful tool for understanding the adsorption mechanisms. Adsorption is accompanied by a shrinking of the beads that corresponds to a 45% reduction of the volume. Adsorption kinetic experiments show that equilibrium time is strongly dependent on the surfactant concentration, which monitors the nature of the interactions. On the other hand, since the pH affects the ionization state of adsorption sites, adsorption depends on the pH solution, maximum adsorption being obtained in a large pH range (3.2–12) in agreement with the pKa value of alginate (pKa=3.4–4.2). Finally, due to the formation of micelle-like surfactants aggregates in the magnetic alginate beads, they could be used as a new efficient magsorbent for hydrophobic pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalginates 3acalcium 3acationic surfactants 3acetylpyridinium chloride 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3aions 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3aneutralization 3apH 3apollutants 0aFerrofluid 0aSurfactant 0aAlginate 0aMagsorbent 0aMagnetic 0aBeads 0aAdsorption 0aCetylpyridinium chloride 0aWater remediation 0aAlginate bead1 aEl Kolli, Nadia1 aDali, Noëlle1 aTalbot, Delphine1 aAbramson, Sébastien1 aWelschbillig, Mathias1 aCabuil, Valérie,1 aBée, Agnès0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 432 p.182-189dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015300162300001600315520087700331592002801208650001801236650002101254650001901275650001301294700002001307700002001327773010201347856007501449852000901524655001201533IND60578018020221117012713.0170811e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057801802DNAL7 a10.1021/ma402354m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Yasuyuki10aModular Synthesis of Mid-Chain-Functionalized Polymers by Photoinduced Diene- and Styrene-Assisted Radical Coupling Reaction of Polymer-End Radicals  ap. 582-588.  aPhotoirradiation of structurally well-defined “living” polymers prepared by organotellurium-mediated living radical polymerization in the presence of dienes or styrenes induced selective polymer-end coupling reaction with the concomitant insertion of the dienes or styrenes with >90% coupling efficiency.

However, the process of MK alkalinization is still unrevealed. Here, we supplied a molecular insight into the process of MK alkalinization through reaction molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The structure, dynamics, and process of MK alkalinization are systematically investigated. The results showed that the layered structure of MK was destroyed and the silicates in MK were dissolved by sodium hydroxide solution during the alkalinization reaction of MK. The aluminates in MK are not dissolved, indicating that aluminates are more stable than silicates. Moreover, the equilibrium structures of MK with H₂O and MK with NaOH solution show that only when both sodium hydroxide and water are involved in the alkalinization reaction, the silicates in MK undergo depolymerization. Also, the observed final state of MK alkalinization can be recognized as the precursor of alkali-activated materials (AAMs).  aPublisher supplied data  a2019KJG010cDepartment of Education of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100012906  a51978352cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aU2006224cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aZR201910210098cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007129  aZR2020JQ25cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007129  a19-3-2-13-zhccQingdao University of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007938 3aalkalinization 3adepolymerization 3amolecular dynamics 3asodium hydroxide1 aHong, Fen1 aDong, Biqin1 aWang, Pan1 aZhang, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4823-46501 aWang, Xinpeng1 aWang, Muhan0 tLangmuir.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 38, no. 37 p.11337-11345dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c016313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011500157520159500272592002801867650002001895650002501915650001501940650001101955650001401966650001301980650001501993650001002008773012002018856007302138852000902211655001202220IND60744114120221120041105.0210709e20210704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074411412DNAL7 a10.3390/w131318642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMewis, Peter 10aEstimation of Vegetation-Induced Flow Resistance for Hydraulic Computations Using Airborne Laser Scanning Data  aThe effect of vegetation in hydraulic computations can be significant. This effect is important for flood computations. Today, the necessary terrain information for flood computations is obtained by airborne laser scanning techniques. The quality and density of the airborne laser scanning information allows for more extensive use of these data in flow computations. In this paper, known methods are improved and combined into a new simple and objective procedure to estimate the hydraulic resistance of vegetation on the flow in the field. State-of-the-art airborne laser scanner information is explored to estimate the vegetation density. The laser scanning information provides the base for the calculation of the vegetation density parameter ωₚ using the Beer–Lambert law. In a second step, the vegetation density is employed in a flow model to appropriately account for vegetation resistance. The use of this vegetation parameter is superior to the common method of accounting for the vegetation resistance in the bed resistance parameter for bed roughness. The proposed procedure utilizes newly available information and is demonstrated in an example. The obtained values fit very well with the values obtained in the literature. Moreover, the obtained information is very detailed. In the results, the effect of vegetation is estimated objectively without the assignment of typical values. Moreover, a more structured flow field is computed with the flood around denser vegetation, such as groups of bushes. A further thorough study based on observed flow resistance is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflow resistance 3ahydraulic resistance 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aroughness 3ascanners 3avegetation 3awater0 tWater.g2021 July 04, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131318643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03908naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006100170300002000231520169500251592002801946596009801974596009802072596009802170596009802268596009802366596008602464596012802550596012802678650001402806650001202820650001302832650000802845650002302853650002802876650002202904700002102926700001302947700001502960700002102975700001402996700001803010700002503028700005503053700001403108700005703122773011703179856008503296852000903381655001203390IND60793605420221120185122.0220920e20220906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079360542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c016372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shizhong10aRole of an Ice Surface in the Photoreaction of Coumarins  ap. 11346-11353.  aIce affects many chemical reactions in nature, which greatly influences the atmosphere, climate, and life. However, the exact mechanism of ice in these chemical reactions remains elusive. For example, it is still an open question as to whether ice can act as a catalyst to greatly enhance the reactivity and selectivity, which is essential for the production of some natural compounds in our planet. Here, we discover that ice can lead to high efficiency and stereoselectivity of the [2 + 2] photodimerization of coumarin and its derivatives. The conversion of the [2 + 2] photodimerization of coumarins enhanced by ice is dozens of times higher than that in the unfrozen saturated solution, and the reaction displays a high syn-head-head stereoselectivity (>95%) in comparison with those in the absence of the ice. Note that almost no reaction occurs in the crystal powder and melt of the coumarins, indicating that the role of ice in the photodimerization reaction is not simply due to the usual mechanisms found in the freezing concentration. We further reveal that the reaction rate is found to be proportional to the total area of the ice surface and follows Michaelis–Menten-like kinetics, indicating that the ice surface catalyzes the reaction. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that ice surfaces can induce reactants to form a two-dimensional liquid-crystal-ordered layer with a suitable intermolecular distance and unique side-by-side packing, facilitating stereoselective photodimerization for syn-head-head dimers. These findings give evidence that ice-surface-induced molecular assembly may play an important role in atmospheric heterogeneous photoreaction processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a11904086cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21733010cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21875261cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22122206cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51925307cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aZDBS-LYSLH031cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  a2018YFA0208502cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2020YFE0100300cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855 3acatalysts 3aclimate 3acoumarin 3aice 3amolecular dynamics 3aphotochemical reactions 3astereoselectivity1 aZhang, Chuanbiao1 aFu, Yang1 aLi, Linhai1 aHuang, Chuanbing1 aLin, Yang1 aZhu, Chongqin1 aFrancisco, Joseph S.1 aHe, Zhiyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7942-86051 aZhou, Xin1 aWang, Jianjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1704-99220 tLangmuir.g2022 Sept. 06, v. 38, no. 37 p.11346-11353dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c016373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100001900167245009800186300001600284520133400300592002801634653003001662653002201692653002101714653001301735653002301748653001701771700001901788700002001807773015501827856011501982852000902097655001202106IND60128964520221120234318.0151124e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012896452DNAL7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2005)21[301:AUAOAA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeisch, Max V.10aAerial ultra-low––volume assessment of anvil 10++10®® against anopheles quadrimaculatus  ap. 301-304.  aAgainst caged field-collected adults of Anopheles quadrimaculatus, optimized aerial applications of ANVIL 10++10®®at 18.4 ml (1.63 g active ingredient)//0.4 ha produced a mean mortality of 92%% at 1, 12, and 24 h after treatment.

Coupled with unreplicated results from a nonoptimized application, these tests provide further documentation of the efficacy of ANVIL 10++10 for wide-area adult mosquito control and for optimization technology.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnopheles quadrimaculatus 0aANVIL 10++ 10®® 0aultra-low volume 0aArkansas 0aaerial application 0aoptimization1 aDame, David A.1 aBrown, James R.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2005 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.301-304dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F8756-971X%282005%2921%5B301%3AAUAOAA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007700166300001600243520166500259592002801924650001901952650001701971650002301988650002502011650002202036650002202058650001502080650002002095650001502115650001302130651001102143700002202154700003502176700003902211700002802250700002202278700001802300700002602318700002002344700002002364700002802384700001902412773013502431856008202566852000902648655001202657IND60592056920221117065612.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059205692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-015-0876-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStürck, Julia10aSimulating and delineating future land change trajectories across Europe  ap. 733-749.  aExplorations of future land use change are important to understand potential conflicts between competing land uses, trade-offs associated with particular land change trajectories, and the effectiveness of policies to steer land systems into desirable states. Most model-based explorations and scenario studies focused on conversions in broad land use classes, but disregarded changes in land management or focused on individual sectors only. Using the European Union (EU) as a case study, we developed an approach to identifying typical combinations of land cover and management changes by combining the results of multimodel simulations in the agriculture and forest sectors for four scenarios from 2000 to 2040. We visualized land change trajectories by mapping regional hotspots of change. Land change trajectories differed in extent and spatial pattern across the EU and among scenarios, indicating trajectory-specific option spaces for alternative land system outcomes. In spite of the large variation in the area of change, similar hotspots of land change were observed among the scenarios. All scenarios indicate a stronger polarization of land use in Europe, with a loss of multifunctional landscapes. We analyzed locations subject to change by comparing location characteristics associated with certain land change trajectories. Results indicate differences in the location conditions of different land change trajectories, with diverging impacts on ecosystem service provisioning. Policy and planning for future land use needs to account for the spatial variation of land change trajectories to achieve both overarching and location-specific targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest industries 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3aEurope1 aLevers, Christian1 avan der Zanden, EmmaHenriëtta1 aSchulp, CatharinaJohanna Elizabeth1 aVerkerk, PieterJohannes1 aKuemmerle, Tobias1 aHelming, John1 aLotze-Campen, Hermann1 aTabeau, Andrzej1 aPopp, Alexander1 aSchrammeijer, Elizabeth1 aVerburg, Peter0 tRegional environmental change.g2018 Mar., v. 18, no. 3 p.733-749dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-015-0876-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003000144245013900174520179600313592002802109650002402137650002102161650002402182650002502206650001802231650001302249650002102262650001602283650001902299650001502318650001102333650002002344650002502364700002302389700002002412700003502432700001902467773012102486856007902607852000902686655001202695IND60757925020221116170236.0211125e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075792502DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101125502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsi, Saeed R.

Varieties during Flower Induction and Development  aThe present investigation was carried out to explore the biochemical changes and antioxidant variations, including non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant variations, in the leaves of different varieties of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) belonging to the early, mid-, and late-flowering categories in the United Arab Emirates. The changes in the protein and phenol concentration; the ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, and α-tocopherol contents; and the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase were studied in the leaves during the preflowering, flowering, and postflowering stages of the date palms. Two varieties each from the early (Shaham, Khanezi), mid- (Barhee, Nabthasaif), and late- (Khasab, Fardh) flowering types were used in this study. The protein content in the leaves was higher in the early flowering varieties during the preflowering stage but lower in the other two varieties. The phenol content showed an opposite trend to the protein. There was significant variation in the ascorbic acid content and a reduction in glutathione and α-tocopherol between the leaves of different varieties. Similarly, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme ascorbate peroxidase in the leaves was higher during the preflowering stage in all varieties. The superoxide dismutase (SOD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and catalase (CAT) activity was highest in the Bharhee leaves for all the stages. The peroxidase activity (POD) was highest in the Fardh variety of date palm, whereas the Khanezi variety exhibited the lowest activity. This study can be used as a baseline for developing more protocols for understanding the possible roles of biochemicals, antioxidants, antioxidant enzymes, and their interactions in the regulation of flower development in different date palm varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3aglutathione 3alate flowering 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3aprotein content 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aRabert, Gabriel A.1 aKurup, Shyam S.1 aAlyafei, Mohammed Abdul Muhsen1 aJaleel, Abdul 0 tPlants.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101125503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03787naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245016800169300001100337520203900348592002802387596004802415596009002463596009002553596009002643650002102733650001502754650001702769650001402786650002002800650001802820650003202838650001402870650002002884650003602904650001302940700001802953700001802971700002002989700006003009700005903069773010903128856008303237852000903320655001203329IND60782369820221118021148.0220728e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078236982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-022-03944-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPezeshki, Soheil14aThe first step into phenolic metabolism in the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis: molecular and biochemical characterization of two phenylalanine ammonia-lyase isoforms  ap. 33.  aMAIN CONCLUSION: Two isoforms of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) have been isolated as cDNA sequences from the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis. The encoded enzymes convert L-phenylalanine and to lower extents L-tyrosine and L-histidine. Thus, the functional presence of the general phenylpropanoid pathway in one of the earliest land plant groups is established. The hornwort Anthoceros agrestis has an elaborated phenolic metabolism resulting in phenolic compounds, such as rosmarinic acid or megacerotonic acid. The general phenylpropanoid pathway is involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds. Two phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) genes, AaPAL1 and AaPAL2, have been identified in Anthoceros agrestis and the protein with an N-terminal 6xHis-tag heterologously synthesized in Escherichia coli for a full biochemical characterization. Both PAL proteins accept L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine as well as L-histidine as substrates, although the activity is explicitly the highest with L-phenylalanine. Kₘ values as well as catalytic efficiencies were determined for phenylalanine (Kₘ AaPAL1 39 µM, AaPAL2 18 µM) and tyrosine (Kₘ AaPAL1 3.3 mM, AaPAL2 3.5 mM). In suspension cultures of Anthoceros agrestis, PAL genes were transcribed in parallel to rosmarinic acid (RA) accumulation and both showed highest abundance in the early growth phase. In a phylogenetic tree, both AaPAL amino acid sequences grouped within a clade with PAL amino acid sequences of diverse origin ranging from non-vascular to vascular plants, while most PALs from eudicots and monocots were mainly found in two other clades. The similarity of the hornwort PAL amino acid sequences to PAL sequences from vascular plants is more than 80% showing a strong conservation within the land plants. With this characterization of PALs from Anthoceros agrestis together with former investigations concerning cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase and 4-coumaric acid CoA-ligase, the functional presence of the general phenylpropanoid pathway in this hornwort is proven.  aPublisher supplied data  aPE360/37-1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  a160004cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  a131726cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  a184826cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung 3aEscherichia coli 3aLiliopsida 3abiosynthesis 3ahistidine 3ap-coumaric acid 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aphylogeny 3arosmarinic acid 3atrans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase 3atyrosine1 aWarmbier, Ina1 aBusch, Tobias1 aBauerbach, Elke1 aSzövenyi, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0324-46391 aPetersen, Maike1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7769-85560 tPlanta.g2022 Aug., v. 256, no. 2 p.33-33dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-022-03944-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245003400171300001600205500001900221520111300240592002801353650000801381650001501389650002601404650001301430650002301443650001001466650002001476650001401496650002401510650001301534650001201547650001301559653001801572653002401590653001701614653001601631700002401647773009201671856008301763990002301846852000901869655001201878IND60697459820221119191546.0200605e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069745982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarris, Reuben S.10aAPOBECs and virus restriction  ap. 131-145.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe APOBEC family of single-stranded DNA cytosine deaminases comprises a formidable arm of the vertebrate innate immune system. Pre-vertebrates express a single APOBEC, whereas some mammals produce as many as 11 enzymes. The APOBEC3 subfamily displays both copy number variation and polymorphisms, consistent with ongoing pathogenic pressures. These enzymes restrict the replication of many DNA-based parasites, such as exogenous viruses and endogenous transposable elements. APOBEC1 and activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) have specialized functions in RNA editing and antibody gene diversification, respectively, whereas APOBEC2 and APOBEC4 appear to have different functions. Nevertheless, the APOBEC family protects against both periodic viral zoonoses as well as exogenous and endogenous parasite replication. This review highlights viral pathogens that are restricted by APOBEC enzymes, but manage to escape through unique mechanisms. The sensitivity of viruses that lack counterdefense measures highlights the need to develop APOBEC-enabling small molecules as a new class of anti-viral drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aantibodies 3acopy number variation 3acytosine 3acytosine deaminase 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3aparasites 3asingle-stranded DNA 3avirology 3aviruses 3azoonoses 0aAPOBEC family 0aCytosine deaminases 0aRetroviruses 0aDNA viruses1 aDudley, Jaquelin P.0 tVirology.g2015 May, v. 479-480 p.131-145dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001700176245011300193300001500306520181800321592002802139650000802167650001502175650001302190650001202203650001802215650001202233650001502245650001902260650002002279650001402299650002302313650001702336650001402353650002302367650001302390650001902403650001202422650001302434650001402447650001602461650001402477650001902491650001102510650001202521650001802533700001202551700002202563700001402585700001902599773015302618856007002771856010602841990002302947852000902970655001202979IND60608453920221116142218.0190510e20160902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060845392DNAL7 a10.3791/543902doi7 aPMC50919802pmcid7 a276843252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Siauw H.10aLaboratory production of biofuels and biochemicals from a rapeseed oil through catalytic cracking conversion  ap. e54390.  aThe work is based on a reported study which investigates the processability of canola oil (bio-feed) in the presence of bitumen-derived heavy gas oil (HGO) for production of transportation fuels through a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) route. Cracking experiments are performed with a fully automated reaction unit at a fixed weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 8 hr-1, 490-530 °C, and catalyst/oil ratios of 4-12 g/g. When a feed is in contact with catalyst in the fluid-bed reactor, cracking takes place generating gaseous, liquid, and solid products. The vapor produced is condensed and collected in a liquid receiver at -15 °C. The non-condensable effluent is first directed to a vessel and is sent, after homogenization, to an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) for refinery gas analysis. The coke deposited on the catalyst is determined in situ by burning the spent catalyst in air at high temperatures. Levels of CO2 are measured quantitatively via an infrared (IR) cell, and are converted to coke yield. Liquid samples in the receivers are analyzed by GC for simulated distillation to determine the amounts in different boiling ranges, i.e., IBP-221 °C (gasoline), 221-343 °C (light cycle oil), and 343 °C+ (heavy cycle oil). Cracking of a feed containing canola oil generates water, which appears at the bottom of a liquid receiver and on its inner wall. Recovery of water on the wall is achieved through washing with methanol followed by Karl Fischer titration for water content. Basic results reported include conversion (the portion of the feed converted to gas and liquid product with a boiling point below 221 °C, coke, and water, if present) and yields of dry gas (H2-C2's, CO, and CO2), liquefied petroleum gas (C3-C4), gasoline, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil, coke, and water, if present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aautomation 3abiofuels 3aboiling 3aboiling point 3aburning 3acanola oil 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic cracking 3adistillation 3afuel oils 3agas chromatography 3agasoline 3ahomogenization 3aliquids 3amethanol 3apetroleum 3atemperature 3atitration 3atransportation 3avapors 3awashing 3awater content1 aShi, Yu1 aHeshka, Nicole E.1 aZhang, Yi1 aLittle, Edward0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Sept. 02, , no. 115 p.e54390-e54390dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/543903Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54390/laboratory-production-biofuels-biochemicals-from-rapeseed-oil-through  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007000150245012000220300001400340520063000354592002800984650001501012650003101027650001701058650003201075650001601107650000901123650001701132650001301149650001701162700002601179700006401205700006201269700006401331700002701395700002301422700006401445773016901509856008401678852000901762655001201771IND60682113620221120121607.0200124e20191224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068211362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b003072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChokchaisiri, Ratchanaporn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4362-005010aIsopimarane Diterpenoids from the Rhizomes of Kaempferia marginata and Their Potential Anti-inflammatory Activities  ap. 14-19.  aSix new isopimarane diterpenes, marginaols A–F (1–6), along with eight known compounds (7–14), were isolated from the rhizomes of Kaempferia marginata.

Among them, marginaol B (2) was found to reduce NO levels in murine macrophage cells with an IC₅₀ value of 28.1 ± 1.7 μM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKaempferia 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aditerpenoids 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amacrophages 3amice 3anitric oxide 3arhizomes 3aspectroscopy1 aChaichompoo, Waraluck1 aChunglok, Warangkana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8000-60521 aCheenpracha, Sarot1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4333-10591 aGanranoo, Lucksagoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4561-85041 aPhutthawong, Nathaporn1 aBureekaew, Sareeya1 aSuksamrarn, Apichart1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8919-35550 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Dec. 24, v. 83, no. 1 p.14-19dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b003073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009900175520097900274592002801253650002501281650001301306650001601319650001701335650001101352650001701363653002001380653002601400653002401426653002501450653002701475700002401502700002101526700003101547773009801578856008701676852000901763655001201772IND60704793720221121122914.0220531e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070479372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1153662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlaucke, Franziska10aImpact of the chlorine value chain on the demand response potential of the chloralkali process  aRenewable sources of energy supply an increasing share to the electricity mix although they show much more fluctuations than conventional energy sources. Hence, net stability and availability represent very large challenges. Demand response can positively contribute to the solution of this issue as large electricity consumers adapt their consumption to the available electricity. In the past, chloralkali electrolysis has been suggested as such a large consumer. Unfortunately, its main product, chlorine, cannot be easily stored in large amounts, so that downstream processes have to operate based on a fluctuating feed. This work reviews the processes within the chlorine value chain, determines the most promising ones for flexibilisation based on their chlorine consumption, and analyses these processes in more detail to assign them to one of four flexibility categories. It is shown that 45% of the theoretical potential could be used for demand response right away.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlor-alkali process 3achlorine 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3asupply chain 0aDemand response 0aFlexibility potential 0aChloralkali process 0aChlorine value chain 0aDemand side management1 aHoffmann, Christian1 aHofmann, Mathias1 aTsatsaronis, G.q(George),0 tApplied energy.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 276 p.115366-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1153663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245013700213500001900350520183500369592002802204650002302232650000802255650001602263650001702279650001402296650001502310650001402325650001302339650001602352650002502368653001302393653001102406653001702417700006402434700005202498700005602550700006202606700002202668700002902690700002202719700001702741700002402758773011002782856008502892852000902977655001202986IND60722778720221117174539.0210212e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072277872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1163262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández, Daniel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0012-209410aAre environmental pollution and biodiversity levels associated to the spread and mortality of COVID-19? A four-month global analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOn March 12th, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The collective impact of environmental and ecosystem factors, as well as biodiversity, on the spread of COVID-19 and its mortality evolution remain empirically unknown, particularly in regions with a wide ecosystem range. The aim of our study is to assess how those factors impact on the COVID-19 spread and mortality by country. This study compiled a global database merging WHO daily case reports with other publicly available measures from January 21st to May 18th, 2020. We applied spatio-temporal models to identify the influence of biodiversity, temperature, and precipitation and fitted generalized linear mixed models to identify the effects of environmental variables. Additionally, we used count time series to characterize the association between COVID-19 spread and air quality factors. All analyses were adjusted by social demographic, country-income level, and government policy intervention confounders, among 160 countries, globally. Our results reveal a statistically meaningful association between COVID-19 infection and several factors of interest at country and city levels such as the national biodiversity index, air quality, and pollutants elements (PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and O₃). Particularly, there is a significant relationship of loss of biodiversity, high level of air pollutants, and diminished air quality with COVID-19 infection spread and mortality. Our findings provide an empirical foundation for future studies on the relationship between air quality variables, a country’s biodiversity, and COVID-19 transmission and mortality. The relationships measured in this study can be valuable when governments plan environmental and health policies, as alternative strategy to respond to new COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent future crises.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aair 3aair quality 3abiodiversity 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3amortality 3apandemic 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 0aCOVID-19 0aGlobal 0aTransmission1 aGiné-Vázquez, Iago1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6725-26381 aLiu, Ivy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3152-26321 aYucel, Recai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8655-544X1 aNai Ruscone, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7416-644X1 aMorena, Marianthi1 aGarcía, Víctor Gerardo1 aHaro, Josep Maria1 aPan, William1 aTyrovolas, Stefanos0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 271 p.116326-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1163263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013500164300001800299520171000317592002802027650002202055650001202077650001402089650001202103650001502115650001802130650003602148650001002184650002402194650001002218650001302228651002602241700001402267700001602281700001802297700001702315700001602332700001802348773011302366856004802479852000902527655001202536IND50060872020221119044313.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006087202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-012-9803-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKombo, G. R.10aDiversity of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) cultivars and its management in the department of Bouenza in the Republic of Congo  ap. 1789-1803.  aCassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is one of the most produced and consumed food crops in the Republic of Congo. To assess the diversity and understand the traditional management of its cultivars in the department of Bouenza, twenty-one villages randomly selected from nine ethnic zones were surveyed using participatory rural appraisal. Altogether, 86 land races cultivars were recorded and further grouped into 36 types based on their agronomic and culinary characteristics. The number of cultivars accessed varied from 6 to 21 per village (13 on average) and from 1 to 11 (4 on average) per household. Their distribution and extent analysis revealed some worrying rates of cultivar loss in the range of 7.41–66.67% (32.06% on average) per village. The reasons of cultivars abandonment, the folk nomenclature and the traditional cutting supply system and planting techniques were documented and their importance in terms of genetic resources conservation and utilisation are discussed. Twenty farmers’ cultivar preference criteria were identified and prioritised. Their relative importances were examined across ethnic groups. Among them, the most important were yield, taste, cossette quality and root size which account for 72.39% of the total responses. The study revealed that most of the farmers did not consider the importance of the sexual reproduction in the cultivar diversification and the impact of cassava mosaic disease on the productivity of the infested plants. Awareness efforts and extension of the study to other cassava production zones were recommended for food security needs in Congo. To clarify synonym, morphological classification and molecular analysis were also suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManihot esculenta 3acassava 3acultivars 3afarmers 3afood crops 3afood security 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3araces 3asexual reproduction 3ataste 3avillages 3aRepublic of the Congo1 aDansi, A.1 aLoko, L.

The morphology of actinosporean stages of myxosporeans obtained from oligochaetes was studied, and their 18S rDNA structure was analyzed by molecular biological methods. Three triactinomyxon types were released from the oligochaete Isochaetides michaelseni (Tubificidae). The sequences of Triactinomyxon type 1 proved to be identical with those of Myxobolus fundamentalis. The sequences of Triactinomyxon type 2 showed 99.9 % similarity to Myxobolus eryhtrophthalmi, while the sequences of Triactinomyxon type 3 showed a 99.9 % similarity to those of Myxobolus shaharomae. The life cycles of the above species, just like those of other species with a known life cycle, suggest that most Myxobolus spp. develop through triactinomyxon-type actinosporean stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxobolus 3aTubificidae 3afauna 3afish 3alakes 3aribosomal DNA 2aAnimals 2aCyprinidaexparasitology 2aLakes 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aMyxobolusxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aOligochaetaxparasitology 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 3aHungary 0aHungary1 aBorkhanuddin, Muhammad Hafiz1 aCech, Gábor1 aKelemen, Olga1 aMolnár, Kálmán,0 tParasitology research.g2014 Aug., v. 113, no. 8 p.2817-2825dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-3942-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007400140245012900214500001900343500002000362520163800382592002802020596006202048650002502110650001602135650000902151650001402160650001802174650001602192650002302208650003202231650001202263650001902275650001302294650001002307650001502317700006702332700003302399700007602432700006602508700003702574700006202611700006202673773014302735856007402878852000902952655001202961IND60725488720221118194941.0210126e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072548872DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.150512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Thamirys Lorranne Santos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8296-154710aPre‐emulsioned linseed oil as animal fat replacement in sheep meat sausages: Microstructure and physicochemical properties  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this research was to investigate the inclusion of pre‐emulsified linseed oil as animal fat replacement on physicochemical properties and microstructure of sheep sausage. Control (0%) and formulations with 10, 20, 30, and 40% pre‐emulsified linseed oil were elaborated. Chemical composition was affected by the partial replacement of animal fat by linseed oil, since the sausages prepared with 40% linseed oil showed the highest protein and ash content. In addition, these sausages presented the highest a* and b* values, WHC, and emulsion stability. As the levels of linseed oil increased, there was also an increase in shear force and lipid oxidation of cooked sausages. On the contrary, as the oil concentrations increased, the morphology has become more compact, indicating a good interaction of the oil emulsion with the other components. Thus, it is suggested the development of sheep meat sausages with 40% linseed oil to replace animal fat. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Consumers are becoming more and more aware of the link between diet and health. In this regard, reformulated meat products constitute an excellent opportunity for the meat industry, to improve the quality and image of meat and put in the market a product with health beneficial properties. Therefore, the use of pre‐emulsified linseed oil as animal fat replacer is a viable strategy, which allows to increase the competitiveness of the sector and meet the demands of consumers. With this in mind, the present study clearly and coherently explains the application of this oil in a highly consumed product (sausage) as well as its benefits.  aPublisher supplied data  a119RT0568cCYTED Ciencia y Tecnología para el Desarrollo 3aanimal fats and oils 3aash content 3adiet 3aemulsions 3afat replacers 3alinseed oil 3alipid peroxidation 3alivestock and meat industry 3amarkets 3amicrostructure 3asausages 3asheep 3asheep meat1 ada Costa, Gilmar Freire1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0525-20581 ada Silva Araújo, Íris Braz1 ada Cruz, George Rodrigo Beltrão1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8480-46251 aRibeiro, Neila Lidiany1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6410-244X1 aFilho, Edvaldo Mesquita Beltrão1 aDomínguez, Rubén1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2764-504X1 aLorenzo, José M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7725-92940 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e15051-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.150513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011400166300001600280520099900296592002801295650004401323650002101367650001701388650001801405650001601423650002101439650002501460650001601485653001301501653002001514653002801534653001301562653002401575700001401599700001201613700001701625700001401642700001601656773010701672856008601779852000901865655001201874IND60540771720221121090112.0190318e20140525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054077172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.01.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chang10aSynthesis of poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate) hydrogel using starch-based nanosphere cross-linkers  ap. 270-275.  aBiodegradable thermosensitive hydrogels have attracted great interest because of their potential in biomedical applications. Herein, we present a novel, thermoresponsive poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate) hydrogels with starch-based nanospheres as cross-linkers (NMH). NMHs exhibit a narrow lower critical phase transition temperature (LCST) range and high mechanical strength compared with conventional, small molecular cross-linked hydrogels (CMH). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy confirms that the NMHs are degradable in aqueous medium. The phase transition temperature of the NMHs is ∼4°C compared with ∼25°C for CMH. The NMHs can sustain strength of 12.2MPa, 10 times more than that of CMH. Moreover, the deswelling rate of NMHs is faster than CMH. The different concentrations of nanospheres can efficiently regulate the various properties of NMHs. The NMHs have excellent properties because of its even network structure formed by nanosphere cross-linkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodegradability 3acrosslinking 3ahydrocolloids 3ananospheres 3aphase transition 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature 0aHydrogel 0aThermosensitive 0aStarch-based nanosphere 0aLCST gap 0aMechanical strength1 aTan, Ying1 aXu, Kun1 aLi, Yangling1 aLu, Cuige1 aWang, Pixin0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 May 25, v. 105 p.270-275dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.01.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245009500176300001800271500002000289500001500309520190600324592002802230650002402258650002302282650001502305650003302320650001202353650001802365650002102383650002202404650000902426650001602435650001102451650000902462650003302471650001602504650001702520651001102537653001902548653002302567700001602590700001802606700001902624700002102643773009902664852000902763856007302772655001202845IND4402418220221121002454.0170626e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440241822DNAL7 a179184142pmid7 a10.1890/06-2000.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParejo, Deseada10aBlue tits use fledgling quantity and quality as public information in breeding site choice  ap. 2373-2382.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aPublic information (PI), which is the information that can be derived from the behavior and performance of conspecifics, has been demonstrated to be used in many fitness‐enhancing decisions. In the context of breeding habitat choice, PI use has been called “habitat copying.” We experimentally tested the existence of habitat copying in the Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), a nonmigratory, short‐lived hole‐nesting bird. We manipulated the mean number of fledglings raised locally (quantity) and their condition (quality) as components of PI by transferring nestlings from Decreased (D) patches to Increased (I) patches. Our manipulations caused a negative relationship between fledgling quantity and quality that does not exist naturally: I patches had a higher number of fledglings that were in poorer condition, whereas D patches had a lower number in better condition. Control (C) patches, whether manipulated or not, had intermediate levels in terms of fledgling quantity and quality. Adult emigration the following year was higher from D than from C or I patches. Similarly, adult dispersal distance decreased for individuals coming from D to C to I patches. This suggests that resident breeders rely mainly on fledgling quantity to make emigration decisions. Emigration patterns of juveniles did not vary in relation to our patch manipulation. Immigration rates were higher and similar in I and D patches than in C patches. Hence, immigrant Blue Tits seem to rely on one of the manipulated components of PI and are insensitive to the discrepancy between fledgling quantity and quality. This shows that even nonmigratory species, such as Blue Tits, may use PI in their dispersal decisions but weigh its components differently for emigration and immigration. Differences among species in the importance of PI in breeding habitat choices may be explained by differences in life histories.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitat preferences 3amigratory behavior 3awild birds 2aAnimal Migrationxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wild 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBirdsxphysiology 2aCues 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNesting Behaviorxphysiology 2aProbability 2aReproduction 3aFrance 0aanimal ecology 0amigration behavior1 aWhite, Joel1 aClobert, Jean1 aDreiss, Amelie1 aDanchin, Etienne0 tEcology.g2007 Sept., v. 88, no. 9 p.2373-2382dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-2000.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02764naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245014000194300001500334520113100349592002801480650001801508650002601526650001501552650001101567650001801578650001501596650000901611650001101620650001401631650001301645650001501658700002601673700001901699700001801718700003201736700002101768700001601789700002001805700002201825700002101847700001901868773015301887856007002040856010402110990002302214852000902237655001202246IND60608454120221116142319.0190510e20160930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060845412DNAL7 a10.3791/543932doi7 aPMC50921812pmcid7 a277680282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagby, Stacey10aDevelopment and maintenance of a preclinical patient derived tumor xenograft model for the investigation of novel anti-cancer therapies  ap. e54393.  aPatient derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models provide a necessary platform in facilitating anti-cancer drug development prior to human trials. Human tumor pieces are injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice (immunocompromised, T cell deficient) to create a bank of tumors and subsequently are passaged into different generations of mice in order to maintain these tumors from patients. Importantly, cellular heterogeneity of the original tumor is closely emulated in this model, which provides a more clinically relevant model for evaluation of drug efficacy studies (single agent and combination), biomarker analysis, resistant pathways and cancer stem cell biology. Some limitations of the PDTX model include the replacement of the human stroma with mouse stroma after the first generation in mice, inability to investigate treatment effects on metastasis due to the subcutaneous injections of the tumors, and the lack of evaluation of immunotherapies due to the use of immunocompromised mice. However, even with these limitations, the PDTX model provides a powerful preclinical platform in the drug discovery process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiomarkers 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3ametastasis 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3astem cells1 aMessersmith, Wells A.1 aPitts, Todd M.1 aCapasso, Anna1 aVarella-­Garcia, Marileila1 aKlauck, Peter J.1 aKim, JiHye,1 aTan, Aik Choon,1 aEckhardt, S.

The plants are designed as polygeneration systems able to produce high-pressure hydrogen, heat, and electricity for self-sustaining the energy consumption for purification, compression, and storage of the produced hydrogen. In this sense, these plants are proposed as on-site hydrogen production plants for the development of novel refueling stations.The two proposed plants differ for the hydrogen production process: i) a biogas-to-hydrogen plant through steam reforming, ii) a biogas-to-hydrogen plant through autothermal reforming.The results of the study have highlighted that the steam reforming-based configuration allows for achieving the best performance in terms of hydrogen production energy-based efficiency (59.8%) and hydrogen production exergy-based efficiency (59.4%). Moreover, the steam reforming-based configuration represents the best solution also considering the co-production of heat and hydrogen (energy-based efficiency 73.5% and exergy-based efficiency 64.4%), while the ATR-based layout, globally more exothermic, can be adopted when a larger local heat demand exists (energy-based efficiency 73.9% and exergy-based efficiency 54.8%).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3aelectricity 3aexergy 3aheat production 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3asteam 0aGreen hydrogen 0aSOFC 0aReforming 0aExergy analysis 0aRefueling stations1 aPerna, Alessandra1 aSorce, Alessandro0 tApplied energy.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 277 p.115452-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1154523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006200169300001600231520110100247592002801348650003301376650001801409650001701427650001601444650001601460650002601476650001701502650001101519653001501530653002201545653001501567653000801582653002301590653002701613653001501640653002001655700002901675700002201704773009201726856008301818990002301901852000901924655001201933IND60697460520221122005841.0200605e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069746052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonvalinka, Jan10aRetroviral proteases and their roles in virion maturation  ap. 403-417.  aProteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is essential for retrovirus infectivity. Retroviral proteases (PR) become activated during or after assembly of the immature, non-infectious virion. They cleave viral polyproteins at specific sites, inducing major structural rearrangements termed maturation. Maturation converts retroviral enzymes into their functional form, transforms the immature shell into a metastable state primed for early replication events, and enhances viral entry competence. Not only cleavage at all PR recognition sites, but also an ordered sequence of cleavages is crucial. Proteolysis is tightly regulated, but the triggering mechanisms and kinetics and pathway of morphological transitions remain enigmatic.Here, we outline PR structures and substrate specificities focusing on HIV PR as a therapeutic target. We discuss design and clinical success of HIV PR inhibitors, as well as resistance development towards these drugs. Finally, we summarize data elucidating the role of proteolysis in maturation and highlight unsolved questions regarding retroviral maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3apathogenicity 3apolyproteins 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3asubstrate specificity 3atherapeutics 3avirion 0aRetrovirus 0aAspartic protease 0aMaturation 0aGag 0aProtease inhibitor 0aAntiretroviral therapy 0aResistance 0aVirus structure1 aKräusslich, Hans-Georg,1 aMüller, Barbara,0 tVirology.g2015 May, v. 479-480 p.403-417dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008200169520116300251592002801414650001501442650001201457650001401469650001201483650001001495650002001505650001401525650002101539700001701560700001901577700002101596773010301617856008501720852000901805655001201814IND60680487320221121145859.0200712e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068048732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2019.1040132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoudry, Olivia10aMale rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) prefer larger conspecific females  aFemale mate choice is a well studied mechanism of sexual selection that can affect the evolution of male secondary sexual traits. However, males also exhibit selective mate choice in some animals, which can affect the evolution of female phenotypes. We tested for evidence of intraspecific male mate choice in the Rainbow Darter (Percidae: Etheostoma caeruleum). Males of numerous darter species have been shown to prefer conspecific over heterospecific females; however, intraspecific preferences in males have not yet been demonstrated in this genus. This study investigated male preference for indicators of female fecundity, specifically female size. We found that male Rainbow Darters prefer larger females, both in dichotomous choice tests, when access between individuals was prevented, and in unrestricted behavioral tests with full access to females. Notably, however, the dichotomous trials were not repeatable; males only displayed a significant preference for larger females in the first dichotomous trial and in the unrestricted trial. We discuss our results in light of experimental methods and the role of male mate choice in sexual selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEtheostoma 3aanimals 3afecundity 3afemales 3amales 3amating behavior 3aphenotype 3asexual selection1 aKaira, Hatib1 aParsa, Shabnam1 aMendelson, Tamra0 tBehavioural processes.g2020 Jan., v. 170 p.104013-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.1040133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011600167300001600283520115000299592002801449650001201477650001201489650001901501650002301520650001401543650001201557650001901569650001201588650002101600650001401621650001301635650001801648653001201666653002501678653001701703653003201720653001001752653001801762700001301780700001701793700001701810700001501827700001401842773010701856856008601963852000902049655001202058IND60540771920221120023513.0190318e20140525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054077192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.01.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yunlong10aPurification, characterization and promoting effect on wound healing of an exopolysaccharide from Lachnum YM405  ap. 169-176.  aAn exopolysaccharide (LEP-2b) with molecular weight of 2.8×104Da was isolated from Lachnum YM405 and purified by DEAE-cellulose 52, Sepharose CL-6B chromatographic column. It consisted of rhamnose (Rha), mannose (Man), glucose (Glc) and galactose (Gal) in a molar ratio of 1.0:5.0:11.5:12.5. Its backbone consisted of →4)-β-d-Manp-(1→, →2)-α-d-Rhap-(1→, →6)-β-d-Glcp-(1→, and →6)-α-d-Galp-(1→, and three types of branches were composed of →6)-α-d-1-OMe-Manf-(2→, →6)-β-d-1-OMe-Manf-(2→, →1)-α-d-Galp-(6→, →1)-β-d-Galp-(6→, and →1)-β-d-Glcp, which were at O-3 of 1,3,6-linked α-d-Manp and O-2, O-3 of the same 1,2,3,6-linked β-d-Glcp in the backbone respectively. LEP-2b ointment significantly accelerated the decrustation of the wounded skin, shortened the healing time and increased the water and hydroxyproline contents of the healed skin. Combined with the results of macroscopic and histological observations, we deemed that LEP-2b could inhibit inflammatory reaction of scalded skin, accelerate tissue repair and re-epithelialization, thereby playing a positive role in promoting wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLachnum 3aagarose 3achromatography 3aexopolysaccharides 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ahydroxyproline 3amannose 3amolecular weight 3aointments 3arhamnose 3atissue repair 0aLachnum 0aHeteropolysaccharide 0aPurification 0aStructural characterization 0aScald 0aWound healing1 aYe, Ming1 aDu, Zhanzhan1 aWang, Huiyan1 aWu, Yenna,1 aYang, Liu0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 May 25, v. 105 p.169-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.01.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017800167300001400345520140900359592002801768650001701796650002001813650001601833650004301849650002901892650000701921650001601928650001301944650002501957650002801982653004302010653002802053653002502081653001702106653005302123700002302176700002802199700002202227700003002249700003002279773009102309856008502400852000902485655001202494IND60599428220221118103413.0180702e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059942822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGure, Abera10aSalting-out assisted liquid–liquid extraction combined with capillary HPLC for the determination of sulfonylurea herbicides in environmental water and banana juice samples  ap. 51-58.  aA salting-out assisted liquid–liquid extraction (SALLE) combined with capillary high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (capillary HPLC-DAD) was proposed for extraction and determination of residues of nine sulfonylurea herbicides (SUHs) in environmental water and banana juice samples.

Good linear relationships as well as low limits of detection, LODs (0.4–1.3 and 3–13µg/L) and quantification, LOQs (1.3–4.3 and 10–43µg/L) were obtained in water and banana juice samples, respectively. The precision (intra- and inter-day) of the peak areas expressed as relative standard deviations (%, RSD), at two concentration levels were below 10 % in both matrices. Recoveries obtained from spiked environmental waters (river water and groundwater) and banana juice samples, at two concentration levels, ranged from 72 to 115%. The results of the analysis revealed that the proposed SALLE-capillary HPLC method is simple, rapid, cheap and environmentally friendly, being successfully applicable for the determination of SUH residues in waters and banana juices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abanana juice 3adetection limit 3agroundwater 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3apH 3ariver water 3asolvents 3astatistical analysis 3asulfonylurea herbicides 0aSalting-out liquid–liquid extraction 0aSulfonylurea herbicides 0aEnvironmental waters 0aBanana juice 0aCapillary high performance liquid chromatography1 aLara, Francisco J.1 aMoreno-González, David1 aMegersa, Negussie1 adel Olmo-Iruela, Monsalud1 aGarcía-Campaña, Ana M.,0 tTalanta.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 127 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245005100198300001500249520098800264592002801252650001501280650002401295650001901319650001701338700002601355700002401381773015201405856007001557856008301627990002301710852000901733655001201742IND60608454220221116142302.0190510e20170429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060845422DNAL7 a10.3791/543942doi7 aPMC55651222pmcid7 a285180702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarthy, Ryan L.10aSample preparation for mass cytometry analysis  ap. e54394.  aMass cytometry utilizes antibodies conjugated with heavy metal labels, an approach that has greatly increased the number of parameters and opportunities for deep analysis well beyond what is possible with conventional fluorescence-based flow cytometry.

The sensitivity and specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were compared examining 177 sera from patients with different clinical courses and outcome of CE and with other parasitic infections. AgB-ELISA in comparison to confirmed cystic echinococcosis has 96.4 % sensitivity and 97.2 % specificity, with 93.1 % positive predictive value and 98.6 % negative predictive value. The HF-ELISA was more sensitive than the AgB-ELISA, but its specificity was lower. Our results indicate that AgB-ELISA was more satisfactory for seroconfirmation of acute echinococcosis than HF-ELISA. Moreover, the AgB-ELISA has a potential key role in control measures implemented in patients undergoing surgery. In sera of patients more than 3 months after the treatment, no antibody response to antigen B was detected; however, with conventionally used HF-ELISA, they were still positive. The AgB is recommended for the confirmatory diagnosis. AgB-WB allocated low background with typical “triplet” bands at 8-12-16 kDa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aantigens 3acontrol methods 3aechinococcosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3apatients 3aserodiagnosis 3asurgery 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Helminthxblood 2aAntigens, Helminthxdiagnostic use. 2aBlotting, Western 2aEchinococcosisxdiagnosis 2aEchinococcus multilocularis 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aHumans 2aImmunologic Tests 2aLipoproteinsxdiagnostic use. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSerologic Testsxmethods1 aAuer, Herbert1 aAltintaś, Nazmiye1 aYolasigmaz, Aysegul0 tParasitology research.g2014 Aug., v. 113, no. 8 p.2861-2867dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-3947-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01468naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002900136245011100165300001600276520036900292592002800661653001400689653001300703653002400716653002600740653002200766653002900788653002100817653001900838653002600857653001100883700002100894773012200915856007201037852000901109655001201118IND60126072820221118002302.0151105e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012607282DNAL7 a10.1654/4246.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYildirimhan, Hikmet Sami10aHelminth Parasites of the Common Toad, Bufo bufo (Linnaeus, 1758) (Anura: Bufonidae) from Northeast Turkey  ap. 176-178.  aThe common toad, Bufo bufo, from Trabzon Province, Turkey, was found to harbor 5 species of Nematoda: Aplectana acuminata, Aplectana macintoshii, Cosmocerca ornata, Oswaldocruzia filiformis, and Rhabdias bufonis, and 1 species of Acanthocephala, Acanthocephalus ranae.

Involvement of laminin-332 in the pathogenesis of cancer has also been reported. I present a theory that can explain these characteristics together. Proliferating keratinocytes in wound healing produce and deposit laminin-332, which is shown in the provisional basement membrane of a wound. In association with wound closure, expression of LG4/5 domain on the α3 chain of laminin-332 disappears, implicating cleavage of LG4/5 domain. LG4/5 domain expression indicates that laminin-332 prior to the cleavage is bound to the cell membrane, because LG4/5 domain is a cell binding site. In this binding, heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the cell surface seems to be the acceptor for LG4/5 domain. I named this laminin “cell membrane–bound laminin-332” (ML332). ML332 would then bind to integrin α3β1 via LG1-3 domain, the integrin binding site, and activate FAK and the following Ras/MAPK pathway. Therefore, ML332 eliminates the need for proliferating keratinocytes to bind to processed laminin-332 secreted and deposited into the basement membrane for their proliferation (anchorage-independency). This may hold true of every proliferating epithelial cell, either benign or malignant. Whereas wound closure deprives keratinocytes of anchorage-independency, such events do not occur in cancer cells, and cancer cells maintain anchorage-independency. In the basement membrane formation by epithelial cells, short arms of laminin-332 anchored to the cell membrane bind each other and generate a meshwork polymer. This is the three-arm interaction model. In a similar manner, short-arm interactions between adjacent cancer cells may occur and induce tumor formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasement membrane 3abinding sites 3acell membranes 3aepithelial cells 3aheparan sulfate 3aintegrins 3akeratinocytes 3alaminin 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3apolymers 3aproteoglycans 3atissue repair0 tCell and tissue research.g2020 Feb., v. 379, no. 2 p.255-259dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-019-03114-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245018000159300001200339520063800351592002800989653001201017653002101029653001801050653002801068653002901096653002301125653001401148653001101162653001001173700002201183773011801205856007201323852000901395655001201404IND60126073020221118002517.0151105e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012607302DNAL7 a10.1654/4251.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaukisalmi, Voitto10aParanoplocephala sciuri (Rausch, 1947) (Cestoda: Anoplocephalidae), a Parasite of the Northern Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), with a Discussion of Its Systematic Status  ap. 1-8.  aThis study redescribes Andrya sciuri Rausch, 1947 (Anoplocephalidae) from the northern flying squirrel, Glaucomys sabrinus (Shaw), in North America, to redefine the morphology and generic position of this poorly known cestode.

To improve the in situ properties of these, chemical soil stabilisers (e.g. cement or lime) can be commonly used. Although successful in minimising severe damage, these stabilisers may have environmental side-effects (e.g. cement and lime production is linked to 7%–8% of overall CO₂ emissions). Therefore, the development of innovative, superior, cost-effective and overall more sustainable soil improvement techniques is a field of ongoing research effort. In this context, this paper studies the electrokinetic (EK) biocementation of a problematic soft organic soil of the UK railway network using indigenous ureolytic bacteria. The paper focuses on aspects relevant for the effective implementation of treatments, namely the effect of degree of saturation of the soil and different ways of treatment implementation. The results in terms of unconfined compressive strength and CaCO₃ content, proved the feasibility of EK biocementation using an indigenous microorganism, either premixed with the soil or injected electrokinetically. Higher strength gains were recorded for degrees of saturation in the region of 85%–95%. Strength gains and increased CaCO₃ contents compared to the control samples were also noted when treatment duration was halved to one week although strengths increased further by 13–17% after a two-week treatment. Overall, the study gives promise for the applicability of the EK-biocementation technique under existing infrastructure. Further optimisation of the treatment variables and refinement of the implementation details could enhance the efficiency of the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3acompression strength 3acost effectiveness 3agreen chemistry 3arailroads 0aBiocemementation 0aElectrokinetics 0aGround improvement 0aOrganic soil1 aMavroulidou, M.1 aGunn, M.J.1 aPurchase, D.1 aPayne, I.1 aGarelick, J.0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2021 June, v. 21 p.100405-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2021.1004053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245012300178300001600301520171800317592002802035653002202063653002002085653002002105653002502125653001802150653002602168700002102194700002302215700001902238773016702257856008202424852000902506655001202515IND60517063220221121060142.0190728e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051706322DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154130019142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZapata-Hernández, Germán10aTrophic structure of the bathyal benthos at an area with evidence of methane seep activity off southern Chile (~45°S)  ap. 659-669.  aThrough application of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope analyses, we investigated the benthic trophic structure of the upper-slope off southern Chile (~45°S) including a recent methane seep area discovered as part of this study. The observed fauna comprised 53 invertebrates and seven fish taxa, including remains of chemosymbiotic fauna (e.g. chemosymbiotic bivalves and siboglinid polychaetes), which are typical of methane seep environments. While in close-proximity to a seep, the heterotrophic fauna had a nutrition derived predominantly from photosynthetic sources (δ¹³C > –21‰). The absence of chemosynthesis-based nutrition in the consumers was likely a result of using an Agassiz trawl to sample the benthos, a method that is likely to collect a mix of fauna including individuals from adjacent non-seep bathyal environments. While four trophic levels were estimated for invertebrates, the fish assemblage was positioned within the third trophic level of the food web. Differences in corrected standard ellipse area (SEAC), which is a proxy of the isotopic niche width, yielded differences for the demersal fish Notophycis marginata (SEAC = 5.1‰) and Coelorinchus fasciatus (SEAC = 1.1‰), suggesting distinct trophic behaviours. No ontogenic changes were detected in C. fasciatus regarding food sources and trophic position. The present study contributes the first basic trophic data for the bathyal area off southern Chile, including the identification of a new methane seep area, among the furthest south ever discovered. Such information provides the basis for the proper sustainable management of the benthic environments present along the vast Chilean continental margin.  aPublisher supplied data 0abathyal megafauna 0astable isotopes 0atrophic ecology 0aisotopic niche width 0amethane seeps 0aChile Triple Junction1 aSellanes, Javier1 aThurber, Andrew R.1 aLevin, Lisa A.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 June, v. 94, no. 4 p.659-669dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154130019143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009100167300001600258520221500274592002802489650002202517650001602539650001202555650003902567650001602606650001202622650001302634650003102647650001602678650002502694650001302719650001302732650001802745650001202763653001802775653001302793653002802806653001102834653001302845653001002858653001002868700001302878700001602891700001302907700001502920773010802935856008603043852000903129655001203138IND60540772220221120035229.0190318e20150213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054077222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.01.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarquis, M.10aMicrofluidics assisted generation of innovative polysaccharide hydrogel microparticles  ap. 189-199.  aCapillary flow-based approach such as microfluidic devices offer a number of advantages over conventional flow control technology because they ensure highly versatile geometry and can be used to produce monodisperse spherical and non-spherical polymeric microparticles. Based on the principle of a flow-focusing device to emulsify the coflow of aqueous solutions in an organic phase, we were able to produce the following innovative polysaccharide hydrogel microparticles:-Janus hydrogel microparticles made of pectin–pectin (homo Janus) and pectin–alginate (hetero Janus) were produced. The efficiency of separation of the two hemispheres was investigated by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) of previously labelled biopolymers. The Janus structure was confirmed by subjecting each microparticle hemisphere to specific enzymatic degradation. As a proof of concept, free BSA or BSA grafted with dextran, were encapsulated in each hemisphere of the hetero Janus hydrogel microparticles. While BSA, free or grafted with dextran, was always confined in the alginate hemisphere, a fraction of BSA diffused from the pectin to the alginate hemisphere. Methoxy groups along the pectin chain will be responsible of the decrease of the number of attractive electrostatic interactions occurring between amino groups of BSA and carboxylic groups of pectin.-Pectin hydrogel microparticles of complex shapes were successfully produced by combining on-chip the phenomenon of gelation and water diffusion induced self-assembly, using dimethyl carbonate as continuous phase, or by deformation of the pre-gelled droplets off-chip at a fluid–fluid interface. Sphere, oblate ellipsoid, torus or mushroom-type morphologies were thus obtained. Moreover, it was established that after crossing the interface during their collect, mushroom-type microparticles did not migrate in the calcium or DMC phase but stayed at the liquid–liquid interface.These new and original hydrogel microparticles will open up opportunities for studying relationships between combined enzymatic hydrolysis and active release for Janus particles and relationships between shape and swelling behaviour for anisotropic pectin microparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiopolymers 3acalcium 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adeformation 3adextran 3adroplets 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemulsifying 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agelation 3ageometry 3ahydrocolloids 3apectins 0aMicrofluidics 0aDroplets 0aDiffusion self-assembly 0aPectin 0aAlginate 0aJanus 0aShape1 aDavy, J.1 aCathala, B.1 aFang, A.1 aRenard, D.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Feb. 13, v. 116 p.189-199dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.01.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005000150245014800200500001900348520198700367592002802354650001202382650002102394650001302415650001802428650001502446650001802461650002502479650001402504650000902518650001202527650000902539650001902548653001702567653002802584653002302612700001702635700001402652700001702666700001702683700002002700700001602720773011002736856008502846852000902931655001202940IND60722779420221117174543.0210212e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072277942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1163652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Di1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8005-256914aThe importance of ammonia volatilization in estimating the efficacy of nitrification inhibitors to reduce N2O emissions: A global meta-analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNitrification inhibitors (NIs) have been shown to be an effective tool to mitigate direct N₂O emissions from soils. However, emerging findings suggest that NIs may increase soil ammonia (NH₃) volatilization and, subsequently, indirect N₂O emission. A quantitative synthesis is lacking to evaluate how NIs may affect NH₃ volatilization and the overall N₂O emissions under different environmental conditions. In this meta-analysis, we quantified the responses of NH₃ volatilization to NI application with 234 observations from 89 individual studies and analysed the role of experimental method, soil properties, fertilizer/NI type, fertilizer application rate and land use type as explanatory factors. Furthermore, using data sets where soil NH₃ emission and N₂O emission were measured simultaneously, we re-evaluated the effect of NI on overall N₂O emissions including indirect N₂O emission from NH₃ volatilization. We found that, on average, NIs increased NH₃ volatilization by 35.7% (95% CI: 25.7–46.7%) and increased indirect N₂O emission from NH₃ emission (and subsequent N deposition) by 2.9%–15.2%. Responses of NH₃ volatilization mainly varied with experimental method, soil pH, NI type and fertilizer type. The increase of NH₃ volatilization following NI application showed a positive correlation with soil pH (R² = 0.04, n = 234, P < 0.05) and N fertilizer rate (R² = 0.04, n = 187, P < 0.05). When the indirect N₂O emission was considered, NI’s N₂O mitigation effect decreased from 48.0% to 39.7% (EF = 1%), or 28.2% (EF = 5%). The results indicate that using DMPP with ammonium-based fertilizer in low pH, high SOC soils would have a lower risk for increasing NH₃ volatilization than using DCD and nitrapyrin with urea in high pH, lower SOC soil. Furthermore, reducing N application rate may help to improve NIs’ overall N₂O emission mitigation efficiency and minimize their impact on NH₃ volatilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3afertilizer rates 3aland use 3ameta-analysis 3anitrapyrin 3anitrification 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apollution 3arisk 3asoil pH 3aurea 3avolatilization 0aN2O emission 0aNitrification inhibitor 0aNH3 volatilization1 aZhang, Yuxue1 aDong, Gao1 aDu, Zhangliu1 aWu, Wenliang1 aChadwick, David1 aBol, Roland0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 271 p.116365-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1163653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03794naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245011600178300001800294520220000312592002802512650001902540650001102559650002102570650001702591650001002608650002302618650002102641650001602662650002302678650002302701650002102724650001102745650002002756650002302776650001902799650003102818650002102849650002702870650003302897650002402930650003302954650003002987650002003017650002003037700002103057773010003078856007703178852000903255655001203264IND60083352120221116193920.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008335212DNAL7 a218549082pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-43592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrummer, J.10aDetermining salt concentrations for equivalent water activity in reduced-sodium cheese by use of a model system  ap. 4360-4365.  aThe range of sodium chloride (salt)-to-moisture ratio is critical in producing high-quality cheese products. The salt-to-moisture ratio has numerous effects on cheese quality, including controlling water activity (aw). Therefore, when attempting to decrease the sodium content of natural cheese it is important to calculate the amount of replacement salts necessary to create the same aw as the full-sodium target (when using the same cheese making procedure). Most attempts to decrease sodium using replacement salts have used concentrations too low to create the equivalent aw due to the differences in the molecular weight of the replacers compared with salt. This could be because of the desire to minimize off-flavors inherent in the replacement salts, but it complicates the ability to conclude that the replacement salts are the cause of off-flavors such as bitter. The objective of this study was to develop a model system that could be used to measure aw directly, without manufacturing cheese, to allow cheese makers to determine the salt and salt replacer concentrations needed to achieve the equivalent aw for their existing full-sodium control formulas. All-purpose flour, salt, and salt replacers (potassium chloride, modified potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium chloride) were blended with butter and water at concentrations that approximated the solids, fat, and moisture contents of typical Cheddar cheese. Salt and salt replacers were applied to the model systems at concentrations predicted by Raoult's law. The aw of the model samples was measured on a water activity meter, and concentrations were adjusted using Raoult's law if they differed from those of the full-sodium model. Based on the results determined using the model system, stirred-curd pilot-scale batches of reduced- and full-sodium Cheddar cheese were manufactured in duplicate. Water activity, pH, and gross composition were measured and evaluated statistically by linear mixed model. The model system method accurately determined the concentrations of salt and salt replacer necessary to achieve the same aw as the full-sodium control in pilot-scale cheese using different replacement salts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheddar cheese 3abutter 3acalcium chloride 3acheesemaking 3aflour 3amagnesium chloride 3amolecular weight 3aoff flavors 3apotassium chloride 3asalt concentration 3asalt substitutes 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3astatistical models 3awater activity 2aCalcium Chloridexanalysis 2aCheesexanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aMagnesium Chloridexanalysis 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPotassium Chloridexanalysis 2aSodium Chloridexanalysis 2aSodium, Dietary 2aWaterxanalysis1 aSchoenfuss, T.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Sept., v. 94, no. 9 p.4360-4365dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-43593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011000170506010400280506007600384520158300460592002802043506003702071650001902108650001102127650001502138650000902153650001302162650001202175650001102187650002102198650002102219653001602240653001302256653001702269653001702286653002402303653002902327700002502356700001602381773009802397856008702495852000902582655001202591IND60704794920221207080233.0220531e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070479492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1154992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaraei, Mahsa10aPower-to-hydrogen storage integrated with rooftop photovoltaic systems and combined heat and power plants  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe growing share of intermittent renewable energy sources for power generation indicates an increasing demand for flexibility in the energy system. Energy storage technologies ensure a balance between demand and supply and increase the system flexibility. This study investigates increased application of renewable energy resources at a regional scale. Power-to-gas storage that interacts with a large-scale rooftop photovoltaic system is added to a regional energy system dominated by combined heat and power plants. The study addresses the influence of the storage system on the production planning of the combined heat and power plants and the system flexibility. The system is modeled and the product costs are optimized using the Mixed Integer Linear Programming method, as well as considering the effects on CO₂ emissions and power import into the regional system. The optimization model is investigated by developing different scenarios for the capacity and cost of the storage system. The results indicate that the proposed storage system increases the system flexibility and can reduce power imports and the marginal emissions by around 53%, compared with the current energy system. There is a potential to convert a large amount of excess power to hydrogen and store it in the system. However, because of low efficiency, a fuel cell cannot significantly contribute to power regeneration from the stored hydrogen. Therefore, for about 70% of the year, the power is imported to the optimized system to compensate the power shortfalls rather than to use the fuel cell.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3aimports 3amodels 3apower generation 3asolar collectors 0aFlexibility 0aHydrogen 0aOptimization 0aPower-to-gas 0aProduction planning 0aRenewable energy sources1 aCampana, Pietro Elia1 aThorin, Eva0 tApplied energy.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 276 p.115499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1154993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245011800197500001900315500002000334520142300354592002801777596008301805650000901888650002001897650002301917650001501940650000701955650001301962650002501975650001602000650002702016700001602043700001502059700001802074700001302092700001802105700001202123773014302135856007402278852000902352655001202361IND60725489520221118195005.0210126e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072548952DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.150042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaodan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2264-948X12aA method to improve water‐holding capacity of beef during freezing‐thawing process using ultrasound treatment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of ultrasound treatment on water‐holding capacity (WHC) of beef during freezing‐thawing process was investigated. The results showed that the WHC of beef without ultrasound was 0.69 after one freezing–thawing process. In different stages of freezing and thawing (before freezing, during freezing, during thawing, and after thawing), the application of ultrasound (400 w, 45 kHz) could improve the WHC quality of beef: the WHC was improved most during thawing, which could reach 0.78. And then, ultrasound treatment could reduce hardness but improve springiness (p < .05) and pH value of beef in freezing–thawing process. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the lacuna of myofibrils increased, which indicated that the ultrasound could help to improve the WHC. Based on the results obtained, ultrasound treatment may be recommended as a useful means to improve the WHC of beef during freezing–thawing process. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In the process of food production, raw meat may undergo repeated freezing–thawing, which would affect the quality of meat. Ultrasound, as a new technology, was used in this study. This study showed that ultrasound could help to improve the WHC of beef during freezing–thawing process. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ultrasound can be used as an effective technology to improve the quality of beef during freezing–thawing process.  aPublisher supplied data  aNX2019008cComparative Analysis of quality Superiority of “Yangguang Pork” 3abeef 3afood production 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3amyofibrils 3apH 3araw meat 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awater holding capacity1 aDong, Yanli1 aWu, Ruijia1 aLiu, Dengyong1 aHu, Feng1 aWang, Cuilian1 aWu, Duo0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e15004-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.150043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011000173300001600283520204100299592002802340650001602368650001702384650001402401650001202415650001702427650001902444650002002463650001502483650002002498650001602518650002202534650001402556653002202570653002302592653001902615653001802634653002202652653002202674700002102696700002602717700002102743700003002764700001502794700001302809700002502822700001602847773008302863856008602946852000903032655001203041IND60581710420221119100315.0171005e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058171042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbeykoon, Chamil10aProcess efficiency in polymer extrusion: Correlation between the energy demand and melt thermal stability  ap. 560-571.  aThermal stability is of major importance in polymer extrusion, where product quality is dependent upon the level of melt homogeneity achieved by the extruder screw. Extrusion is an energy intensive process and optimisation of process energy usage while maintaining melt stability is necessary in order to produce good quality product at low unit cost. Optimisation of process energy usage is timely as world energy prices have increased rapidly over the last few years. In the first part of this study, a general discussion was made on the efficiency of an extruder. Then, an attempt was made to explore correlations between melt thermal stability and energy demand in polymer extrusion under different process settings and screw geometries. A commodity grade of polystyrene was extruded using a highly instrumented single screw extruder, equipped with energy consumption and melt temperature field measurement. Moreover, the melt viscosity of the experimental material was observed by using an off-line rheometer. Results showed that specific energy demand of the extruder (i.e. energy for processing of unit mass of polymer) decreased with increasing throughput whilst fluctuation in energy demand also reduced. However, the relationship between melt temperature and extruder throughput was found to be complex, with temperature varying with radial position across the melt flow. Moreover, the melt thermal stability deteriorated as throughput was increased, meaning that a greater efficiency was achieved at the detriment of melt consistency. Extruder screw design also had a significant effect on the relationship between energy consumption and melt consistency. Overall, the relationship between the process energy demand and thermal stability seemed to be negatively correlated and also it was shown to be highly complex in nature. Moreover, the level of process understanding achieved here can help to inform selection of equipment and setting of operating conditions to optimise both energy and thermal efficiencies in parallel.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aenergy costs 3aextrusion 3amelting 3apolystyrenes 3aprocess energy 3aproduct quality 3arheometers 3aspecific energy 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aviscosity 0aPolymer extrusion 0aProcess monitoring 0aMelt viscosity 0aEnergy demand 0aThermal stability 0aEnergy efficiency1 aKelly, Adrian L.1 aVera-Sorroche, Javier1 aBrown, Elaine C.1 aCoates, P.

The probe contains a dansyl moiety as fluorophore and a multidentate ligand for copper (II) ion recognition. The reaction of the molecular probe with copper (II) ion proceeds rapidly and irreversibly in a 1 to 1 stoichiometric way, leading to the production of stable copper (II) complex, which subsequently results in the quenching of fluorescence. The detection limit for copper (II) ion was measured to be about 2ppb. It was also shown that the probe has high selectivity for copper (II) ion and good anti-interference ability against other transition metal ions. The herein reported very simple and reliable fluorescence probe could be employed for copper (II) ion detection in many aspects.  aPublisher supplied data 3achelation 3acopper 3adetection limit 3adose response 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aligands 3ametal ions 3amoieties 0aDansyl-based fluorescent probe 0aCopper (II) ion 0aCoordination1 aYu, Tao1 aSun, Mingtai1 aYou, Huan,1 aZhang, Zhongping1 aWang, Suhua1 aJiang, Hui0 tTalanta.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 126 p.185-190dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01465naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245004900168300001600217520044800233592002800681650002800709650002800737650001400765650001800779700001500797700001500812700001400827700001400841700001700855700001700872700001600889773011800905856008301023852000901106655001201115IND60782371420221120090702.0220708e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078237142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-022-03708-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhengyou,12aA New β-Ionone from Liriodendron tulipifera  ap. 455-458.  aA new β-ionone, litulipiferic acid (12), was isolated from the leaves of Liriodendron tulipifera (Magnoliaceae).

These were subsequently reacted with phenyl isocyanate to give urea-functionalized materials, so that hydrogen peroxide could be reversibly bound, giving in turn antibacterial materials with high activity. These functionalized materials were characterized using a combination of XPS, IR, and NMR spectroscopy, and clear evidence for the crosslinking on the surface of materials was achieved. The crosslinking reaction in the deposited layer contributed to higher loadings of hydrogen peroxide, and hence the antibacterial activity of urea-functionalized materials significantly increased. This approach gives a new protocol to prepare high loading antiseptic/antibacterial materials and surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aantiseptics 3acrosslinking 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyethylene 3apolystyrenes 3atitanium dioxide1 aMoloney, Mark G.0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 07, v. 7, no. 47 p.29645-29655dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra05258h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245018400165300001600349520157800365592002801943653002001971653001401991653002102005653001802026653001802044653002502062653001502087653001702102700003802119700001702157700002102174773016702195856008202362852000902444655001202453IND60517063720221121040203.0190728e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051706372DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140000462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurser, Autun14aThe influence of flow velocity and suspended particulate concentration on net prey capture rates by the scleractinian coral Balanophyllia europaea (Scleractinia: Dendrophylliidae)  ap. 687-696.  aBalanophyllia europaea is an endemic Mediterranean sublittoral zooxanthellate solitary coral. Given the broad distribution of the species throughout many areas of the Mediterranean surprisingly little is known of preferred habitat niches or susceptibility of the species to environmental change. In this study we investigated in the laboratory the net prey capture rates of the coral achievable under a range of flow velocities (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 15 cm s⁻¹) and under exposure to different suspended particulate concentrations (0, 7.3 and 170 mg l⁻¹). In recirculation flumes we simulated both commonly occurring and the occasionally high flow velocities and various suspended particulate concentrations reported from the Gulf of Lions (north-west Mediterranean). We then delivered ca 500 A. salina nauplii l⁻¹ as food (Artemia salina nauplii) to the flumes and monitored net prey capture over time. We found net prey capture rates by the species to be highest under flow velocities of 5 cm s⁻¹, with 230 µg C coral individual⁻¹ h⁻¹ achieved. The presence or absence of even environmentally high particulate concentrations (up to 170 mg l⁻¹ resuspended seabed material) did not significantly affect the net prey capture rates achieved by the coral polyps. We found that net prey capture in Balanophyllia europaea is not inhibited during periods of heavy particle exposure, as has been observed in other temperate scleractinian corals. Also, flow velocities of ca ~5 s⁻¹ appear to be optimal for maximum net prey capture by the species.  aPublisher supplied data 0atemperate coral 0acup coral 0anet prey capture 0aGulf of Lions 0aMediterranean 0aparticulate exposure 0aflow rates 0aScleractinia1 aOrejas Saco del Valle, Covadonga,1 aMoje, Annika1 aThomsen, Laurenz0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 June, v. 94, no. 4 p.687-696dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140000463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002400136245017300160300001600333520178300349592002802132653002302160653002402183653002302207653002602230653001602256653001202272653001502284653001502299653001702314653002902331653002902360653003002389653001402419773012202433856007202555852000902627655001202636IND60126073720221118002404.0151105e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012607372DNAL7 a10.1654/4233.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Nathan A.10aSeasonal Prevalence of Ribeiroia ondatrae in One Population of Planorbella trivolvis (==Helisoma trivolvis), Including Notes on the Larval Trematode Component Community  ap. 312-318.  aDuring the spring, summer, and fall of 2003 and 2004, 947 and 1,970 Planorbella trivolvis (==Helisoma trivolvis) collected from 1 site in Portage County, Wisconsin, U.S.A., were measured and examined for larval trematodes. Cercarial morphology was used to identify trematode larvae, and the prevalence of each larval type was determined. Totals of 292 and 618 larval trematode infections, including 140 and 191 identified as Ribeiroia ondatrae, were observed in 2003 and 2004, respectively. In addition to R. ondatrae, collections yielded 8 morphologically distinct larvae: echinostome, armatae, magnacauda, amphistome, cystophorous, longifurcate-pharyngeate/strigea, brevifurcate-pharyngeate/clinostomoid, and brevifurcate-apharyngeate. Ribeiroia ondatrae and echinostome larvae contributed 30.9%% and 25.2%%, respectively, of the overall trematode prevalence observed in 2004, whereas magnacauda, cystophorous, longifurcate-pharyngeate, brevifurcate-pharyngeate, and brevifurcate-apharyngeate infections were only infrequently encountered. Because the prevalence of R. ondatrae might have implications for the genesis of amphibian malformations in the field, the focus of this study was to determine how the prevalence of R. ondatrae fluctuates with time. In both 2003 and 2004, the total intramolluscan trematode prevalence, as well as that of R. ondatrae and echinostome larvae, increased significantly from spring to fall. These results were reaffirmed in an analysis of snail size and trematode prevalence, which showed that intramolluscan prevalence increased from spring to fall within all size classes. However, unlike the prevalence of echinostome larvae, the prevalence of R. ondatrae exhibited a midsummer decline before rising rapidly in late September and October.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRibeiroia ondatrae 0aseasonal prevalence 0aHelisoma trivolvis 0aPlanorbella trivolvis 0aechinostome 0aarmatae 0amagnacauda 0aamphistome 0acystophorous 0alongifurcate-pharyngeate 0abrevifurcate-pharyngeate 0abrevifurcate-apharyngeate 0acercariae0 tComparative parasitology.g2007 July, v. 74, no. 2 p.312-318dHelminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4233.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001700162245010000179300001800279520117300297592002801470650002001498650001501518650002001533650001001553650002001563650001301583650001501596650001301611650000901624650001501633650002301648650001801671650001201689650001101701650003101712650002701743650001101770650001401781650003201795650001501827650003101842651001901873651001801892700001601910700001801926700001701944773010001961856007702061852000902138655001202147IND60083352420221116193804.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008335242DNAL7 a218549112pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-42762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArcher, S.C.10aAssociation between somatic cell count and serial locomotion score assessments in UK dairy cows  ap. 4383-4388.  aThis research investigated the effect of lameness, measured by locomotion score (LS) on the somatic cell count (SCC) of UK dairy cows. The data set consisted of 11,141 records of SCC and LS collected monthly on 12 occasions from 1,397 cows kept on 7 farms. The data were analyzed to account for the correlation of repeated measures of SCC within cow. Results were controlled for farm of origin, stage of lactation, parity, season, and test-day milk yield. Compared with the geometric mean SCC for cows with LS 1 on each farm, cows on farm 3 with LS 2 produced milk with 28,000 fewer somatic cells/mL, and cows with LS 2 on farm 6 produced milk with 30,000 fewer somatic cells/mL at a test day within 10 d. Cows that would have LS 3 six months later produced milk with 16,000 fewer somatic cells/mL compared with the geometric mean SCC for cows that would have LS 1 in 6mo time. These results illustrate differences in disease dynamics between farms, highlight potential conflict between lameness and mastitis control measures, and emphasize the importance of developing farm-specific estimates of disease costs, and hence, health management plans in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontrol methods 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3afarms 3alactation stage 3alameness 3alocomotion 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk yield 3asomatic cell count 3asomatic cells 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLameness, Animalxdiagnosis 2aLocomotion 2aMilkxcytologyxstandards. 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain1 aGreen, M.J.1 aMadouasse, A.1 aHuxley, J.N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Sept., v. 94, no. 9 p.4383-4388dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-42763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012400172300001600296520197100312592002802283650001502311650001102326650001402337650001202351650001602363650001902379650002202398650000902420650001602429650001902445650002402464651001002488653002602498653001902524653002702543653002802570653002102598700001602619700002302635700001602658773008302674856008602757852000902843655001202852IND60581710820221119095926.0171005e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058171082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirvonen, Janne10aLocal sharing of cogeneration energy through individually prioritized controls for increased on-site energy utilization  ap. 350-363.  aAll over the world, including Japan, there are targets to decrease building energy consumption and increase renewable energy utilization. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants increase energy efficiency and are becoming popular in Japan. CHP plants produce both heat and power simultaneously, but there is not always a need for both. A cluster of several different buildings can increase total efficiency and reduce primary energy (PE) consumption by sharing excess heat and electricity between neighboring buildings. If the generated energy comes from renewable sources, energy sharing makes it easier to reach the net zero energy balance. By adjusting CHP sizes and operation patterns, the wasted heat and primary energy consumption can be minimized.Energy sharing has been explored in situations with identical buildings and centrally administered energy systems before, but not with different building types with separate systems. In this study, a cluster of Japanese office and residential buildings were combined to allow heat and electricity sharing based on cogeneration, using individually prioritized control (IPC) systems. TRNSYS simulation was used to match energy generation with pregenerated demand profiles. Absorption cooling was utilized to increase the benefits of local heat generation. Different CHP operation modes and plant sizes were tested.The benefit of surplus energy sharing depends on the CHP capacities and the fuel type. When using biogas, larger CHP plants provided lower total primary energy consumption, in the most extreme case lowering it by 71%, compared to the conventional case. Using natural gas provided only a 6% decrease. The savings resulting from energy sharing were between 1% and 9% with biogas and between 1% and 6% using natural gas. The least amount of PE was consumed by having large CHP plants with biogas, due to the value of renewable electricity. Using natural gas, thermal tracking had the lowest PE consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiogas 3abuildings 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aenergy balance 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3anatural gas 3aprimary energy 3aresidential housing 3aJapan 0aZero energy community 0aEnergy sharing 0aDistributed generation 0aOn-site energy matching 0aRenewable energy1 aKayo, Genku1 aḤasan, ʻAlāʼ,1 aSirén, Kai0 tApplied energy.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 135 p.350-363dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245011300186300001800299520106100317592002801378650002701406650001201433650001601445650001701461650002101478650001701499650003201516650001801548650001601566650000901582650001401591650001801605650001401623650002001637650001201657650003901669650002601708650003201734650002001766650002901786650003301815650002701848650001101875650003801886650003201924650003001956650000901986650002401995650005202019700002202071700002002093700001602113700001402129700002002143773009902163856008102262852000902343655001202352IND60080271320221117190204.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008027132DNAL7 a249069892pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-014-3954-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontrieux, Elly10aIn vitro and in vivo activity of major constituents from Pluchea carolinensis against Leishmania amazonensis  ap. 2925-2932.  aThe search for new therapeutic agents from natural sources has been a constant for the treatment of diseases such as leishmaniasis. Herein, in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activities of pure major phenolic constituents (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, and rosmarinic acid) from Pluchea carolinensis against Leishmania amazonensis are presented. Pure compounds showed inhibitory activity against promastigotes (IC₅₀ = 0.2–0.9 μg/mL) and intracellular amastigotes (IC₅₀ = 1.3–2.9 μg/mL). Four of them were selected after testing against macrophages of BALB/c mice: caffeic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, and rosmarinic acid, with selective indices of 11, 17, 10, and 20, respectively. Ferulic acid, rosmarinic acid, and caffeic acid controlled lesion size development and parasite burden in footpads from BALB/c experimentally infected mice, after five injections of compounds by intralesional route at 30 mg/kg every 4 days. Pure compounds from P. carolinensis demonstrated antileishmanial properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania amazonensis 3aPluchea 3aamastigotes 3acaffeic acid 3achlorogenic acid 3aferulic acid 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleishmaniasis 3amacrophages 3amice 3aparasites 3apromastigotes 3aquercetin 3arosmarinic acid 2aAnimals 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxpharmacology 2aAsteraceaexchemistry 2aCaffeic Acidsxpharmacology 2aCells, Cultured 2aCinnamatesxpharmacology 2aCoumaric Acidsxpharmacology 2aDepsidesxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aLeishmania mexicanaxdrug effects 2aLeishmaniasisxdrug therapy 2aMacrophagesxparasitology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aQuercetinxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology.1 aPerera, Wilmer H.1 aGarcía, Marley1 aMaes, Louis1 aCos, Paul1 aMonzote, Lianet0 tParasitology research.g2014 Aug., v. 113, no. 8 p.2925-2932dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-3954-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010400169300001400273520105400287592002801341653001901369653002301388653001801411653002001429653001601449773011901465856008301584852000901667655001201676IND60128567320221122030749.0151116e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012856732DNAL7 a10.4003/0740-2783-23.1.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, Robert10aTaxonomic occurrences of gastropod spermatozeugmata and non-stylommatophoran spermatophores updated  ap. 11-16.  aSpermatozeugmata, not to be confused with spermatophores, that also transfer sperm, are compound structures (parasperms with attached eusperms) known only in certain ““mesogastropods””: Loxonematoidea? (Abyssochrysidae), Littorinoidea (Littorinidae), Triphoroidea (Triphoridae and Cerithiopsidae), Tonnoidea (Ranellidae), Janthinoidea (Epitoniidae and Janthinidae), and doubtfully Cypraeoidea (Cypraeidae). This pattern of taxonomic occurrence does not match that of any other character known, their morphology is diverse, and it is concluded that the spermatozeugmata in these taxa are not all homologous and that, like spermatophores, they have evolved repeatedly. Littorinid spermatozeugmata have frequently been studied after fixation and shrinkage of the parasperms (““nurse cells””), during which the eusperms drop off. Spermatozeugmata are not a synapomorphy linking the Triphoroidea and Janthinoidea. Records of spermatophores (except in the ““pulmonate”” suborder Stylommatophora) since Robertson (1989) are updated.  aPublisher supplied data 0asperm transfer 0ainferred homoplasy 0aeuspermatozoa 0aparaspermatozoa 0anurse cells0 tAmerican Malacological Bulletin.g2007 Dec., v. 23, no. 1 p.11-16dAmerican Malacological Societyx0740-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4003%2F0740-2783-23.1.113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245012700165520159500292592002801887650001201915650002701927650000901954650001501963650001101978650001801989650001602007650001002023651001102033700004102044700002302085700001802108700002202126700002102148700003002169773012002199856007302319852000902392655001202401IND60744110820221120034339.0210709e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074411082DNAL7 a10.3390/w131318342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilama Luwa, Justine 10aVariabilities and Trends of Rainfall, Temperature, and River Flow in Sipi Sub-Catchment on the Slopes of Mt. Elgon, Uganda  aThe variabilities in rainfall and temperature in a catchment affect water availability and sustainability. This study assessed the variabilities in rainfall and temperature (1981–2015) and river flow (1998–2015) in the Sipi sub-catchment on annual and seasonal scales. Observed daily rainfall and temperature data for Buginyanya and Kapchorwa weather stations were obtained from the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA), while the daily river-flow data for Sipi were obtained from the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE). The study used descriptive statistics, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Mann–Kendall trend analysis, and Sen’s slope estimator. Results indicate a high coefficient of variation (CV) (CV > 30) for August, September, October, and November (ASON) seasonal rainfall, while annual rainfall had a moderate coefficient of variation (20 ˂ CV ˂ 30). The trend analysis shows that ASON minimum and mean temperatures increased at α = 0.001 and α = 0.05 levels of significance respectively in both stations and over the entire catchment. Furthermore, annual and March, April, and May (MAM) river flows increased at an α = 0.05 level of significance. A total of 14 extremely wet and dry events occurred in the sub-catchment during the post-2000 period, as compared to five in the pre-2000. The significant increased trend of river flow could be attributed to the impacts of climate and land-use changes. Therefore, future studies may need to quantify the impacts of future climate and land-use changes on water resources in the sub-catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adescriptive statistics 3arain 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asubwatersheds 3atemperature 3awater 3aUganda1 aMajaliwa, Jackson-Gilbert Mwanjalolo1 aBamutaze, Yazidhi 1 aKabenge, Isa 1 aPilesjö, Petter,1 aOriangi, George 1 aBagula Mukengere, Espoir 0 tWater.g2021 June 30, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131318343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013200154300001600286500002000302520149200322592002801814650001901842650000901861650002801870650001001898650001901908650001201927650001201939650001601951700001701967700002001984700005102004700001702055700001802072700001702090700001802107700001802125700005802143773013302201856007302334852000902407655001202416IND60675767320221121070458.0191108e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067576732DNAL7 a10.1111/vru.128032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Gayeon10aEvaluation of the radiographic liver length/11th thoracic vertebral length ratio as a method for quantifying liver size in cats  ap. 640-647.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAbdominal radiography is a standard diagnostic test for cats with suspected liver disease, however, absolute measurements of radiographic liver size can be affected by other factors such as positioning, radiographic technique, and obesity. This prospective and retrospective, analytical, cross‐sectional study evaluated the liver length/11th thoracic vertebral length (LL/T11) ratio as a method for minimizing these outside effects. In a prospectively recruited sample of 25 clinically healthy cats, measurements of radiographic LL/T11 ratio were compared with CT measurements of liver volume. Effects of radiographic technical factors (body posture, recumbency state, and beam center to LL/T11 ratio) and observer were also tested. In a retrospectively recruited sample of 324 cats with no evidence of liver disease, radiographic measurements of the LL/T11 ratio were performed using right lateral radiographs and compared among signalment groups (age, sex, body weight, and body condition score). There was a strong significant correlation between the LL/T11 ratio and CT liver volume (P < .001), and this ratio was not affected by radiographic technical factors. The reference value of the LL/T11 ratio was 4.22 ± 0.54 and the LL/T11 ratio did not differ among signalment groups. Findings supported the use of the LL/T11 ratio as a novel quantitative index of radiographic liver size in cats. Future studies in clinically affected cats are needed to further validate this method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody condition 3acats 3across-sectional studies 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3aobesity 3aposture 3aradiography1 aKwon, Dohoon1 aYoon, Hyounglok1 aYu, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0170-21461 aBang, Sohyun1 aLee, Youngjae1 aJeon, Seokho1 aJung, Jaihyun1 aChang, Jinhwa1 aChang, Dongwoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7721-773X0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2019 Nov., v. 60, no. 6 p.640-647dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.128033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011200165300001600277520164100293592002801934650001301962650001501975650001001990650001602000650002202016650000902038650000902047650001102056650001702067650001802084650001302102650001502115653001602130653001802146653002702164653002902191653001002220700001302230700001702243700001302260700001702273700002002290700001602310773011102326856008302437852000902520655001202529IND60553602720221123011844.0180831e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055360272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaoming12aA universal multicolor immunosensor for semiquantitative visual detection of biomarkers with the naked eyes  ap. 122-128.  a3, 3′, 5, 5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) has been widely used as a chromogenic substrate for colorimetric immunoassays. Normally, the colorless TMB is oxidized into yellow TMB²⁺ (in acidic solution) to indicate the presence of the target molecules. However, this kind of monochromic intensity changes seriously confine the accuracy of visual inspection. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that TMB²⁺ can quantitatively and efficiently etch gold nanorods (AuNRs). The addition of AuNRs into a solution containing different amount of TMB²⁺ generates vivid color responses as colorful as a rainbow, and the etching process can be finished within 90s. As a result, the exact concentration of TMB²⁺ can be easily distinguished with the naked eyes by the corresponding solution color. Based on this finding, we incorporate AuNRs into the well-developed, commercially available horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-TMB immunoassay system, so that it can be utilized for semiquantitative detection of a broad range of disease biomarkers with the naked eyes (termed ‘NEQ-IA’). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Prostate specific antigen (PSA) had been chosen as example targets to test the feasibility of the proposed biosensor. The results showed good accordance with the conventional methods. Because no sophisticated apparatus but human eyes are used as the readout, the proposed NEQ-IA could be a good supplementary to current state-of-the-art immunoassay methods for those applications that require the use of portable and affordable devices, for example, for the detection of disease biomarkers at home and in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adisease detection 3aeyes 3agold 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananorods 3aperoxidase 0aImmunoassay 0aGold nanorods 0aColorimetric detection 0aCarcinoembryonic antigen 0aELISA1 aLin, Yue1 aGuo, Longhua1 aQiu, Bin1 aChen, Guonan1 aYang, Huang-hao1 aLin, Zhenyu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 87 p.122-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01015naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010700160520011400267592002800381650001500409650001600424650001300440650001400453650001000467700002400477700002200501773012000523856007300643852000900716655001200725IND60744111020221120034359.0210709e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074411102DNAL7 a10.3390/w131317282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreti, Federico 10aTerraced Landscapes and Hydrological-Geological Hazards: Innovative Approaches and Future Perspectives  aIn the last few years, terraced landscapes have been receiving renovated interest all over the world (e [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3aterraces 3aterracing 3awater1 aErrico, Alessandro 1 aCastelli, Giulio 0 tWater.g2021 June 22, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131317283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007300165520183800238592002802076650001302104650002402117650000902141650002402150650001702174650001502191650001302206650001102219650001802230650002502248650002402273650001302297650002402310650003702334650001102371650001602382650001802398650001402416650001302430650001702443650001402460700003202474700002102506700002102527700002102548700002302569700002502592700003302617700002402650700002702674700002202701700002902723700001902752700002302771773012102794856007902915852000902994655001203003IND60757921920221116164123.0211125e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075792192DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101125222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrifan, Adriana 10aHonokiol and Magnolol: Insights into Their Antidermatophytic Effects  aDermatophyte infections represent a significant public health concern, with an alarming negative impact caused by unsuccessful therapeutic regimens. Natural products have been highlighted as a promising alternative, due to their long-standing traditional use and increasing scientific recognition. In this study, honokiol and magnolol, the main bioactives from Magnolia spp. bark, were investigated for their antidermatophytic activity. The antifungal screening was performed using dermatophyte standard strains and clinical isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined in accordance with EUCAST-AFST guidelines, with minor modifications. The effects on ergosterol biosynthesis were assessed in Trichophyton rubrum cells by HPLC-DAD. Putative interactions with terbinafine against T. rubrum were evaluated by the checkerboard method. Their impact on cells’ viability and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α) was shown using an ex vivo human neutrophils model. Honokiol and magnolol were highly active against tested dermatophytes, with MIC and MFC values of 8 and 16 mg/L, respectively. The mechanism of action involved the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, with accumulation of squalene in T. rubrum cells. Synergy was assessed for binary mixtures of magnolol with terbinafine (FICI = 0.50), while honokiol-terbinafine combinations displayed only additive effects (FICI = 0.56). In addition, magnolol displayed inhibitory effects towards IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α released from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human neutrophils, while honokiol only decreased IL-1β secretion, compared to the untreated control. Overall, honokiol and magnolol acted as fungicidal agents against dermatophytes, with impairment of ergosterol biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnolia 3aTrichophyton rubrum 3abark 3abioactive compounds 3abiosynthesis 3aergosterol 3ahonokiol 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-8 3akeratinophilic fungi 3alipopolysaccharides 3amagnolol 3amechanism of action 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3aneutrophils 3apublic health 3asecretion 3asqualene 3atherapeutics 3aviability1 aBostănaru, Andra-Cristina 1 aLuca, Simon Vlad1 aTemml, Veronika 1 aAkram, Muhammad 1 aHerdlinger, Sonja 1 aKulinowski, Łukasz 1 aSkalicka-Woźniak, Krystyna 1 aGranica, Sebastian 1 aCzerwińska, Monika E.1 aKruk, Aleksandra 1 aGreige-Gerges, Hélène 1 aMareș, Mihai 1 aSchuster, Daniela 0 tPlants.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101125223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245017500154300001600329520114600345592002801491650001301519650003301532650001201565650002101577650002701598650001801625650001201643700001901655700001701674700002001691700002201711700001801733773010201751856007501853852000901928655001201937IND60578015720221117012802.0170811e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057801572DNAL7 a10.1021/ma401895t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Wenjie10aInitial Stages of Interdiffusion between Asymmetrical Polymeric Layers: Glassy Polycarbonate and Melt Poly(methyl methacrylate) Interface Studied by Neutron Reflectometry  ap. 713-720.  aInterfacial evolution of deuterated polycarbonate (dPC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bilayer films supported on silicon substrates was examined by neutron reflectometry. The dPC was in the glassy state and the PMMA was in the melt state when the samples were annealed at temperatures (from 400 to 415 K) between the bulk glass transition temperature (Tg) of dPC (Tg ∼ 418 K) and PMMA (Tg ∼ 390 K). Asymmetric concentration profiles were observed as a result of composition dependence of the mobility. Once the slow moving dPC molecules leave the dPC-rich side (which was glassy) and enter the PMMA side, the dPC molecules become fast moving and diffuse freely in a viscous melt environment, while the fast moving PMMA molecules become slow as PMMA enter the glassy dPC matrix. Slight change in molecular mass of dPC gives rise to remarkable difference in concentration profile, indicating that mutual diffusion is very sensitive to molecular friction and entanglement of medium. With the penetration of PMMA into the dPC-rich side, the sluggish relaxation of dPC with high molecular mass results in the swelling of the dPC layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3aglass transition temperature 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3areflectometry 3asilicon1 aYuan, Guangcui1 aWang, Mingji1 aHan, Charles C.1 aSatija, Sushil

Bacteriocidal effects have been studied, as well as certain interesting chemical and physical changes occurring as a result of this treatment. Comparison of published results is confounded by the lack of standardised treatment parameters. US does not appear to offer advantages regarding microbiological quality, in comparison with conventional HTST pasteurisation (72 °C for 15 s). Most publications do not address possible sensory changes caused by US treatment but, according to some authors, some definitive changes do occur. To obtain knowledge that ensures that quality products are produced, research on US is needed that combines the aspects of the effect on microorganisms, product functionality and quality and the influence on flavour and sensory aspects of the milk or milk product.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflavor 3aheat 3ahigh-temperature short-time pasteurization 3amicrobiological quality 3amilk 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aNarvhus, Judith A.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2022 Aug., v. 131 p.105375-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2022.1053753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245014500169520192100314592002802235650002002263650001802283650001302301650002502314650003602339650001402375650004602389650001702435650002002452650002802472650001502500650004302515650002402558650002302582650002302605650001502628650001802643650001202661650001602673650001402689650001402703700002702717700002702744773012102771856007902892852000902971655001202980IND60757922120221116164424.0211125e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075792212DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101125252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlennikov, Daniil N.10aMetabolites of Prickly Rose: Chemodiversity and Digestive-Enzyme-Inhibiting Potential of Rosa acicularis and the Main Ellagitannin Rugosin D  aPrickly rose (Rosaacicularis Lindl.) is the most distributed rose species in the Northern Hemisphere, used by indigenous people for various food purposes. The lack of detailed information about the chemical composition of R. acicularis has led us to study the phytochemical composition and metabolic profile of prickly rose extracts using chromatographic techniques. Many groups of phenolic and non-phenolic compounds were quantified in the leaves, flowers, roots and fruits of R. acicularis. Phenolic compounds were the dominant phytochemicals in the aerial parts and roots of R. acicularis. A precise study by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection and electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detection showed the presence of 123 compounds, among which ellagic acid derivatives, ellagitannins, gallotannins, catechins, catechin oligomers, hydroxycinnamates and flavonoid glycosides of kaempferol, quercetin and dihydroquercetin were all identified for the first time. The most abundant phenolic compounds were ellagitannins and flavonoid glycosides, with a maximal content of 70.04 mg/g in leaves and 66.72 mg/g in flowers, respectively, indicating the great ability of R. acicularis organs to accumulate phenolic compounds. By applying a standardized static, simulated gastrointestinal digestion method, we found the inhibitory potential of the leaf extract against digestive α-amylases. A pancreatic α-amylase activity-inhibiting assay coupled with HPLC microfractionation demonstrated high inhibition of enzyme activity by ellagitannin rugosin D, which was later confirmed by a microplate reaction with mammalian α-amylases and the simulated digestion method. This study clearly demonstrates that R. acicularis leaf extract and its main component, ellagitannin rugosin D, strongly inhibit digestive α-amylase, and may be a prospective antidiabetic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa acicularis 3aalpha-amylase 3acatechin 3achemical composition 3achemical constituents of plants 3adigestion 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aellagic acid 3aenzyme activity 3agastrointestinal system 3aglycosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahypoglycemic agents 3ain vitro digestion 3aindigenous peoples 3akaempferol 3aleaf extracts 3amammals 3ametabolites 3aquercetin 3ataxifolin1 aChemposov, Vladimir V.1 aChirikova, Nadezhda K.0 tPlants.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101125253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011300166520108500279592002801364650002101392650002301413650002501436650001601461650001701477650001101494650001301505650001001518650001101528650001201539650001701551650001801568653001901586653003501605653002001640653001801660653001701678700001801695700001901713700001101732700001901743700001801762773010501780856008701885852000901972655001201981IND60771634320221119184935.0220421e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077163432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1270242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pei10aModule engineering coupled with omics strategies for enhancing D-pantothenate production in Escherichia coli  aBiosynthesis of D-pantothenate has been widely studied as D-pantothenate is one kind of important vitamins used in food and pharmaceuticals. However, the engineered strain for D-pantothenate production was focused solely on the main biosynthetic pathway, while other important factors such as one carbon unit were ignored. Here the systematic modular engineering on different factors coupled with omics analysis were studied in Escherichia coli for efficient D-pantothenate production. Through reinforcing the precursor pool, refactoring the one carbon unit generation pathway, optimization of reducing power and energy supply, the D-pantothenate titer reached 34.12 g/L with the yield at 0.28 g/g glucose under fed-batch fermentation in 5-L bioreactor. With a further comparative transcriptome and metabolomics studies, the addition of citrate was implemented and 45.35 g/L D-pantothenate was accumulated with a yield of 0.31 g/g glucose. The systematic modular engineering coupled with omics studies provide useful strategies for the industrial production of D-pantothenate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abatch fermentation 3abiochemical pathways 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acitrates 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aglucose 3ametabolomics 3atranscriptome 0aD-pantothenate 0aSystematic modular engineering 0aOne carbon unit 0aTranscriptome 0aMetabolomics1 aZhou, Hai-Yan1 aZhou, Jun-Ping1 aLi, Bo1 aLiu, Zhi-Qiang1 aZheng, Yu-Guo0 tBioresource technology.g2022 May, v. 352 p.127024-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1270243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245005600164300001600220520162000236592002801856650004401884650001301928650001801941650002101959650001901980650001901999650001302018650003302031650002102064650001302085650001102098650002102109700002202130700002402152773010202176856007502278852000902353655001202362IND60578015920221117012253.0170811e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057801592DNAL7 a10.1021/ma401904x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallagher, James J.,10aDegradable Thermosets from Sugar-Derived Dilactones  ap. 498-505.  aUsing the sugar derivatives glucarodilactone and mannarodilactone, two new dimethacrylate monomers (GDMA and MDMA) were synthesized by a tin-catalyzed alcohol–isocyanate coupling between the dilactones and isocyanatoethyl methacrylate. GDMA was polymerized using thermally initiated free radical polymerization at 135 °C in the presence of dicumyl peroxide as an initiator. The fractional conversion of methacrylate groups in PGDMA was determined by FT-IR to be 0.64, within the typical range of poly(di-methacrylates). Tensile testing of PGDMA demonstrated the stiff but brittle nature of this material and the modulus was shown to be similar to that reported for commercially available poly(dimethacrylates) from rigid monomers. The hydrolytic stability of PGDMA was investigated by submersing polymer samples in acidic, neutral, and basic aqueous environments. PGDMA degraded to water-soluble components after 17 days in 1 M NaOH but remained stable under acidic and neutral conditions. Solvent casting a mixture of GDMA, MDMA, and benzoyl peroxide followed by thermal curing at 95 °C gave clear P(GDMA-co-MDMA) (3:2) coatings. These coatings showed similar hydrolytic stability to the bulk PGDMA material. GDMA and methyl methacrylate (MMA) were used to synthesize P(GDMA-co-MMA) microspheres by precipitation polymerization in THF. These particles were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) in THF and in the dry state by scanning electron microscopy. Optimization of polymerization conditions yielded 730 nm diameter particles with a spherical morphology and low dispersity as determined by DLS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acoatings 3afree radicals 3alight scattering 3amicroparticles 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3asugars 3awater solubility1 aHillmyer, Marc A.1 aReineke, Theresa M.0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 47, no. 2 p.498-505dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma401904x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010400164300001600268520214700284592002802431650001502459650001102474650001102485650001002496650001302506650001702519650001202536650002102548650001102569650001202580650001202592650001102604650001002615650001002625650000902635650001502644650002102659650001602680700002402696773014102720856008302861852000902944655001202953IND60648534220221118234836.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDost, Julie10aP87 Tasting Tuesdays: Increasing Dietary Variety for Adults with Autism in a Community-Based Center  ap. S71-S72.  aIn order to promote dietary variety, “Tasting Tuesdays” were implemented at Community Support Services (CSS), a large community-based center for adults with autism. The goal of “Tasting Tuesdays” is to highlight new foods through an appeal to multiple sensory modalities (sight, smell, touch, taste) in an engaging format.“Tasting Tuesdays” emphasize choice and individualization, basic principles of “Active Engagement,” a well-vetted approach to cooking that was first established at CSS and is now a manualized treatment option for individuals with autism.Adults with autism are an at-risk and underserved population characterized by elevated rates of overweight/obesity. Individuals on the spectrum experience disordered eating at high prevalence and food selectivity is widespread.Each Tuesday a chosen food is offered in sample servings to the entire CSS community and all participants are asked to provide input through a visual graphing activity. Featured foods generally fall into one of several categories: unusual fruits/vegetables (dragon fruit, beet juice), specialty food products (broccoli tots, vegan chicken nuggets), unusual recipes (tofu scramble, watermelon salad) or seasonal specialties (latkes, eggnog). In the two years since inception, almost 100 different food samples have been included in the program.Tasters vote with a picture symbol containing a happy face (like) or a sad face (dislike). An “X” marker is used to track those individuals who decide not to taste the offered food. Outcomes are also reported in the biweekly nutrition newsletter distributed throughout the community. General participation rates are collected to assess the level of community involvement.Preference varies on a weekly basis due to personal choice. Program effectiveness, however, is assessed through participation rates which have increased by greater than 20% since inception, thus implying increased reach.Making a range of new foods available, and offering community-based tasting as a form of engagement, appears to be an effective means of addressing dietary rigidity amongst individuals with autism.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHylocereus 3aadults 3aautism 3abeets 3abroccoli 3achicken meat 3acooking 3aeating disorders 3afruits 3aobesity 3arecipes 3asalads 3asmell 3ataste 3atofu 3avegan diet 3avegetable juices 3awatermelons1 aGoldschmidt, Janice0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S71-S72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003500144245014500179520131500324592002801639650001701667650001901684650002101703650001001724650004301734650002201777650001601799650001601815650001901831650001301850650001501863650002501878700002901903700002801932700002901960700002801989773012102017856007902138852000902217655001202226IND60757922220221116164315.0211125e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075792222DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101125262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLins, Francisca Sabrina Vieira10aBioguided Isolation of Alkaloids and Pharmacological Effects of the Total Alkaloid Fraction from Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart.

The aim of the study was to perform phytochemical characterization and evaluate the anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive and acute toxicity effects of the total alkaloid fraction (TAF-Ap) from stem barks. Two monoterpenic indole alkaloids were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and the structural elucidation was performed using 1D and 2D NMR analysis. As for toxicity, no animals died at 50 mg kg⁻¹ and this concentration presented mild sedation and forced breathing within the first 24 h. The lethal dose capable of killing 50% of the animals (LD₅₀) was estimated to be 160 mg kg⁻¹. In the pharmacological tests, the models used were 1% carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis, 1% formalin-induced nociception and 1% acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing in Swiss mice. The study made it possible to isolate 15-methoxyaspidospermine and 15-methoxypyrifolidine, corroborating the results of pharmacological assays, which showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential, especially at 30 mg kg⁻¹ (p < 0.001). Thus, the species was shown to be a promising source of active substances, with special attention paid to its toxicological potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspidosperma 3aacute toxicity 3aanalgesic effect 3aedema 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anociception 3aperitonitis 3aphytochemicals 3asedation 3atoxicology 3atraditional medicine1 ada Silva, Vanessa Farias1 aTavares, Josean Fechine1 ados Santos, Vanda Lúcia1 ada Silva Alves, Harley 0 tPlants.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101125263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007700171300001600248520104800264592002801312650001601340650001201356650001401368650001101382650001301393650001301406650001401419650001001433650001201443650001801455650001601473650001801489650001601507650001101523650001701534653002201551653001601573653002801589653001801617653001401635773010101649856008601750852000901836655001201845IND60531443720221120160944.0190319e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053144372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickinson, Eric10aBiopolymer-based particles as stabilizing agents for emulsions and foams  ap. 219-231.  aThe effectiveness of biopolymer-based particles as stabilizing agents of emulsified and aerated systems is attributable to a pair of contributory mechanisms — Pickering stabilization by adsorbed particles at the oil–water or air–water interface, and gel-like structuring of particles between droplets or bubbles. This review describes recent advances in the stabilization of emulsions and foams by edible particles of nanoscale and microscale dimensions. The biopolymer ingredients involved include common food proteins such as whey protein, soy protein and gelatin, and polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose and chitin. The diverse morphologies of the biopolymer-based entities range from rigid structures like dense spheres and polygonal crystals, through to semi-flexible fibres and deformable microgels. The clear message to be inferred from these studies is that a broadly consistent range of mechanistic behaviour has emerged — albeit with some basic questions remaining that offer exciting opportunities for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3abubbles 3acellulose 3achitin 3acrystals 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3afoams 3agelatin 3ahydrocolloids 3aingredients 3ananoparticles 3asoy protein 3astarch 3awhey protein 0aEmulsion droplets 0aGas bubbles 0aPickering stabilization 0aNanoparticles 0aMicrogels0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 July, v. 68 p.219-231dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012200174520113700296592002801433650001701461650001601478650001501494650002201509650001201531650001501543653001601558653002501574653001501599653001101614653001901625653003201644700001901676700003301695773010501728856008701833852000901920655001201929IND60771634520221119184853.0220412e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077163452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1270382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehera, Bunushree10aResearch trends and market opportunities of microalgal biorefinery technologies from circular bioeconomy perspectives  aMicroalgae as an alternative feedstock for sustainable bio-products have gained significant interest over years. Even though scientific productivity related to microalgae-based research has increased in recent decades, translation to industrial scale is still lacking. Therefore, it is essential to understand the current state-of-art and, identify research gaps and hotspots driving industrial scale up. The present review through scientometric analysis attempted to delineate the research evolution contributing to this emerging field. The research trends were analysed over the last decade globally highlighting the collaborative network between the countries. The comprehensive knowledge map generated confirmed microalgal biorefinery as a scientifically active field, where the present research interest is focussed on synergistically integrating the unit processes involved to make it enviro-economically feasible. Market opportunities and regulatory policy requirements along with the consensus need to adopt circular bio-economy perspectives were highlighted to facilitate real-time implementation of microalgal biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomics 3abiorefining 3afeedstocks 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amicroalgae 0aBiorefinery 0aCircular bio-economy 0aMicroalgae 0aMarket 0aResearch trend 0aEnviro-economic feasibility1 aSelvam S, Mari1 aParamasivan, Balasubramanian0 tBioresource technology.g2022 May, v. 351 p.127038-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1270383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009400177300001600271520102000287536036201307592002801669596011301697596005601810650000901866650001501875650001501890650001401905650001201919650001101931650001201942650001401954651001301968653002401981653002902005653003702034653002802071700002102099700002102120700003102141773011802172856008502290852000902375655001202384IND60695021920221119055031.0200515e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069502192DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2020.17228662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruntorad, Matthew P.10aIdentifying factors influencing hunter satisfaction across hunting activities in Nebraska  ap. 215-231.  aUsing an online survey completed by individuals who hunted deer, waterfowl, upland game, or spring turkey in Nebraska during the 2017–2018 hunting seasons, we applied importance-grid analysis (IGA) and penalty-reward-contrast analysis (PRCA) to examine how activity-related attributes are related to satisfaction for each type of hunting activity. Effective response rates for the deer, waterfowl, small and upland-game, and spring turkey hunting surveys were 23%, 16%, 19%, and 27%, respectively. Results suggested that among hunting activities, different attributes were related to their sense of satisfaction. PRCA identified “seeing game animals” as a minimum requirement for participation in all activities except waterfowl hunting. “Seeing game birds” and “harvesting the daily bag limit” were identified as attributes that related to satisfaction and dissatisfaction among waterfowl hunters. Our study provides insights into factors that are important to satisfaction for each hunting activity.  aCJC was supported by Hatch funds through the Agricultural Research Division at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and from Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration project W-120-T, administered by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (NGPC).

S73.  aSNAP-Ed program implementers are encouraged to engage in sustainability planning with partner sites as a long-term environmental outcome per the SNAP-Ed Evaluation Framework. However, currently no literature exists on the sustainability of policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) change strategies adopted with the guidance of program implementers.The study explored the sustainability of PSE strategies implemented in partnership with the South Carolina SNAP-Ed program.Key informants at SNAP-Ed partner sites where at least one PSE strategy was adopted in FY2017 participated in an interview six to eight months post adoption (n = 31). An interview guide was developed based on a validated program sustainability assessment tool to explore the tool's eight domains of sustainability.Interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed using NVIVO. Each domain was coded based on being evidenced or not evidenced for the strategy. Then, categories of “sustained” and “not sustained” were developed based on emergent common storylines of sustainability among sites. Categories were then dichotomized to demonstrate high versus low capacity for future sustainability and comparisons were made between the two groups for each domain.Five storylines of sustainability surfaced, including strategies that were: going strong (n = 17); going with site investment but unstable (n = 4); going but lacked site investment (n = 1); going but with site planning to discontinue (n = 2); and not going but with site interest in reviving (n = 7). Strategies that demonstrated high capacity for future sustainability commonly had evidence of environmental support, organizational capacity, and partnerships (81%, 48%, 86%, respectively) as compared to strategies with low capacity for future sustainability (10%, 0%, 20%, respectively).Sustainable PSE strategies are crucial for SNAP-Ed to achieve its goal of ensuring low-income people are able to meet dietary guidelines and to maximize program funding. SNAP-Ed implementers should work with sites to ensure the most salient domains for future sustainability are in place during PSE implementation.USDA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Guidelines 3afunding 3aissues and policy 3alow-income population 3aplanning 3aSouth Carolina1 aWhitt, Olivia1 aYounginer, Nick1 aPope, Holly1 aPaget, Chris0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S73-S73dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245009400153520139200247592002801639650001301667650001801680650001501698650001601713650001801729650001901747650001001766650002501776700002001801700001801821700002101839773012001860856007301980852000902053655001202062IND60744111720221120041109.0210709e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074411172DNAL7 a10.3390/w131318422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMor, Ziv 10aHydrostatic Densitometer for Monitoring Density in Freshwater to Hypersaline Water Bodies  aDensity, temperature, salinity, and hydraulic head are physical scalars governing the dynamics of aquatic systems. In coastal aquifers, lakes, and oceans, salinity is measured with conductivity sensors, temperature is measured with thermistors, and density is calculated. However, in hypersaline brines, the salinity (and density) cannot be determined by conductivity measurements due to its high ionic strength. Here, we resolve density measurements using a hydrostatic densitometer as a function of an array of pressure sensors and hydrostatic relations. This system was tested in the laboratory and was applied in the Dead Sea and adjacent aquifer. In the field, we measured temporal variations of vertical profiles of density and temperature in two cases, where water density varied vertically from 1.0 × 10³ kg·m⁻³ to 1.24 × 10³ kg·m⁻³: (i) a borehole in the coastal aquifer, and (ii) an offshore buoy in a region with a diluted plume. The density profile in the borehole evolved with time, responding to the lowering of groundwater and lake levels; that in the lake demonstrated the dynamics of water-column stratification under the influence of freshwater discharge and atmospheric forcing. This method allowed, for the first time, continuous monitoring of density profiles in hypersaline bodies, and it captured the dynamics of density and temperature stratification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adensitometers 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ahypersalinity 3aionic strength 3alakes 3atemperature profiles1 aLutzky, Hallel 1 aShalev, Eyal 1 aLensky, Nadav G.0 tWater.g2021 July 01, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131318423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010700167520137100274592002801645650002701673650002501700650001501725650001301740650002301753650001101776650003201787650002501819650001301844650001401857650002001871650002401891650001501915653002101930653001801951653002001969653003201989653002502021700001802046700001402064773011202078856008502190852000902275655001202284IND60705589920221122222700.0200831e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070558992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1185302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinhua10aSecret underneath: Fouling of membrane support layer in anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor (AnOMBR)  aAnaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor (AnOMBR) holds promise for simultaneous wastewater purification and biogas production, allowing for an energy and carbon-neutral treatment facility. In a typical AnOMBR, reverse osmosis (RO) is employed for re-concentrating draw solution for continuous operation and cost saving. We compared membrane fouling behaviors between AnOMBR-RO hybrid system and AnOMBR without RO unit. We concluded that the porous support layer was susceptible to both inorganic scaling and biofouling in the closed-loop AnOMBR-RO system. We also explored two cleaning approaches to mitigate inorganic scaling and biofouling. Specifically, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was introduced into draw solution for minimizing inorganic scaling, but biofouling was deteriorated as EDTA provided extra nutrients for bacterial proliferation and biofouling. On the other hand, chemical cleaning of membrane support layer was performed using NaClO solution for biofouling control, but such cleaning efficacy attenuated after several cleaning cycles, because inorganic minerals accumulated and grew within membrane porous layer which could not be flushed by NaClO cleaning. Our finding highlighted the complexity and courter intuitive perspective to membrane fouling and cleaning in AnOMBR-RO hybrid system for inorganic scaling and biofouling management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aartificial membranes 3abiofouling 3acleaning 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3agas production (biological) 3amembrane bioreactors 3aminerals 3anutrients 3areverse osmosis 3asodium hypochlorite 3awastewater 0aMembrane fouling 0aSupport layer 0aForward osmosis 0aOsmotic membrane bioreactor 0aWastewater treatment1 aWang, Hailong1 aXie, Ming0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 614 p.118530-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1185303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014800166300001600314520164700330592002801977650000802005650001502013650002302028650002002051650002102071650001502092650002202107650000902129650001402138650003102152650001402183650001902197653003002216653001902246653003102265653002802296653002702324700001402351700001602365700001402381773011102395856008302506852000902589655001202598IND60553603420221123033723.0180831e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055360342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jianmin10aDendritic structure DNA for specific metal ion biosensor based on catalytic hairpin assembly and a sensitive synergistic amplification strategy  ap. 157-163.  aIn this work, a sensitive electrochemical biosensing to Pb²⁺ was proposed based on the high specificity of DNAzymes to Pb²⁺. The response signal was efficiently amplified by the catalytic hairpin assembly induced by strand replacement reaction and the formation of dendritic structure DNA (DSDNA) by layer-by-layer assembly. Firstly, in the presence of Pb²⁺, the substrate strand (S1) of the Pb²⁺-specific DNAzymes was specifically cleaved by Pb²⁺. Secondly, one of the two fragments (rS1) introduced into the electrode surface was hybridized with a hairpin DNA (H1) and further replaced by another hairpin DNA (H2) by the hybridization reaction of H1 with H2. The released rS1 then induced the next hybridization with H1. After repeated cycles, the catalytic recycling assembly of H2 with H1 was completed. Thirdly, two bioconjugates of Pt@Pd nanocages (Pt@PdNCs) labeled with DNA S3/S4 and electroactive toluidine blue (Tb) (Tb-S3-Pt@PdNCs and Tb-S4-Pt@PdNCs) were captured onto the resultant electrode surface through the hybridization of S3 and H2, S3 and S4, resulting in the formation of DSDNA triggered by layer-by-layer assembly. This formed DSDNA greatly facilitated the immobilization of manganese(III) meso-tetrakis (4-N-methylpyridiniumyl)-porphyrin (MnTMPyP) as mimicking enzyme. Under the synergistic catalysis of Pt@PdNCs and MnTMPyP to H2O2 reduction, the effective signal amplification of the developed Pb²⁺ biosensor was achieved. As a result, the sensitive detection of the proposed electrochemical strategy for Pb²⁺ was greatly improved in the range of 0.1pM–200nM with a detection limit of 0.033pM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alead 3amanganese 3anucleic acid hybridization 3arecycling 3atoluidine blue 0aElectrochemical biosensor 0aPb2+ detection 0aCatalyzed hairpin assembly 0aDendritic structure DNA 0aPb2+-specific DNAzymes1 aJing, Pei1 aXue, Shuyan1 aXu, Wenju0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 87 p.157-163dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002700172245012700199300001800326520081600344592002801160650001601188650001101204650000901215650001501224650002501239650001701264650001701281650002601298650001501324650000901339650001901348650001401367650001201381650001601393650005001409650002601459650003301485650001101518650003101529650004601560650002601606650002301632650004601655650002401701651001101725651001101736700001901747700002301766700001901789700002201808773008401830856008901914852000902003655001202012IND4466425220221120043554.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446642522DNAL7 a212729172pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeras’kin, Stanislav10aGeno-toxicity assay of sediment and water samples from the Upper Silesia post-mining areas, Poland by means of Allium-test  ap. 1133-1146.  aGenotoxic potential of two environmental compartments (water and sediment) from the Upper Silesia Coal Basin (USCB), Poland were evaluated and compared by employing root meristem cells of Allium cepa.

Among the remediation technologies, adsorption with metal sulfide nanomaterials has proven to be a promising strategy due to their cost-effective, environmentally friendly, surface modulational, and amenable properties. Their excellent adsorption characteristics are attributed to the inherently exposed sulfur atoms that interact with heavy metals through various processes. This work presents a comprehensive overview of the sequestration of heavy metals from water using metal sulfide nanomaterials. The common methods of synthesis, the structures, and the supports for metal sulfide nano-adsorbents are accentuated. The adsorption mechanisms and governing conditions and parameters are stressed.

Depending on their types, sizes, and orientation angles, spur dikes can substantially change flow characteristics. Results of previous studies indicate that the presence of an ice cover in rivers can cause complicated flow structures. The present experimental study investigates velocity fields and turbulence structures in the vicinity of spur dikes under ice cover with different roughness coefficients. The spur dikes were set up at the following three angles of orientation, 90°, 60°, and 45°. Our results show that the strongest velocity fluctuation occurs immediately above the scour hole surface and very close to the dike tip. The increase in the dike angle toward upstream, the velocity component values increase, leads to a larger scour hole. Results show that an increase in dike angle of each 10° (from 45° to 90°) increases the scour depth between 5% and 10%, depending on flow conditions. Furthermore, the increase in the cover roughness coefficient and the blockage ratio of a spur dike leads to a further increase in turbulence kinetic energy and 3D velocity components values. The findings of this study imply that the appearance of an ice cover can increase turbulence intensities up to nearly 30%.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydraulic structures 3aice 3aice cover 3akinetic energy 3aroughness 3aturbulent flow 3awater1 aSui, Jueyi 0 tWater.g2021 July 01, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131318443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100004200144245007200186520106300258592002801321650001701349650001301366650002301379650001801402650001001420650001701430650001101447651001101458700003501469773012101504856007901625852000901704655001201713IND60757922820221116164430.0211125e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075792282DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101125302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Obeso Fernandez Del Valle, Alvaro 10aFrom Past to Present: Biotechnology in Mexico Using Algae and Fungi  aAlgae and fungi share a rich history in the fields of basic and applied natural science. In biotechnology, in particular, algae and fungi are of paramount importance, due to the production and development of valuable compounds, such as pharmaceuticals, enzymes, and biofuels. They are also used in waste fermentation, biocontrol of pathogens, and food processing and improvement, among other fields. Although a substantial number of different microorganisms are utilized for these purposes, there lies tremendous potential in uncharacterized microbial species. For this reason, biodiversity hotspots offer a wealth of potential in the discovery of new products and processing strategies based on these microorganisms. This review presents an overview of the use of algae and fungi in pre-Hispanic times/modern-day Mexico for the benefits of mankind. One of our objectives is to raise awareness about the potential of developing research projects for identification and biotechnological utilization of algae and fungi in a megadiverse country, such as Mexico.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiofuels 3abiological control 3abiotechnology 3adrugs 3afermentation 3ahumans 3aMexico1 aScheckhuber, Christian Quintus0 tPlants.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101125303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001600295520206000311592002802371650005002399650001102449650002002460650001302480650001502493650001102508650001102519650003902530650002602569650001902595650001602614650001202630650002402642650002502666650001502691650001202706650001102718650002302729650001002752650001202762651001202774700001702786773014102803856008302944852000903027655001203036IND60648534820221118234559.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, Ginnefer10aP93 Utilizing Sensory Evaluation Methodology in Recipe Development for Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP)  ap. S74-S75.  aFederal programs such as EFNEP provide nutrition education for limited resource consumers. A component of the nutrition education often includes the inclusion of recipes which are provided to increase healthy eating behaviors among targeted audiences. Currently, there is limited information regarding sensory evaluation of recipes targeted to limited resource consumers.To utilize sensory evaluation methodology to assess acceptability including overall liking (OL) and liking of specific sensory attributes (appearance, flavor, texture) for 16 recipes taught and demonstrated through the University of Georgia EFNEP Food Talk nutrition education curriculum.A total of 872 EFNEP eligible Georgian adults who participate in the Food Talk Nutrition Education Curriculum conducted sensory evaluation on sixteen existing recipes through the EFNEP Food Talk curriculum. Recipes were prepared following standardized instructions for consistency of preparation and portion size.Sensory evaluation used the traditional nine-point hedonic scale to evaluate OL and specified sensory attributes (1= dislike extremely, 5 = neither like nor dislike, and 9 = like extremely). Standard range of acceptability for a recipe is ≥ 7.0. OL based on recipe title, and purchasing intent of recipe ingredients were also measured.Recipes with the highest acceptability ratings were fruit-based recipes (Fruit Smoothie, mean OL = 7.67, flavor = 7.56, texture = 7.54; Crunchy Apple Salad, mean OL = 7.97, flavor = 8.18, texture = 8.02). Recipes with the lowest acceptability ratings were Easy Cheesy Broccoli Soup (mean OL = 6.63, flavor = 6.51, texture = 6.64) and Curly Noodle Supreme (mean OL = 6.11, flavor = 5.58, texture = 6.56).Study findings suggest sensory evaluation should be a part of any nutrition education curriculum designed to improve diet quality through the introduction of new recipes and recipe modifications to promoted meaningful behavior change within the nation's most vulnerable populations.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3aExpanded Food and Nutrition Education Program 3aadults 3abehavior change 3abroccoli 3acurriculum 3aflavor 3afruits 3agovernmental programs and projects 3ahealthy eating habits 3ahedonic scales 3aingredients 3anoodles 3anutrition education 3anutritional adequacy 3apurchasing 3arecipes 3asalads 3asensory evaluation 3asoups 3atexture 3aGeorgia1 aMoore, Carla0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S74-S75dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006700168300001400235520163900249592002801888653001201916653002201928653001201950653001701962773011901979856008302098852000902181655001202190IND60128568920221120073123.0151116e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012856892DNAL7 a10.4003/0740-2783-24.1.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrasso, Frank W.10aOctopus sucker-arm coordination in grasping and manipulation**  ap. 13-23.  aIn natural settings octopuses use their arms and suckers in a variety of dexterous manipulation tasks, such as extracting prey from crevices and burrows, opening bivalve shells, and arranging middens in front of den entrances. Octopuses use multiple suckers on a single surface for a power grasp that supports their locomotion or permits the animal to carry or move small objects. Similar to squids engaged in prey capture, octopuses can project an arm from their body, attach a group of distal suckers, and pull an object toward themselves by shortening the arm. I investigated octopuses' use of suckers in similar tasks under controlled, reproducible laboratory conditions. Because larger suckers can generate larger adhesion forces, I hypothesized that the larger suckers toward the base of the arm would be preferred in tasks requiring the arm to employ greater forces. Octopuses did not use the strategy found in squid tentacles: applying suckers of appropriate force generation to a surface and lifting or pulling the arm. Instead, in many cases they used a variety of arm movements in combination with different functional groups of suckers. In addition, different arms performed different roles. When animals were restricted to the use of a single arm, they preferred to use suckers in the middle positions of the arm to support this coordinated arm-sucker activity. Contrary to a view of suckers as passive agents reflexively reacting to surface contact, these results are consistent with the known neural organization of the octopus arm and also with complex sucker-arm coordination in the performance of manipulation tasks.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOctopus 0agrasping-behavior 0asuckers 0acoordination0 tAmerican Malacological Bulletin.g2008 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.13-23dAmerican Malacological Societyx0740-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4003%2F0740-2783-24.1.133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008800165300001800253500001100271520086600282592002801148650002601176650001301202650002201215650001701237650001401254650001501268650001501283650002601298650001601324650002201340650001601362700002601378700001501404700001401419700001901433773014501452856008201597852000901679655001201688IND60592055020221117065441.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059205502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-8815-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Songwei10a4-Hydroxybenzoic acid—a versatile platform intermediate for value-added compounds  ap. 3561-3571.  aReview  a4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) has recently emerged as a promising intermediate for several value-added bioproducts with potential biotechnological applications in food, cosmetics, pharmacy, fungicides, etc. Over the past years, a variety of biosynthetic techniques have been developed for producing the 4-HBA and 4-HBA-based products.

However, the deposition characteristics of the particles are influenced by their morphology and size distribution. Moreover, the real-time particle size distribution during inhalation is important for determining smoke particle deposition in the lungs. Smoke particles generated under different fire conditions differ in their physical and chemical characteristics. Thus, there is a need to adopt international standard methods for characterizing the particles generated in fire. In the present study, the size distributions together with morphology of smoke particles were measured for each fire stage by using the steady-state tube furnace method given in ISO/TS 19700. The size distributions of smoke particles from wood and polypropylene (PP) were measured in real time by using an electric low-pressure impactor (ELPI⁺), and their morphologies were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abreathing 3afurnaces 3alungs 3aparticle size distribution 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolypropylenes 3asmoke 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awood 0aSmoke particles 0aSize distribution 0aMorphology 0aFire stage 0aTube furnace 0aElectrical low-pressure impactor (ELPI) 0aTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)0 tFire safety journal.g2015 Nov., v. 78 p.96-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04045naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001500170245008100185300001600266520196000282592002802242650001502270650001302285650001602298650002502314650001302339650001702352650001002369650001402379650001502393650001002408650001002418650002002428650001202448650001302460650001502473650001902488650001902507650001702526650001902543650001802562650001002580650001702590650002102607650001202628650002502640650001102665650000902676650002302685650002602708650003202734650001702766650004102783650008502824650001002909650007002919651001202989651002703001700001403028700001703042700002003059700001403079700001403093773010803107856008703215852000903302655001203311IND4470022820221120043645.0141112e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447002282DNAL7 a225340712pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGotter, V.10aMain risk factors for Salmonella-infections in pigs in north-western Germany  ap. 301-307.  aSalmonellosis is one of the major zoonotic, food-borne diseases, among others, caused by pig derived food products. As infected pigs are one of the main sources of the introduction of the bacterium into the food chain, scientific research in the last years has focussed on identifying risk factors for infection as well as developing mitigation strategies on this level of production. In order to update the knowledge of the German situation by incorporating recent changes in the German pig industry, a case–control study was set up to identify the key contributing risk factors for farms located in the western part of Lower Saxony, the region with the highest pig density in Germany. Based on an extensive and systematic literature search, a comprehensive questionnaire with 302 questions concerning such topics as personnel hygiene, animal management, biosecurity, feeding management as well as cleaning and disinfection routines was utilized in a face-to-face interview on 104 case and 67 control farms. Within a stepwise forward selection process the preliminary identified factors were grouped contextually, associations between variables were calculated and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted. Identified risk factors were: the moving of individual animals during the fattening period (OR 5.3, CI 95% 1.35–20.35), not having a separate transporter for different age groups (OR 11.4, CI 95% 1.94–66.18) and pigs having contact to other animals (OR 4.3, CI 95% 1.39–12.96). The following factors were identified as being protective: not cleaning the transporter (OR 0.2, CI 95% 0.05–0.72) and not having clean boots available (OR 0.2, CI 95% 0.07–0.64). While this study was able to identify some factors which influence the Salmonella-infection of a herd, overall the process of analysis showed that the control of Salmonella on farm is due to a series of individual factors and therefore remains extremely complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3abacteria 3abiosecurity 3acase-control studies 3acleaning 3adisinfection 3afarms 3afinishing 3afood chain 3afoods 3aherds 3ahuman resources 3ahygiene 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3alogit analysis 3aquestionnaires 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3asalmonellosis 3aswine 3atransporters 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSalmonellaxisolation & purification 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 3aGermany 0aGermanyxepidemiology.1 aKlein, G.1 aKoesters, S.1 aKreienbrock, L.1 aBlaha, T.1 aCampe, A.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 106, no. 3-4 p.301-307dElsevier B.V.x0167-58777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014100168300002000309520199900329592002802328596009202356650002102448650001502469650001702484650002202501650000902523650000902532650001402541700006502555773011702620856008502737852000902822655001202831IND60793603620221120160457.0220920e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079360362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosna, Maciej10aElectron Transfer in Binary Hemin-Modified Alkanethiol Self-Assembled Monolayers on Gold: Hemin’s Lateral and Interfacial Interactions  ap. 11180-11190.  aOrientated coupling of redox enzymes to electrodes by their reconstitution onto redox cofactors, such as hemin conjugated to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formed on the electrodes, poses the requirements for a SAM design enabling reconstitution. We show that the kinetics of electron transfer (ET) in binary SAMs of alkanethiols on gold composed of in situ hemin-conjugated 11-amino-1-undecanethiol (AUT) and diluting OH-terminated alkanethiols with 11, 6, and 2 methylene groups (MC₁₁OH, MC₆OH, and MC₂OH) depends on both the SAM composition and surface density of hemin, Γₕₑₘₑ. In AUT/MC₁₁OH SAMs composed of equal linker/diluent lengths, the heterogeneous ET rate constant kₛ decreased with the Γₕₑₘₑ and varied between 70 and 500 s–¹. For shorter diluents, the kₛ of 245–330 s–¹ (C₆) and 300–340 s–¹ (C₂) showed a little (if any) Γₕₑₘₑ dependence. In AUT/MC₁₁OH SAMs, the increasing Γₕₑₘₑ resulted in the steric crowding of hemin species and their neighboring lateral interactions in the plane of hemin localization, affecting the potential distribution at the SAM/electrode interface and inducing local electrostatic effects interfering with hemin oxidation. In AUT/MC₆OH and AUT/MC₂OH SAMs, hemin discharged at the plane of the closest approach to the gold surface, equal to the diluent length and permeable to electrolyte ions, which lessened those effects. All studied binary SAMs provided steric hindrance for protein reconstitution on the hemin cofactor conjugated to the extended AUT linker. Further use of SAM-modified electrodes with the covalently attached hemin as interfaces for heme proteins’ reconstitution should consider SAMs with loosely dispersed redox centers terminating more rigid molecular wires. Such wires place hemin at fixed distances from the electrode surface and thus ensure the interfacial properties required for the effective on-surface reconstitution of proteins and enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data  a11-107176cNatur og Univers, Det Frie Forskningsr?ddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008394 3achemical bonding 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3agold 3aheme 3aoxidation1 aFerapontova, Elena E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1177-32040 tLangmuir.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 38, no. 37 p.11180-11190dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011600167300001200283520205800295592002802353650002702381650002102408650001102429650002302440650002002463650002502483650001702508650002402525650001102549700001802560700001802578773014102596856008302737852000902820655001202829IND60648535120221118234907.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoerper, Tracy10aP96 Evaluation of the Effect of an Online Dual Enrollment Nutrition Course for College and High School Students  ap. S76.  aDual enrollment involves simultaneous enrollment in two or more courses at distinctly different educational levels such as secondary and tertiary. Dual enrollment programs can facilitate the transition of high school students into post-secondary education, and may reduce attrition rates in allied health programs. Dual enrollment is a rapidly growing segment of post-secondary education, yet there is a paucity of data concerning the nature and effectiveness for such programs in online nutrition education.This project implemented a fully online undergraduate dual-enrollment nutrition course for high school and college students. Extent of attainment of course content was ascertained for all groups.USDA grant dollars were obtained to facilitate a two-year dual enrollment collaboration between college (C) and two high schools (HS1 and HS2). Two sections of junior-level high school students in HS1 (n = 11) and HS2 (n = 20), and one section of C (n = 29) completed a one-semester online three credit hour nutrition course. Course content focused on normal nutrition, was delivered using an online platform, and was identical for all students groups.Pretest and posttest data were collected based on a 30-item nutrition knowledge test. A paired sample t-test was performed as well as an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare group mean differences.Paired sample t-test results indicate the mean difference between pretest and posttest scores (M = 32.4, SD = 20.8, N = 54) to be significantly greater than zero, t(53) = 11.5, P < .001, [two-tailed]. ANCOVA results indicate a significant difference between groups on posttest scores when controlling for pretest scores, F(2, 50) = 5.8, P = .01. Adjusted mean posttest score for HS1 was significantly different from mean posttest scores for HS2 and C.The results indicate that delivery of the online introductory nutrition course in the dual-enrollment program was effective in significantly improving nutrition knowledge of both high school and college students.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of covariance 3acollege students 3acredit 3aeducational status 3ahealth programs 3ahigh school students 3ahigh schools 3anutrition knowledge 3at-test1 aColson, Janet1 aOwusu, Andrew0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S76-S76dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03625naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245010500206506007600311520233100387592002802718506003702746650001902783650001302802650001202815650003302827650001002860650001802870651001102888700002502899700003102924700002402955700002602979700002003005773011903025856007403144852000903218655001203227IND60660449020221207084144.0190823e20190817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066044902DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90805692doi7 aPMC67190822pmcid7 a314264932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz-Lundahl, Sofia 10aIntra- and Inter-Observer Reliability of Qualitative Behaviour Assessments of Housed Sheep in Norway  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study tested the reliability of a Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA) protocol developed for the Norwegian Sheep House (F&aring;reBygg) project. The aim was to verify whether QBA scores were consistent between different observers, i.e., inter-observer reliability, and between scorings of the same observers on different time points, i.e., intra-observer reliability. Six trained observers, including two veterinary students, two animal welfare inspectors and two sheep farmers observed sheep in 16 videos, and independently scored 14 pre-defined behavioural descriptors on visual analogue scales (VAS). The procedure was repeated one week after the first scoring session. QBA scores were analysed using Principal Component Analysis. Inter- and intra-observer agreement was assessed using Kendall&rsquo;s coefficient of concordance (W). Principal component 1 (PC 1) and 2 (PC 2) combined explained >60% of the total variation in the QBA scores in both scoring sessions. PC 1 (44.5% in sessions 1 and 2) ranged from the positive descriptors calm, content, relaxed and friendly to the negative descriptors uneasy, vigilant and fearful, and was therefore labelled mood. PC 2 (18% in session 1, 16.6% in session 2) ranged from bright to dejected and apathetic, and was therefore labelled arousal. Kendall&rsquo;s coefficient of concordance of PC 1 for all observers was high in the two scoring sessions (W = 0.87 and 0.85, respectively), indicating good inter-observer reliability. For PC 2, the agreement for all observers was moderate in both video sessions (W = 0.45 and 0.65). The intra-observer agreement was very high for all observers for PC 1 (W > 0.9) except for one, where the agreement was considered to be high (W = 0.89). For PC 2, Kendall&rsquo;s coefficient was very high for the veterinary students and interpreted as moderate for the two farmers and welfare inspectors. This study indicates that the QBA approach and the terms included in the F&aring;rebygg protocol were reliable for assessing video recordings of sheep behaviour when applied by trained observers, regardless of whether they were a veterinary student, animal welfare inspector or sheep farmer. Further work is needed to examine the reliability of the QBA protocol when tested on-farms for sheep managed under Norwegian housing systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal welfare 3aemotions 3afarmers 3aprincipal component analysis 3asheep 3aveterinarians 3aNorway1 aHellestveit, Selina 1 aStubsjøen, Solveig  Marie1 aJ.

Two sequencing batch biofilm reactors (SBBRs): S1 (the control) and S2 (C6-HSL and 3-oxo-C8-HSL dosing) were used to treat aniline wastewater. The NH₄⁺-N and TN removal rates of S2 were 42.50% and 26.99% higher than S1 in the aerobic phase, respectively. It revealed the nitrogen removal performance of S2 much better than S1. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that many nitrifiers and denitrifiers of S2, such as Nitrosomonas and Thauera, transferred from sludge to biofilm significantly and built closer relationships each other. Overall, main nitrogen removal was contributed by biofilm rather than sludge with the regulation of AHLs. A mild and collaborative environment of biofilms for microorganisms enhanced nitrogen removal. The work provided a new idea for reconciling the contradiction between nitrification and denitrification in aniline wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aThauera 3aaniline 3abiofilm 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3alactones 3amicrobial communities 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3asludge 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aExogenous AHLs 0aAniline degradation 0aSBBR 0aNitrogen removal 0aMicrobial community1 aZhang, Qian1 aHuang, Wansong1 aSong, Jianyang1 aPeng, Haojin1 aFeng, Jiapeng1 aHe, Jing1 aZhang, Yunjie1 aWei, Hua0 tBioresource technology.g2022 May, v. 351 p.127052-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1270523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005200139245010200191300001600293500002000309520230800329592002802637650002302665650002302688650001502711650002702726650001102753650001502764650001302779650002202792650000902814650001102823650001602834650001302850651001202863651001202875700001902887700001702906700002002923700001602943700001802959700001402977773012102991856007303112852000903185655001203194IND60698288520221119210640.0200611e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069828852DNAL7 a10.1111/acv.125372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFolt, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2278-201810aModeling strategies and evaluating success during repatriations of elusive and endangered species  ap. 273-285.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWildlife repatriation is an important tool to decrease extinction risk for imperiled species, but successful repatriations require significant time, resources and planning. Because repatriations can be long and expensive processes, clear release strategies and monitoring programs are essential to efficiently use resources and evaluate success. However, monitoring can be challenging and surrounded by significant uncertainty, particularly for secretive species with extremely low detection probability. Here, we simulated how alternative repatriation strategies influence repatriation success for the eastern indigo snake Drymarchon couperi, a federally‐Threatened species that is currently being repatriated in Alabama and Florida. Critically, we demonstrate how observed population growth can differ from true population growth when detection probabilities are low and mark‐recapture analyses are not an option. Specifically, we built a stochastic stage‐based population model to predict population growth and extinction risk under different release strategies and use information from ongoing repatriations to predict success and guide future releases. Because D. couperi is difficult to monitor, we modeled how detection probability influenced perceptions of abundance and population growth by monitoring programs. Simulated repatriation strategies releasing older, head‐started snakes in greater abundance and frequency created wild populations with decreased extinction risk relative to scenarios releasing fewer and younger snakes less frequently. Ongoing repatriations currently have a 0.23 (Alabama) and 0.61 (Florida) probability of quasi‐extinction, but extinction risk decreased to 0.07 and 0.10 at sites upon achieving the targeted number of releases. Abundances observed under realistic detection thresholds for D. couperi did not always predict true population growth; specifically, we demonstrate that monitoring programs during repatriations of secretive species may indicate that efforts have been unsuccessful when populations are actually growing. Overall, our modeling framework informs release strategies to maximize repatriation success while demonstrating the need to consider how detection processes influence assessment of success during conservation interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrymarchon couperi 3aendangered species 3aextinction 3amark-recapture studies 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3arisk 3asnakes 3auncertainty 3awildlife 3aAlabama 3aFlorida1 aMcGowan, C.

We used fenchone, 1,8-cineol and α-pinene, and soils from phrygana, a typical Mediterranean-type ecosystem where aromatic plants abound, and from another five ecosystem types, focusing on culturable bacteria. Patterns of response were common to all ecosystems, but responses themselves were not always as pronounced in phrygana as in the other ecosystems, suggesting that these enrichments are less of a disturbance there. More specifically, soil respiration and abundance of the bacterial communities increased, becoming from below two up to 16 times as high as in control soils (for both attributes) and remained at high levels as long as these compounds were present. Bacteria that can utilize these three compounds as substrates of growth became dominant members of the bacterial communities in the enriched soils. All changes were readily reversible once monoterpene addition stopped. Bacteria with the ability to utilize these monoterpenes as carbon sources were found in soils from all ecosystems, 15 strains in total, suggesting a rather universal presence; of these, six could also utilize the organic pollutants toluene or p-xylene. These results suggest also potential novel applications of monoterpenes in combating soil pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acineole 3aecosystems 3aessential oils 3asoil bacteria 3asoil pollution 3asoil respiration 3atoluene 3axylene1 aKaramanoli, Katerina 1 aVokou, Despoina 0 tPlants.g2021 Nov. 21, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101125363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016600165300001600331520112900347592002801476650001501504650002001519650001701539650001301556650001801569653001001587653001601597653001301613653001101626653002701637700001901664700001701683700001901700700001901719773011101738856008301849852000901932655001201941IND60553604120221122171221.0180831e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055360412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Bao-Zhu10aDirect fluorescence detection of microRNA based on enzymatically engineered primer extension poly-thymine (EPEPT) reaction using copper nanoparticles as nano-dye  ap. 216-221.  aA new strategy based on enzymatically engineered primer extension poly-thymine (EPEPT) and nanomaterials in situ generation technology is reported for direct detection of microRNA (miRNA) in a fluorescence turn-on format using the sequential and complementary reactions catalyzed by Klenow Fragment exo⁻ (KFexo⁻) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdTase). The short miRNA can be efficiently converted into long poly-thymine (polyT) sequences, which function as template for in situ formation of fluorescence copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) as nano-dye for detecting miRNA. The polyT-CuNPs can effectively form and emit intense red fluorescence under the 340nm excitation. For the proof of concept, microRNA-21 (miR-21) was selected as the model target to testify this strategy as a versatile assay platform. By directly using miR-21 as the primer, the simple, rapid and sensitive miRNA detection was successfully achieved with a good linearity between 1pM and 1nM and a detection limit of 100fM. Thus, the EPEPT strategy holds great potential in biochemical sensing research as an efficient and universal platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3amicroRNA 3ananoparticles 0amiRNA 0aPolyT-CuNPs 0aKFexo− 0aTdTase 0aFluorescence detection1 aLiang, Ru-Ping1 aQiu, Wei-Bin1 aYuan, Yan-Hong1 aQiu, Jian-Ding0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 87 p.216-221dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006200174300001600236520102600252592002801278650001201306650001501318650001201333650001001345650001301355650001801368650002001386650001701406650001001423653000801433653001201441653002601453653001401479653000901493653002201502653001401524700001901538700001701557700001901574773009801593856008501691852000901776655001201785IND60603704320221118055116.0180716e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060370432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSjöström, Johan,10aThermal exposure from large scale ethanol fuel pool fires  ap. 229-237.  aThe growing use of ethanol as fuel for combustion engines has dramatically increased the need for large scale storage of ethanol in tanks. There are new risks related to fires in storage tanks having larger volumes. Very little experimental data exist to support risk assessments regarding emitted radiation and burning rate for large pool fires. Experience from small scale tests show that the exposure to nearby surroundings is less for alcohols than for hydrocarbon fuels like gasoline and these results are often extrapolated to fires of large sizes. This paper describes the results of two pool fires conducted within the frame of the ETANKFIRE project, one with 97% ethanol and 3% gasoline and the other with 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, both with a surface area of 254m². The results show, contrary to experience from small scale pool fires, that the exposure to nearby surroundings is much larger for ethanol-rich fuels compared to the calculated radiative heat flux from a pure gasoline fire of same fuel area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acombustion 3aethanol 3afires 3agasoline 3aheat transfer 3arisk assessment 3asurface area 3atanks 0aE85 0aAlcohol 0aLarge scale pool fire 0aRadiation 0aTest 0aPlate thermometer 0aTank fire1 aAmon, Francine1 aAppel, Glenn1 aPersson, Henry0 tFire safety journal.g2015 Nov., v. 78 p.229-237dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008300164300002000247520105700267592002801324650001301352650001501365650001101380650002301391650001301414650002201427650001901449700002701468700002901495700002101524773012401545856007501669852000901744655001201753IND60636163520221120064016.0190506e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063616352DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04537a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalaspina, Thaciana10aAssessing the interaction between surfactant-like peptides and lipid membranes  ap. 35973-35981.  aAtomistic molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the interaction of AₙK peptides (with n = 3, 6 and 9) in contact with two different types of lipid membranes, DPPC and DPPG. PMF calculations and their decomposition into enthalpic and entropic components allowed a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the energy profile associated with the adsorption and penetration of the peptides through the lipid membranes. Our simulations indicated a drastic difference between the interactions of the peptides with both membranes. For the peptide A₆K the interaction with the DPPG and DPPC membranes were −222 kJ mol⁻¹ and −16 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively. PMF for the DPPC membrane did not show any minimum in the interface region, that is, no favorable interaction with its surface. On the other hand, the interaction with the DPPG membrane showed a clear minimum near the surface. This minimum, although shallow, −10 kJ mol⁻¹, indicates that the adhesion of the AₙK peptides on the surface of the DPPG membranes is a favorable process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3alipids 3amolecular dynamics 3apeptides 3asimulation models 3athermodynamics1 aColherinhas, Guilherme1 ade Oliveira Outi, Felipe1 aFileti, Eudes E.0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 19, v. 7, no. 57 p.35973-35981dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04537a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245012500177300001800302520148600320592002801806650001401834650004001848650001601888650002101904650001901925650001101944650001801955650001801973650002001991650001902011650002102030650001402051650001102065650001202076650001302088650001802101650002002119650001302139650001302152650001002165700001902175700002302194700002502217700002302242700002202265773014502287856008202432852000902514655001202523IND60681766320221121034439.0200117e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068176632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-10301-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro, Larindja A. M.10aUse of phage ϕ6 to inactivate Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae in kiwifruit plants: in vitro and ex vivo experiments  ap. 1319-1330.  aOver the last years, the global production and trade of kiwifruit has been severely impacted by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), a phytopathogen that causes a disease in kiwifruit plants known as bacterial canker. The available treatments for this disease are still scarce, with the most common involving frequently spraying the orchards with disinfectants, copper-based bactericides and/or antibiotics. Moreover, these treatments should be avoided due to their high toxicity to the environment and promotion of bacterial resistance. Phage therapy may be an alternative approach to inactivate Psa. The present study investigated the potential application of the already commercially available bacteriophage (or phage) ϕ6 to control Psa infections. The inactivation of Psa was assessed in vitro, using liquid culture medium, and ex vivo, using artificially contaminated kiwifruit leaves with two biovar 3 (a highly aggressive pathogen) strains (Psa CRA-FRU 12.54 and Psa CRA-FRU 14.10). In the in vitro experiments, the phage ϕ6 was effective against both strains (maximum reduction of 2.2 and 1.9 CFU/mL for Psa CRA-FRU 12.54 and Psa CRA-FRU 14.10, respectively). In the ex vivo tests, the decrease was lower (maximum reduction 1.1 log and 1.8 CFU/mL for Psa CRA-FRU 12.54 and Psa CRA-FRU 14.10, respectively). The results of this study suggest that the commercially available phage ϕ6 can be an effective alternative to control Psa infections in kiwifruit orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinidia 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae 3aantibiotics 3abacterial canker 3abacteriophages 3acopper 3aculture media 3adisinfectants 3aex vivo studies 3afruit diseases 3ain vitro studies 3akiwifruit 3aleaves 3aliquids 3aorchards 3aphage therapy 3aplant pathogens 3aspraying 3atoxicity 3atrade1 aPereira, Carla1 aBarreal, M.

Methods: 15N-labelled leaf litter was traced in situ into abiotic and biotic N pools in mineral soil as well as into beech seedlings and mycorrhizal root tips over three growing seasons. Results: There was a rapid transfer of 15N into the mineral soil already 21 days after tracer application with soil microbial biomass initially representing the dominant litter-N sink. However, 15N recovery in non-extractable soil N pools strongly increased over time and subsequently became the dominant 15N sink. Recovery in plant biomass accounted for only 0.025 % of 15N excess after 876 days. After three growing seasons, 15N excess recovery was characterized by the following sequence: non-extractable soil N >> extractable soil N including microbial biomass >> plant biomass > ectomycorrhizal root tips. Conclusions: After quick vertical dislocation and cycling through microbial N pools, there was a rapid stabilization of leaf-litter-derived N in non-extractable N pools of the mineral soil. Very low 15N recovery in beech seedlings suggests a high importance of other N sources such as root litter for N nutrition of beech understorey. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3aforests 3agrowing season 3alabeling techniques 3amicrobial biomass 3amineral soils 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aplant litter 3aroot tips 3aseedlings 3asoil treatment 3aunderstory 3aGermany1 aSimon, Judy1 aGasche, R.,1 aNaumann, Pascale Sarah1 aBimüller, Carolin1 aPena, Rodica1 aPolle, Andrea1 aKögel-Knabner, Ingrid,1 aZeller, Bernd1 aRennenberg, H.q(Heinz),1 aDannenmann, Michael0 tPlant and soil.g2013 Aug., v. 369, no. 1-2 p.657-668dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-1603-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009300159500001900252500002000271520129100291592002801582596002601610650002301636650000801659650001901667650001001686650002301696650001101719650002101730650001101751700002501762700006101787700003201848700002001880700002501900700002301925773014301948856007402091852000902165655001202174IND60725486520221118194856.0210126e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072548652DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.150452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIntanon, Winai10aInhibition of the aflatoxin‐producing fungus Aspergillus flavus by a plasma jet system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was aimed to determine the effects of a plasma jet of mixed argon and oxygen (Ar‐O₂) on Aspergillus flavus growth in potato dextrose broth (PDA). Settings for power, discharge duration, and gas flow rate of the plasma jet system (PJS) were optimized over ranges of 10–20 W, 1–10 min, and 3–9 L/min, respectively. The optimal conditions required to inhibit 100% of A. flavus growth at 30°C for 48 hr were 20 W, 10 min, and 9 L/min, respectively. The PJS inhibited 100% of the A. flavus growth in 20 replicates of infected peeled peanuts. Aspergillus flavus cell walls were destroyed via lipid and cell membrane oxidization, resulting in lost osmotic capability and damaged DNA and enzymes. However, the PJS is limited by a short exposure distance. More power, longer exposure, and increased gas flow might be needed to increase the distance while maintaining 100% microbial growth inhibition. Application to real foods and agricultural products, and upscaling the PJS for industrial use will be assessed in further studies. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Our proposed plasma system could be applied to postharvested agricultural products such as dried peanuts and chili. However, the technology will require validation before it can be applied in an industrial scale.  aPublisher supplied data  cChiang Mai University 3aAspergillus flavus 3aDNA 3acell membranes 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3alipids 3amicrobial growth 3aoxygen1 aVichiansan, Norrapon1 aLeksakul, Komgrit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6877-15981 aBoonyawan, D.q(Dheerawan),1 aKumla, Jaturong1 aSuwannarach, Nakarin1 aLumyong, Saisamorn0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e15045-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.150453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012600174520186400300592002802164650001502192650001402207650002302221650002702244650001902271650002902290650000902319650001402328650001902342650001402361650000702375650001502382650001002397650001702407650001502424653001402439653002702453653002102480653003902501653001502540700005602555700002102611700001802632700002402650700006502674773011802739856008202857852000902939655001202948IND60735797120221118183626.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073579712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Lan Hương,10aImproving Fenton-like oxidation of Rhodamin B using a new catalyst based on magnetic/iron-containing waste slag composite  aHeterogeneous catalytic Fenton of Rhodamine B (RhB) was enhanced by magnetic waste iron slag composite (MIS) as a novel catalyst. The MIS was successfully enriched by an increase in mass rate of Fe element from 26.60% (in iron slag-IS) to 50.68% (in MIS-10). Besides, the textural properties of MIS-10 were remarkably improved in porous structure and BET specific surface area compared with IS. An almost complete degradation of RhB was obtained at the composite ratio between mixture of (Fe2+ and Fe3+) and IS of 10% (w/w), solution pH of 3, H₂O₂ of 1680 mg/L and catalyst dosage of 4000 mg/L for both IS/H₂O₂ and MIS-10/H₂O₂ systems within 120 min reaction time At this optimal operational condition, the decolorization and mineralization of RhB, respectively, reached 71.84% and 59.75% for IS/H₂O₂ system and 98.48% and 83.33% for MIS-10/H₂O₂ system. The first-order reaction rate constant (Kd) values of the pseudo-first-order kinetic followed the same sequence as COD removal. The Fe amount enriched in MIS-10’s constituent was proved the improving considerably reaction rate with H₂O₂ to generate continuously more hydroxyl (.OH) radicals which led to higher oxidation of RhB by MIS-10/H₂O₂ compared with IS/H₂O₂. The mechanisms of RhB enhanced degradation included adsorption, leaching iron through homogeneous Fenton reactions and heterogeneous Fenton reaction. The main mechanism of RhB oxidation by MIS-10/H₂O₂ system was through .OH which was produced by heterogeneous Fenton reaction due to the contribution of Fe elements enriched on the catalyst’s surface. The MIS-10 exhibited a high stability with very low iron leaching and maintained a high catalytic activity after 5 successive cycles, indicating MIS-10 is fully promising catalyst for Fenton oxidation of persistent organic compound from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecolorization 3aenvironmental technology 3airon 3amagnetism 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3apH 3arhodamines 3aslags 3asurface area 3awastewater 0aIron slag 0aHeterogeneous catalyst 0aFenton oxidation 0aMagnetic waste iron slag composite 0aRhodamin B1 aVan, Huu Tap1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9584-83831 aNgo, Quoc Nguyen1 aThai, Van Nam1 aHoàng, Văn Hùng,1 aHai, Nguyen Thi Thanh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4816-29440 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101582-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245014300175300001600318520121900334592002801553650002101581650002301602650001101625650002101636650001301657650000901670650002601679650001601705650002101721650002201742650001601764700001901780700001801799700001701817700002501834773007501859856008901934990002302023852000902046655001202055IND60096035220221120225827.0141104e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009603522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.04.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Joung-Man10aInterfacial, fire retardancy, and thermal stability evaluation of graphite oxide (GO)-phenolic composites with different GO particle sizes  ap. 290-296.  aMechanical and thermal properties of graphite oxide (GO)-phenolic composites were evaluated for different sizes of GO. Tensile tests on the composites with larger sizes of GO particles typically exhibited better mechanical properties. After ageing tests at 200°C a decline in the mechanical properties of GO-phenolic composites was observed but this decline was less than that for neat phenolic resin. This was attributed to the GO absorbing thermal energy and thereby reducing damage to the molecular chain in the resin. The ageing tests, also suggested that the wettability of specimens improved with the addition of GO, which might be attributed to microvoid formation on specimen’s surface during the elapsed time at the elevated temperature. The chemical structures of neat phenolic resin was relatively easily broken-up by thermal damage, whereas GO-phenolic composites exhibited better thermal stability in both thermal analysis and flame retardant testing. The GO particles exhibited reinforcing effects that served to protect chemical bonding in the phenolic resin. It appears, therefore, that GO composites may be good candidates for us as heat and flame resisting materials, for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3aflame retardants 3agraphene 3aheat 3amechanical properties 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3athermal stability 3awettability1 aKwon, Dong-Jun1 aWang, Zuo-Jia1 aGu, Ga-Young1 aDeVries, K.

To inform restoration objectives with data sources that can characterize individual trees, groups of trees, and the entire stand, different remote sensing strategies such as aerial and terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have been explored. Unfortunately, high equipment and operational costs of aerial systems, along with limited spatial extent of terrestrial scanners, have restricted widespread adoption of these technologies for repeated forest monitoring. This study investigates applications of unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery for Structure from Motion derived modeling of individual tree and stand-level metrics. Specifically, we evaluate how flight parameters impact UAS extracted height and imputed DBH accuracies against field stem-mapped values. In total, 30 UAS image datasets collected from combinations of three altitudes, two flight patterns, and five camera orientations were assessed. Tree heights were extracted using a variable window function that searched UAS-derived canopy height models, while DBH was sampled from point cloud slices at 1.32–1.42 m using a least squares circle fitting algorithm. The sample trees were then filtered against National Forest Inventory data from the study region to ensure reasonable matching of extracted heights and diameters. The matched values were used to create a height to diameter relationship for predicting missing DBH values. Extracted and imputed tree values were compared against stem-mapped values to determine tree commission and omission rates, the accuracy and precision of extracted tree height, DBH, as well as overstory and understory stand density. Finding that, 1) tree extraction accuracy and correctness was maximized (F-score = 0.77) for nadir crosshatch UAS flight designs; 2) extracted tree height R² with stem-mapped values was high (R² ≥ 0.98) for all UAS flight parameters, but the quality (mean error = 0.79 cm) and quantity (~10% of all trees) of extracted DBH values was maximized for lower altitude, nadir crosshatch acquisitions; 3) the distribution of predicted DBH values most closely matched field observed values for off-nadir crosshatch flight designs; 4) using either off-nadir or crosshatch flight designs at lower altitudes maximized correlation (r > 0.70) and accuracy (basal area within 2 m² ha⁻¹) of stand density estimates. This study demonstrates a novel UAS-based inventory strategy for estimating individual tree structural attributes (i.e., location, height, and DBH) in dry conifer forests, without the need for in situ field observations.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3acameras 3acanopy height 3aconifers 3adata collection 3aflight 3aforest inventory 3alidar 3anational forests 3aoverstory 3astand density 3atree height 3atrees 3aunderstory 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aTree detection 0aCanopy height model 0aForest inventory 0aUnmanned aerial system 0aForest structure1 aTinkham, Wade T.1 aVogeler, Jody C.1 aHudak, Andrew T.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 263 p.112540-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.1125403Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010900170300001400279520197400293592002802267650002602295650002002321650001302341650001002354650000902364650002702373650003202400650002602432650001502458650004302473650001102516650001402527651001402541653002702555653001902582653002002601653000802621653001602629653001102645653000902656700001902665700001702684700002002701700002602721773013902747856008402886852000902970655001202979IND60560342020221119230645.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056034202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2016.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestman, Mark E.10aComparison of three feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) point-of-care antigen test kits using blood and saliva  ap. 88-96.  aFeline leukaemia virus (FeLV) can be a challenging infection to diagnose due to a complex feline host-pathogen relationship and occasionally unreliable test results. This study compared the accuracy of three point-of-care (PoC) FeLV p27 antigen test kits commonly used in Australia and available commercially worldwide (SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo, Witness FeLV/FIV and Anigen Rapid FIV/FeLV), using detection of FeLV provirus by an in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay as the diagnostic gold standard. Blood (n=563) and saliva (n=419) specimens were collected from a population of cats determined to include 491 FeLV-uninfected and 72 FeLV-infected individuals (45 progressive infections [p27 and qPCR positive], 27 regressive infections [p27 negative, qPCR positive]). Sensitivity and specificity using whole blood was 63% and 94% for SNAP Combo, 57% and 98% for Witness, and 57% and 98% for Anigen Rapid, respectively. SNAP Combo had a significantly lower specificity using blood compared to the other two kits (P=0.004 compared to Witness, P=0.007 compared to Anigen Rapid). False-positive test results occurred with all three kits using blood, and although using any two kits in parallel increased specificity, no combination of kits completely eliminated the occurrence of false-positive results. We therefore recommend FeLV proviral PCR testing for any cat that tests positive with a PoC FeLV antigen kit, as well as for any cat that has been potentially exposed to FeLV but tests negative with a FeLV antigen kit, before final assignment of FeLV status can be made with confidence. For saliva testing, sensitivity and specificity was 54% and 100%, respectively, for all three test kits. The reduced sensitivity of saliva testing compared to blood testing, although not statistically significant, suggests saliva testing with the current generation of PoC FeLV antigen kits is unsuitable for screening large populations of cats, such as in shelters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFeline leukemia virus 3aanalytical kits 3aantigens 3ablood 3acats 3afalse positive results 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3apoint-of-care systems 3aproviruses 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asaliva 3ascreening 3aAustralia 0aFeline leukaemia virus 0aFeLV diagnosis 0aAntigen testing 0aPCR 0aWhole blood 0aSaliva 0aCats1 aMalik, Richard1 aHall, Evelyn1 aSheehy, Paul A.1 aNorris, Jacqueline M.0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2017 Feb., v. 50 p.88-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2016.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100003700195245012800232506010400360506007600464506003100540520167000571592002802241596008302269596004502352506003702397650001102434650001702445650001702462650001402479650001702493650001902510650001202529651001602541653001702557653002002574653001702594653002602611653002202637653002002659700002502679700001902704700002202723700002402745700002402769773011002793856008702903852000902990655001202999IND60762382420221215142556.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076238242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1045232chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1045232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendriks-Hartensveld, Anouk E.M.14aThe relative importance of complexity, variety, and portion size in ice cream preference in Dutch and American participants  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFood variety, complexity, and portion size each influence food choice and consumption, but their relative importance is poorly understood. In an online discrete choice-experiment, we investigated the relative importance of variety, complexity, and portion size in consumer preferences by systematically varying ice cream offerings. Complexity was defined as the presence of different components within a scoop (e.g., chunks or flavors), while variety was defined as combinations of ice cream scoops that differ in flavor and/or texture. A choice-based conjoint questionnaire with two sections was presented to 498 Dutch (50.8% females) and 502 American (52.6% females) consumers aged between 18 and 65 years. Section 1 tested the relative importance of complexity and variety in consumer preferences, while Section 2 tested the relative importance of variety and portion size in preferences. Participants chose their preferred option when presented with various ice cream options showing different levels of variety and complexity (Section 1), or different levels of variety and portion sizes (Section 2). Across countries, variety was a stronger driver of ice cream preference than complexity, but the most preferred ice cream options were both varied and complex. Further, across countries, flavor was more important than portion size, and again a variety of flavors was the most preferred. Finally, American participants overall preferred larger portion sizes than did Dutch participants. These data indicate variety is a key determinant of food preference, at least within the context of this study, for consumers in both the Netherlands and the United States.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflavor 3afood choices 3afood quality 3aice cream 3aportion size 3aquestionnaires 3atexture 3aNetherlands 0aFood variety 0aFood complexity 0aPortion size 0aChoice-based conjoint 0aChoice experiment 0aFood preference1 aBrodock, Jennifer L.1 aHayes, John E.1 aRolls, Barbara J.1 aKeller, Kathleen L.1 aHavermans, Remco C.0 tFood quality and preference.g2022 July, v. 99 p.104523-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1045233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009300168300001400261520100000275592002801275650002301303650001801326650001801344650001501362650002901377650001301406650001301419650002301432650001101455650002001466650002101486650002101507650001901528650000901547650001401556650001601570650001301586653002301599653002301622653003201645700001901677700001901696700001701715700001901732700001801751773013901769856008401908852000901992655001202001IND60560342120221119231121.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056034212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2016.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsueh, Kai-Jen10aTranscutaneous immunization of Streptococcus suis bacterin using dissolving microneedles  ap. 78-87.  aVaccine delivery using microneedle (MN) patches is an easy, safe and painless alternative to traditional needle injections. In this study, we examined whether MN patches can enhance the efficacy of a Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) vaccine in a mouse model. Results showed that MNs can reach 200–250μm into the skin, a depth beneficial for targeted delivery of antigens to antigen-presenting cells in the epidermis and dermis. Vaccination with prime-boost of MN induced higher levels of IgG2a antibody titer, T cell proliferation, and TH1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-12) as compared to intramuscular (IM) injection. In addition, single dose MN vaccination better protected mice against lethal challenge than IM vaccination. MN vaccination also conferred long-term IgG2a antibody against S. suis 2 bacteria presence for up to 7 months. Taken together, these data showed that vaccine delivery by MNs results in superior immune response and protection rate when compared to IM injections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus suis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aantigens 3abacteria 3acell proliferation 3adermis 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-12 3amice 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aMicroneedles (MNs) 0aStreptococcus suis 0aTranscutaneous immunization1 aChen, Mei-Chin1 aCheng, Li-Ting1 aLee, Jai-Wei1 aChung, Wen-Bin1 aChu, Chun-Yen0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2017 Feb., v. 50 p.78-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2016.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016300166300001600329520203500345592002802380650001202408650001602420650001802436650001102454650001902465650001702484650001302501650002302514650002202537650002402559650001602583651001302599653001702612653002602629653002302655653002002678653002402698700001902722700001802741700002602759700002102785773011502806856008302921852000903004655001203013IND60605539220221119171219.0200517e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060553922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2018.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuraire, Mohd10aSeasonal changes in abundance of four Acartia species (Copepoda, Calanoida) in the coastal waters of Peninsular Malaysia; relationship with monsoon transition  ap. 101-111.  aThe seasonal variation of Acartia copepods from the waters of Peninsular Malaysia was studied via monthly observations at 2 fixed stations on the west coast (Pulau Pinang and Port Dickson) and 2 fixed stations on the east coast (Kijal and Penyabong) from October 2012 to March 2014. In situ temperatures recorded during this period were relatively constant (mean 29.6±0.7°C) at all stations. Salinity measurements were also fairly constant (mean 30.3 ± 1.1 PSU) for all stations during this study except at Penyabong where the salinity during the northeast (NE) monsoon season was significantly lower (p<0.05) (mean 23.2 ± 7.9 PSU) than during the southwest (SW) monsoon season. Concentration of chlorophyll a at Pulau Pinang during the SW monsoon period was significantly higher (p<0.05) (mean 14.6±5.4μg/L) than during the NE monsoon period. Four species of Acartia were identified at all stations: A. amboinensis, A. erythraea, A. pacifica and A. spinicauda. At Kijal, Acartia erythraea population was significantly higher (p<0.05) (mean 695.7 ± 618.4 inds/m³) compared with the other stations. Acartia species composition at Port Dickson was similar to Penyabong, while Kijal was similar to Pulau Pinang. Small-sized species, Acartia pacifica and A. spinicauda were dominant at Port Dickson and Penyabong, while the larger-sized species, Acartia amboinensis and A. erythraea were dominant at Kijal. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were applied to abundance data to describe the environmental preference associated with population recruitment of these species, and the results identified a relative contrast in environmental envelopes occupied by the larger and smaller-sized species. The large-sized species preferred colder and more saline water while the small-sized species preferred warmer and lower salinity water. The succession and co-occurrence of similar sized species is suggested to be a result of the combined effect of species-specific preference to varying temperature–salinity regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3amonsoon season 3asaline water 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3aspecies recruitment 3atemperature 3aMalaysia 0aAcartia spp. 0aSeasonal distribution 0aStraits of Malacca 0aSouth China Sea 0aPeninsular Malaysia1 aCob, Zaidi Che1 aToda, Tatsuki1 aOthman, Bin Haji Ross1 aYoshida, Teruaki0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2018 July, v. 22 p.101-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2018.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245007200160300001600232520108600248592002801334650002501362650001001387650000901397650001001406650002601416650002001442650003301462650001901495650001601514650001401530650001901544650001801563653001801581653002401599653002101623653002301644653003101667700001301698700001401711773012901725856008001854852000901934655001201943IND60622195520221120063531.0181124e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062219552DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132177133312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChong, KY10aThermosonication and optimization of stingless bee honey processing  ap. 608-622.  aThe effects of thermosonication on the quality of a stingless bee honey, the Kelulut, were studied using processing temperature from 45 to 90 ℃ and processing time from 30 to 120 minutes.

Current FCM control strategies include the use of chemical insecticides. However, FCM has developed resistance to some of the insecticides, and stringent chemical residue restrictions have been imposed by some foreign markets. Thus, the demand for high-quality fruit has translated into a need for new, efficient and effective integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. One such strategy is the control of the soil-dwelling life stages of FCM, using entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF). Both of the biocontrol agents concerned have individually been shown to be effective against FCM. However, it is possible that, if they are applied simultaneously, a synergistic relationship might be observed between EPNs and EPF that could serve to enhance their efficacy against the target pest. In addition to reviewing previous and current control options against FCM in South African fruit crops, this study investigates the potential for using EPNs and EPF individually, and in combination, as biological control agents against FCM within an IPM system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThaumatotibia leucotreta 3abiological control agents 3achemical residues 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aforeign markets 3afruit crops 3afruits 3ainsecticides 3aintegrated pest management 3apests 3aSouth Africa 0abiological control 0aentomopathogenic nematodes 0aentomopathogenic fungi 0amanagement 0aThaumatotibia leucotreta1 aDiest, J.I. von1 aMoore, S.D.1 aAddison, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8227-339X0 tAfrican entomology.g2018 Apr., v. 26, no. 1 p.14-29dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.026.00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01661naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012500160300001600285520071100301592002801012650001901040650002101059650001801080650001701098650002201115700001501137700001801152700002101170773009901191856004801290852000901338655001201347IND50063746820221122003340.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006374682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5555-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Tian10aSynthesis and properties of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene/WS₂ nanoparticle fiber for bullet-proof materials   ap. 945-948.  aUltrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)/WS₂ nanoparticle fibers were prepared by adding WS₂ nanoparticles treated by coupling agent in the precursor solution of UHMWPE.

Hydrophobicity increased when protein was cooked and denatured (P < 0.05). Protein oxidation was increased based on levels of SH, S‐S and carbonyl groups during the cooking process (P < 0.05). Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE) revealed that the intensity of myosin heavy chain band was decreased while biopolymer band was denser when sausages were cooked. Sausages with 1.8% salt and 0.3% phosphate (S1P1) showed the lowest digestibility and maintained a flat and compact structure, unlike other treatments during the gastrointestinal digestive stage. SDS‐PAGE of digested chicken sausages showed that protein bands were degraded into small bands followed by gradual disappearance. In conclusion, cooking process can lead to protein denaturation and oxidation, regardless of levels of salt and phosphate added. In addition, adding salt and phosphate can significantly affect the digestibility of meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3achickens 3adigestion 3agastrointestinal system 3ahydrophobicity 3ameat 3ameat protein 3amyosin heavy chains 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein denaturation 3asodium dodecyl sulfate1 aChin, Koo Bok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8062-63310 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2021 Oct., v. 56, no. 10 p.5250-5258dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.151813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245011700160300001800277520170000295592002801995650001402023650002002037650001102057650001502068650001602083650001702099700002002116700003002136700002202166700002102188700002302209773014502232856007202377852000902449655001202458IND60661956020221122234911.0190904e20091202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066195602DNAL7 a10.1039/b907137g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrixey, Laurie A.14aThe effect of a tall tower on flow and dispersion through a model urban neighborhoodPart 2. Pollutant dispersion  ap. 2171-2179.  aThis article is the second in a two-paper series presenting results from wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of flow and dispersion in an idealized model urban neighborhood. Pollutant dispersion results are presented and discussed for a model neighborhood that was characterized by regular city blocks of three-story row houses with a single 12-story tower located at the downwind edge of one of these blocks. The tower had three significant effects on pollutant dispersion in the surrounding street canyons: drawing the plume laterally towards the tower, greatly enhancing the vertical dispersion of the plume in the wake of the tower, and significantly decreasing the residence time of pollutants in the wake of the tower. In the wind tunnel, tracer gas released in the avenue lee of the tower, but several blocks away laterally, was pulled towards the tower and lifted in the wake of the tower. The same lateral movement of the pollutant was seen in the next avenue, which was approximately 2.5 tower heights downwind of the tower. The tower also served to ventilate the street canyon directly in its wake more rapidly than the surrounding areas. This was evidenced by CFD simulations of concentration decay where the residence time of pollutants lee of the 12-story tower was found to be less than half the residence time behind a neighboring three-story building. This same phenomenon of rapid vertical dispersion lee of a tower among an array of smaller buildings was also demonstrated in a separate set of wind tunnel experiments using an array of cubical blocks. A similar decrease in the residence time was observed when the height of one block was increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3afluid mechanics 3amodels 3apollutants 3aurban areas 3awind tunnels1 aHeist, David K.1 aRichmond-Bryant, Jennifer1 aBowker, George E.1 aPerry, Steven G.1 aWiener, Russell W.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2009 Dec. 2, v. 11, no. 12 p.2171-2179dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b907137g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010100162300001600263520143600279592002801715650002601743650001301769650001601782650001301798650001101811650001201822650001001834650002601844650002301870650001701893650000901910653002001919653002401939653001801963653001701981700001301998700001402011700001702025700001302042700001902055700001402074700001502088773014602103856008302249852000902332655001202341IND60586157120221120034844.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058615712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Xun10aLOX-related collagen crosslink changes act as an initiator of bone fragility in a ZDF rats model  ap. 821-827.  aDiabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) results in bone abnormalities that manifest as increased bone fragility. Bone consists of two phases, the mineral phase and the matrix phase, and disorders in both are seen in DM2. However, the phase in which DM2 mediated bone fragility is initiated is still unknown. In this study, a male Zucker diabetic fatty (fa/fa) (ZDF) rat model was used to investigate the underlying mechanism initiating DM2 mediated bone fragility. The fracture surface morphology, pre- and post-yield bone mechanical behavior, insoluble collagen volume, lysyl oxidase family (LOX) enzyme levels and correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between insoluble collagen and post-yield behavior. Four weeks after the induction of diabetes, insoluble collagen was decreased in only the matrix phase in diabetic rats. Consistently, mechanical testing of the bone showed changes only in post-yield behavior. Diabetic rats also had decreased levels of enzymes involved in insoluble collagen formation (LOX and LOXL1 families). Correlation analysis demonstrated that insoluble collagen was a positive regressor of post-yield displacement (R = 0.894, P < 0.001) and post-yield energy (R = 0.918, P < 0.001). Together, these findings suggest that bone fragility in DM2 is initiated in the matrix phase and that the LOX family may play a critical part in the pathogenesis of DM2 mediated bone fragility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3acollagen 3acorrelation 3adiabetes 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3amales 3amechanical properties 3amechanical testing 3apathogenesis 3arats 0aType 2 diabetes 0aDiabetic osteopathy 0aLysyl oxidase 0aMatrix phase1 aRen, Jie1 aChen, Jun1 aLiu, Zhaohui1 aTian, Ye1 aNabar, Neel R.1 aWang, Min1 aHao, Liang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 495, no. 1 p.821-827dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007300167300001600240520146000256592002801716650002001744650001801764650001401782650002001796650001601816650002601832650001101858650001901869650002601888700002001914700006301934700002201997773011902019856008202138852000902220655001202229IND60605539720221119171428.0181129e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060553972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2018.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodhouse, Anna10aSustainability checklist in support of the design of food processing  ap. 110-120.  aTo source food ingredients produced by best practice, reducing food loss in the processing line and implementation of new technologies are some examples of changes in the management in the food and drink sector that may offer advantages from a sustainability perspective. There are several tools and methods for evaluating sustainability for a food processing technology but often specific methodological knowledge is essential and many companies may not be able to carry out such a study due to time constraints and lack of data. The aim of this paper is to provide a tool with the format of a qualitative sustainability checklist, based on existing Life Cycle Assessment theory. The checklist is devoted to the design and adaptation of processing in the food industry to clarify the potential hot spots in new process design and is focused on environmental sustainability, although other aspects were conferred as well to demonstrate its potential. To identify the potential of this kind of checklist, it was tested by four food companies. The participant feedback was in general positive. The companies highlighted the benefits of creating awareness of sustainability issues within the company and providing a good overview without data collection. From a scientific point of view, the approach can help to overcome several challenges in sustainability assessment in the agri-food sector, especially some modeling issues and spatio-temporal resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afood industry 3afood loss 3afood processing 3aingredients 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3aprocess design 3aprocessing technology1 aDavis, Jennifer1 aPénicaud, Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1161-02721 aÖstergren, Karin0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2018 Oct., v. 16 p.110-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2018.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100003500190245009600225300001800321520093200339592002801271653002601299653001601325653003301341653003401374653002601408653003801434653001501472700002501487700002001512700002201532700001901554700002001573700003101593700002201624773008001646856008301726852000901809655001201818IND60555294720221121053551.0161026e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055529472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.0122doi7 aPMC45883932pmcid7 a265011142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubicek-Sutherland, Jessica Z.10aHost-dependent Induction of Transient Antibiotic Resistance: A Prelude to Treatment Failure  ap. 1169-1178.  aCurrent antibiotic testing does not include the potential influence of host cell environment on microbial susceptibility and antibiotic resistance, hindering appropriate therapeutic intervention. We devised a strategy to identify the presence of host–pathogen interactions that alter antibiotic efficacy in vivo. Our findings revealed a bacterial mechanism that promotes antibiotic resistance in vivo at concentrations of drug that far exceed dosages determined by standardized antimicrobial testing. This mechanism has escaped prior detection because it is reversible and operates within a subset of host tissues and cells. Bacterial pathogens are thereby protected while their survival promotes the emergence of permanent drug resistance. This host-dependent mechanism of transient antibiotic resistance is applicable to multiple pathogens and has implications for the development of more effective antimicrobial therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aMIC testing 0aAntibiotic-resistant mutants 0aMultidrug-resistant pathogens 0aAntimicrobial therapy 0aAntibiotic susceptibility testing 0aSalmonella1 aHeithoff, Douglas M.1 aErsoy, Selvi C.1 aShimp, William R.1 aHouse, John K.1 aMarth, Jamey D.1 aTrawick-Smith, Jeffrey W.,1 aMahan, Michael J.0 tEBioMedicine.g2015 Sept., v. 2 p.1169-1178dElsevier B.V.x2352-39647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245013900155300001800294520146400312592002801776650001101804650002201815650001501837650002201852650002401874650001601898650002501914650001201939650001601951650001501967700002201982700002302004700002102027773014502048856007202193852000902265655001202274IND60661956220221122234922.0190904e20091202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066195622DNAL7 a10.1039/b907140g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahn, Intaek10aParameterization of meteorological variables in the process of infiltration of outdoor ultrafine particles into a residential building  ap. 2192-2200.  aAs part of the Brooklyn Traffic Real-Time Ambient Pollutant Penetration and Environmental Dispersion (B-TRAPPED) study, a field investigation was conducted of the mechanisms involved in infiltration of outdoor particles (0.02 μm to 1 μm) into a near-highway urban residential building. Using continuous real-time total number concentration time-series data measured simultaneously at multiple outdoor and indoor locations, the infiltration time was estimated for various indoor sites by using the cross-correlation analysis method. The effects of meteorological variables on infiltration times were also characterized at given locations. In particular, infiltration time was examined as a function of outdoor mean rooftop wind speed. Outdoor and indoor temperature and relative humidity were also investigated in relation to infiltration times. Our results showed that outdoor wind speed was the dominant meteorological parameter affecting the infiltration rate, but no correlation was found with temperature. The outdoor–indoor PM concentration ratio was found to be significantly different for the first and second floors of the test building. Finally, we determined the effectiveness of a protective shelter-in-place area inside the building by calculating infiltration times into the area. We found that the shelter-in-place area offered some protection against the infiltrating particles because of increased attenuation of the outdoor concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloors 3ainfiltration rate 3apollutants 3arelative humidity 3aresidential housing 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3awind speed1 aBrixey, Laurie A.1 aWiener, Russell W.1 aHenkle, Stacy W.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2009 Dec. 2, v. 11, no. 12 p.2192-2200dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b907140g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010500165300001400270520057200284592002800856650001200884650001900896650001400915650002900929650002000958650001300978650002800991650002701019650001101046650001301057650001201070650002101082653002501103653002001128653001601148653001701164653002801181700002801209700005401237700001501291700001501306773011301321856008101434852000901515655001201524IND60605539920221119171624.0180721e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060553992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2018.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeñafiel, I.10aRecyclable supported Pd-NHC catalytic systems for the copper-free Sonogashira cross-coupling in flow  ap. 69-75.  aA new family of well-defined NHC-Pd complexes immobilised onto silica, alumina and titania is reported.

In particular, it investigates the extent to which cultural ecosystem services were considered in urban planning in socialist and post-socialist Zagreb. We conducted a content analysis of three socialist and two post-socialist plans of Zagreb and interview transcripts with urban planners and academics. To take account of the relational character of cultural ecosystem services, we assessed the extent to which urban planning facilitated opportunities for human–ecosystem interactions rather than individual cultural ecosystem services themselves. This revealed planning factors that helped promote and discourage conditions for CES to arise. The findings indicated that socialist planning facilitated interaction opportunities to a wider extent than post-socialist planning, mainly by providing abundant, fair-sized, well-distributed green spaces with clearly outlined functions. The proposed assessment approach could be implemented in the planning process to evaluate how conditions for CES generation are provided by the current planning cycle and inform the process in the following cycle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aecosystems 3aland policy 3apolitics 3avegetation 0aCEB 0aCES 0aCICES 0aES 0aGUP 0aMEA 0aUGBS 0aCultural ecosystem services 0aPost-socialist regime 0aUrban green and blue spaces 0aUrban plans1 aIves, Christopher D.1 aWatkins, Charles0 tLand use policy.g2022 Sept., v. 120 p.106309-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.1063093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001700190245007000207300001800277520114900295592002801444653002301472653003501495653002401530653002301554653003301577700001901610700001301629700001801642700001501660700001701675700001601692700001601708700001401724700002001738700001901758700001701777700001801794700001701812700001701829700001301846700001701859773007901876856008301955852000902038655001202047IND60555294920221121053523.0161026e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055529492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.0142doi7 aPMC46342002pmcid7 a266295452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelroyen, A.10aGrating-based X-ray Dark-field Computed Tomography of Living Mice  ap. 1500-1506.  aChanges in x-ray attenuating tissue caused by lung disorders like emphysema or fibrosis are subtle and thus only resolved by high-resolution computed tomography (CT). The structural reorganization, however, is of strong influence for lung function. Dark-field CT (DFCT), based on small-angle scattering of x-rays, reveals such structural changes even at resolutions coarser than the pulmonary network and thus provides access to their anatomical distribution. In this proof-of-concept study we present x-ray in vivo DFCTs of lungs of a healthy, an emphysematous and a fibrotic mouse. The tomographies show excellent depiction of the distribution of structural – and thus indirectly functional – changes in lung parenchyma, on single-modality slices in dark field as well as on multimodal fusion images. Therefore, we anticipate numerous applications of DFCT in diagnostic lung imaging. We introduce a scatter-based Hounsfield Unit (sHU) scale to facilitate comparability of scans. In this newly defined sHU scale, the pathophysiological changes by emphysema and fibrosis cause a shift towards lower numbers, compared to healthy lung tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDark-field imaging 0aDark-field computed tomography 0aPulmonary emphysema 0aPulmonary fibrosis 0aX-ray phase-contrast imaging1 aYaroshenko, A.1 aHahn, D.1 aFehringer, A.1 aTapfer, A.1 aMüller, M.,1 aNoël, P.B.1 aPauwels, B.1 aSasov, A.1 aYildirim, A.Ö.1 aEickelberg, O.1 aHellbach, K.1 aAuweter, S.D.1 aMeinel, F.G.1 aReiser, M.F.1 aBech, M.1 aPfeiffer, F.0 tEBioMedicine.g2015 Oct., v. 2 p.1500-1506dElsevier B.V.x2352-39647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04106naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245015300167300001600320520240400336592002802740650001502768650002002783650001302803650001102816650001202827650002302839650001602862650001502878650001602893650002002909650001102929650002702940650002602967650000902993650002503002650002403027650002503051650001903076650002203095650001403117651001503131653003703146653002903183653002403212653001203236700001803248700002003266700001903286700001603305773012303321856008703444852000903531655001203540IND60583814720221118230319.0190318e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058381472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGow, L.J.10aSubsurface water-use strategies and physiological responses of subtropical eucalypt woodland vegetation under changing water-availability conditions  ap. 348-360.  aThis study investigated subsurface water-use strategies and physiological responses of subtropical remnant eucalypt woodlands in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. A land surface temperature (LST) model-data approach was used to detect daily use of subsurface water (i.e. soil moisture obtained from depths >30cm and aquifer groundwater) by woody vegetation to a confidence level of 95%. Vegetation subsurface water use was quantified over a 13-year period (2000–2012) coinciding with a series of wet and dry climatic periods. Land surface temperature and subsurface water use time-series data were compared to local meteorological (vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, and soil water availability) and vegetation (leaf area index, stomatal resistance and latent heat loss) data to determine vegetation strategies to declining shallow (<30cm depth) soil water availability. Different vegetation subsurface water-use strategies and physiological response to changes in water availability were identified at inter- and intra-annual time-scales. At the intra-annual scale, frequency of subsurface water use by vegetation was strongly influenced by availability of shallow soil water. From January–September in this landscape, frequency of subsurface water use by vegetation remained relatively constant, supplementing decreasing shallow soil water availability and/or increasing evaporative demand. From October–December, the vegetation opportunistically utilised more abundant shallow soil water arising from more frequent, intense rainfall events, rather than relying on subsurface water. At the inter-annual scale, vegetation increased frequency of subsurface water use and decreased leaf area to reduce latent heat loss in response to dry conditions. Then, during wet years, subsurface water use by vegetation decreased in frequency as water was increasingly sourced from shallow soil layers. However, despite preceding dry periods of different severity, and exhibiting different average annual rainfall, air temperatures and reduction in the frequency of subsurface water use by vegetation, leaf area increased by approximately the same amount for both ‘recovery’ years. This suggests that investment in canopy leaf growth by this vegetation was more sensitive to the onset of increased water availability after drought rather than the overall volume of water made available by rainfall.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aair temperature 3aaquifers 3acanopy 3adrought 3aevaporative demand 3agroundwater 3alandscapes 3alatent heat 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3aphysiological response 3aplant available water 3arain 3astomatal conductance 3asurface temperature 3atime series analysis 3avapor pressure 3awater utilization 3awoodlands 3aQueensland 0aGroundwater-dependent vegetation 0aLand surface temperature 0aVegetation response 0aDrought1 aBarrett, D.J.1 aO’Grady, A.P.1 aRenzullo, L.J.1 aPhinn, S.R.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 248 p.348-360dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009200167300001600259520067000275592002800945650001800973650002200991650002201013650001701035650002001052653001801072653000901090653002501099653002201124700002001146700001701166700001901183700001201202700002101214700001501235700005501250773014601305856008301451852000901534655001201543IND60586157520221120035003.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058615752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Han-wei10aOld drug new tricks: Chlorhexidine acts as a potential allosteric inhibitor toward PAK1  ap. 728-732.  aThis paper describes the identification of chlorhexidine, an agent commonly used in clinical as a novel potential allosteric inhibitor of PAK1. In cellular assays, chlorhexidine showed a good inhibitory profile, and its inhibitory profile was even better than IPA-3, a well-known allosteric inhibitor. In pharmacology experiments, chlorhexidine successfully inhibited the relief of PAK1 dimer and inhibited the activation of PAK1.

The adhesion ability was observed through in vitro and in vivo tests. Intestinal epithelial cells and recombinant Lactobacillus were co-cultured for observation of adhesion. One hundred one-day-old chicks were randomly divided into four groups; C15, C73, C1573 and control. Each chick in C15, C73, C1573 and control were orally gavaged with 200 |jL of fermentation broth of recombinant L. reuteri XNY-Cel15, 200 jiL of fermentation broth of recombinant L. reuteri XNY-Cel73 and 200 jiL of broth containing equal XNY-Cel15 and XNY-Cel73, 200 jiL of MRS broth, once at the beginning of the trial respectively. Recombinant L. reuteri adhered to chick intestinal epithelial cells which co-cultured together in vitro. After feeding for 30 days, the reporter genes of recombinant Lactobacillus was detected in the crop, small intestine and cecum of trial chicks, with their sequences corresponding to those of the insert genes. The digestibility of crude fiber in experimental groups was higher than that in control group; and the digestibility of C15 was significantly higher than other groups (P<0.01). It showed that the recombinant Lactobacillus can survive in the digestive tract of chicken for more than 30 days and helped to decompose the crude fiber in the digestive tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanimal research 3acecum 3achickens 3achicks 3acoculture 3acrude fiber 3aculture media 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestive tract 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3asmall intestine 0aCellulase gene 0aCrude fiber digestibility 0aGastrointestinal adhesion 0aLactobacillus1 aZhang, Jingbo1 aCheng, Peng1 aZhao, Longmei0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2021 June, v. 55, no. 6 p.674-678dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-12413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245007800164300001600242520134600258592002801604650002401632650001401656650001201670650001601682650002701698650001501725650001001740650001201750650002201762650001301784650001801797650001601815650002001831650001101851650001501862650001301877650001201890650001501902650001201917650001601929653002001945653001801965653002101983653001702004653001202021700002402033700001902057700001902076773012902095856008002224852000902304655001202313IND60622196220221120063625.0181124e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062219622DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132177178022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBird, Libby G10aProducts of chickpea processing as texture improvers in gluten-free bread  ap. 690-698.  aRecent market developments raised the need for alternatives to hydrocolloids as texture improver in gluten-free bread. Chickpea exerts several physicochemical properties (water- and oil-binding, emulsifying and foaming) that might address this need. Therefore, the effect of processing on chickpea functionality was tested on low ingredient dose, comparably to that of common hydrocolloids. Control bread was small, hard and with low gas retention ability as shown by microscopy, depicting holes inside crumb pores. Addition of chickpea flour in low dose (2% w/w) enhanced loaf volume by 20% and reduced crumb hardness by 40%, due to increased gas retention (no holes within pores) and superior homogeneity of the starch–protein network. On the contrary, chickpea paste deleteriously affected bread quality due to loss of solubility upon cooking. Interestingly, both soaking and cooking water significantly reduced crumb hardness, although to a lower extent than the flour. More homogeneous crumb structure and gas retention were observed in the micrographs, possibly due to the emulsifying activity of flavonoids and saponins (soaking) and insoluble fibre (cooking). Chickpea ingredients are promising substitute of hydrocolloids such as xanthan gum for texture improvement of gluten-free bread, although acting with different mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreadmaking quality 3achickpeas 3acooking 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aflavonoids 3aflour 3afoaming 3agluten-free bread 3ahardness 3ahydrocolloids 3aingredients 3ainsoluble fiber 3aloaves 3amicroscopy 3asaponins 3asoaking 3asolubility 3atexture 3axanthan gum 0aBakery products 0adigital image 0afood ingredients 0afood texture 0alegumes1 aPilkington, Casey L1 aSaputra, Agung1 aServenti, Luca0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 23, no. 8 p.690-698dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132177178023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001400191245013600205300001800341506007600359520124800435592002801683506003701711650002101748650001901769650001401788650002001802650002301822650001501845650001101860650002401871650001701895650002901912650001301941650001201954650001101966650001201977651001001989700001401999773007602013856008402089852000902173655001202182IND60096525520221207103435.0141104e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009652552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0292doi7 aPMC71275162pmcid7 a322880442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, S.H.10aSite verification and modeling of desiccant-based system as an alternative to conventional air-conditioning systems for wet markets  ap. 1076-1083.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDesiccant cooling system for active humidity control and to conserve energy has been in commercial applications for over two decades. However, its use in humid wet markets has never been examined. A gas-fired desiccant cooling system has been installed in a wet market in Hong Kong. In this study, the annual energy saving in conjunction with the use of desiccant cooling system was investigated by in-situ measurements, site surveys and simulations. The verified computer model was used for further simulations. It was found that for the use of a minimum ventilation rate of 10.3 L/s/person, the use of desiccant cooling system as compared to conventional system saved 4% of the energy and could achieve the desired space conditions. A parametric study under various ventilation rates indicated that use of desiccant cooling system in wet markets in hot and humid Hong Kong would lead to energy and energy cost savings, as well as CO₂ emission reduction amounting from 1% to 13%. The savings were more evident when wet markets were designed for a ventilation rate of 20 L/s/person. Furthermore, the actual occupancy profile, and lighting and small power densities determined in this study would be useful for future studies on wet market.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair conditioning 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputers 3acooling systems 3acost effectiveness 3adesiccants 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy costs 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahumidity 3amarkets 3amodels 3asurveys 3aChina1 aLee, W.L.0 tEnergy.g2013 June 15, v. 55 p.1076-1083dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245015900158300001600317520152100333592002801854650002101882650002001903650002601923650001901949650001101968650001401979650001501993650001502008650001102023650001502034650002902049650001202078650002302090650001702113653001202130653000902142653002002151653000802171653000802179700001602187700001702203700001702220700001302237700002302250700003102273700001402304773014902318856007602467852000902543655001202552IND60747702120221119132004.0210818e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074770212DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-40052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunder, Jai10aDistribution of Tet, aac and Ctx-m genes among antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli isolated from poultry under various farming system of A and N Islands  ap. 689-696.  aTransmission of antibiotic resistance from animal food chain to human through animal food-borne pathogens have led to increased public concern. Wider surveillance on prevalence of antibiotic resistance in E. coli will provide information on evolution of resistance in various geographical locations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of antimicrobial resistance of E. coli isolates from poultry under various farming system in A and N Islands and resistance genes of tet, ctx-M and aac encoding the isolates. Isolates were obtained from cloacal swabs in poultry under various farming systems and tested against major antimicrobial derivatives to study multi drug resistance. The presence of genes associated with resistance to tetracycline (tet A), ESBL (CTX-M) and Gentamycin (aac(3)-IV) were determined by PCR. A total of 126 cloacal samples were analysed out of which 31.38% of the E.coli isolates from poultry under various farming systems were producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and were multiple antimicrobial resistant. Poultry birds of commercial farms showed higher resistance levels (37.5%) than organised farms (24.76%) and desi birds (31.88%). Results indicate a high level of multi-drug resistance is emerging even in desi birds. It is suggested that an antimicrobial resistance surveillance program is needed in A and N Islands in order to detect bacterial resistance among rural poultry production as the 80 percentage of total poultry population belong to desi birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanimal research 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3acloaca 3aevolution 3afood chain 3agentamicin 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amultiple drug resistance 3apoultry 3apoultry production 3atetracycline 0aE. coli 0aESBL 0aFarming systems 0aMDR 0aPCR1 aSujatha, T.1 aBhowmick, S.1 aMayuri, S.C.1 aDe, A.K.1 aBhattacharyya, D.,1 aSiddhuraju, P.q(Perumal),1 aKundu, A.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2021 June, v. 55, no. 6 p.689-696dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-40053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03782naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245012300209506011700332506007600449520201000525592002802535506003702563650002202600650001102622650001702633650002202650650001902672650000902691650001402700650001802714650000902732650002002741650001502761650001002776651001402786653002002800653002102820653002602841653001902867653001602886700002202902700002402924700002702948700002302975700001802998700001903016773012203035856008603157852000903243655001203252IND60787401920221207124636.0220830e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078740192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2022.1069792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacIntosh, Amy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8438-771310aRadiological risk assessment to marine biota from exposure to NORM from a decommissioned offshore oil and gas pipeline  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aScale residues can accumulate on the interior surfaces of subsea petroleum pipes and may incorporate naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM). The persistent nature of ‘NORM scale’ may result in a radiological dose to the organisms living on or near intact pipelines. Following a scenario of in-situ decommissioning of a subsea pipeline, marine organisms occupying the exteriors or interiors of petroleum structures may have close contact with the scale or other NORM-associated contaminated substances and suffer subsequent radiological effects. This case study used radiological dose modelling software, including the ERICA Tool (v2.0), MicroShield® Pro and mathematical equations, to estimate the likely radiological doses and risks of effects from NORM-contaminated scale to marine biota from a decommissioned offshore oil and gas pipeline. Using activity concentrations of NORM (²²⁶Ra, ²¹⁰Po, ²¹⁰Pb, ²²⁸Ra, ²²⁸Th) from a subsea pipeline from Australia, environmental realistic exposure scenarios including radiological exposures from both an intact pipe (external only; accounting for radiation shielding by a cylindrical carbon steel pipe) and a decommissioned pipeline with corrosive breakthrough (resulting in both internal and external radiological exposure) were simulated to estimate doses to model marine organisms. Predicted dose rates for both the external only exposure (ranging from 26 μGy/h to 33 μGy/h) and a corroded pipeline (ranging from 300 μGy/h to 16,000 μGy/h) exceeded screening levels for radiological doses to environmental receptors. The study highlighted the importance of using scale-specific solubility data (i.e., Kd) values for individual NORM radionuclides for ERICA assessments. This study provides an approach for conducting marine organism dose assessments for NORM-contaminated subsea pipelines and highlights scientific gaps required to undertake risk assessments necessary to inform infrastructure decommissioning planning.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquatic organisms 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3ainfrastructure 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aradioactivity 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asolubility 3asteel 3aAustralia 0aDecommissioning 0aIn-situ disposal 0aNatural radionuclides 0aDose modelling 0aContaminant1 aKoppel, Darren J.1 aJohansen, Mathew P.1 aBeresford, Nicholas A.1 aCopplestone, David1 aPenrose, Beth1 aCresswell, Tom0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2022 Oct., v. 251-252 p.106979-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2022.1069793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245019300211300001800404520138700422592002801809653001501837653002001852653002801872653002701900653001101927700002501938700002401963700001901987700001802006700002002024773007902044856008302123852000902206655001202215IND60555295220221122102207.0161026e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055529522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.0182doi7 aPMC46346212pmcid7 a266295462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevereux, Graham10aCysteamine as a Future Intervention in Cystic Fibrosis Against Current and Emerging Pathogens: A Patient-based ex vivo Study Confirming its Antimicrobial and Mucoactive Potential in Sputum  ap. 1507-1512.  aCysteamine has recently been shown to have in vitro properties potentially therapeutically beneficial in cystic fibrosis (CF). In this study we investigated the antimicrobial and mucolytic activity of cysteamine against the complex biologic matrix of CF sputum.Sputum samples were obtained from 23 CF adults. Sputum polymicrobial content after in vitro exposure to cysteamine and standard CF antibiotics was assessed after a single exposure and after 14days low-dose exposure. The effect of cysteamine on sputum spinnbarkeit was assessed.Cysteamine reduced sputum polymicrobial burden by 3·18 (95% CI 2·30–4·07, p<0.001) log10 units after 24h incubation. Combined cysteamine and tobramycin reduced polymicrobial burden by a further 3·75 (95% CI 2·63–5·07, p<0·001) log10 units above that seen with tobramycin. Repeated low dosing with cysteamine reduced sputum polymicrobial load from day 10 onwards (p=0.032). Cysteamine reduced CF sputum viscoelasticity, sputum spinnbarkeit cysteamine 11.1mm/s (95% CI 3.95–18.2) vs DNAse 1.69mm/s (95% CI 0.73–2.65), p=0.016. Cysteamine was active against Mycobacterium abscessus as a monotherapy and also potentiated the effects of amikacin and azithromycin.Further investigation is required into the therapeutic potential of cysteamine in CF to treat emerging as well as established microbial pathogens and as a mucolytic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCysteamine 0aCystic fibrosis 0aMycobacterium abscessus 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aSputum1 aFraser-Pitt, Douglas1 aRobertson, Jennifer1 aDevlin, Edward1 aMercer, Derry1 aO'Neil, Deborah0 tEBioMedicine.g2015 Oct., v. 2 p.1507-1512dElsevier B.V.x2352-39647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009000170300001400260520162500274592002801899650002301927650002401950650001801974650002401992650001102016650001502027650001402042650002102056650003202077650002002109650002202129650002302151650001702174650001802191650002102209653001302230653000702243653000702250653000802257653000602265653000802271653000802279653000902287653000702296653000702303653000802310653000702318653000802325653001002333653000902343653000702352653000802359653000802367653000802375653000802383653000702391653000902398653000802407653000802415653000802423653000802431653000702439653000802446653000802454653002402462653001102486653001502497653001602512653001302528653002802541773011302569856008202682852000902764655001202773IND60605540020221119170334.0180905e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060554002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2018.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpielmeyer, Astrid10aOccurrence and fate of antibiotics in manure during manure treatments: A short review  ap. 76-86.  aVeterinary antibiotics are frequently applied in livestock farming worldwide and their usage is expected to increase during the next years by more than 60%. The aim of this review is to give a brief overview about excretion rates reported for diverse antibiotics and their fate within different manure treatments. Depending on the substance, < 5% up to 90% of the active ingredient were found to be excreted by the treated organisms leading to antibiotic residues in animal waste. As manure is utilized as substrate in biogas plants, antibiotics can enter this process and might have an effect on biogas and methane yield. This crucial point was subject of several anaerobic digestion studies giving variable results from increased biogas production in only one case (+ 14%) up to almost complete inhibition (− 93%). The fate of antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides or tetracyclines during manure treatment (anaerobic digestion, storage, composting) was investigated in different setups with composting often resulting in the highest elimination rates (up to > 99%). Based on reported transformation products of distinct antibiotics, degradation cannot be presumed for most compounds. In many cases, only minor structural modifications were observed and several transformation products are still microbiologically active. Consequently, manure treatments should not be evaluated based on the disappearance of the parent compound only. Comprehensive studies should include the elucidation of elimination pathways to identify efficient processes for reducing the input of antibiotics into the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanimal wastes 3aantibiotic residues 3abiogas 3acomposting 3aexcretion 3afluoroquinolones 3agas production (biological) 3agreen chemistry 3alivestock farming 3amethane production 3asulfonamides 3atetracyclines 3aveterinary drugs 0a4-OH-SDZ 0aAC 0aAD 0aAMO 0aB 0aCIP 0aCTC 0aDaFX 0aDC 0aDM 0aENR 0aFW 0aHRT 0a(M)IC 0aMICO 0aMR 0aNOR 0aODM 0aOTC 0aPCU 0aSC 0asim. 0aSPI 0aSDZ 0aSMX 0aSMZ 0aTC 0aTMP 0aTYL 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBiogas 0aComposting 0aDegradation 0aSorption 0aTransformation products0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2018 Sept., v. 9 p.76-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2018.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04227naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245023500196300001600431520233700447592002802784650002402812650002802836650002102864650002302885650001902908650001302927650003102940650001702971650002102988650001103009650002003020650001103040650001603051650001503067650001803082650001203100650001603112650001203128650001003140651001403150651001303164653001503177653002803192653002103220653001103241653001903252700005903271700001803330700002303348700005603371773013603427856007703563852000903640655001203649IND60594309720221122061355.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059430972DNAL7 a10.4001/003.026.01042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdlela, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0015-994614aThe Distribution and Management of Two Invasive Pests of Eucalyptus: The Red Gum Lerp Psyllid, Glycaspis brimblecombei (Hemiptera: Psylloidae), and the Blue Gum Chalcid Wasp, Leptocybe invasa (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), in Zimbabwe  ap. 104-115.  aEucalyptus species are indigenous to Australia but arenowgrown worldwide due to their fast growth rate and various uses as timber and fuel wood. Insect pests of Eucalyptus have since followed their host and, in most cases, leaving behind the natural enemies which usually regulate them below economic injury. This is the case with Glycaspis brimblecombei and Leptocybe invasa which are now resident in most parts of the world including Zimbabwe. Damage as a result of the two pests currently poses a threat to reforestation efforts to provide alternative sources of firewood for curing tobacco. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of the two pests as well as assess the possibility of managing L. invasa through biological control by releasing and recovering successive generations of the natural enemy Selitrichodes neseri in selected L. invasa-infested areas. Surveys were therefore carried out in Zimbabwe and GPS coordinates for pest presence recorded and used to determine the current distribution and future projections of the two pests using Maximum Entropy (maxent) ecological niche modelling. In preliminary studies to manage L. invasa, the natural wasp enemy S. neseri was released in Eucalyptus plantations and recovery studies done to establish their perpetuation in the field. Based on temperature and precipitation averages for Zimbabwe, the model predicted widespread distribution of the two pests especially in Mashonaland West, Bulawayo, Harare, Midlands province and parts of Manicaland province. This predicted range was projected to shrink due to climate change by the year 2055. In terms of relative contribution in predicting the distribution of the occurrence data, the three most important variables were mean annual temperature (39 %), mean temperature coolest month (18.3%)and annual moisture index (18 %). The performance of the model was high, with an AUC value of 0.884. Selitrichodes neseri wasps were recovered in infested Eucalyptus samples 4–6 generations after the initial release, indicating a high possibility of the natural enemy being able to establish in the future. Our findings are therefore important in understanding the current and projected distribution of both L. invasa and G. brimblecombei in Zimbabwe and formulating management measures for the two pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aGlycaspis brimblecombei 3aLeptocybe invasa 3abiological control 3aclimate change 3afuelwood 3aglobal positioning systems 3ainsect pests 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anatural enemies 3aniches 3aplantations 3aprediction 3areforestation 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atobacco 3awasps 3aAustralia 3aZimbabwe 0aEucalyptus 0aGlycaspis brimblecombei 0aLeptocybe invasa 0amaxent 0ainvasive pests1 aManyangadze, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6140-51141 aSachisuko, A.1 aLingen, S. van der1 aMakowe, I.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8041-614X0 tAfrican entomology.g2018 Apr., v. 26, no. 1 p.104-115dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.026.01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013100170520145800301592002801759650003001787650001801817650001301835650003001848650001901878650001301897650001301910650001201923650001101935650002101946650001101967650002001978650003001998650000902028650001502037650001302052650001102065650002302076650001202099653001902111653001102130653001202141653001902153653002502172653003002197653000802227653001602235653000802251653000802259653000902267653000902276653000902285700002202294700002502316700002102341700002202362700002302384700001802407700003202425773008802457856008702545852000902632655001202641IND60707615220221119103206.0210513e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070761522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2020.1022372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodkhe, Rahul10aHuman gut-derived commensal suppresses generation of T-cell response to gliadin in humanized mice by modulating gut microbiota  aThe human intestinal tract is colonized by a large number of diverse microorganisms that play various important physiologic functions. In inflammatory gut diseases including celiac disease (CeD), a dysbiotic state of microbiome has been observed. Interestingly, this perturbed microbiome is normalized towards eubiosis in patients showing recovery after treatment. The treatment has been observed to increase the abundance of beneficial microbes in comparison to non-treated patients. In this study, we investigated the effect of Prevotella histicola or Prevotella melaninogenica, isolated from the duodenum of a treated CeD patient, on the induction and maintenance of oral tolerance to gliadin, a CeD associated subgroup of gluten proteins, in NOD.DQ8.ABo transgenic mice. Conventionally raised mice on a gluten free diet were orally gavaged with bacteria before and after injection with pepsin trypsin digested gliadin (PTD-gliadin). P. histicola suppressed the cellular response to gliadin, whereas P. melaninogenica failed to suppress an immune response against gliadin. Interestingly, tolerance to gliadin in NOD.DQ8.ABo mice may be associated with gut microbiota as mice gavaged with P melaninogenica harbored a different microbial diversity as compared to P. histicola treated mice. This study provides experimental evidence that gut microbes like P. histicola from treated patients can suppress the immune response against gliadin epitopes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrevotella melaninogenica 3aT-lymphocytes 3abacteria 3abeneficial microorganisms 3aceliac disease 3aduodenum 3aepitopes 3agliadin 3agluten 3agluten-free diet 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3amicrobiome 3apatients 3apepsin 3atransgenic animals 3atrypsin 0aCeliac disease 0aGluten 0aGliadin 0aOral tolerance 0aPrevotella histicola 0aGut microbiota modulation 0aCeD 0aPTD-gliadin 0aGFD 0aGCD 0aPCoA 0arRNA 0aSCFA1 aMarietta, Eric V.1 aBalakrishnan, Baskar1 aLuckey, David H.1 aHorwath, Irina E.1 aShouche, Yogesh S.1 aTaneja, Veena1 aMurray, J.

Each cell shows a two-electrode configuration comprising a single working electrode and a counter/pseudo-reference electrode that is compartmentalized to be shared among all the cells of the array. Using this configuration, just six contact pads are required, which significantly reduces the chip overall surface area. Electrochemical characterization studies are carried out in solutions containing the two species of reversible redox pairs. The concentration of one redox species can reliably be measured at the working electrode by applying potentiostatic techniques to record the current due to the corresponding electrochemical reaction. The redox counterpart in turn undergoes an electrochemical process at the counter/pseudo-reference electrode, which, under optimized experimental conditions, injects current and keeps the applied potential in the electrochemical cell without limiting the current being recorded at the working electrode. Under these conditions, the electrode array shows an excellent performance in electrochemical detection studies without any chemical or electrical cross-talk between cells. The enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and myeloperoxidase enzymes is analyzed using different redox mediators. Quasi-simultaneous measurements with the five electrochemical cells of the array are carried out within 1 s time frame. This array layout can be suitable for multiplexed electrochemical immunoassays and immunosensor approaches and implementation in simplified electrochemical ELISA platforms that make use of enzyme labels. Moreover, the array reduced dimensions facilitate the integration into compact fluidic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenzyme activity 3agold 3aimmunosensors 3amyeloperoxidase 3aperoxidase 3asurface area 0aALP 0aBQ 0aCE 0aCRE 0aCV 0aFc-MeOH 0a[Fc-MeOH]+ 0aHQ 0aHRP 0aMPO 0aRE 0aWE 0aOn-chip electrochemical cell array 0aTwo-electrode cell 0aRedox pair 0aEnzyme activity 0aImmunoassay1 aBaldi, Antoni1 aMerlos, Ángel1 aFernández-Sánchez, César1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2779-92810 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 201 p.113952-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1139523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245013800164300001800302500002000320520100000340592002801340596001001368650002001378650001601398650001201414650001801426650002201444650001001466650001201476650002001488650001201508650001101520650001601531700006301547700002901610700002501639773015301664856007501817852000901892655001201901IND60755350420220219000000.0211030e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075535042DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.153092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSotera, Edgar Mario10aReview characterization of edible films formulated with sodium alginate and low‐methoxyl pectin in osmotic dehydration applications  ap. 4995-5006.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this work was to evaluate the behaviour of two edible films (sodium alginate and low‐methoxyl pectin) under different osmotic conditions (solutions: sucrose, glucose syrup and maltodextrin; concentrations: 40 °Brix and 60 °Brix; temperature 40 °C and processing times: 0.5, 1 and 2 h). From the experimental water loss and solid uptake kinetics, effective diffusion coefficients and the dehydration performance ratio were obtained. The microstructural characteristics of the osmodehydrated films were also analysed using pear as a food matrix. The results showed that films osmodehydrated with maltodextrin and glucose syrup solutions presented higher dehydration performance ratio values than those osmodehydrated with sucrose. A reduction in the thicknesses of edible coatings was observed. The best formulation was sodium alginate 2% and calcium lactate 5% according to the microstructural analysis and structural integrity for at least up to 16 h of osmotic dehydration.  aPublisher supplied data  cCIDCA 3acalcium lactate 3afood matrix 3aglucose 3amaltodextrins 3aosmotic treatment 3apears 3apectins 3asodium alginate 3asucrose 3asyrups 3atemperature1 aRodríguez, Anabel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7242-596X1 aGamboa‐Santos, Juliana1 aCampañone, Laura A.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2021 Oct., v. 56, no. 10 p.4995-5006dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.153093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01140naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245004900168300001600217520037200233592002800605650001700633650001100650650002400661700002400685773007400709856008200783852000900865655001200874IND60551679820221121060208.0161019e20140828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055167982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Ming-Feng10aBuilding a Temperature-Sensitive Ion Channel  ap. 977-979.  aThe biophysical basis of temperature-sensitive ion channel gating has been a tough nut to crack.

A combination was used of classical methods (incl. crushing of barley kernels by a roll crusher, steeping in 0.02M HCl, repeated rubbing and filtering through the sieve of 0.08 mm), and novel pieces of know-how (treatment with &beta;-glucanase and cellulase, alkalisation at pH = 10.0 and centrifugation of crude starch suspension through the layer of CsCl). In this way, barley starch of high purity was obtained at a very low loss, using Low Angle Laser Light Scattering for the determination of the size distribution of starch granules. The boundary of the particle size between the peaks of A-starch and B-starch (7 &micro;m) was evaluated from the distribution curves, while the contents of A- and B-starches were calculated from the cumulative curves. As a whole, the method was internally validated and for its repeatability and uncertainty of measurement the stimates of standard deviation s = 1.56 and confidence interval L<sub>1,2</sub> = x&plusmn; 1.9% were established, respectively. Taking into account the generally well known difficulties associated with the extraction of substances from biological materials, in this case the separation of starch from barley kernels, we believe that the proposed method will bring satisfactory results in practice. &nbsp; &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abarley starch 3acentrifugation 3aconfidence interval 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3apH 3aparticle size 3astandard deviation 3auncertainty1 aChmelík, J.1 aPsota, V.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 24, no. 1 p.11-18dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3288-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011600168300001600284520127000300592002801570650003501598650000901633650000901642650001401651650001501665650001101680650000901691650001901700650001601719700001401735700001401749773007401763856008401837852000901921655001201930IND60096525920221118042507.0141104e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009652592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ming-Lei10aHow does oil market uncertainty interact with other markets? An empirical analysis of implied volatility index  ap. 860-868.  aOVX (Crude oil volatility index), as a measure of oil market uncertainty and new volatility derivatives published by CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) during the 2008 global financial crisis, provides a direct prediction of the market's expectation for future 30-day crude oil price volatility. This paper investigates the short- and long-term cross-market uncertainty transmission implied by OVX and other important volatility indices which are VIX (stock market volatility index), EVZ (euro/dollar exchange rate volatility index) and GVZ (gold price volatility index). The results indicate that there are no strong long-run equilibrium relationships among these volatility indices, which indirectly verify the effectiveness of cross-market volatility portfolio strategy for risk hedge. Furthermore, OVX is significantly influenced by other ones, which indicates that investors' volatility expectation in the oil market become more sensitive to uncertainty shocks from other markets when the global economic situation is extremely unstable. Finally, impacts of interior and exterior uncertainty shocks on OVX are found to be positive and transient. And the significant short-term uncertainty transmission between oil and other major markets has been confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic outlook and situation 3agold 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3aprices 3arisk 3astock exchange 3auncertainty1 aJi, Qiang1 aFan, Ying0 tEnergy.g2013 June 15, v. 55 p.860-868dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008500165500001900250520140600269592002801675650000801703650002601711650001401737650001401751650001001765650001301775650001801788650001701806650002301823650001401846650001101860653002501871653002201896653001601918653002501934653001001959773011201969856008202081852000902163655001202172IND60707615520221119103136.0210415e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070761552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2020.1034422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Nobuo12aA new scheme to artificially alter yeast mating-types without autodiploidization  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSexual hybridization can drive dramatic yeast evolution through the inheritance of genomic information from each parental cell. Unfortunately, however, a pair of strains, MATa and MATα mating-types, is absolutely required for sexual hybridization of budding yeasts, which restricts the combining possibilities of previously isolated and engineered strains. While the Ho endonuclease has been used to artificially convert yeast mating-types, “stuck” mutations are often hindrances to mating-type conversion due to extremely low efficiency of DNA digestion. An alternative and powerful approach to generate mating strains with specific properties and desired mating-type from existing strains is needed, to accelerate progress in yeast breeding technology and strain engineering. I established an approach for generating MATa and MATα mating-types from those of the opposite mating-type using synthetic DNA substitution of the MAT gene. I used previously constructed episomal vectors that suppress the mating ability of existing cells and produce opposite mating-type derivatives with antibiotic resistance for target cell isolation. I demonstrated that the mating-type-altered cells exhibited the same phenotype as those separately generated without MAT gene substitution. This approach can facilitate yeast-strain development and sexual hybridization using available resources with less efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantibiotic resistance 3adigestion 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahybridization 3amating types 3amicrobial genetics 3aphenotype 3ayeasts 0aAutopolyploidization 0aGene substitution 0aMating-type 0aSexual hybridization 0aYeast0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2020 Nov., v. 144 p.103442-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2020.1034423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245012200171300001600293520234200309592002802651650001302679650002302692650001102715650001602726650002502742650001902767650001702786650002202803650001502825650002402840650001102864650002002875650002502895650001802920651001302938700001702951700001802968700002002986700002003006700001903026773010303045856004803148852000903196655001203205IND4483418720221122045714.0120515e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448341872DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-011-1299-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakari, Said Suleiman10aDelineation of groundwater provenance in a coastal aquifer using statistical and isotopic methods, Southeast Tanzania  ap. 889-902.  aRapid population growth and urbanization has placed a high demand on freshwater resources in southeast costal Tanzania. In this paper, we identify the various sources of groundwater and the major factors affecting the groundwater quality by means of multivariate statistical analyses, using chemical tracers and stable isotope signatures. The results from hierarchical cluster analyses show that the groundwater in the study area may be classified into four groups. A factor analysis indicates that groundwater composition is mainly affected by three processes, accounting for 80.6% of the total data variance: seawater intrusion, dilution of groundwater by recharge, and sewage infiltration. The hydrochemical facies of shallow groundwater was mostly of the NaâCaâCl type, although other water types were also observed. The deep groundwater samples were slightly to moderately mineralized and they were of the NaHCO3 type. This water type is induced mainly by dissolution of carbonate minerals and modified by ion exchange reactions. The signal from the stable isotope composition of the groundwater samples corresponded well with the major chemical characteristics. In the shallow groundwater, both high-nitrate and high-chloride concentrations were associated with localized stable isotope enrichments which offset the meteoric isotopic signature. This is inferred to be due to the contamination by influx of sewage, as well as intrusion by seawater. The depleted stable isotope values, which coincides with a chemical signature for the deep aquifer indicates that this deep groundwater is derived from infiltration in the recharge zone followed by slow lateral percolation. This study shows that a conceptual hydrogeochemical interpretation of the results from multivariate statistical analysis (using HCA and FA) on water chemistry, including isotopic data, provides a powerful tool for classifying the sources of groundwater and identifying the significant factors governing the groundwater quality. The derived knowledge generated by this study constitutes a conceptual framework for investigating groundwater characteristics. This is a prerequisite for developing a sound management plan, which is a requirement for ensuring a sustainable exploitation of the deep aquifer water resource in the coastal area of Tanzania.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acarbonate minerals 3acoasts 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrochemistry 3aion exchange 3apopulation growth 3aprovenance 3asaltwater intrusion 3asewage 3astable isotopes 3astatistical analysis 3awater quality 3aTanzania1 aAagaard, Per1 aVogt, Rolf D.1 aRuden, Fridtjov1 aJohansen, Ingar1 aVuai, Said Ali0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2012 June, v. 66, no. 3 p.889-902dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-1299-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245011500155300001400270520141600284592002801700650001901728650001301747650002601760650001501786650002501801650002301826650001101849650001101860650001401871650001501885650001801900650002101918650002101939650001801960650001501978700002701993700002502020773014102045856007202186852000902258655001202267IND60661957120221123013128.0190904e20100115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066195712DNAL7 a10.1039/b907851g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChon, Ho-Sik10aImplementation of E.U. Water Framework Directive: source assessment of metallic substances at catchment levels  ap. 36-47.  aThe E.U. Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to prevent deterioration of water quality and to phase out or reduce the concentrations of priority substances at catchment levels. It requires changes in water management from a local scale to a river basin scale, and establishes Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) as a guideline for the chemical status of receiving waters. According to the Directive, the standard and the scope of the investigation for water management are more stringent and expanded than in the past, and this change also needs to be applied to restoring the level of metals in water bodies. The aim of this study was to identify anthropogenic emission sources of metallic substances at catchment levels. Potential sources providing substantial amounts of such substances in receiving waters included stormwater, industrial effluents, treated effluents, agricultural drainage, sediments, mining drainage and landfill leachates. Metallic substances have more emission sources than other dangerous substances at catchment levels. Therefore, source assessment for these substances is required to be considered more significantly to restore their chemical status in the context of the WFD. To improve source assessment quality, research on the role of societal and environmental parameters and contribution of each source to the chemical distribution in receiving waters need to be carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3adrainage 3aenvironmental factors 3aguidelines 3aindustrial effluents 3alandfill leachates 3ametals 3amining 3asediments 3astormwater 3asurface water 3atoxic substances 3awater management 3awater quality 3awatersheds1 aOhandja, Dieudonne-Guy1 aVoulvoulis, Nikolaos0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2010 Jan. 15, v. 12, no. 1 p.36-47dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b907851g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245016900165500001400334520134800348592002801696650001301724650000901737650001601746650001401762650001601776650002501792650001201817650002001829650001901849650001101868650001501879650001401894650001301908650001501921650001901936650002401955700002501979700002102004700002502025700002402050700001902074700001802093700002402111700002202135700002002157700002002177773012202197856007502319852000902394655001202403IND60703441620221120041539.0200721e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070344162DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120203022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPustozerov, Evgenii 14aThe Role of Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load in the Development of Real-Time Postprandial Glycemic Response Prediction Models for Patients with Gestational Diabetes  aNAL-light  aThe incorporation of glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) is a promising way to improve the accuracy of postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) prediction for personalized treatment of gestational diabetes (GDM). Our aim was to assess the prediction accuracy for PPGR prediction models with and without GI data in women with GDM and healthy pregnant women. The GI values were sourced from University of Sydney’s database and assigned to a food database used in the mobile app DiaCompanion. Weekly continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data for 124 pregnant women (90 GDM and 34 control) were analyzed together with records of 1489 food intakes. Pearson correlation (R) was used to quantify the accuracy of predicted PPGRs from the model relative to those obtained from CGM. The final model for incremental area under glucose curve (iAUC120) prediction chosen by stepwise multiple linear regression had an R of 0.705 when GI/GL was included among input variables and an R of 0.700 when GI/GL was not included. In linear regression with coefficients acquired using regularization methods, which was tested on the data of new patients, R was 0.584 for both models (with and without inclusion of GI/GL). In conclusion, the incorporation of GI and GL only slightly improved the accuracy of PPGR prediction models when used in remote monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aarea 3acorrelation 3adatabases 3afood intake 3agestational diabetes 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3aglycemic index 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anutrients 3apatients 3aprediction 3apregnant women 3aregression analysis1 aTkachuk, Aleksandra 1 aVasukova, Elena 1 aDronova, Aleksandra 1 aShilova, Ekaterina 1 aAnopova, Anna 1 aPiven, Faina 1 aPervunina, Tatiana 1 aVasilieva, Elena 1 aGrineva, Elena 1 aPopova, Polina 0 tNutrients.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120203023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03584naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003200132024001100164040001800175100001700193245013500210300001600345506017300361520162700534650002102161650002102182650001802203650001902221650002302240650002402263650001202287650002202299650001502321650002002336650001902356650002402375650002202399650001702421650002302438650001802461650002402479700001802503700002002521700002002541700002302561700002202584773013002606856011202736856007802848956008602926961000903012852000903021655001203030IND60005943020221214225009.0140724s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000594302DNAL7 a3077752aris7 a10113/594302hdl7 a10.4236/oje.2014.490422doi8 ans5129  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElias, Emile14aThe Public Water Supply Protection Value of Forests: A Watershed-Scale Ecosystem Services Analysis Based upon Total Organic Carbon  ap. 517-531.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWe developed a cost-based methodology to assess the value of forested watersheds to improve water quality in public water supplies. The developed methodology is applicable to other source watersheds to determine ecosystem services for water quality. We assess the value of forest land for source water mitigation of total organic carbon (TOC) through the use of linked watershed and reservoir simulation models and cost-based valuation economics. Watershed modeling results indicated that expected urbanization will increase TOC loads to Converse Reservoir (Mobile, AL). Reservoir model results indicated that future median TOC concentrations increased by 1.1 mg·L-1 between 1992 and 2020 at the source water intake. Depending upon dynamic reservoir TOC concentrations, additional drinking water treatment with powdered activated carbon (PAC) often is necessary between May and October to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. The cost for additional treatment was calculated using minimum and maximum volume treated with simulated TOC concentrations at the source water intake. Daily simulated TOC concentrations for the base scenario using 1992 land cover (3% urban) were compared with simulated TOC concentrations following forest to urban land conversion predicted in the watershed by 2020 (22% urban). The daily cost for additional drinking water treatment with PAC was calculated if simulated TOC concentrations exceeded 2.7 mg·L-1. The mean increase in daily treatment costs between base and future scenarios ranged from $91 to $95 per km2 per day for forest land water purification ecosystem services. 3aactivated carbon 3acarbon footprint 3acost analysis 3adrinking water 3aecosystem services 3aforested watersheds 3aforests 3ahydrologic models 3aland cover 3aland use change 3apollution load 3apublic water supply 3asimulation models 3aurbanization 3awater purification 3awater quality 3awatershed hydrology1 aLaband, David1 aDougherty, Mark1 aLockaby, Graeme1 aSrivastava, Puneet1 aRodríguez, Hugo,0 tOpen journal of ecology.g2014, v. 04, no. 09 p.517-531dScientific Research Publishing, Inc.wJournal:28375x2162-19937nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/594303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4236/oje.2014.490423Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/14-021.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03857naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245014900179520205000328592002802378650004402406650002002450650002302470650002502493650001802518650001802536650001402554650001802568650001302586650001502599650001202614650001302626650002102639650001902660650000702679650001802686650001202704650001602716650002202732650001302754653001902767653001202786653001802798653003002816653001502846653003802861700007702899700006902976700006103045773010203106856008603208852000903294655001203303IND60787402420221118044809.0220921e202301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078740242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1080112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Magner Pessoa da10aCreation of a new proof-of-concept pectin/lysozyme nanocomplex as potential β-lactose delivery matrix: Structure and thermal stability analyses  aLactose is a disaccharide and has many uses in food and non-food formulations. Its anomeric form, β-lactose, is a natural inhibitor of the galectin-3 protein, which is responsible for several pathological effects (e.g., colon cancer cell proliferation). However, lactose cannot be orally administered since it is rapidly hydrolyzed by intestinal lactases. Therefore, the development of nanosystems from food hydrocolloids is of particular interest as oral delivery systems for β-lactose to enhance its chemical stability, bioaccessibility, and bioavailability. This report describes a new proof-of-concept assembling of high methoxyl pectin (HMP) and lysozyme (Ly) complexes loaded with β-lactose produced under appropriate solution conditions (ratio, pH, and temperature) without toxic solvents. Under optimized conditions, the prepared nanoparticles had a spherical shape (81.20 ± 0.34 nm), negative surface charge (∼−30 mV), homogeneous size distribution (PDI <0.2), and smooth surface, as evidenced by dynamic light scattering, scanning, and transmission electron microscopes. The encapsulation efficiency of β-lactose was greater than 96%. The particle size and morphology of the nanoparticles hardly changed with the incorporation of β-lactose. The interaction between the compounds was evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, indicating that intermolecular electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds were the driving forces to form nanoparticles and suggesting the absence of free β-lactose on the surface of nanoparticles. Colorectal cancer cells treated with the nanocomplexes showed time-dependent incorporation of nanocomplexes. The results demonstrate a newly proof-of-concept pectin/lysozyme nanocomplexes loaded with β-lactose, with acid galacturonans covering the nanoparticles and maintaining the thermal stability, being relevant for future application of these complexes as potential oral delivery vehicles in food matrices for low molecular weight sugars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abioavailability 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aencapsulation 3agalacturonans 3agalectins 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen 3aintestines 3alactose 3alysozyme 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3aparticle size 3apectins 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 0aPolysaccharide 0aProtein 0aNanoparticles 0aElectrostatic interaction 0aβ-Lactose 0aDifferential scanning calorimetry1 aRosales, Thiécla Katiane Osvaldt1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9653-71171 aPedrosa, Lucas de Freitas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2053-04071 aFabi, João Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7430-77560 tFood hydrocolloids.g2023 Jan., v. 134 p.108011-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1080113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012000169300001600289520114000305592002801445650004401473650002501517650001401542650001101556650001301567650001401580650002201594650004101616650001601657650002001673650001801693650001301711650001801724650001201742650002101754650004401775650001101819650002001830650001301850650001001863653002901873653002501902653002401927653002101951653003101972653004002003653005002043653004302093653004902136653004202185653005502227653004102282653007302323773010102396856008602497852000902583655001202592IND60573003620221120185033.0190319e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057300362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarhadi, Neda10aStructural elucidation of a water-soluble polysaccharide isolated from Balangu shirazi (Lallemantia royleana) seeds  ap. 263-270.  aA novel water-soluble polysaccharide was isolated from the seeds of Balangu shirazi (BSG) by warm-water extraction and then purified.

Monosaccharide composition analysis by GC-MS showed the BSG contained sugar constituents of arabinose, rhamnose, mannose, fructose, galactose, α-and β-d-glucose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, and glucosamine although mainly composed of rhamnose, galactose, arabinose and galacturonic acid. 1H, 13C and COSY NMR spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of (1 → 4)-linked-α-D-GalpA, (1 → 3)-linked-β-D-Galp, (1 → 6)-linked-β-D-Galp, (1 →)-β-L-Arap, (1 → 2)-linked-α-L-Rhap and (1 → 3)-linked-β-L-Arap in the polysaccharide sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLallemantia royleana 3aarabinose 3acarbon 3afructose 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglucosamine 3aglucuronic acid 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen 3alipid content 3amannose 3anitrogen content 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3apolysaccharides 3arhamnose 3aseeds 0aBalangu shirazi seed gum 0aChemical composition 0aStructural features 0aNMR spectroscopy 0aHexane (PubChem CID: 8058) 0aDichloromethane (PubChem CID: 6344) 0aTrifluoroaceticacid (TFA) (PubChem CID: 6422) 0aGlacial acetic acid (PubChem CID: 176) 0aDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (PubChem CID: 679) 0a1-methylimidazole (PubChem CID: 1390) 0asodium borohydride (NaBH4) (PubChem CID: 22959485) 0aAcetic anhydrate (PubChem CID: 7918) 0aBis (trimethylsilyl) triflouroacetamide (BSTFA) (PubChem CID: 94358)0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 Nov., v. 72 p.263-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04313naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024001700113024002100130024002800151024001100179040001800190100001500208245014200223300001600365506017300381520177600554650001602330650000902346650002202355650001802377650001502395650002002410650001002430650003302440650001702473650002102490650001602511650001902527650002802546650001302574650001402587650001802601650001902619650002402638650003202662650006902694650002502763650002102788650003802809650004802847650001102895650002802906650003402934650001402968650002702982650002203009651001903031651001903050700002203069700002203091700002603113700002803139700002203167773008903189856011203278856007403390956008503464961000903549852000903558655001203567IND60006038920221214225542.0150224e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000603892DNAL7 a249517232pmid7 a3021502aris7 a10113/603892hdl7 a10.1093/mmy/myu0222doi8 ans6613  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubka, Vit10aAspergillus pragensis sp. nov. discovered during molecular reidentification of clinical isolates belonging to Aspergillus section Candidi  ap. 565-576.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe identity of nine clinical isolates from Czech patients presumably belonging to Aspergillus section Candidi based on morphology of colonies was revised using sequences of ß-tubulin, calmodulin, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA. The set of isolates included six isolates from suspected (not verified using standard criteria) and proven onychomycosis, one isolate from otitis externa, and two isolates associated with probable invasive aspergillosis. The results showed that A. candidus isolate was a cause of otitis externa, both isolates from sputum of patients with probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) were excluded from section Candidi and re-identified as A. carneus (sect. Terrei) and A. flavus (sect. Flavi). The isolates from nail scrapings were mostly identified as A. tritici (n=3), a verified agent of non-dermatophyte onychomycosis. One isolate from toenail was identified as A. candidus and two isolates belonged to a hitherto undescribed species. This species is well supported by phylogenetic analysis based on ß-tubulin and calmodulin gene. This species is distinguished from all other members of section Candidi by white colonies on malt extract agar (MEA) with red-brown reverse, very slow growth on Czapek-Dox agar and inability to grow at 37 °C. We propose for this species the name A. pragensis related to the locality of isolation. Section Candidi encompasses five species (including A. pragensis sp. nov.) for which a dichotomous key based on colonies characteristics is provided. All seven clinical isolates from sect. Candidi were tested for susceptibilities to selected antifungal agents using Etest and disc diffusion method. Our results indicate that sect. Candidi species have overall good susceptibility to common antifungals. 3aAspergillus 3aagar 3aantifungal agents 3aaspergillosis 3acalmodulin 3adrug resistance 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amalt extract 3amicrobial growth 3anew species 3aotitis externa 3apathogen identification 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3ataxonomic keys 3ataxonomic revisions 2aAspergillosisxmicrobiology 2aAspergillusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCalmodulinxgenetics 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTubulinxgenetics 3aCzech Republic 0aCzech Republic1 aLyskova, Pavilina1 aFrisvad, Jens C.,1 aPeterson, Stephen W.,1 aSkořepová, Magdalena,1 aKolarik, Miroslav0 tMedical mycology.g2014 Aug., v. 52, no. 6 p.565-576wJournal:28462x1369-37867nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/603893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mmy/myu0223Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/10746.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04739naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245019000167520255400357592002802911650001502939650002702954650001202981650002402993650001603017650001503033650002003048650002503068650002603093650001803119650002303137650001003160650002603170650001103196650001403207650002303221650002303244650002103267650002603288650001803314650001303332650001003345650001703355650001403372650001203386650001703398650001903415650002403434650001903458651001003477653001803487653001403505653002203519653002603541653002203567653003103589700001503620700001403635700001803649700002003667700001403687700001203701700001903713700001703732700001703749700001703766773010403783856008503887852000903972655001203981IND60762379420221119115215.0220523e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076237942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1043832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Yalong10aBioorganic and silicon amendments alleviate early defoliation of pear trees by improving the soil nutrient bioavailability, microbial activity, and reshaping the soil microbiome network  aPear trees with severe early defoliation usually suffer from weakened aboveground growth and a serious decrease of fruit quality and yield. Soil fertility and its microbial community and functional activity are significant factors impacting plant growth and yield, which also might be the very factors that influence the early defoliation of pear trees. To address the problems caused by chemical fertilizers, bioorganic fertilizer (BIO) and silicon amendment (SOA) are increasingly used as amendments to improve soil microbial activity and increase soil nutrient availability. However, how effective BIO and SOA are at improving the health of soils and reducing early defoliation remains unclear. Here, we conducted a 4-year field experiment (2016–2019) in a 25-year-old ‘Cuiguan’ pear orchard in Jianning county, Fujian province, comparing local custom fertilization (CK), local custom fertilization supplemented with SOA (CK-SOA), BIO, and BIO supplemented with SOA (BIO-SOA). At the end of the 4-year study we found that BIO and BIO-SOA treatments resulted in reduced leaf nitrogen content and increased leaf potassium (K), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and manganese (Mn) content. BIO and BIO-SOA treatments also resulted in a 50% reduction of the early deciduous rate and a 47% increase in pear yield. Compared with CK treated soil, BIO and BIO-SOA treated soils had higher nitrate nitrogen content (NO₃⁻-N), available Si, Fe, Mn, and Zn content, and significantly improved microbial biomass nitrogen content (MBN), geometric mean enzyme activity (GMEA) and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). Network analysis revealed that BIO and BIO-SOA treatments had significantly altered the bacterial and fungal community composition in the orchard soil. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and the Mantel test indicated that soil available K, exchangeable Ca and Mg, and available Si, Fe, Mn and Zn content were the main factors influencing bacterial and fungal communities. The increased nutrient availability (e.g., NO₃⁻-N and microelement contents), MBN, GMEA and EMF had negative effects on the early defoliation rate. Random Forest model identified soil available Si content, microbial biomass nitrogen content, EMF, and GMEA as the main predictors of early defoliation rate. Overall, this study demonstrates that application of BIO or BIO mixed with SOA can alleviate the early defoliation rate of pear trees by increasing the availability of microelements, microbial functional activity, and changing the soil microbial community composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abio-organic fertilizer 3acalcium 3acommunity structure 3adefoliation 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3aexchangeable calcium 3afield experimentation 3afruit quality 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aleaf nitrogen content 3aleaves 3amanganese 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial nitrogen 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aorchard soils 3aorchards 3apears 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3asilicon 3asoil ecology 3asoil fertility 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrients 3aChina 0aAcid red soil 0aPear tree 0aEarly defoliation 0aBioorganic fertilizer 0aSilicon amendment 0aSoil microbial communities1 aMa, Yanwei1 aWu, Wenli1 aZeng, Shaomin1 aJiang, Shangtao1 aYang, Han1 aLi, Yan1 aWang, Zhonghua1 aDong, Caixia1 aXu, Yangchun1 aShen, Qirong0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 May, v. 173 p.104383-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1043833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100001800193245011000211300001600321506007600337506003100413520172000444592002802164596008302192596008802275596006402363506003702427650002802464650002202492650002902514650002802543650002202571650003902593650002002632650003802652650001002690650001902700650001302719650001802732650002102750650001502771650001102786650002302797650002502820650001902845650001602864650001102880650001202891650002002903653002402923653001602947653003502963653002102998653002203019653002503041700001703066773010103083856008603184856004503270961000903315852000903324655001203333IND60573003720221215142817.0190319e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057300372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.06.0162doi7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.06.0162chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Jianhui10aSuppression of retrogradation of gelatinized rice starch by anti-listerial grass carp protein hydrolysate  ap. 338-345.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aRetrogradation of gelatinized starch is a well-known phenomenon causing quality deterioration of starch-containing foods during storage. The objective of this work was to study physical phenomena underlying the reduced retrogradation of gelatinized rice starch (GRS) by anti-listerial grass carp protein hydrolysate (AGCPH) during short-term and long-term storage. The AGCPH was produced from grass carp protein using neutrase to a hydrolysis degree of 19% that was previously shown to have strong anti-listerial properties. Rheological results showed that a greater amount of AGCPH significantly reduced the storage modulus to a greater extent during heating from 25 to 95 °C at 5 °C/min, cooling from 95 to 25 °C at 5 °C/min, and the subsequent holding at 25 °C for 180 min, indicating the short-term suppression of GRS retrogradation by AGCPH. During the 14-day storage at 4 °C, the addition of AGCPH significantly reduced the hardness of pastes from 878.9 to 350.6 g, and the percentage of retrogradation was decreased from 82.2% to 21.7% according to differential scanning calorimetry, while the recrystallization of GRS based on X-ray diffraction spectroscopy was reduced from 13.4% to 6.9% when the GRS:AGCPH mass ratio decreased from 100:0 to 88:12. In addition, confocal laser scanning microscopy and atomic force microscopy showed that AGCPH bound with GRS starch molecules to block the formation of hydrogen bonds to impact intra- and inter-particle interactions and inhibit the recrystallization of GRS. The findings suggest that AGCPH may be used to significantly inhibit the short-term and long-term retrogradation of GRS to improve the safety and quality of refrigerated paste products.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  cUniversity of Tennesseedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000071350 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical elements 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afoods 3agelatinization 3ahardness 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysis 3apastes 3aphysical phenomena 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aretrogradation 3arice starch 3astarch 3astorage 3astorage modulus 0aAnti-retrogradation 0aRice starch 0aGrass carp protein hydrolysate 0aDynamic rheology 0aRecrystallization 0aMesoscopic structure1 aZhong, Qixin0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 Nov., v. 72 p.338-345dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.06.0163Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5730037  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012900175520148000304592002801784650002201812650004401834650003701878650001501915650001701930650001201947650001201959650001101971650002401982650003702006650001402043650001602057650002102073700002402094700002802118700002502146773011402171856008602285852000902371655001202380IND60752500420221120235836.0220124e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075250042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1273392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Gómez, E.O.10aObtention of biochar-Ca nanoparticles using Citrus tangerina׃ A morphological, surface and study remotion of Aflatoxin AFB1  aThis work presents the formation of biochar with calcium nanoparticles (NPsCa) in function of pyrolysis time (C10, C30, C60, C120 and C180 min) using the Citrus tangerina peel and their evaluation in the remotion of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in aqueous phase. Firstly, the Citrus tangerina was studied by Thermogravimetric analysis to determine the optimal temperature (TGA), obtaining a result of 600 °C. The biochar (NPsCa) were characterized by Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), as well as surface properties including the identification of functional groups by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR), and energetic states through the X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption studies were carried out on the different materials and later, the experimental data was adjusted to different mathematical models, obtaining the best fit of the kinetic data to the Ho-McKay model, whilst the adsorption isotherms were adjusted to the model of Langmuir, which indicates that the Aflatoxin B1 adsorption process is carried out through a monolayer chemisorption process with maximum sorption capacities (qm) ranging between 15.72 and 63.22 μg g⁻¹ with the 180th minute being the adequate time to obtain the carbon with the best surface properties and the best adsorption capacity. Additionally, it was observed that each material can be reused up to five times in accordance with the results from the reuse cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus reticulata 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaflatoxin B1 3abiochar 3acalcium 3acarbon 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aGarcía-Rosales, G.1 aLongoria-Gándara, L.C.1 aGómez-Vilchis, J.C.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 424 p.127339-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1273393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245010900187300001600296520086200312592002801174650004401202650001601246650001401262650001601276650002701292650001701319650001101336650003701347650001801384650001901402650001901421650001601440650003301456650001101489650002201500650002101522650002601543650000901569650001801578700002001596773007601616856008901692990002301781852000901804655001201813IND60096032020221120084004.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009603202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParvinzadeh Gashti, Mazeyar10aCitric acid/ZrO₂ nanocomposite inducing thermal barrier and self-cleaning properties on protein fibers  ap. 340-349.  aThe present research carried out to stabilize nano-ZrO₂ on the wool fabric using citric acid (CA) as a crosslinking agent and sodium hypophosphite (SHP) as a catalyst under UV irradiation.

While the recently developed lignin depolymerization strategies gave rise to well-defined aromatic platform chemicals, the diversification of these structures, especially toward high-end applications is still poorly addressed. Molecular motors and switches have found widespread application in many important areas such as targeted drug delivery systems, responsive coatings for self-healing surfaces, paints and resins or muscles for soft robotics. They typically comprise a functionalized aromatic backbone, yet their synthesis from lignin has not been considered before. In this contribution, we showcase the synthesis of a novel light-driven unidirectional molecular motor from the specific aromatic platform chemical 4-(3-hydroxypropyl)-2,6-dimethoxyphenol (dihydrosynapyl alcohol) that can be directly obtained from lignocellulose via a reductive catalytic fractionation strategy. The synthetic path takes into account the principles of green chemistry and aims to maintain the intrinsic functionality of the lignin-derived platform molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaromatic compounds 3adepolymerization 3adrugs 3afractionation 3agreen chemistry 3alignin 3alignocellulose1 aFridrich, Bálint1 aCrespi, Stefano1 aLubbe, Anouk S.1 aBarta, Katalin1 aFeringa, Ben L.0 tGreen chemistry.g2022 May 9, v. 24, no. 9 p.3689-3696dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2gc00291d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04155naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245009700209300001300306506007600319520202400395592002802419506003702447650002602484650002602510650001502536650001202551650001802563650003302581650001602614650001702630650001402647650001202661653001602673653001502689653001402704653001802718653002302736653006002759653005502819653005502874653006502929653004502994653004803039653005503087700001403142700001803156700001503174700001703189700001503206700001603221700001803237700001803255700001703273773013303290856008503423852000903508655001203517IND60541080920221207125545.0190318e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054108092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.simyco.2014.07.0012doi7 aPMC42555842pmcid7 a254929802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisagie, C.M.10aOchratoxin production and taxonomy of the yellow aspergilli (Aspergillus section Circumdati)  ap. 1-61.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAspergillus section Circumdati or the Aspergillus ochraceus group, includes species with rough walled stipes, biseriate conidial heads, yellow to ochre conidia and sclerotia that do not turn black. Several species are able to produce mycotoxins including ochratoxins, penicillic acids, and xanthomegnins. Some species also produce drug lead candidates such as the notoamides. A polyphasic approach was applied using morphological characters, extrolite data and partial calmodulin, β-tubulin and ITS sequences to examine the evolutionary relationships within this section. Based on this approach the section Circumdati is revised and 27 species are accepted, introducing seven new species: A. occultus, A. pallidofulvus, A. pulvericola, A. salwaensis, A. sesamicola, A. subramanianii and A. westlandensis. In addition we correctly apply the name A. fresenii (≡ A. sulphureus (nom. illeg.)). A guide for the identification of these 27 species is provided. These new species can be distinguished from others based on morphological characters, sequence data and extrolite profiles. The previously described A. onikii and A. petrakii were found to be conspecific with A. ochraceus, whilst A. flocculosus is tentatively synonymised with A. ochraceopetaliformis, despite extrolite differences between the two species. Based on the extrolite data, 13 species of section Circumdati produce large amounts of ochratoxin A: A. affinis, A. cretensis, A. fresenii, A. muricatus, A. occultus, A. ochraceopetaliformis (A. flocculosus), A. ochraceus, A. pseudoelegans, A. pulvericola, A. roseoglobulosus, A. sclerotiorum, A. steynii and A. westerdijkiae. Seven additional species produce ochratoxin A inconsistently and/or in trace amounts: A. melleus, A. ostianus, A. persii, A. salwaensis, A. sesamicola, A. subramanianii and A. westlandensis. The most important species regarding potential ochratoxin A contamination in agricultural products are A. ochraceus, A. steynii and A. westerdijkiae.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus ochraceus 3aagricultural products 3acalmodulin 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew species 3aochratoxin A 3asclerotia 3atubulin 0aAscomycetes 0aEurotiales 0aMycotoxin 0aFood spoilage 0aIndoor environment 0aAspergillus occultus Visagie, Seifert, Frisvad & Samson 0aA. pallidofulvus Visagie, Varga, Frisvad & Samson 0aA. pulvericola Visagie, Seifert, Frisvad & Samson 0aA. salwaensis Visagie, Houbraken, Fotedar, Frisvad & Samson 0aA. sesamicola Visagie, Frisvad & Samson 0aA. subramanianii Visagie, Frisvad & Samson 0aA. westlandensis Visagie, Varga, Meijer & Frisvad1 aVarga, J.1 aHoubraken, J.1 aMeijer, M.1 aKocsubé, S.1 aYilmaz, N.1 aFotedar, R.1 aSeifert, K.A.1 aFrisvad, J.C.1 aSamson, R.A.0 tStudies in mycology.g2014 June, v. 78 p.1-61dElsevier B.V.aCBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity CentrewJournal:1988x0166-06167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.simyco.2014.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245015400166300001800320520223900338592002802577650003202605650002502637650002102662650002002683650002102703650001802724650001302742650002802755650002202783650001302805650001702818650002702835700002302862700002402885700001802909700002402927700002002951700002002971700002002991700006003011700006003071773014703131856007603278852000903354655001203363IND60603900020221120100843.0180716e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060390002DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b025972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojtczak, Blazej A.10a5′-Phosphorothiolate Dinucleotide Cap Analogues: Reagents for Messenger RNA Modification and Potent Small-Molecular Inhibitors of Decapping Enzymes  ap. 5987-5999.  aThe 5′ cap consists of 7-methylguanosine (m⁷G) linked by a 5′–5′-triphosphate bridge to messenger RNA (mRNA) and acts as the master regulator of mRNA turnover and translation initiation in eukaryotes. Cap analogues that influence mRNA translation and turnover (either as small molecules or as part of an RNA transcript) are valuable tools for studying gene expression, which is often also of therapeutic relevance. Here, we synthesized a series of 15 dinucleotide cap (m⁷GpppG) analogues containing a 5′-phosphorothiolate (5′-PSL) moiety (i.e., an O-to-S substitution within the 5′-phosphoester) and studied their biological properties in the context of three major cap-binding proteins: translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and two decapping enzymes, DcpS and Dcp2. While the 5′-PSL moiety was neutral or slightly stabilizing for cap interactions with eIF4E, it significantly influenced susceptibility to decapping. Replacing the γ-phosphoester with the 5′-PSL moiety (γ-PSL) prevented β-γ-pyrophosphate bond cleavage by DcpS and conferred strong inhibitory properties. Combining the γ-PSL moiety with α-PSL and β-phosphorothioate (PS) moiety afforded first cap-derived hDcpS inhibitor with low nanomolar potency. Susceptibility to Dcp2 and translational properties were studied after incorporation of the new analogues into mRNA transcripts by RNA polymerase. Transcripts containing the γ-PSL moiety were resistant to cleavage by Dcp2. Surprisingly, superior translational properties were observed for mRNAs containing the α-PSL moiety, which were Dcp2-susceptible. The overall protein expression measured in HeLa cells for this mRNA was comparable to mRNA capped with the translation augmenting β-PS analogue reported previously. Overall, our study highlights 5′-PSL as a synthetically accessible cap modification, which, depending on the substitution site, can either reduce susceptibility to decapping or confer superior translational properties on the mRNA. The 5′-PSL-analogues may find application as reagents for the preparation of efficiently expressed mRNA or for investigation of the role of decapping enzymes in mRNA processing or neuromuscular disorders associated with decapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3ahuman cell lines 3amessenger RNA 3amoieties 3aneuromuscular disorders 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3atherapeutics 3atranslation (genetics)1 aSikorski, Pawel J.1 aFac-Dabrowska, Kaja1 aNowicka, Anna1 aWarmiński, Marcin,1 aKubacka, Dorota1 aNowak, Elzbieta1 aNowotny, Marcin1 aKowalska, Joanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9174-79991 aJemielity, Jacek1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7633-788X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 140, no. 18 p.5987-5999dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b025973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245017700162300001800339500001900357520101400376592002801390650002301418650001401441650002001455650001701475650001901492650003401511650001801545650002101563650001901584650001001603650003101613653001001644653002101654653000701675653000901682700001601691700001601707700001501723700001901738700006001757700005701817773014801874856008002022852000902102655001202111IND60731138720221120051024.0210317e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073113872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c062482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jing10aMolecular and Biochemical Characterization of Jasmonic Acid Carboxyl Methyltransferase Involved in Aroma Compound Production of Methyl Jasmonate during Black Tea Processing  ap. 3154-3164.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMethyl jasmonate (MeJA), a volatile organic compound, is a principal flowery aromatic compound in tea. During the processing of black tea, MeJA is produced by jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT) of the jasmonic acid (JA) substrate, forming a specific floral fragrance. CsJMT was cloned from tea leaves; the three-dimensional structure of CsJMT was predicted. Enzyme activity was identified, and protein purification was investigated. Site-directed deletions revealed that N-10, S-22, and Q-25 residues in the beginning amino acids played a key functional role in enzyme activity. The expression patterns of CsJMT in tea organs differed; the highest expression of CsJMT was observed in the fermentation process of black tea. These results aid in further understanding the synthesis of MeJA during black tea processing, which is crucial for improving black tea quality using specific fragrances and could be applied to the aromatic compound regulation and tea breeding improvement in further studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3ablack tea 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3ajasmonate O-methyltransferase 3ajasmonic acid 3amethyl jasmonate 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3avolatile organic compounds 0aCsJMT 0acharacterization 0aJA 0aMeJA1 aJia, Huiyan1 aZhu, Biying1 aLi, Junyao1 aYang, Tianyuan1 aZhang, Zheng-Zhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1564-14281 aDeng, Wei-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0732-70760 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 69, no. 10 p.3154-3164dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c062483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01557naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002700189245008200216500002200298520061400320592002800934653002300962653001300985653003100998653002101029700002301050773009101073856008201164852000901246655001201255IND60566116820221120154957.0170712s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056611682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ctro.2017.03.0022doi7 aPMC58935182pmcid7 a296580082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBibault, Jean-Emmanuel14aThe role of Next-Generation Sequencing in tumoral radiosensitivity prediction  aPre-press version  aTechnological advances have led to more precise radiation delivery, which has resulted in significant clinical gains.

This review describes the technical aspects and evolutions of NGS and discusses the latest clinical applications of genomics to predict tumoral radiosensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRadiation oncology 0aGenomics 0aNext-Generation Sequencing 0aRadiosensitivity1 aTinhofer, Ingeborg0 tClinical and Translational Radiation Oncology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x2405-63087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2017.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166520169100305592002801996650001302024650002002037650002502057650001502082650001502097650002002112650002102132650001702153650001302170651001002183653001302193653001502206653001502221653001102236653001502247653001302262700001602275700001802291700001702309700001802326700001702344700001602361773013302377856008502510852000902595655001202604IND60740999820221119051132.0211213e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074099982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.1105142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xiantao10aMiniaturized trace fossils in microbialites from the Cambrian Series 2 Qingxudong Formation in the Panshi area, eastern Guizhou, China  aTrace fossils are especially useful to elucidating metazoan evolution and species extinction events through geologic history. This paper reports results of an investigation of well exposed microbialites in the Cambrian Series 2 (upper Toyonian–lower Amgan) Qingxudong Formation (QF) of the Panshi area, eastern Guizhou Province. Light and scanning electron microscopic examination of these deposits has revealed for the first time small Planolites. Detailed analysis of these trace fossils has helped elucidate their mode of formation mechanism and their relationship with the extinction of Archaeocyathids early in the Toyonian. Our results suggest that the trace-makers had a trophic specialization strategy and selectively fed in a low-energy and Girvanella-rich environment. They were the pioneers of ecosystem recovery following extinction of reef-building Archaeocyathids and had survived the earlier oxygen-depleted environment. Sedimentary facies evolution manifested by the studied deposits and penecontemporaneous siderite indicates that the trace fossils formed in a shallow sea in which a weakly reducing, sulfur-poor sedimentary environment had been established in association with transgression. The recovery and expansion of microbial reefs and the miniaturization of trace fossils suggest that the anoxic environment severely inhibited metazoans and may have contributed significantly to the extinction of reef-building Archaeocyathids during the early Toyonian time and the slow recovery of ecosystems that followed. Our results provide impetus for further research on the extinction event and the recovery process of metazoans in the late period of Cambrian Epoch 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aCambrian period 3aanaerobic conditions 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asiderite 3aChina 0aToyonian 0aPlanolites 0aGirvanella 0aAnoxia 0aExtinction 0aRecovery1 aXiang, Fang1 aSu, Zhongtang1 aZhang, Deyan1 aLash, Gary G.1 aYang, Kunmei1 aYou, Wenzhi0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 576 p.110514-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.1105143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011100170300001600281520167200297592002801969650002801997650001502025650002202040650002502062650004002087650001402127650001602141650002602157650001202183650001702195653003402212653004802246653005102294653004402345653002302389700001902412700006202431700006202493700006002555700001902615700001902634700005902653700002302712700002502735773033802760856008503098852000903183655001203192IND60762379920221119115315.0220222e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076237992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2021.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasano, Tommaso10aSearch for familial hypercholesterolemia patients in an Italian community: A real-life retrospective study  ap. 577-585.  aFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common inherited disorder of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism that causes elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Despite the availability of effective treatments, FH remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. The aims of the study were to identify putative FH subjects using data from laboratory and cardiology databases, genetically characterize suspected FH patients referred to the Lipid Clinic and monitor attainment of treatment goals in identified patients. We retrieved the electronic health records of 221,644 individuals referred to laboratory for routine assessment and of 583 ASCVD patients (age ≤65) who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). We monitored the lipid profiles of subjects with LDL-C ≥ 250 mg/dl identified by laboratory survey (LS-P), PTCA patients and patients from the Lipid Clinic (LC-P). The laboratory survey identified 1.46% of subjects with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dl and 0.08% with LDL-C ≥ 250 mg/dl. Probable/definite FH was suspected in 3% of PTCA patients. Molecularly-confirmed FH was found in 44% of LC-P subjects. Five new LDLR mutations were identified. The 50% LDL-C reduction target was achieved by 70.6% of LC-P patients. Only 18.5% of PTCA patients reached the LDL-C < 55 mg/dl target. By using a combined approach based on laboratory lipid profiles, documented ASCVD and Lipid Clinic data, we were able to identify subjects with a high probability of being FH. Attainment of LDL-C goals was largely suboptimal. Efforts are needed to improve FH detection and achievement of lipid targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3acatabolism 3agenetic disorders 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anutrition 3aprobability 3aretrospective studies 3asurveys 3atelemedicine 0aFamilial Hypercholesterolemia 0aLow-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) 0aAtherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) 0aDutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) score 0aESC/EAS guidelines1 aTrenti, Chiara1 aNegri, Emanuele A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5828-65101 aGuiducci, Vincenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0833-27851 aForacchia, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3140-80791 aBonelli, Efrem1 aCanovi, Simone1 aBesutti, Giulia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5319-54951 aBertolini, Stefano1 aCalandra, Sebastiano0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.577-585dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245008900162300001600251500000900267520125100276592002801527650001501555650002801570650001801598650002401616650001301640650001201653650001901665650002001684650002801704650001501732650001801747650001101765650002601776650001301802651001001815700002101825700002201846700001701868773012201885852000902007856007902016655001202095IND4406917520221123005746.0191226e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440691752DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2007.00422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuir, James P.10aHarvest Techniques Change Annual Warm-Season Legume Forage Yield and Nutritive Value  ap. 765-770.  aepub  aComparison among warm-season legume forage trials may not be valid if harvest techniques vary. To address this question, herbage dry matter (DM) yields, branching, crude protein (CP), and fiber concentrations for nine warm-season annual herbaceous legumes were measured by hand-plucking all leaves and pliable tips or clipping at 7.5- or 15-cm height. The experiment was conducted in Texas on a Windthorst fine sandy loam over 2 yr. Harvest technique did not affect DM yield in 2004, but the hand-plucked harvest technique produced 34 to 39% less forage in 2005 (low rainfall year) compared with the clipped plots. Most entries had greater branching on hand-plucked than on clipped plants (entry by harvest P < 0.05). Crude protein concentration was greater (P < 0.05) and fiber concentrations lower in the hand-plucked compared with the clipped plants. These results suggest that neither yields nor nutritive values of hand-plucked forage trials examining annual warm-season herbaceous legumes should be compared with clipped forage trials, whereas clipping heights may be less problematic. Results support a careful choice of experiment harvest technique based on the future field-scale harvest method or degree of target herbivore selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3ainterspecific variation 3afiber content 3aexperimental design 3aFabaceae 3acutting 3aforage legumes 3anutritive value 3adry matter accumulation 3acrop yield 3acrude protein 3aheight 3afield experimentation 3abranches 3aTexas1 aButler, Twain J.1 aWolfe, Richard M.1 aBow, John R.0 tAgronomy journal.g2008 May, v. 100, no. 3 p.765-770dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2007.00423Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02346naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245011900212300001600331500001900347520110800366592002801474650001501502650001101517650001701528650001101545651002301556653002901579653001401608653001501622653001901637653001201656653000801668653001601676653001501692653001501707700002201722773009901744856008401843852000901927655001201936IND60708344920221117171718.0200824e20200821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070834492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.oneear.2020.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCumming, Graeme S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3678-132610aQuantifying Social-Ecological Scale Mismatches Suggests People Should Be Managed at Broader Scales Than Ecosystems  ap. 251-259.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe management of natural resources creates feedbacks between ecosystems and societies, both of which exist at characteristic scales. Theory predicts that sustainability is higher when governance and management scales align with scales of ecological heterogeneity. We analyzed the areas of institutions (10,030 permissions from 7,478 permits in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, 2007–2017) and compared these with the areas of reef features and non-reef marine bioregions. Permission extents were bimodal; 72% were fine scale (median 16.5 km²), and 28% were broad scale (median 99,193 km²). Biophysical data were unimodal and at significantly smaller scales than permissions. Different permission scales for different activities indicated adaptability within the permitting system. Our analysis demonstrates a new approach to quantifying scale mismatches. It suggests that discrete institutional scales exist but differ from ecological scales and that rules at broader scales than the managed resource may allow greater adaptation and responsiveness by human users than rules at the same scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3ahumans 3amarine parks 3apeople 3aGreat Barrier Reef 0asocial-ecological system 0aecosystem 0aresilience 0asustainability 0ascaling 0afit 0ainstitution 0amanagement 0acoral reef1 aDobbs, Kirstin A.0 tOne earth.g2020 Aug. 21, v. 3, no. 2 p.251-259dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27390x2590-33227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008900172300001600261520088500277592002801162650001501190650001101205650002101216650002001237653003001257653003201287653001401319653002401333653002401357653002201381700002201403700002201425700001901447700003401466700006401500773007401564856008401638852000901722655001201731IND60582451420221120184332.0171006e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058245142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández, Luis,10aArtificial neural networks for short-term load forecasting in microgrids environment  ap. 252-264.  aThe adaptation of energy production to demand has been traditionally very important for utilities in order to optimize resource consumption. This is especially true also in microgrids where many intelligent elements have to adapt their behaviour depending on the future generation and consumption conditions. However, traditional forecasting has been performed only for extremely large areas, such as nations and regions. This work aims at presenting a solution for short-term load forecasting (STLF) in microgrids, based on a three-stage architecture which starts with pattern recognition by a self-organizing map (SOM), a clustering of the previous partition via k-means algorithm, and finally demand forecasting for each cluster with a multilayer perceptron. Model validation was performed with data from a microgrid-sized environment provided by the Spanish company Iberdrola.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 0aArtificial neural network 0aShort-term load forecasting 0aMicrogrid 0aPattern recognition 0aSelf-organizing map 0ak-Means algorithm1 aBaladrón, Carlos1 aAguiar, Javier M.1 aCarro, Belén,1 aSánchez-Esguevillas, Antonio1 aLloret Mauri, Jaime,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0862-05330 tEnergy.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 75 p.252-264dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.07.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245008300184520139300267592002801660650002801688650001801716650002801734650001501762650001901777650001701796650001101813650001501824650001601839650000901855650001901864650002101883653000701904653000701911653001101918653000801929653000901937653000701946653000801953653001001961653000801971653000701979653000801986653000801994653000802002653000702010653000802017653000702025653000802032653000802040653001402048653000902062653000802071653001802079653002702097653002002124700002702144700003102171700002902202700003202231700003002263773011402293856008602407852000902493655001202502IND60752500920221120215436.0220124e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075250092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1273442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardes, Rodrigo Cupertino10aToxicological assessment of agrochemicals on bees using machine learning tools  aMachine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables the analysis of complex multivariate data. ML has significant potential in risk assessments of non-target insects for modeling the multiple factors affecting insect health, including the adverse effects of agrochemicals. Here, the potential of ML for risk assessments of glyphosate (herbicide; formulation) and imidacloprid (insecticide, neonicotinoid; formulation) on the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata was explored. The collective behavior of forager bees was analyzed after in vitro exposure to agrochemicals. ML algorithms were applied to identify the agrochemicals that the bees have been exposed to based on multivariate behavioral features. Changes in the in situ detection of different proteins in the midgut were also studied. Imidacloprid exposure leads to the greatest changes in behavior. The ML algorithms achieved a higher accuracy (up to 91%) in identifying agrochemical contamination. The two agrochemicals altered the detection of cells positive for different proteins, which can be detrimental to midgut physiology. This study provides a holistic assessment of the sublethal effects of glyphosate and imidacloprid on a key pollinator. The procedures used here can be applied in future studies to monitor and predict multiple environmental factors affecting insect health in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelipona quadrifasciata 3aagrochemicals 3aartificial intelligence 3aglyphosate 3agroup behavior 3aimidacloprid 3amidgut 3aphysiology 3apollinators 3arisk 3astingless bees 3atoxicity testing 0aML 0aAI 0aERK1/2 0aJNK 0aMAPK 0acf 0aGLM 0aANOVA 0aRFE 0aRF 0aLDA 0aQDA 0aKNN 0aNB 0aSVM 0aGB 0aMLP 0aPCA 0aPERMANOVA 0aAChE 0aACh 0aEcotoxicology 0aPhysiological response 0aRisk assessment1 aBotina, Lorena Lisbetd1 ada Silva, Fernanda Pereira1 aFernandes, Kenner Morais1 aLima, Maria Augusta Pereira1 aMartins, Gustavo Ferreira0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 424 p.127344-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1273443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011300171520132700284592002801611650001301639650002001652650001301672650002201685650001101707650002201718650001301740653001701753653001901770653002301789653001301812653002301825653002901848653002601877700001901903700002301922700001801945700002001963773011401983856008602097852000902183655001202192IND60752501020221120082325.0220404e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075250102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1273452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunghare, Suraj10aThermite reaction driven pyrotechnic formulation with promising functional performance and reduced emissions  aGreen pyrotechnics/firecrackers reported herein are driven by thermite reactions for self-contained and self-sustained exothermic chemical reactions to make heat and sound by the usage of minimal fuel (aluminum), oxidizer (potassium nitrate), and Sulfur. These firecrackers have the potential for generating less emissions (70%) compared to commercial firecracker-based counterparts due to the presence of additives and are therefore designated as “Green firecrackers” or reduced emissions firecrackers. The functional performance and long-term stability of the composition was investigated through sound measurement and different tests, including ageing, thermal stability, and moisture test. The thermodynamics of the facilitated thermite reaction was cross-checked with experimental and theoretical methods. Prevalent mechanism for a substantial reduction in emissions to the tune of about 70% has been discussed. Cost of the green firecrackers is at par with the commercial firecrackers as cost of raw materials being used to prepare the formulation is comparable to the relatively toxic oxidizer substituted. “Green firecrackers” developed and reported here are environmentally benign in nature with higher business potential as far as a green chemistry-based sustainable solution for the society is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aheat production 3aoxidants 3apotassium nitrate 3asulfur 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 0aPyrotechnics 0aThermodynamics 0aThermite reactions 0aOxidizer 0aEmission reduction 0aEco-friendly firecracker 0aSustainable chemistry1 aKumari, Shilpa1 aChaudhary, Avinash1 aKumar, Rakesh1 aRayalu, Sadhana0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 424 p.127345-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1273453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245012100201300002000322520164500342592002801987650001302015650001402028650002802042650001902070650001702089650001102106650001202117650001602129650001902145650001902164650001602183650001102199650002002210650001902230700005902249700007002308773014202378856007902520852000902599655001202608IND60626180120221120162424.0181218e20181127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062618012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b057682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoo, Chanhee1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4595-996310aRelating Organic Fouling in Membrane Distillation to Intermolecular Adhesion Forces and Interfacial Surface Energies  ap. 14198-14207.  aThis study investigates the fouling mechanisms in membrane distillation, focusing on the impact of foulant type and membrane surface chemistry. Interaction forces between a surface-functionalized particle probe simulating a range of organic foulants and model surfaces, modified with different surface energy materials, were measured by atomic force microscopy. The measured interaction forces were compared to those calculated based on the experimentally determined surface energy components of the particle probe, model surface, and medium (i.e., water). Surfaces with low interfacial energy exhibited high attractive interaction forces with organic foulants, implying a higher fouling potential. In contrast, hydrophilic surfaces (i.e., surfaces with high interfacial energy) showed the lowest attractive forces with all types of foulants. We further performed fouling experiments with alginate, humic acid, and mineral oil in direct contact membrane distillation using polyvinylidene fluoride membranes modified with various materials to control membrane surface energy. The observed fouling behavior was compared to the interaction force data to better understand the underlying fouling mechanisms. A remarkable correlation was obtained between the evaluated interaction force data and the fouling behavior of the membranes with different surface energy. Membranes with low surface energy were fouled by hydrophobic, low surface tension foulants via “attractive” and subsequent “adsorptive” interaction mechanisms. Furthermore, such membranes have a higher fouling potential than membranes with high or ultralow surface energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalginates 3aatomic force microscopy 3adirect contact 3adistillation 3aenergy 3afouling 3ahumic acids 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amineral oil 3amodels 3asurface tension 3athermoplastics1 aHong, Seungkwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9455-64341 aElimelech, M.q(Menachem),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4186-15630 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Nov. 27, v. 52, no. 24 p.14198-14207dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b057683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010800169300001600277520134000293592002801633650001401661650001801675650001101693650001801704650001801722650001101740650002601751650002101777653002601798653001401824653001501838653001601853653001601869700001701885700002501902700001701927773007401944856008402018852000902102655001202111IND60582451720221120194548.0171006e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058245172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.07.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrasco, L.M.10aIn-field assessment of batteries and PV modules in a large photovoltaic rural electrification programme  ap. 281-288.  aAssuring the sustainability of quality in photovoltaic rural electrification programmes involves enhancing the reliability of the components of solar home systems as well as the characterization of the overall programme cost structure. Batteries and photovoltaic modules have a great impact on both the reliability and the cost assessment, the battery being the weakest component of the solar home system and consequently the most expensive element of the programme. The photovoltaic module, despite being the most reliable component, has a significant impact cost-wise on the initial investment, even at current market prices. This paper focuses on the in-field testing of both batteries and photovoltaic modules working under real operating conditions within a sample of 41 solar home systems belonging to a large photovoltaic rural electrification programme with more than 13,000 installed photovoltaic systems. Different reliability parameters such as lifetime have been evaluated, taking into account different factors, for example energy consumption rates, or the manufacturing quality of batteries. A degradation model has been proposed relating both loss of capacity and time of operation. The user – solar home system binomial is also analysed in order to understand the meaning of battery lifetime in rural electrification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acost analysis 3aenergy 3amanufacturing 3amarket prices 3amodels 3arural electrification 3asolar collectors 0aRural electrification 0aBatteries 0aPV modules 0aDegradation 0aReliability1 aNarvarte, L.1 aMartínez-Moreno, F.1 aMoretón, R.0 tEnergy.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 75 p.281-288dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.07.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006600146245018100212300001800393500001900411520184000430592002802270650003602298650001502334650001202349650001802361650001602379650001202395650001602407650001902423650001202442650001202454650001602466650001402482650002102496653001702517653001002534653001702544653001702561653002302578700002402601700001802625700001802643700001802661700003202679700002202711700001802733700002002751773014802771856008002919852000902999655001203008IND60731139220210418000000.0210317e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073113922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c072002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil-Cardoso, Katherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7158-582510aConsumption of Sourdough Breads Improves Postprandial Glucose Response and Produces Sourdough-Specific Effects on Biochemical and Inflammatory Parameters and Mineral Absorption  ap. 3044-3059.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo evaluate responses to different sourdough breads, six groups of rats were fed a conventional refined wheat bread with no sourdough content (C_WhB); a leavened spelt bread baked with Rebola sourdough (Re_SpB); a durum wheat bread with Rebola sourdough (Re_DuB); or a multigrain bread leavened with Rebola (Re_MGB), Carla (Ca_MGB), or San Francisco sourdough (SF_MGB). Compared to C_WhB-fed rats, Re_SpB-, Re_DuB-, and Re_MGB-fed animals showed lower postprandial blood glucose levels, whereas SF_MGB-fed rats displayed a decreased postprandial blood insulin response and glucose and insulin products. The 3 week intake of Ca_MGB decreased blood triacylglycerols and the relative apparent absorption (RAA) of Fe²⁺, Cu²⁺, and Zn²⁺, whereas Re_MGB-fed animals showed lower serum levels of the MCP-1 inflammatory marker and decreased the Fe RAA. The 3 week consumption of the multigrain bread produced sourdough-specific effects. Thus, Re_MGB-fed animals displayed higher insulin concentrations than Ca_MGB- and SF_MGB-fed rats and decreased blood MCP-1 levels compared to those of Ca_MGB-fed animals. In addition, Ca_MGB-fed rats showed lower serum triacylglycerol concentrations than those of Re_MGB- and SF_MGB-fed animals, whereas SF_MGB-fed rats displayed higher RAA values of Ca²⁺, Cu²⁺, Fe²⁺, Mg²⁺, and Zn²⁺ than their Re_MGB and Ca_MGB counterparts. These sourdough-specific effects could be related to changes in the contents of sugars and organic acids, acidity, microbial composition, and proteolytic activity among sourdoughs. Hence, the consumption of sourdough breads improved postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses and produced sourdough-specific effects on RAA and serum insulin and triacylglycerol and MCP-1 levels in rats, showing that SF_MGB has the most promising beneficial effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum subsp. spelta 3aabsorption 3aacidity 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3adurum wheat 3afood chemistry 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3aproteolysis 3asourdough 3atriacylglycerols 0afermentation 0abread 0apostprandial 0ainflammation 0amineral absorption1 aSaldaña, Guillermo1 aLuengo, Elisa1 aPastor, Jorge1 aVirto, Raquel1 aAlcaide-Hidalgo, Juan Maria1 adel Bas, Josep M.1 aArola, Lluís1 aCaimari, Antoni0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Mar. 03, v. 69, no. 10 p.3044-3059dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c072003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100005500186245005600241300002000297506007600317520156700393592002801960506003701988650001202025650002802037650002102065650001302086650001902099650001002118650004202128650001602170650001602186650001302202650001402215650001102229650000902240650001302249651001102262700002102273700002502294700001602319700002102335700002802356700005902384700002402443700002202467773014202489856007902631852000902710655001202719IND60626180220221207095037.0181218e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062618022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b064572doi7 aPMC70361372pmcid7 a304578472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Rowan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2826-940X10aCirculating miRNAs Associated with Arsenic Exposure  ap. 14487-14495.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a form of As commonly found in drinking water and in some foods. Overwhelming evidence suggests that people chronically exposed to iAs are at risk of developing cancer or cardiovascular, neurological, and metabolic diseases. Although the mechanisms underlying iAs-associated illness remain poorly characterized, a growing body of literature raises the possibility that microRNAs (miRNAs), post-transcriptional gene suppressors, may serve as mediators and/or early indicators of the pathologies associated with iAs exposure. To characterize the circulating miRNA profiles of individuals chronically exposed to iAs, samples of plasma were collected from 109 healthy residents of the city of Zimapán and the Lagunera area in Mexico, the regions with historically high exposures to iAs in drinking water. These plasma samples were analyzed for small RNAs using high-throughput sequencing and for iAs and its methylated metabolites. Associations between plasma levels of arsenic species and miRNAs were evaluated. Six circulating miRNAs (miRs-423-5p, -142-5p -2, -423-5p +1, -320c-1, -320c-2, and -454-5p), two of which have been previously linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes (miRs-423-5p, -454-5p), were found to be significantly correlated with plasma MAs. No miRNAs were associated with plasma iAs or DMAs after correction for multiple testing. These miRNAs may represent mechanistic links between iAs exposure and disease or serve as markers of disease risks associated with this exposure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarsenic 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic exposure 3adiabetes 3adrinking water 3afoods 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3apeople 3arisk 3atoxicity 3aMexico1 aBommarito, Paige1 aDouillet, Christelle1 aKanke, Matt1 aDel Razo, Luz M.1 aGarcía-Vargas, Gonzalo1 aFry, Rebecca C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0899-90181 aSethupathy, Praveen1 aStýblo, Miroslav0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 52, no. 24 p.14487-14495dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b064573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245014200208300001600350520132500366592002801691650001601719650001101735650001001746651001601756653002101772653001001793653002901803653002401832653001701856653001601873653001601889700002501905773011201930856008102042852000902123655001202132IND60601339720221118065915.0180706e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060133972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2014.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDriscoll, Killian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8613-883010aTheir lips are sealed: identifying hard stone, soft stone, and antler hammer direct percussion in Palaeolithic prismatic blade production  ap. 134-141.  aThe present experiment examined the differentiation between hard stone, soft stone, and antler hammer in Upper Palaeolithic direct percussion, prismatic blade production through the experimental knapping by two knappers who were asked to produce a series of medium-sized blades. The use of two knappers in the experiment tested knapper variability in the resultant experimental assemblage. While the majority of the attributes of blades and proximal fragments – including the presence of lipping, platform preparation, bulb presence and prominence, and curvature amongst others – did not vary significantly in regards to which hammer type either knapper used, a number of blade attributes differed, significantly yet weakly, and there was almost no direct correlation between the individual knappers blades and the hammer type they used. This suggests strongly that for a given goal of producing medium-sized blades, this can be accomplished equally well using antler, hard stone, or soft stone hammers, and the resultant blades will be difficult to tell apart. Therefore, based on the results of this series of knapping experiments, we would be hesitant in using the 21 variables tested here to differentiate between blades produced with antler, hard stone, and soft stone hammer types in the archaeological record.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3ablades 3arocks 3aMiddle East 0aBlade technology 0aChert 0aExperimental archaeology 0aKnapper variability 0aPalaeolithic 0aSoft hammer 0aHard hammer1 aGarcía-Rojas, Maite0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 July, v. 47 p.134-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016500165300001600330520172800346592002802074650003002102650001802132650001502150650004302165650001402208650001202222650002402234650002402258650000902282650002402291653004302315653001202358653002902370653002902399700001602428700001702444700002102461700001602482700001802498700001602516700001802532700001302550700001502563700001602578700001402594700001602608700001202624700001602636700005702652700001502709773033802724856008503062852000903147655001203156IND60762380420221119113920.0220411e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076238042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2022.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yang10aIndependent and joint associations of non-exercise cardiorespiratory fitness and obesity with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Rural Chinese Cohort Study  ap. 929-936.  aAn association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been established in the Chinese population. This study aimed to estimate the independent and joint associations of CRF and obesity with T2DM incidence in the rural Chinese population. We conducted a prospective study of 11,825 non-T2DM subjects among rural Chinese adults. Cox regression models were used to estimate the independent and joint associations between CRF and obesity exposure on T2DM. Restricted cubic splines were used to model the dose–response association. During a median follow-up of 6.01 years, 835 participants developed T2DM. In comparison to quartile 1 of CRF, the multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of quartiles 2, 3, 4 were 0.75 (0.61–0.91), 0.54 (0.43–0.68), and 0.42 (0.32–0.55), respectively. When stratified by sex, the results were similar. Joint analyses showed that overweight/obesity-unfit individuals had a 2.28 times higher risk of developing T2DM than the normal weight-fit referent (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.84–2.83; Pᵢₙₜₑᵣₐcₜᵢₒₙ <0.001). The risk for the overweight/obesity-fit category (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.21–2.15) was larger than for the normal weight-unfit category (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.97–1.95) versus the normal weight-fit referent. Similar joint associations for waist circumference and CRF with T2DM were also observed. A negative association was observed between CRF and risk of T2DM. Overweight/obese or abdominal obesity and unfit participants showed the highest risks of T2DM. It is therefore strongly recommended that fitness-enhancing be encouraged for the prevention of T2DM, especially among obesity participants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiorespiratory fitness 3adose response 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3awaist circumference 0aNon-exercise cardiorespiratory fitness 0aObesity 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aProspective cohort study1 aQie, Ranran1 aHan, Minghui1 aHuang, Shengbing1 aWu, Xiaoyan1 aZhang, Yanyan1 aFeng, Yifei1 aYang, Xingjin1 aLi, Yang1 aWu, Yuying1 aLiu, Dechen1 aHu, Fulan1 aZhang, Ming1 aLiu, Yu1 aSun, Xizhou1 aHu, Dongsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9998-80411 aSun, Liang0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.929-936dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2022.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008800170300001400258520117300272592002801445650001901473650002001492650002201512650001201534650001601546650001701562650001301579650001201592650002301604650001101627650002901638650001001667650001801677650001601695650001001711653001901721653001301740653003401753653003401787700002101821773007201842856008401914852000901998655001202007IND60582451920221120184356.0171006e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058245192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.05.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEr-rbib, Hanaâ10aModeling and simulation of CO methanation process for renewable electricity storage  ap. 81-88.  aIn this paper, a new approach of converting renewable electricity into methane via syngas (a mixture of CO and H2) and CO methanation is presented. Surplus of electricity is used to electrolyze H2O and CO2 to H2 and CO by using a SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell). Syngas produced is then converted into methane. When high consumption peaks appear, methane is used to produce electricity. The main conversion step in this process is CO methanation. A modeling of catalytic fixed bed methanation reactor and a design of methanation unit composed of multistage adiabatic reactors are carried out using Aspen plus™ software. The model was validated by comparing the simulated results of gas composition (CH4, CO, CO2 and H2) with industrial data. In addition, the effects of recycle ratio on adiabatic reactor stages, outlet temperature, and H2 and CO conversions are carefully investigated. It is found that for storing 10 MW of renewable electricity, methanation unit is composed of three adiabatic reactors with recycle loop and intermediate cooling at 553 K and 1.5 MPa. The methanation unit generates 3778.6 kg/h of steam at 523.2 K and 1 MPa (13.67 MW).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acomputer software 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3awater 0aCO methanation 0aModeling 0aMultistage adiabatic reactors 0aRenewable electricity storage1 aBouallou, Chakib0 tEnergy.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 75 p.81-88dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.05.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170300001500260520142300275592002801698650002601726650002701752650001201779650001301791650001101804650001201815650001701827650000901844650001101853650001501864650001101879650001601890650001401906650001001920650001201930650000901942700001601951700002001967773008801987856008402075852000902159655001202168IND60573004720221116222314.0170720e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057300472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.05.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVachová, Pavla10aUsing expansive grasses for monitoring heavy metal pollution in the vicinity of roads  ap. 94-101.  aWe propose a method for monitoring heavy metal deposition in the vicinity of roads using the leaf surfaces of two expansive grass species which are greatly abundant. A principle of the proposed procedure is to minimize the number of operations in collecting and preparing samples for analysis. The monitored elements are extracted from the leaf surfaces using dilute nitric acid directly in the sample-collection bottle. The ensuing steps, then, are only to filter the extraction solution and the elemental analysis itself. The verification results indicate that the selected grasses Calamagrostis epigejos and Arrhenatherum elatius are well suited to the proposed procedure. Selected heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr, and Cd) in concentrations appropriate for direct determination using methods of elemental analysis can be extracted from the surface of leaves of these species collected in the vicinity of roads with medium traffic loads. Comparing the two species showed that each had a different relationship between the amounts of deposited heavy metals and distance from the road. This disparity can be explained by specific morphological properties of the two species' leaf surfaces. Due to the abundant occurrence of the two species and the method's general simplicity and ready availability, we regard the proposed approach to constitute a broadly usable and repeatable one for producing reproducible results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArrhenatherum elatius 3aCalamagrostis epigejos 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3agrasses 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3anickel 3anitric acid 3apollution 3aroads 3atraffic 3azinc1 aVach, Marek1 aNajnarová, Eva0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Oct., v. 229 p.94-101dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.05.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245006800179300001600247520089300263592002801156650002901184650002201213650001601235650001101251650000901262650001201271650001701283651001101300653001101311653001201322653001601334700002301350700002701373773007401400856008401474852000901558655001201567IND60582452120221120194533.0171006e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058245212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.07.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoroneos, Christopher J.10aExergy analysis of a 300 MW lignite thermoelectric power plant  ap. 304-311.  aIn recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread to the fields of physics and engineering as a useful decision making tool.

In this study, an exergy analysis of a 300 MW lignite thermoelectric power plant, located in Ptolemais Greece, is carried out. In order to promote a more efficient solution, the existing lignite thermoelectric power plant is compared with three different cogeneration (CHP (combined heat and power)) systems, employing the Rankine cycle, designed to use the same amount of fuel as the existing one. The performed exergy analysis reveals that the utilization of the proposed CHP systems may result to a significant increase of the energy efficiency, compared to the performance of the existing power plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision support systems 3aenergy efficiency 3aengineering 3aexergy 3aheat 3alignite 3apower plants 3aGreece 0aExergy 0aLignite 0aPower plant1 aFokaides, Paris A.1 aChristoforou, Elias A.0 tEnergy.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 75 p.304-311dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.07.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013400163300001600297520132200313592002801635650001301663650002401676650001301700650001501713650001901728653001301747653001301760653002401773653002201797653002201819773010001841856008501941852000902026655001202035IND60741000920221120232704.0220207e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074100092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Dan10aFour-way coupled second-order method of two-fluid model for gas-particle flow and the numerical simulation in horizontal channels  ap. 354-368.  aIn this study, a four-way coupled second-order method of Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model is proposed to numerically investigate the gas-particle flow, where exist particle-particle collisions, however, the particle turbulence is far from equilibrium to satisfy the Boussinesq approximation. The second-order two-fluid model is developed by coupling the gas phase model of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes method closed by the second-order Reynolds stress turbulence model with the particle simulation equations of second-order moment method of kinetic theory of granular flow. The four-way coupling method is established considering the particle-particle collisions and fluid-particle interactions, which are represented by the momentum exchange between two phases, fluid turbulence generation and/or dissipation due to the presence of particles, and the particle fluctuation due to drag fluctuations. Furthermore, the model is applied to the pneumatic conveying in a horizontal channel to demonstrate the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid modeling of the gas-particle flow in the median concentration of the particles. The model is found superior to the two-way coupled method and the classic isotropic method of kinetic theory of granular flow. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aisotropy 3amathematical models 3amomentum 3atechnology 3aturbulent flow 0aSOM-KTGF 0aRANS-RSM 0aSecond-order method 0aFour-way coupling 0aGas-particle flow0 tPowder technology.g2021 Sept., v. 390 p.354-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.05.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245011500205300001600320520192900336592002802265650001402293650002902307650001202336650002402348650002902372650002102401650001602422650002502438650001402463650001002477650001902487650001802506650001302524650001102537650002202548651001802570653001702588653002102605653002102626653001602647653002302663653002002686700002102706700001602727700001702743700005702760773010002817856008602917852000903003655001203012IND60625873020221122074533.0190412e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062587302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1500-051912aA functional group approach reveals important fish recruitments driven by flood pulses in floodplain ecosystem  ap. 130-139.  aThe periodical flood pulses, assisting by the connectivity between rivers and lakes in floodplain ecosystems, are of paramount importance in underpins fish meta-communities. Regardless of the unprecedented anthropogenic disturbances on natural flood regimes, there is limited understanding for the response of fish assemblages to flood pulses. Most studies documented the issue sorely on floodplain rivers or floodplain lakes, but the dynamics of fish communities in the transitional floodplains accounting for both lentic and lotic environments are rarely reported. Here we measure temporal (high and low water seasons) and spatial (lotic and lentic environments) patterns of fish assemblages in the transitional floodplain between the Yangtze River and Lake Caizi using taxonomic and functional group metrics. Our results demonstrated significantly variations in fish community composition among different environments between high and low water seasons. During flooding season in high water phase, we observed significantly patchy population recruitments of riverine fish species. Then in low water season, widespread lake residents dominated the lentic environments due to their higher environment tolerance. Benefitting from the functional group measurement, we identified three flooding related functional groups i.e., G2, G9 and G10 (consisting of riverine catfishes, gudgeons, and loaches), that may bear the brunt of natural flood pulses alterations. Despite the significant variations of richness in taxonomic diversity, we detected higher sensitivity of functional diversity, since three functional diversity indices were significantly higher in high water season. This findings demonstrated important functional recruitments triggered by flood pulses, highlighting a pressing need to sustain natural flood regime with hydrological connectivity for better conservation of fish assemblages in floodplain ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCobitidae 3aanthropogenic activities 3acatfish 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental indicators 3afish communities 3afloodplains 3afunctional diversity 3ahydrology 3alakes 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3amoieties 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3aYangtze River 0aFlood pulses 0aFunctional group 0aLentic and lotic 0aFloodplains 0aHigh and low water 0aFreshwater fish1 aJiang, Zhongguan1 aZhou, Lizhi1 aDai, Bingguo1 aSong, Zhuoyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6056-85680 tEcological indicators.g2019 Apr., v. 99 p.130-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011300175300001600288520121300304592002801517650002801545650001601573650002301589650002901612650001601641650001201657650001501669650001001684650001901694650002001713650002001733650001201753651001101765653001601776653001101792653001701803653002801820653001901848700002601867700002101893700003101914773011401945856008502059852000902144655001202153IND60566117820221120144319.0170401e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056611782DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2016.11883682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos-Reyes, Jaime10aSchoolchildren's earthquake knowledge, preparedness, and risk perception of a seismic-prone region of Mexico  ap. 494-507.  aThe paper presents results of a cross-sectional study regarding schoolchildren's seismic risk perception, awareness, and preparedness in a sample size of 817 in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The approach is the application of a questionnaire survey. The main conclusion is that schoolchildren considered in the study are vulnerable to earthquakes due to the lack of a seismic education program. Some relevant results are summarized as follows: (1) over 50% of schoolchildren reported “little fear,” about 25% reported “a lot of fear” during earthquakes, and 19.4% reported low levels of perceived coping abilities; (2) male children get less afraid and show an increased degree of belief in their ability to cope emotionally with earthquakes than females; (3) about 50% of schoolchildren showed deficiencies in knowledge about earthquakes; (4) older schoolchildren (fifth to sixth grade) are more knowledgeable on earthquakes than younger ones (third to fourth grade); (5) a significant number of schoolchildren are not well prepared for what to do before, during, and after an earthquake; and (6) in general, urban schoolchildren are better prepared toward earthquakes than semi-rural schoolchildren.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3aearthquakes 3aeducation programs 3aenvironmental assessment 3afearfulness 3afemales 3ageophysics 3amales 3aquestionnaires 3arisk perception 3aschool children 3asurveys 3aMexico 0aearthquakes 0aMexico 0apreparedness 0aseismic risk perception 0aschoolchildren1 aSantos-Reyes, Galdino1 aGouzeva, Tatiana1 aVelazquez-Martinez, Daniel0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 23, no. 3 p.494-507dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2016.11883683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245015200205300001800357500001900375520094200394592002801336650001101364650003901375650002401414650001301438650003201451650001601483650001901499650001901518650001201537650002201549650001001571650001701581650001901598650001301617653001601630653002801646653003001674653001401704653002201718700001801740700001901758700001901777700001901796700001501815773014801830856008001978852000902058655001202067IND60731139720221120070744.0210317e20210302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073113972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c075432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevi-Zada, Anat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8951-476910aAbsolute Configuration of the Spherical Mealybug Nipaecoccus viridis Sex Pheromone, γ-Necrodyl Isobutyrate: Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Bioassays  ap. 3026-3031.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe spherical mealybug, Nipaecoccus viridis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), is a major global pest causing feeding damage to leaves and fruits of citrus varieties, soybean, mango, pomegranate, and grapevines. Females of the mealybug release a sex pheromone that was identified recently as a mixture of γ-necrodyl isobutyrate and γ-necrodol. The identification required synthesis based on a natural source of trans-α-necrodol, of unknown chirality, obtained from essential oil of Spanish lavender, Lavandula luisieri. To determine the chirality of the sex pheromone, here, we synthesize the γ-necrodyl acetate enriched in (+)-(S)-enantiomer and separate the enantiomers using a lipase enzyme. We confirm that the natural components, both in the mealybug and in the lavender essential oil, consist of (−)-(R)-enantiomers. Bioassays conducted in the lab and field show that males are attracted to (−)-(R)-γ-necrodyl isobutyrate alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aLavandula stoechas subsp. luisieri 3aNipaecoccus viridis 3aacetates 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aenantiomers 3aessential oils 3afood chemistry 3amangoes 3aoptical isomerism 3apests 3apomegranates 3asex pheromones 3asoybeans 0aγ-necrodol 0aγ-necrodyl isobutyrate 0achemoenzymatic separation 0apheromone 0atrans-α-necrodol1 aSteiner, Sara1 aBen-Aziz, Orna1 aProtasov, Alex1 aFefer, Daniela1 aKaspi, Roy0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Mar. 02, v. 69, no. 10 p.3026-3031dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c075433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01962naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008900170300001600259520088800275592002801163650001301191650001501204650001501219650002901234650001101263650000901274650001801283650001301301653003001314653001501344653001601359653001701375773011401392856008501506852000901591655001201600IND60566117920221120144141.0170401e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056611792DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2016.12037242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chongfu10aPavement model in Internet of intelligences and applications in risk analysis online  ap. 412-425.  aIn this article, I suggest a model to study the risk issue that can be mapped into a query on how to pass a road safely. The model is called the pavement model, which can be used in the Internet of intelligences. The model has three components: object, value of success or failure, and duration of the value. An object is mapped into a section of road, the value is defined by the truth value of success or failure passing the road, and the duration represents the number of parts with the value in the session. The case of choosing milk powder shows that the model can perfectly integrate childcare experiences to be a rank that indicates which milk powder should be the first choice and which milk powder is not recommended to buy.

This study focuses on investigating the underlying mechanisms of goethite precipitation on magnetite and maghemite MNPs, providing insights on Fe(III)ₐq adsorption and nucleation of goethite on MNPs. A predictive surface complexation/precipitation model of the system was developed based on the results from two different types of experiments: the potentiometric titration of MNPs to calculate proton binding constants (Kₐ) of discrete MNP surface functional groups and the corresponding site concentrations; and adsorption of Fe(III)ₐq onto MNP surfaces to determine metal binding constants (Kf). The composition of the surface complexes on MNPs was determined by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The results indicated the formation of polynuclear surface complexes. The content of polynuclear surface complexes was found to be significantly higher on maghemite MNPs than on magnetite MNPs. This trend is consistent with our experimental results of a greater goethite precipitation on maghemite than on magnetite. Overall, the formation of Fe(III) polynuclear surface complexes correlates directly to the nucleation and precipitation of goethite on the surfaces of both types of MNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalcium sulfate 3agoethite 3airon 3amaghemite 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3atitration 3azinc1 aSun, Wei1 aHu, Yuehua1 aXu, Zhenghe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8118-19200 tLangmuir.g2018 Oct. 09, v. 34, no. 50 p.15134-15142dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b025713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245018500165300001400350520151000364592002801874650001601902650001001918650001101928650001301939650001901952650001101971650002101982650002102003650001302024650002002037650002002057651001702077653001502094653001902109653001102128653001302139653003102152700001902183700002202202700005702224773011002281856008102391852000902472655001202481IND60601340020221118224621.0180706e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060134002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2014.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSealy, Judith10aComparison of two methods of extracting bone collagen for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis: comparing whole bone demineralization with gelatinization and ultrafiltration  ap. 64-69.  aWe compare two methods of isolating bone collagen for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis. The older method (as practised at the University of Cape Town) demineralizes bone ‘chunks’, while the newer method (as practised at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig) involves demineralization, gelatinization and ultra-filtration to select only higher molecular weight protein fragments for isotopic analysis. The latter method was developed for problematic (i.e. poorly-preserved) samples and while it is more rigorous, it is also significantly more expensive and more labor-intensive. Our aim is to find out whether there is any difference between the δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N of bone collagen isolated from relatively well-preserved bones using the two methods. Our sample set consists of 5 modern and 47 archaeological animal and human bones from the southern and western parts of South Africa. Archaeological specimens range in age from a few hundred to approximately six thousand years old. Collagen was extracted, its quality assessed using %C, %N and C:N, and δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values measured independently in both laboratories. There are no statistically significant differences between the sets of δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values from the two laboratories. For relatively well-preserved bones, the ‘chunk’ method of collagen preparation continues to be an acceptable alternative to more sophisticated collagen extraction protocols for C and N isotope analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3abones 3acarbon 3acollagen 3agelatinization 3ahumans 3aisotope labeling 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3astable isotopes 3aultrafiltration 3aSouth Africa 0aPalaeodiet 0aStable isotope 0aCarbon 0aNitrogen 0aCollagen extraction method1 aJohnson, Malia1 aRichards, Michael1 aNehlich, Olaf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4993-50130 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 July, v. 47 p.64-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245008500157300001600242520150900258592002801767650001901795650001101814650001101825650002301836650001701859650001301876650001901889650002601908650001301934650002501947650001101972650000901983650002501992650002202017650002002039650001102059650001602070650001002086650002502096653001402121653004102135653002002176653001902196653001702215700002202232700002102254700002102275773009502296856003802391852000902429655001202438IND4467648320221120113647.0120316s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446764832DNAL7 a10.1071/FP111562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Joaquim M.10aGrapevine varieties exhibiting differences in stomatal response to water deficit  ap. 179-189.  aKnowledge on variety traits and physiological responses to stress is still scarce in Vitis vinifera L., limiting the optimisation of irrigation and breeding for high water use efficiency. We have characterised five grapevine varieties using thermal imaging, leaf gas exchange, leaf morphology and carbon isotope composition. Plants of the varieties Aragonez, Trincadeira, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Touriga Nacional were grown in field conditions. Two experiments were performed. In Experiment I (2006), vines of Aragonez and Trincadeira were either well irrigated (WI, 80% ETc), non-irrigated but rain fed (NI) or subjected to regulated deficit irrigation (RDI, 40% ETc) and studied along the summer season. In Experiment II (2006 and 2007), vines of the five varieties were subjected to RDI (30–40% ETc) and studied at veraison. In Experiment I, leaf temperature (Tleaf) correlated negatively with stomatal conductance (gs) and leaf water potential (Ψpd). The inverse relationship between gs and Tleaf was highly significant in the afternoon. In Experiment II, the different genotypes showed different Tleaf for similar Ψpd. Stomatal density did not correlate with gs suggesting that varieties have different stomatal control. Our results show that combined measurements of canopy temperature and Ψpd can aid in better understanding of stomatal regulation in different grapevine varieties. Such variation in stomatal regulation should be taken into account in determining irrigation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3acanopy 3acarbon 3adeficit irrigation 3agas exchange 3agenotype 3aimage analysis 3airrigation management 3aisotopes 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3arain 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3asummer 3atemperature 3avines 3awater use efficiency 0agenotypes 0astomatal conductance to water vapour 0athermal imaging 0aVitis vinifera 0awater stress1 aOrtuño, Maria F.1 aLopes, Carlos M.1 aChaves, Maria M.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2012, v. 39, no. 3 p.179-189dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP11156  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010400171300001600275520094400291592002801235650001201263650001301275650001201288650001101300650001201311650001201323650001301335650002001348650001101368650001101379650002001390650000901410650000901419650001401428650001401442650001401456650001101470650001401481650001301495650001101508650001101519650001401530650001201544650000901556651001501565651001101580653001201591653001501603653001601618653001101634653001001645653001701655700002801672700002301700700002601723773010501749856008401854852000901938655001201947IND60560340620221119231118.0170105e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056034062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalandysz, Jerzy10aAccumulation and distribution of metallic elements and metalloids in edible Amanita fulva mushrooms  ap. 265-271.  aBaseline concentrations of Ag, Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sr, Tl, V, U and Zn were presented in Amanita fulva collected from unpolluted areas in Poland.

Marked decline in microbial diversity in ZJW group was accompanied by its correspondent function adjustment. Specific enrichment of genus Bacteroides, Sutterella, Akkermansia and Roseburia along with the major varying amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism were observed meantime. Metabolic data further corroborated that ZJW-related metabolic changes were basically gathered in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate/energy metabolism and lipid metabolism. Of note, some biochemical parameters were deeply implicated with the discriminative microbial genera and metabolites involved in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and amino acid metabolism, indicating the microbiome-metabolome association in gut microbiota-metabolite-phenotype axis during UC treatment of ZJW. For the first time, integrated microbiome-metabolome analysis depicted that ZJW could alleviate DSS-induced UC in rats via a crosstalk between gut microbiota and host cometabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aRoseburia 3aSutterella 3aamino acid metabolism 3aanimal models 3adextran sulfate 3adigestive system 3aenergy metabolism 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3atherapeutics 3aulcerative colitis 0aUlcerative colitis 0aGut microbiota 0aMetabolomics 0aZuo-Jin-Wan 0aANOVA 0aCMC-Na 0aDAI 0aDSS 0aIACUC 0aIBD 0aLEfSe 0aOTUs 0aPICRUSt 0aRDA 0aSASP 0aSCFAs 0aTCA 0aUC 0aZJW1 aLi, Siju1 aZhang, Xiaojun1 aCao, Xueqin1 aLiu, Deliang1 aZhu, Yanglu1 aYe, Simin1 aXu, Zengmei1 aLiao, Qiongfeng1 aHong, Yanjun1 aXie, Zhiyong0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Apr., v. 98 p.153914-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1539143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245012600171500001900297520156600316592002801882650003001910650001901940650002501959650001201984650002301996650003002019650001302049650002102062650002002083650001102103650001202114650001302126650001402139650001502153650003202168650002402200650003102224650001102255653001502266653001702281653003302298653002702331653002202358700001502380700001702395700001802412700001702430700001602447700001702463773010302480856008902583852000902672655001202681IND60707612720221119103250.0201206e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070761272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.1044062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Huihui10aControl of postharvest grey spot rot of loquat fruit with Metschnikowia pulcherrima E1 and potential mechanisms of action  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study, the biocontrol efficacy of Metschnikowia pulcherrima E1 against grey spot rot (Pestalotiopsis vismiae) on loquat fruits was assessed and along with potential mechanisms of action. Results indicated that decay incidence and lesion diameter were both significantly reduced by treatment of fruits with the yeast, M. pulcherrima E1. M. pulcherrima E1 quickly colonized wounds in loquat fruit stored at either 20 °C or 4 °C. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the yeast formed a biofilm on the wound surface in loquat fruit which inhibited the invasion of pathogenic fungi. M. pulcherrima E1 also competed with the pathogen for nutrients (iron) and space. Results of dual-culture petri dish assay indicated that M. pulcherrima E1 produces volatile antifungal compounds that inhibit the growth of P. vismiae. SPME-GC–MS analysis revealed that 3-methyl-1-butanol, phenylethyl alcohol and 1-Hexanol are the main volatile organic compounds produced by M. pulcherrima E1 and that had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of fungal mycelia. M. pulcherrima E1 induced a higher level of defense-related enzyme activity in loquat fruit, including polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. Collectively, the results of the present study indicate that M. pulcherrima E1 has good potential to be used as a biocontrol agent against postharvest grey spot rot on loquats. The different mechanisms of action exhibited by M. pulcherrima E1 enhances its ability to control P. vismiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetschnikowia pulcherrima 3aPestalotiopsis 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abiofilm 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3aloquats 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3avolatile organic compounds 3ayeasts 0aBiocontrol 0aLoquat fruit 0aMetschnikowia pulcherrima E1 0aPestalotiopsis vismiae 0aAction mechanisms1 aWang, Ling1 aLi, Shengjie1 aGao, Xingbiao1 aWu, Ningning1 aZhao, Yifan1 aSun, Weihong0 tBiological control.g2021 Jan., v. 152 p.104406-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.1044063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245015300171300001600324520132200340592002801662650002701690650001801717650001901735650001901754650001401773650001301787650001201800650003001812650000901842650002401851650002101875653002701896653001401923653004301937653004001980653002002020653001302040700002502053773012902078856008002207852000902287655001202296IND60622194120221120093541.0181124e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062219412DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132176983292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayanth, Hampapura S10aSurvival of a native toxigenic isolate of Listeria monocytogenes CFR 1302 during storage of milk-based foods can be a potential cause of health risk  ap. 426-436.  aThe ability of a native toxigenic culture of Listeria monocytogenes CFR 1302 to survive and elaborate associated toxigenic trait in ice cream and mango pulp-based lactic fermented milk was studied. The culture of L. monocytogenes inoculated at two initial levels of 4.6 and 5.6 log₁₀ CFU/ml almost remained unaltered during storage of the food products. However, in both the milk-based products, a marginal increase in viable population was observed during 2–4 d of storage as against the initial inoculum levels. The toxigenic trait, listeriolysin “O” was detected by PCR based on species-specific hlyA primers in the two products without any step of enrichment. The positive amplification in PCR was evidenced with initial population levels of 6.3, 7.3, and 8.3 log₁₀ CFU/ml of the respective products. In culture broth, PCR detection was positive with the lowest level of 2.3 log₁₀ CFU/ml. The established pathogenic strain of L. monocytogenes Scott A used as a reference culture revealed almost the same behavior to that of native culture in the food products. The findings of present study bring into focus that, irrespective of low storage temperatures, there exists the potential health hazard associated with foods initially contaminated with risk population levels of L. monocytogenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aculture media 3afermented milk 3ahealth hazards 3aice cream 3ainoculum 3amangoes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3astorage temperature 3avirulent strains 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aice cream 0amango pulp-based lactic fermented milk 0apolymerase chain reaction detection 0atoxigenic trait 0asurvival1 aVaradaraj, Mandyam C0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 23, no. 5 p.426-436dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132176983293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245007100196500002000267520046900287592002800756650001200784650001000796650001200806650001600818651001000834700002200844700001700866700002200883773011700905856007401022852000901096655001201105IND60755347720221121105553.0211030e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075534772DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.033412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xing‐Da1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6137-215610aPrimula longistyla (Primulaceae), a new species from Yunnan, China  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrimula longistyla, a new species of Primulaceae from Cangyuan County, Yunnan Province, China, is described and illustrated.

Four species of microalgae Isochrysis galbana, Tetraselmis suecica, Scenedesmus almeriensis, and Nannochloropsis gaditana were used in this study. Properties such as water activity, pH, microbiological counts, viscosity, and color were analyzed to determine the effect of microalgae addition on sourdough. The technological quality of breads was analyzed in terms of physicochemical properties, color, texture profile, and porosity. The main effect of microalgae addition was changes in bread color, crust, and crumb that implies an increase of browning and an evolution to more green-yellow tonalities. The textural parameters of breads such as hardness, chewiness, and resilience are not modified by microalgae addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsochrysis galbana 3aNannochloropsis 3aScenedesmus 3aTetraselmis suecica 3abreads 3achewiness 3acolor 3ahardness 3amicroalgae 3apH 3aporosity 3asourdough 3atexture 3aviscosity 3awater activity 0aMicroalgae 0abread 0acolor 0atexture1 aPagán-Moreno, María J1 aLara, Irene F1 aMartínez Monzó, Javier,0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 23, no. 5 p.437-447dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132177002593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245010100206300001800307520182300325592002802148650002302176650003002199650002002229650001502249650001802264650002002282650001102302650001502313650001302328650001502341650000902356650001502365650001602380650001302396653001302409653002202422653001502444653002002459653001302479653000902492653001502501653000802516653000802524653000802532700002902540700001802569700001902587700002602606700001202632700001702644700001602661700001802677700002502695773010002720856008602820852000902906655001202915IND60787399620221117163859.0221004e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078739962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Jordan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6326-266012aA behavior change model to address caregiver hesitancy around COVID-19 vaccination in pediatrics  ap. 5664-5669.  aMany families express hesitancy around immunizing their children against COVID-19. We sought to better understand the perspectives of vaccine hesitant caregivers, and develop targeted recommendations for health care workers and policymakers to engage in more effective vaccine discussions. We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 23 caregivers recruited from a pediatric infectious diseases clinic, including a subset of patients referred to discuss vaccine hesitancy. Thematic analysis of the interviews identified themes that were mapped using behavior change models to identify perceived barriers and facilitators towards COVID-19 immunization. Barriers and facilitators were mapped to the WHO (World Health Organization) 3C’s (confidence, complacency, convenience) model of vaccine hesitancy as well as the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation) behavior change model. Barriers included mistrust in authorities, misperception of the risk of COVID-19 in children, and perceived health contraindications and negative previous vaccine experiences. Facilitators included positive relationships with healthcare workers, the promise of a “return to normal”, and societal pressures to immunize. Efforts to increase vaccine uptake in the pediatric population must target specific barriers and facilitators to immunization expressed by caregivers. To address these concerns, we suggest: 1. Educating hesitant caregivers by highlighting the long-term pandemic effects on children and the threat of COVID-19 to children’s health, 2. Building on the trust caregivers have in healthcare workers by involving frontline workers in public health policy, and 3. Harnessing the power of peer pressure by mobilization of societal pressures and establishing COVID-19 vaccination as the norm in children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aWorld Health Organization 3abehavior change 3acaregivers 3ahealth policy 3ahealth services 3amodels 3amotivation 3apandemic 3apediatrics 3arisk 3atelephones 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aCOVID-19 0aVaccine hesitancy 0aPediatrics 0aBehavior change 0aCOVID-19 0aHCWs 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aTDF 0aVHC 0aWHO1 aFurr Gudmundsen, Caitlyn1 aFazel, Sajjad1 aCorrigan, Alex1 aFullerton, Madison M.1 aHu, Jia1 aJadavji, Taj1 aKuhn, Susan1 aKassam, Aliya1 aConstantinescu, Cora0 tVaccine.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 40, no. 39 p.5664-5669dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245011400179300001600293520216400309592002802473650001402501650002402515650001102539650002702550650002602577650001202603650002302615650002302638650002002661650001802681650000902699650002202708650001402730650002202744650001502766650001702781650001702798653002802815653002402843653002502867653001902892653002702911700003702938773011602975856008503091852000903176655001203185IND60526210520221120131653.0190403e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052621052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantoani, Maurício Cruz10aRegeneration response of Brazilian Atlantic Forest woody species to four years of Megathyrsus maximus removal  ap. 141-146.  aGuinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs – Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5×5-m plots were established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1), and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species >10cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M. maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total of three times in MR1 (2008–2009) and six times in MR2 (2008–2010). After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire, native vegetation will suppress Guinea-grass. Furthermore, grass removal from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of ecological restoration initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3acanopy 3aecological restoration 3aecological succession 3agrasses 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3apioneer species 3areforestation 3arisk 3asecondary forests 3aseedlings 3aspecies diversity 3aunderstory 3aweed control 3awoody plants 0aInvasive exotic species 0aAdaptive management 0aPanicum maximum Jacq 0aExotic grasses 0aEcological restoration1 aTorezan, José Marcelo Domingues0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 359 p.141-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05589naa a2201057 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016800166520256400334592002802898650002002926650002102946650001502967650002402982650001903006650001503025650001003040650001603050650002803066650002003094650001603114650001003130650002103140650001903161650001703180650002303197650002303220650001703243650002703260650003703287650002103324650001403345650001703359650002103376653001503397653003003412653001003442653001703452653002103469653002903490653003303519653007803552653005103630653005803681653004703739653004403786653004003830653003703870653003103907653001003938653001203948653001103960653000903971653000903980653000803989653001003997653000804007653000904015653001004024653001104034653001004045653000804055653000804063653001104071653000904082653000904091653000804100653001104108653001304119653001204132653001104144653000904155653000904164700001404173700001904187700001904206700002204225700001504247700001704262700002004279700001704299700001504316773009404331856008504425852000904510655001204519IND60761803820221119062239.0220328e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076180382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1539192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Hai-Yan10aSeed oil of Rosa roxburghii Tratt against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo and in vitro through PPARα/PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial oxidative metabolism  aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte injury, is an obesity-induced metabolic dysregulation with few available therapeutic options. Enhancement of the mitochondrial function was considered as an effective treatment for NALFD. Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) have been shown to have beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome disease such as hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and cardiovascular diseases. The seed oil of Rosa roxburghii Tratt (ORRT) was of high quality in terms of its high amount of unsaturated fatty acids. However, the effects of ORRT on NALFD have not been reported so far. The study aimed to evaluate the protective effects and molecular mechanism of ORRT for the treatment of NAFLD in vivo and in vitro. The beneficial effects, especially improving the mitochondrial function, and the potential mechanism of ORRT on NAFLD were studied both in vivo and in vitro. Lipid levels were determined by triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and Oil Red O staining. Oxidative stress and inflammation were assessed by detecting antioxidant enzyme activity, MDA content, and ELISA assay. Blood TG, TC, HDL-c and LDL-c levels were measured in HFD mice. Western blot analyses were used to determine the levels of the protein involved in fatty acid oxidation, oxidative metabolism, and mitochondria biogenesis and function. The mitochondrial membrane potential level was measured by JC-1 staining to teste the effect of ORRT on mitochondrial function in vitro. GW6471 (inhibitor of PPARα) was used to confirm the relationship between PPARα and PGC-1α. ORRT significantly restrained NAFLD progression by attenuating lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Furthermore, ORRT upregulated thermogenesis-related gene expressions, such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). The results showed that the expression of key genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (e.g., CPT-1α, ACADL, PPARα) and in mitochondrial biogenesis and function (e.g., TFAM, NRF1, PGC-1α, and COX IV) was significantly increased. Together with the observed MMP improvement, these findings suggested that ORRT activated the mitochondrial oxidative pathway. Additionally, GW6471 inhibited the ORRT on promoting the expression of PGC-1α, CPT-1α, and ACADL. In conclusion, ORRT possessed the potential to prevent lipid accumulation via the PPARα/PGC-1α signaling pathway, which could be developed as a natural health-promoting oil against NAFLD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa roxburghii 3aWestern blotting 3aaerobiosis 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abeta oxidation 3abiogenesis 3ablood 3acholesterol 3acoronary artery disease 3aenzyme activity 3afatty liver 3agenes 3ahealth promotion 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3amembrane potential 3ametabolic syndrome 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3aseed oils 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols 0aHepatology 0aMitochondrial dysfunction 0aNALFD 0aPhytotherapy 0aOxidative stress 0aPPARα/PGC-1α signaling 0aPBS, phosphate buffer saline 0aPGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α 0ap38 MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 0aPPARα, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α 0aTFAM, Mitochondrial transcription factor A 0aTGF-β, transforming growth factor-beta 0aTNF-α, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha 0aTNF-α, Tumor necrosis factor-α 0aUCP1, uncoupling protein 1 0aACADL 0aCPT-1α 0aCOX IV 0aDMEM 0aDMSO 0aFBS 0aHDL-c 0aHFD 0aIL-6 0aIL-10 0aIL-1β 0aLDL-c 0aMMP 0aMTT 0aNDUFA2 0aNRF1 0aORRT 0aPBS 0aPPARα 0ap38 MAPK 0aPGC-1α 0aTNF-α 0aTFAM 0aUCP11 aYu, Liang1 aZhao, Xue-Lian1 aWang, Li–Tao1 aZhao, Chun–Jian1 aHuang, Han1 aZhu, Han-Lin1 aEfferth, Thomas1 aGu, Cheng-Bo1 aFu, Yu-Jie0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Apr., v. 98 p.153919-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1539193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009100169300001600260520112800276592002801404650000801432650001601440650001801456650001601474650001201490650001601502650001901518650001001537650002401547650001301571650001801584650001501602650001801617650000901635650001601644650001201660650002101672650002901693653001601722653003101738653000801769653001301777653002501790653002401815700001901839700002301858700002201881700001901903773014601922856008302068852000902151655001202160IND60586155620221121222459.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058615562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Shinya10aTranscriptional regulation of acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase by Sp1 in neuroblastoma cells  ap. 652-658.  aAcetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) is the enzyme responsible for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the cytosol. We have previously shown that AACS has an important role in normal neuronal development and that knockdown of SREBP-2, which orchestrates cholesterol synthesis, resulted in the downregulation of AACS mRNA levels. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional mechanism of AACS in Neuro-2a, neuroblastoma cells. Luciferase assay showed that the minimal core promoter of the mouse AACS gene is located in a region with 110 bps upstream from the transcription start site. Mutagenesis studies showed that the Sp1 binding site was crucial for AACS promoter activity. ChIP assay and DNA affinity precipitation assay showed that Sp1 binds to the Sp1 binding site on the promoter region of AACS. Moreover, overexpression of Sp1 increased AACS mRNA levels. Knockdown of AACS resulted in a decrease in histone deacetylase 9, associated with gene silencing. These results suggest that Sp1 regulates gene expression of AACS in Neuro-2a cells and ketone body utilization affects the balance of histone acetylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aacetylation 3abinding sites 3acholesterol 3acytosol 3afatty acids 3agene silencing 3agenes 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3aketone bodies 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amutagenesis 3aneurons 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 0aKetone body 0aAcetoacetyl-CoA synthetase 0aSp1 0aPromoter 0aTranscription factor 0aHistone deacetylase1 aImai, Masahiko1 aYamasaki, Masahiro1 aTakahashi, Noriko1 aFukui, Tetsuya0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 495, no. 1 p.652-658dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009900169300001600268520096300284592002801247650002901275650001101304650001501315650002101330650001701351650002101368650001701389650001301406650002301419650002701442650001401469650001201483650001501495651001201510653002701522653001801549653001101567653002801578700002201606700002001628700001701648773010101665856008501766852000901851655001201860IND60370368720221117000639.0150816e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6037036872DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2015.10228382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEguvbe, P.

A total of 222 sediment core samples were collected during the wet season (August 2010) and the dry season (January 2011). The samples were dried, soxhlet extracted, fractionated and analyzed for aliphatic hydrocarbons by using a gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons ranged from 37 to 286,894 μg/kg (wet season) and from 30 to 11,773 μg/kg (dry season). The concentrations of n -alkanes for a number of stations in this study are comparable to sites with high anthropogenic activities in the Niger Delta. The carbon preference index (CPI) and the pristane/phytane ratios showed that the major source of hydrocarbon pollution in the sediment core was from petrogenic origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon 3adry season 3aflame ionization 3ahydrocarbons 3anitrogen content 3ariver deltas 3asampling 3aseasonal variation 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3astreams 3awet season 3aNigeria 0aaliphatic hydrocarbons 0acore sediment 0acreeks 0acarbon preference index1 aIwegbue, C.

Exogenous hormones can be used to facilitate the induction and synchronization of estrus in the anestrus period. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy rate in ewes after the treatment with different hormones and fixed time artificial insemination. The ewes were randomly divided in 4 (n=4) groups: Melatonin group (Group 1), Melatonin and Medroxyprogesterone group (Group 2), Medroxyprogesterone group (Group 3) and control group (Group 4). Pregnancy rate, estrus induction rate and litter size were determined and compared. The estrus induction rate in our study was 100% for the first 3 groups and 6.25% for the 4ᵗʰ group. The pregnancy rate was between 4.16% (group 4) and 95.83% (group 2). For the others groups the values were 89.58% for the first group and 91.67%, for the 3ʳᵈ group. The prolificacy rate was between 1 (control group) and 1.71 (2ⁿᵈ group), with intermediate values for the other 2 groups: 1.21 for 1ˢᵗ group and 1.27 for the 3ʳᵈ group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanestrus 3aanimal research 3aartificial insemination 3aestrus 3alitter size 3amedroxyprogesterone 3amelatonin 3apregnancy rate 3areproductive efficiency 0aEwes synchronization1 aErgene, O.1 aBlaga-Petrean, A.1 aBogdan, I.1 aCiupe, S.1 aCenariu, M.1 aPall, E.1 aBogdan, L.M.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2021 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.517-521dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-12823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04826naa a2200997 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170520234400308592002802652650003302680650003402713650002502747650002702772650001602799650001302815650001102828650002202839650001502861650000902876650001602885650001602901650001702917650001002934650001902944650002302963650001702986650001703003650001403020650001103034650002203045650002303067650002103090650002003111650002203131650000903153650001703162653001803179653001703197653002103214653001403235653000803249653000803257653000903265653000803274653000903282653000903291653000703300653000803307653000803315653000803323653000803331653000803339653000803347653000803355653000803363653000803371653000803379653000803387653000703395653001203402653000803414653000903422653000803431653000803439653000703447653001703454653001103471700001603482700001603498700001703514700001703531700001703548700001303565700001703578700001603595700001703611773009403628856008503722852000903807655001203816IND60761803920221119062234.0220207e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076180392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1539202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaosong10aSheng Mai San ameliorated heat stress-induced liver injury via regulating energy metabolism and AMPK/Drp1-dependent autophagy process  aLiver damage is one of the most common complications in humans and animals after heat stress (HS). Sheng Mai San (SMS), a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that originated in the Jin Dynasty, exert a therapeutic effect on HS. However, how SMS prevents liver injury after heat exposure remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effect and molecular mechanisms of SMS on HS-induced liver injury. A comprehensive strategy via incorporating pharmacodynamics, targeted metabolomics, and molecular biology technology was adopted to investigate energy metabolism changes and the therapeutic mechanisms of SMS in HS-induced rat liver injury. First, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to HS (38 °C/ 75% RH/ 2 h/ day) for 7 consecutive days to establish the HS model, and SMS was given orally for treatment 2 h before heat exposure. Thereafter, liver function and pathological changes in liver tissue were evaluated. Finally, the underlying mechanisms of SMS were determined using targeted energy metabolomics to comprehensively analyze the metabolic pathways and were further verified through Western-blot and qRT-PCR assays. Our results showed that SMS alleviated HS-induced liver dysfunction by reducing the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and AST/ALT ratios in serum and improving hepatic pathological damage. Meanwhile, SMS suppressed inflammatory response, oxidative injury, and overexpression of heat shock proteins in liver tissue after heat exposure. With the help of targeted energy metabolomics, we found that SMS could effectively regulate glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to relieve energy metabolism disorder. Furthermore, we confirmed that SMS can facilitate the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through a dynamin protein 1 (Drp1)-dependent mitophagy process. On the basis of energy metabolomics, the present study for the first time systematically illustrated the protective effect of SMS on HS-induced liver injury, and preliminarily confirmed that an AMPK-mediated Drp1-dependent mitophagy and mitochondria rebuilding process plays an important role in SMS intervention on HS-induced rat liver. Together, our study lends further support to the use of SMS in treating HS condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3adynamins 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aglycolysis 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3aliver 3aliver function 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolomics 3amitochondria 3amitophagy 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3aoxidative toxicity 3apharmacodynamics 3aphosphorylation 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atherapeutics 0aSheng Mai San 0aLiver injury 0aOxidative stress 0aAutophagy 0aALT 0aAST 0aCytc 0aCAT 0aDrp1 0aHPLC 0aHS 0aHSP 0aHCA 0aHRP 0aH&E 0aTNF 0aMDA 0aMPO 0aMRM 0aNAC 0aPAS 0aPCA 0aQC 0aqRT-PCR 0aSMS 0aSIRS 0aSOD 0aTCA 0aTc 0aUPLC–MS/MS 0a8-OHDG1 aJia, Yaqian1 aYuan, Ziwen1 aWen, Yanqiao1 aZhang, Yahui1 aRen, Jianmin1 aJi, Peng1 aYao, Wanling1 aHua, Yongli1 aWei, Yanming0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Mar., v. 97 p.153920-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1539203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245011800156300001600274520180900290592002802099650002002127650001902147650001002166650001902176650002202195650002102217650001702238650001802255650001002273650001702283650001702300650002002317650000902337650001302346650002002359650004302379650001802422650001002440651001002450653002802460653002102488653001302509653001202522653001202534700001802546700001802564700002002582700001602602700001802618700001902636700001602655700001702671700001302688773014802701856007602849852000902925655001202934IND60747699520221119094601.0210818e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074769952DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-12082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhibo10aCloning, characterization and bioinformatics analysis of the sequences of mir-10a and mir-10b in sheep (hu Sheep)  ap. 522-529.  aMicro RNAs (miRNAs) are active regulators of numerous biological and physiological processes and play an important role in the regulation of animal ovaries and other reproductive related organs. To understand the molecular mechanisms of miR-10 family, we investigated the molecular characteristics and the relative expression of sheep miR-10a and miR-10b (miR-10a/b) and conducted bioinformatics analysis. During the period 2018–2019 total of 20 samples including blood and tissues such as hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary were collected from the Hu sheep raised in the National Meat Sheep Experimental Station of China (Luoyang City, Henan Province, China). Blood was collected from jugular vein by vacuum and anticoagulation blood collection tube and stored in refrigerator at −20°C. The tissues were placed into the cryopreservation tube treated with Diethy pyrocarbonate (DEPC) water and stored in liquid nitrogen. All the samples were processed for isolation and confirmed with biochemical analysis and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The target genes were predicted by three kinds of target gene predicting software. The function of target genes and their involved pathways were obtained by gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. The relative expression of miR-10a/b in sheep ovary was extremely significantly higher than that in hypothalamus and pituitary gland (P<0.01). The relative expression of miR-10b in ovary or pituitary was extremely significantly higher than that of miR-10a (P<0.01) and the relative expression of miR-10b in hypothalamus was significantly higher than that of miR-10a (P<0.05). These results serve as a foundation for further study on the Sheep miR-10 family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3abioinformatics 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acomputer software 3acryopreservation 3afluorescence 3agene ontology 3agenes 3ahypothalamus 3ajugular vein 3aliquid nitrogen 3ameat 3amicroRNA 3apituitary gland 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arefrigerators 3asheep 3aChina 0aBioinformatics analysis 0aExpression level 0aHu sheep 0aMir-10a 0aMir-10b1 aZhai, Zhenhan1 aWang, Mengyao1 aDing, Hongxiang1 aShi, Huibin1 aTian, Zhilong1 aZhang, Xiaohui1 aWang, Yuqin1 aWei, Caihong1 aLi, Fadi0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2021 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.522-529dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-12083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03733naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245008600205520195300291592002802244650000802272650001802280650001302298650001902311650002102330650001202351650002202363650002202385650002002407650001902427650001502446650002402461650002602485650002702511650001302538650001102551650001202562650002902574650001902603650001202622650002102634650000902655650001202664650001402676650000702690650000902697650001402706650001802720650001102738650001402749650002302763651001202786700002002798700005702818700001802875773012002893856008503013852000903098655001203107IND60605538120221119171104.0200217e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060553812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.susmat.2018.e000672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiiv, Jüri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8507-489810aNovel ecosustainable peat and oil shale ash-based 3D-printable composite material  aIn this study, a novel peat composite construction material suitable for three-dimensional printing of entire house boxes (walls, floors, ceilings, etc.) was developed. Peat was used as filler to achieve excellent thermal properties. Using peat for this purpose has not been mentioned in the earlier literature because it retarding properties to the cementation process. As a binder, combustion fly ash was used. The retarding properties of peat humic substances on hardening of pozzolanic mixtures were successfully overcome by using silica fume as an additive. The same additive also greatly improved the long setting time of oil shale ash. The mechanism of hardening of the composite material was hypothesized as the following: first, upon contact with water, the pH of pore water exceeded 13 due to the high content of oxides of alkali metals in the ash, which promoted the oxidation of humates into oxalate. Then, alkali metal, aluminum and silicate ions (the latter mostly originating from silica fume) with alumina formed insoluble feldspars leading to a decrease in pH. At pH values lower than 12.4, Ca(OH)₂ became soluble and Ca²⁺ ions migrated to the liquid phase, allowing pozzolanic reactions to occur and calcium oxalate to precipitate. Finally, the residual Ca(OH)₂ reacted with atmospheric CO₂ to form CaCO₃. Test samples were 3D-printed using experimental apparatus, the printing head involved a nozzle delivering wet peat-ash mixture using compressed air. The material was characterized by measuring its thermal resistance (<0.08 W/(m K)), compressive and bending strengths (1.2 MPa and 0.36 N/mm², respectively). Using peat composites in the construction industry allows reducing CO₂ emissions from partially mined peatlands (currently the one of the largest contributors to the total CO₂ emission from Estonia) and increasing the reuse of oil shale ash while providing a cheap and affordable raw material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalkali metals 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3abending strength 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium hydroxide 3acalcium oxalate 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3acomposite materials 3aconstruction industry 3aconstruction materials 3afeldspar 3afloors 3afly ash 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat tolerance 3ahumates 3ahumic substances 3aions 3aliquids 3aoil shale 3apH 3apeat 3apeatlands 3araw materials 3asilica 3asilicates 3athermal properties 3aEstonia1 aTeppand, Tõnis1 aRikmann, Ergo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7469-26851 aTenno, Toomas0 tSustainable materials and technologies.g2018 Sept., v. 17 p.e00067-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23531x2214-99377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2018.e000673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04134naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002400194245012700218300001600345506007600361520215600437592002802593506003702621650000802658650001802666650001602684650001402700650001102714650001302725650002702738650002202765650001702787650001102804650001702815650001502832650001902847650002402866650001102890650002002901650003102921651000902952653002102961653001002982653000802992653001703000653001703017700002003034700002603054700002103080700001803101700002503119700002203144700002003166700001903186700001803205700001603223700001903239773010603258856008703364852000903451655001203460IND60562455920221207112319.0170719e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056245592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.1362doi7 aPMC48187002pmcid7 a269506312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoombs, Kanistha C.10aIndoor air quality in green-renovated vs. non-green low-income homes of children living in a temperate region of US (Ohio)  ap. 178-185.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGreen eco-friendly housing includes approaches to reduce indoor air pollutant sources and to increase energy efficiency. Although sealing/tightening buildings can save energy and reduce the penetration of outdoor pollutants, an adverse outcome can be increased buildup of pollutants with indoor sources. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the indoor air quality (IAQ) between green and non-green homes in low-income housing complexes. In one housing complex, apartments were renovated using green principles (n=28). Home visits were conducted immediately after the renovation, and subsequently at 6months and at 12months following the renovation. Of these homes, eight homes had pre-renovation home visits; this allowed pre- and post-renovation comparisons within the same homes. Parallel visits were conducted in non-green (control) apartments (n=14) in a nearby low-income housing complex. The IAQ assessments included PM2.5, black carbon, ultrafine particles, sulfur, total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and air exchange rate. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. None of the indoor pollutant concentrations were significantly different between green and non-green homes. However, we found differences when comparing the concentrations before and after renovation. Measured immediately after renovation, indoor black carbon concentrations were significantly lower averaging 682ng/m3 in post-renovation vs. 2364ng/m3 in pre-renovation home visits (p=0.01). In contrast, formaldehyde concentrations were significantly higher in post-renovated (0.03ppm) than in pre-renovated homes (0.01ppm) (p=0.004). Questionnaire data showed that opening of windows occurred less frequently in homes immediately post-renovation compared to pre-renovation; this factor likely affected the levels of indoor black carbon (from outdoor sources) and formaldehyde (from indoor sources) more than the renovation status itself. To reduce IAQ problems and potentially improve health, careful selection of indoor building materials and ensuring sufficient ventilation are important for green building designs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abuildings 3acarbon 3achildren 3aconstruction materials 3aenergy efficiency 3aformaldehyde 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aquestionnaires 3aresidential housing 3asulfur 3atemperate zones 3avolatile organic compounds 3aOhio 0aGreen renovation 0aPM2.5 0aVOC 0aBlack carbon 0aFormaldehyde1 aChew, Ginger L.1 aSchaffer, Christopher1 aRyan, Patrick H.1 aBrokamp, Cole1 aGrinshpun, Sergey A.1 aAdamkiewicz, Gary1 aChillrud, Steve1 aHedman, Curtis1 aColton, Meryl1 aRoss, Jamie1 aReponen, Tiina0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 June 01, v. 554-555 p.178-185dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002300183245007500206300001600281506007600297520160000373592002801973506003702001650002302038650002202061650001102083650001002094650001802104650001102122650001402133650001502147650001202162650001502174700002302189700002102212700001902233773009102252856008202343852000902425655001202434IND4487143920221207144413.0120502e20120122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448714392DNAL7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.08422doi7 aPMC32236792pmcid7 a216535872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, Michael W.10aOntogenetic immune challenges shape adult personality in mallard ducks  ap. 326-333.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConsistent individual differences in behaviour are widespread in animals, but the proximate mechanisms driving these differences remain largely unresolved. Parasitism and immune challenges are hypothesized to shape the expression of animal personality traits, but few studies have examined the influence of neonatal immune status on the development of adult personality. We examined how non-pathogenic immune challenges, administered at different stages of development, affected two common measures of personality, activity and exploratory behaviour, as well as colour-dependent novel object exploration in adult male mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). We found that individuals that were immune-challenged during the middle (immediately following the completion of somatic growth) and late (during the acquisition of nuptial plumage) stages of development were more active in novel environments as adults relative to developmentally unchallenged birds or those challenged at an earlier developmental time point. Additionally, individuals challenged during the middle stage of development preferred orange and avoided red objects more than those that were not immune-challenged during development. Our results demonstrate that, in accordance with our predictions, early-life immune system perturbations alter the expression of personality traits later in life, emphasizing the role that developmental plasticity plays in shaping adult personality, and lending support to recent theoretical models that suggest that parasite pressure may play an important role in animal personality development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aadult development 3aadults 3aducks 3aimmune system 3amodels 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aplumage 3aprediction1 aToomey, Matthew B.1 aMcGraw, Kevin J.1 aRowe, Melissah0 tProceedings.g2012 Jan. 22, v. 279, no. 1727 p.326-333dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.08423Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01422naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012600159300002000285520047400305592002800779650001400807700002100821700001600842700001700858700003400875700001600909773012400925856007401049852000901123655001201132IND60641612320221122120346.0190505e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064161232DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02458d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Young Mo10aRetrieving aromaticity of dithiadiazuliporphyrin by oxidation: illustration by experimental and theoretical investigation  ap. 19502-19505.  aThe photophysical properties of neutral, monocation radical, and dication of dithiadiazuliporphyrin have been examined with a particular focus on their aromaticity.

The consequences may be permanent disability or death depending on severity and segment of spinal cord affected. Assessment of primary damage to spinal cord is important to prevent secondary damage and complications arising from neurological deficit. Since assessment of neurological dysfunction and its treatment in spinal trauma in cats is an evolving field, the present study was undertaken with an objective to record and associate epidemiological data and clinical examination findings at the time of presentation with clinical outcome on 60ᵗʰ post-treatment day in cats with thoracolumbar vertebral fracture and luxation, for a better clinical approach in this condition. 24 affected cats were assessed epidemiologically and clinically at the time of presentation. All the cats were treated either conservatively or surgically based on extent of neurological dysfunction and severity of injury on radiographic evaluation. Post-treatment observations was then correlated with epidemiological data and clinical findings to assess the clinical outcome. In the present study, sub-adult semi-domicile cats were most affected and major cause was automobile accident. Presence of concomitant injuries (30%) affected recovery. Thoracolumbar spinal cord segment (T3-L3) was most affected (71%). Among 16 cats with unstable vertebral fractures, 5/6 cats recovered after surgical treatment and 2/10 cats recovered after conservative treatment. Survival and recovery was poor when degree vertebral canal displacement was more than 70% (10 cats). All 7 cats with grade 1 or grade 2 and one cat with grade 3 neurological dysfunction recovered after conservative treatment. 5 cats with grade 3 and 2 cats with grade 4 neurological dysfunction recovered after surgical treatment. Selection of surgical treatment provided better recovery in cats with unstable vertebral fractures and greater degree of neurological dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aanimal research 3aautomobiles 3aclinical examination 3adeath 3aradiography 3aspinal cord 3asurgery 0aCats 0aEpidemiological 0aFracture 0aLuxation 0aThoracolumbar1 aNath, I.1 aDas, M.R.1 aPanda, S.K.1 aKundu, A.K.1 aMishra, U.K.1 aParvathamma, P.S.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2021 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.553-560dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-39843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009500167300001600262520137500278592002801653650001501681650001501696650001701711650001601728650001401744650002001758650002301778650001301801650001601814650000901830650001501839650001101854650002501865650001601890650001701906653002201923653001401945653001001959653001101969700001901980700002401999773012902023856008002152852000902232655001202241IND60622194820221120093645.0181124e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062219482DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132177043272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Arashdeep10aInfluence of grain activation conditions on functional characteristics of brown rice flour  ap. 500-512.  aGrain activation is a natural processing technique that can be used to produce modified flours without chemical modification. Functional characteristics of brown rice flour as influenced by grain activation time and temperatures were investigated. Germination temperatures at 25 ℃, 30 ℃ and 35 ℃ and time for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h significantly influenced the functional properties of flour with modification of starch, protein and high enzymatic activity. Significant decrease in the bulk density, water absorption and swelling power of brown rice flour was observed in comparison to non-germinated flour. Gel consistency and oil absorption capacity of brown rice flour increased as the grain activation time and temperature were increased. Native flour had lowest emulsion and foaming properties, while increase in grain activation time and temperature enhanced the emulsifying and foaming properties of flour. Paste clarity of native flour was 54% which was reduced to 25.17%; however, increase in germination time and temperature increased the % synersis values of germinated flour. Native flour had least gelation concentration of 12% which increased to 25% after 48 h of germination at 35 ℃. Overall, germination can be used as a natural way to modify the functional properties of brown rice flours for their utilization in variety food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abrown rice 3abulk density 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aenzyme activity 3afoaming properties 3agelation 3agermination 3aoils 3arice flour 3astarch 3aswelling (materials) 3atemperature 3awater uptake 0aCereal processing 0aemulsions 0afoams 0abaking1 aSharma, Savita1 aBalajīta Siṅgha,0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 23, no. 6 p.500-512dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132177043273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013900166300002000305520115400325592002801479650001001507650001701517650003901534650002801573650002101601650001201622650001501634650001301649650000701662650001501669650001901684650003701703700002801740700001601768773012401784856007401908852000901982655001201991IND60641612420221122120401.0190505e20170418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064161242DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02459b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkatesan, Parthiban12aA rhodamine-based chemosensor with diphenylselenium for highly selective fluorescence turn-on detection of Hg²⁺in vitro and in vivo  ap. 21733-21739.  aA rhodamine-B based chemosensor with diphenylselenium, RhoSe, has been synthesized, and its detection behavior towards various metal ions is studied via UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. RhoSe shows a selective response to Hg²⁺ in CH₃OH/H₂O (v/v = 9 : 1) solutions over other metal ions. After addition of Hg²⁺, the solution of RhoSe displays an obvious color change from colorless to pink and a significant, 48-fold fluorescence enhancement. The color change and fluorescence enhancement are attributed to the ring-opening of the spirolactam in the rhodamine fluorophore, which is induced by Hg²⁺ binding. The binding ratio of RhoSe–Hg²⁺ was determined by a Job plot as a 1 : 1 ratio, and the effective pH range for Hg²⁺ detection was 4.0–10. Importantly, the reversibility of the RhoSe–Hg²⁺ complex was observed through the addition of Na₂S. For practical applications, the strip method was utilized to detect Hg²⁺ in water/methanol solution. In addition, confocal fluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrated that RhoSe is an effective fluorescent probe for Hg²⁺ detection in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amethanol 3apH 3arhodamines 3asodium sulfide 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aThirumalivasan, Natesan1 aWu, Shu-Pao0 tRSC advances.g2017 Apr. 18, v. 7, no. 35 p.21733-21739dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02459b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245013600162300001600298520104800314592002801362650002701390650001101417650002101428650001001449650000901459650001201468650001201480650001101492650001701503650001401520650001301534650001101547650001001558650001001568651001701578653001801595653001101613653002301624653002001647653002401667700001601691700001601707700001501723773013701738856007701875852000901952655001201961IND60594307920221122145133.0180619e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059430792DNAL7 a10.4001/003.025.04742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThackeray, S.R.10aBiology and Rearing of Ectomyeolis ceratoniae Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), Carob Moth, a Pest of Multiple Crops in South Africa  ap. 474-480.  aEctomyeolis ceratoniae Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), carob moth, is a pest of several crops in South Africa. A laboratory culture was established from field-collected larvae infesting mummified pecan nuts. Biological parameters of larvae reared on an artificial diet were measured. The insect goes through five larval instars, and the head capsule sizes of the five instars were determined to be ≤0.34 mm, 0.35–0.64 mm, 0.65–0.94 mm, 0.95–1.14 mm and ≥0.15 mm for the five instars, respectively. The insect was reared individually and communally in glass vials, the latter to develop a mass-rearing technique. Developmental time from neonate to pupa was significantly slower when larvae were individually reared (38.18 ± 1.2 days) compared to when they were communally reared (24.6 ± 0.65 days).Amicrosporidian infection (Nosema sp.) was recorded in the culture, causing significantly (F₁,₆ = 14.99, P = 0.0082) higher mortality of communally reared larvae (76.25 % ± 11.87) than individually reared larvae (24.9 % ± 9.6).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEctomyelois ceratoniae 3aNosema 3aartificial diets 3acrops 3ahead 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amass rearing 3amortality 3aneonates 3apecans 3apests 3apupae 3aSouth Africa 0aMicrosporidia 0aNosema 0alaboratory culture 0aartificial diet 0amicrobial infection1 aMoore, S.D.1 aKirkman, W.1 aHill, M.P.0 tAfrican entomology.g2017 Sept., v. 25, no. 2 p.474-480dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.025.04743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245010000159300001600259520159600275592002801871650000801899650001901907650001801926650002001944650001101964650002201975650001501997650001402012650001402026650002102040650001602061650001202077650001102089650002102100650001302121650001102134650001202145650002102157650001302178650001902191650001102210651002102221700001802242773014202260856007202402852000902474655001202483IND60661955120221120140727.0190904e20100409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066195512DNAL7 a10.1039/b906771j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Kyoung-Hee10aHazardous air pollutant (HAP) emission characterization of sewage treatment facilities in Korea  ap. 898-905.  aUntil recently, nearly all sewage treatment-related regulations and researches have focused on the removal of the conventional and toxic pollutants from liquid effluents. The discharge of toxic compounds to the atmosphere has been implicitly regarded as a way of removal or destruction. During sewage treatment, the fate mechanism of volatilization/stripping, sorption and biotransformation primarily determines the fate of volatile HAPs. The objectives of this study are to investigate the emission characteristics of HAPs, which are generated from the liquid surface of sewage treatment facilities, by using an emission isolation flux chamber. HAP emissions increased at the inlet of the aerobic chamber during summer due to the relatively high atmospheric temperature. The percent ratio of flux for toluene reached its peak in winter, accounting for 33.6–34.2% of the total, but decreased to 25.1–28.6% in summer. In autumn, trichloroethene (TCE) was the highest, recording 17.6–18.1%, with chloroform and toluene showing similar levels. It seems that the ratio of chlorinated hydrocarbons increases in both summer and autumn because the chamber temperature during that time is higher than winter. This study is the initial study to investigate the emission characteristics of volatile HAPs emitted from domestic sewage treatment facilities to the air in Korea. Therefore, the isolation flux chamber will be used as an emission estimations tool to measure HAPs from sewage treatment facilities and may be applied to develop the emission factor and national source inventory of HAPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3abiotransformation 3achloroform 3aeffluents 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3ainventories 3aliquids 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asorption 3asummer 3atoluene 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3avolatilization 3awinter 3aKorean Peninsula1 aDong, Jong-In0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2010 Apr. 9, v. 12, no. 4 p.898-905dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b906771j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010800167300001600275520130600291592002801597650003101625650001501656650002501671650001401696650002801710650001001738650001401748650002501762651001901787700002101806700002001827700002201847773012701869856008401996852000902080655001202089IND60765026320220904000000.0220904e20200525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076502632DNAL7 a10.17221/327/2019-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHlavsa, Tomas10aStatistical analysis of economic viability of farms operating in Czech areas facing natural constraints  ap. 193-202.  aThe redesign of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) allows for more room to address issues related to stabilising farmers’ income and developing their viability in areas facing natural constraints (ANC). Maintaining income levels, developing farm economies in rural areas, and encouraging competitive agricultural practises are the challenges facing the new CAP. ANCs in the Czech Republic are characterised by a lower level of income compared to areas outside ANCs and their generally prevailing specialisation in livestock production, which has been facing a relatively turbulent development in the last decade. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the economic viability with regard to the level of natural disadvantage and with regard to farm specialisation. The database of Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) was used for assessment; the authors built the Farm Economic Viability indicator, which is based on modified Farm Net Value Added. The differences between the farm groups were tested through analysis of variance. Significantly lower viability was found in ANCs compared to farms outside ANCs. Field crops achieved significantly higher levels, both in and outside ANCs. The most threatened group of farms are grazing livestock in ANCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aaccounting 3aanalysis of variance 3adatabases 3aeconomic sustainability 3afarms 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3aCzech Republic1 aSpicka, Jindrich1 aStolbova, Marie1 aHlouskova, Zuzana0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 66, no. 5 p.193-202dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/327/2019-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03699naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011400161520174900275592002802024650002602052650001302078650002502091650002002116650003402136650001802170650001302188650001502201650001502216650001502231650001102246650001302257650002202270650002102292650002302313650002002336650000902356650003702365650001102402650001702413650002502430650000902455650001502464650001702479653001302496653002202509653002502531653002802556653001502584700001602599700001502615700002002630700001802650700001502668700001402683700001402697700001702711700005602728700002002784700001902804773009902823856008202922852000903004655001203013IND60655238920221121160226.0211129e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065523892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1167002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yun10aInhibitory effects of hydrogen on in vitro platelet activation and in vivo prevention of thrombosis formation  aHydrogen (H₂) has antioxidant effects. The pharmacologic function of H₂ in platelets is not yet clear. Therefore, in this study we sought to investigate the inhibitory effects of H₂ on in vitro platelet activation and in vivo prevention of thrombus formation.After platelets were incubated with H₂-rich saline (HRS), platelet adhesion in whole human blood was assessed in fibrinogen-coated perfusion chambers, while rat platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen and H₂O₂ was detected through light transmission aggregometry. The level of P-selectin, thromboxane B₂, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cGMP, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (p-ERK1/2), and fibrinogen binding to platelets were evaluated in vitro. Besides, the in vivo effects were examined in arterio-venous shunt thrombosis, FeCl₃-induced artery thrombus formation, and tail bleeding time in mice and rats.HRS prolonged tail bleeding time in mice and rats, decreased thrombus weight and prolonged the time to occlusion in rat and mouse thrombosis models in vivo and inhibited platelet adhesion as well as aggregation in vitro. Additionally, HRS decreased P-selectin expression, release of thromboxane B₂, ROS, and fibrinogen binding, but enhanced NO levels in H₂O₂-exposed platelets. HRS also decreased malondialdehyde levels in plasma of the rat arterial thrombosis or H₂O₂-exposed platelet model. Moreover, HRS increased cGMP level, decreased p-ERK1/2 (diminished with KT5823) in the platelets stimulated by H₂O₂.These results suggest that H₂ has antithrombotic effects, which may be due to its antioxidant property and subsequent inhibition of platelet activation via NO/cGMP/PKG/ERK pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadhesion 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood platelets 3acGMP-dependent protein kinase 3acell adhesion 3acollagen 3acyclic GMP 3afibrinogen 3ahemorrhage 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro studies 3alight transmission 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aplatelet aggregation 3arats 3athrombosis 3athromboxanes 0aHydrogen 0aPlatelet adhesion 0aPlatelet aggregation 0aReactive oxygen species 0aThrombosis1 aWu, Ya-ping1 aHan, Ji-ju1 aZhang, Mao-qing1 aYang, Chen-xi1 aJiao, Peng1 aTian, Hua1 aZhu, Chao1 aQin, Shu-cun1 aSun, Xue-jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2387-55311 aZhang, Han-ting1 aZhao, Xiao-min0 tLife sciences.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 233 p.116700-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1167003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013700173520104700310592002801357650001901385650002301404650001301427650001901440650001401459650001901473650002201492650002101514653002201535653002401557653000801581653001901589700001901608700001801627700002201645700001801667700001701685773009101702856009001793852000901883655001201892IND60770717520221120233328.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077071752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Yunjin10aAbiotic degradation behavior of polyacrylonitrile-based material filled with a composite of TiO2 and g-C3N4 under solar illumination  aAs some of the most promising alternatives to traditional non-degradable materials, photodegradable materials have advantages of environmental benignity and rapid degradation under simple conditions. In this work, nontoxic TiO₂ and cost-effective g-C₃N₄ have been compounded in a weight of 9:1 to form a photocatalytic additive with high activity. A 25 wt% loading of this photocatalytic additive has been incorporated into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) by centrifugal electrospinning to prepare an abiotic degradable PAN material. Our results showed that the PAN chain could be almost fully degraded within 90 h in an aqueous medium under simulated sunlight in the absence of microorganisms. Product analysis implied that degradation of the PAN chain mainly involved the breaking of –CN and C–C bonds by radicals, followed by oxidation of terminal groups to carboxyl and gradual mineralization to CO₂ and H₂O. This design strategy may provide new insight for the production and degradation mechanism of photodegradable polymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3alighting 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3apolyacrylonitrile 3atitanium dioxide 0aPlastic pollution 0aAbiotic degradation 0aPAN 0aPhotocatalysis1 aChen, Haixiang1 aChen, Xiufang1 aChang, Ping-Ying,1 aChen, Wenxing1 aLu, Wangyang0 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 299 p.134375-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245008000190300001600270520165800286592002801944650001201972650000901984650001001993650001002003650001302013650001202026650001302038650000902051650002102060650001402081700003402095700002202129700002402151773008502175856008102260852000902341655001202350IND60119845120221119040641.0150114e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011984512DNAL7 a254336932pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-014-3142-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaubenheimer, David10aGeometry of nutrition in field studies: an illustration using wild primates  ap. 223-234.  aNutritional geometry has shown the benefits of viewing nutrition in a multidimensional context, in which foraging is viewed as a process of balancing the intake and use of multiple nutrients. New insights into nutrient regulation have been generated in studies performed in a laboratory context, where accurate measures of amounts (e.g. eaten, converted to body mass, excreted) can be made and analysed using amounts-based nutritional geometry. In most field situations, however, proportional compositions (e.g. of foods, diets, faeces) are the only measures readily available, and in some cases are more relevant to the problem at hand. For this reason, a complementary geometric method was recently introduced for analysing multi-dimensional data on proportional compositions in nutritional studies, called the right-angled mixture triangle (RMT). We use literature data from field studies of primates to demonstrate how the RMT can provide insight into a variety of important concepts in nutritional ecology. We first compare the compositions of foods, using as an example primate milks collected in both the wild and the laboratory. We next compare the diets of different species of primates from the same habitat and of the same species (mountain gorillas) from two distinct forests. Subsequently, we model the relationships between the composition of gorilla diets in these two habitats and the foods that comprise these diets, showing how such analyses can provide evidence for active nutrient-specific regulation in a field context. We provide a framework to relate concepts developed in laboratory studies with field-based studies of nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGorilla 3adiet 3afeces 3afoods 3aforaging 3aforests 3ahabitats 3amilk 3anutrient content 3anutrients1 aMachovsky-Capuska, Gabriel E.1 aChapman, Colin A.1 aRothman, Jessica M.0 tOecologia.g2015 Jan., v. 177, no. 1 p.223-234dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-3142-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010200169300001600271520095400287536015201241592002801393596003401421596006601455653002301521653001801544653001901562653001601581653000801597700002201605700002801627700001901655773014301674856008601817852000901903655001201912IND60672919120191113000000.0191113e20190509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291912DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2018.15644292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Prachi12aA scientometric analysis on WoS reports to evaluate the research on Fusarium oxysporum since 2009  ap. 795-812.  aFusarium oxysporum is one of the most devastating fungal pathogen, worldwide having wide host range, infecting large number of monocot and dicot.

A practice-based approach to understanding foodborne disease that originates in the home  ap. 118-125.  aFood stored, prepared, cooked and eaten at home contributes to foodborne disease which, globally, presents a significant public health burden. The aim of the study reported here was to investigate, analyse and interpret domestic kitchen practices in order to provide fresh insight about how the domestic setting might influence food safety. Using current theories of practice meant the research, which drew on qualitative and ethnographic methods, could investigate people and material things in the domestic kitchen setting whilst taking account of people's actions, values, experiences and beliefs. Data from 20 UK households revealed the extent to which kitchens are used for a range of non-food related activities and the ways that foodwork extends beyond the boundaries of the kitchen. The youngest children, the oldest adults and the family pets all had agency in the kitchen, which has implications for preventing foodborne disease. What was observed, filmed and photographed was not a single practice but a series of entangled encounters and actions embedded and repeated, often inconsistently, by the individuals involved. Households derived logics and principles about foodwork that represented rules of thumb about ‘how things are done’ that included using the senses and experiential knowledge when judging whether food is safe to eat. Overall, food safety was subsumed within the practice of ‘being’ a household and living everyday life in the kitchen. Current theories of practice are an effective way of understanding foodborne disease and offer a novel approach to exploring food safety in the home.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achildren 3afood safety 3afoodborne illness 3ahome safety 3ahouseholds 3akitchens 3apeople 3apublic health 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFoodborne disease 0aCurrent theories of practice 0aFood safety 0aDomestic kitchen practices 0aQualitative research 0aVisual research1 aMeah, Angela1 aDickinson, Angela M.1 aShort, Frances0 tAppetite.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 85 p.118-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245013000186300001400316520143000330592002801760650001401788650001401802650001601816650000901832650001501841650001401856700002101870700002701891700002301918773008301941856008102024852000902105655001202114IND60119845320221119040818.0150114e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011984532DNAL7 a254241572pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-014-3152-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNash, Kirsty L.10aHome-range allometry in coral reef fishes: comparison to other vertebrates, methodological issues and management implications  ap. 73-83.  aBody size has been identified as a key driver of home-range area. Despite considerable research into home-range allometry, the relatively high variability in this relationship among taxa means that the mechanisms driving this relationship are still under debate. To date, studies have predominantly focused on terrestrial taxa, and coral reef fishes in particular have received little attention. We quantitatively reviewed studies examining home range in reef fishes, and assessed the interspecific relationship between body mass and home-range area. Body mass and home range are positively related in reef fishes (slopes of 1.15–1.72), with predators having larger home ranges than herbivorous species. This may be attributed to the mobility and lower abundance of predators’ food items. Coral reef fishes, and fishes in general, appear to occupy a smaller area per unit mass than terrestrial vertebrates (intercepts of −0.92 to 0.07 versus ≥1.14). This is likely linked to the relative metabolic costs of moving through water compared to air. The small home ranges of reef fishes and their apparent reluctance to cross open areas suggest that reserves aimed at protecting fish species may be more effective if located across whole reefs, even if those reefs are comparatively small, rather than if they cover subsections of contiguous reef, as home ranges in the former are less likely to cross reserve boundaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3abody size 3acoral reefs 3afish 3ahome range 3apredators1 aWelsh, Justin Q.1 aGraham, Nicholas A.

This special supplement presents the proceedings of a symposium focusing on advances in scientific understanding of the development of healthy food portion sizes in children and their families. Recent basic research highlights individual differences in children's responsiveness to portion size as well as potential mechanisms of portion size effects. Quantitative approaches highlight the influence of maternal serving in determining intake, while qualitative approaches seek to elaborate caregiver decisions around child portion sizes at meals and snacks. Family-based environmental interventions for child weight control involving food portion size are outlined. An overview of the overarching issues and roundtable discussion on the forefronts of portion size research are presented as well as policy considerations to promote healthy portion control.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aeating habits 3aenergy density 3afoods 3ahealthy diet 3aissues and policy 3aportion size 3asnacks 3aweight control 0aPortion size 0aConsumer impact 0aPrevention 0aChildren 0aFamilies1 aGoran, M.I.1 aRowe, S.1 aHetherington, M.M.0 tAppetite.g2015 May 01, v. 88 p.1-4dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245014900171520129400320592002801614650001501642650002501657650001301682650001701695650001601712650001901728650001601747650001401763653001801777653001601795653003101811653001501842653001601857700005601873773009101929856009002020852000902110655001202119IND60770717920221120223150.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077071792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yufan10aInteraction of norfloxacin and hexavalent chromium with ferrihydrite nanoparticles: Synergistic adsorption and antagonistic aggregation behavior  aThe co-existence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and norfloxacin (NOR) can be detected in natural environments. However, the interaction of the co-existing Cr(VI), NOR and ferrihydrite nanoparticles (FNPs, a ubiquitous natural iron oxide nanoparticle) is lacking investigation. Figuring out this interaction could help us better predict the transport and fate of the relevant contaminants. Here, the adsorption and aggregation of FNPs in the presence of Cr(VI) and NOR were investigated. Comparing to FNPs interaction with Cr(VI) or NOR alone, the co-existence of Cr(VI) and NOR could lead to a synergistic effect to increase their adsorption onto FNPs. This observation can be attributed to the complexation between Cr(VI) and carboxyl or amino groups from NOR. Furthermore, the aggregation of FNPs could be accelerated by Cr(VI) through charge neutralization since the adsorption of Cr(VI) could decrease the surface potential of FNPs (positive charge). However, the presence of NOR will increase the surface charge, and thus stabilize FNPs. In general, the aggregation state of FNPs in the presence of co-existing Cr(VI) and NOR depends on their ratio. Overall, these understandings help us predict the transport and fate of FNPs and the associated contaminants in natural environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaggregation behavior 3achromium 3aferrihydrite 3airon oxides 3aneutralization 3anorfloxacin 3asynergism 0aChromium (VI) 0aNorfloxacin 0aFerrihydrite nanoparticles 0aAdsorption 0aAggregation1 aLi, Zhixiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9860-51920 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 299 p.134386-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245005500171300001600226520207600242592002802318650002002346650002602366650001602392650002402408650002202432650001302454650001802467650001702485650001802502650001402520650002502534650001702559650001602576650001502592653001602607653002602623700001602649700001802665700001702683700001402700700001802714773014202732856008602874852000902960655001202969IND60721447920221119091950.0201224e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072144792DNAL7 a10.5958/0976-4615.2017.00058.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Meetika10aCharacter association and path analysis in mustard  ap. 315-321.  aGenetic variability, character association and path coefficient analysis was conducted using 15 lines and 4 testers and their 60 F1 made with the parents of Brassica juncea genotype of diverse origin. The phenotypic coefficient of variation which measures the total variation was found to be greater than the genotypic coefficient of variation in majority of characters in the present study. The closer magnitude of GCV and PCV indicated that genotype has played greater role rather than environment. Analysis of variance revealed considerable differences among the genotypes for all the traits which indicate that sufficient scope for bringing genetic improvement in all the attributes. Phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variation were high (more than 25%) exhibited for days to maturity, number of siliqua per plant, biological yield per plant and seed yield per plant indicated that the existence of wide spectrum of variability for these traits and greater opportunities for desired gain through phenotypic selection. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance expressed as per cent of mean were observed for days to maturity, number of siliqua per plant, biological yield per plant and seed yield per plant indicated additive gene action and selection may be effective for these characters. Seed yield per plant showed positive and significant stable correlation with number of seeds per siliqua, biological yield per plant, number of secondary branches per plant, 1000 seed weight and number of primary branches per plant at genotypic and phenotypic level indicated that by improving these traits the yield can be improved in mustard. Biological yield per plant displayed high order of direct effect on seed yield per plant followed by harvest index, 100 seed weight and plant height at both phenotypic and genotypic levels suggested that these characters may play an important role in improvement of seed yield in mustard. It was concluded that these characters could be considered as significant selection criteria for yield improvement in mustard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aadditive gene effects 3aagriculture 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aharvest index 3aheritability 3apath analysis 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic selection 3aplant height 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 0aVariability 0aCharacter association1 aSingh, S.K.1 aChand, Pooran1 aKerkhi, S.A.1 aVaishali,1 aMukesh Kumar,0 tProgressive agriculture.g2017 Aug., v. 17, no. 2 p.315-321dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-4615.2017.00058.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04136naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009100169300001600260500001500276520294300291592002803234650002203262650001303284650001203297650001203309650001203321650001903333650002203352650001703374650001503391650002203406650001603428653002403444700002003468700002003488700001803508773011003526856008103636852000903717655001203726IND60123841220221121075138.0160304e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012384122DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-014-0271-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellocchi, Gianni10aDeliberative processes for comprehensive evaluation of agroecological models. A review  ap. 589-605.  a2019-12-04  aThe use of biophysical models in agroecology has increased in the last few decades for two main reasons: the need to formalize empirical knowledge and the need to disseminate model-based decision support for decision makers (such as farmers, advisors, and policy makers). The first has encouraged the development and use of mathematical models to enhance the efficiency of field research through extrapolation beyond the limits of site, season, and management. The second reflects the increasing need (by scientists, managers, and the public) for simulation experimentation to explore options and consequences, for example, future resource use efficiency (i.e., management in sustainable intensification), impacts of and adaptation to climate change, understanding market and policy responses to shocks initiated at a biophysical level under increasing demand, and limited supply capacity. Production concerns thus dominate most model applications, but there is a notable growing emphasis on environmental, economic, and policy dimensions. Identifying effective methods of assessing model quality and performance has become a challenging but vital imperative, considering the variety of factors influencing model outputs. Understanding the requirements of stakeholders, in respect of model use, logically implies the need for their inclusion in model evaluation methods. We reviewed the use of metrics of model evaluation, with a particular emphasis on the involvement of stakeholders to expand horizons beyond conventional structured, numeric analyses. Two major topics are discussed: (1) the importance of deliberative processes for model evaluation, and (2) the role computer-aided techniques may play to integrate deliberative processes into the evaluation of agroecological models. We point out that (i) the evaluation of agroecological models can be improved through stakeholder follow-up, which is a key for the acceptability of model realizations in practice, (ii) model credibility depends not only on the outcomes of well-structured, numerically based evaluation, but also on less tangible factors that may need to be addressed using complementary deliberative processes, (iii) comprehensive evaluation of simulation models can be achieved by integrating the expectations of stakeholders via a weighting system of preferences and perception, (iv) questionnaire-based surveys can help understand the challenges posed by the deliberative process, and (v) a benefit can be obtained if model evaluation is conceived in a decisional perspective and evaluation techniques are developed at the same pace with which the models themselves are created and improved. Scientific knowledge hubs are also recognized as critical pillars to advance good modeling practice in relation to model evaluation (including access to dedicated software tools), an activity which is frequently neglected in the context of time-limited framework programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3amanagers 3afarmers 3amarkets 3asurveys 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3astakeholders 3ascientists 3aissues and policy 3aagroecology 0amathematical models1 aRivington, Mike1 aMatthews, Keith1 aAcutis, Marco0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.589-605dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0271-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008100171300001600252520129100268592002801559650001101587650001601598650001801614650001601632650001101648700002301659700002301682773007301705856008401778852000901862655001201871IND60096540920221117234323.0141104e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009654092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.11.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteffen, Michael10aEfficiency of a new Triangle Cycle with flash evaporation in a piston engine  ap. 295-307.  aA Triangle Cycle with a piston engine expansion unit is used to convert low temperature heat into electrical energy. In this process, the isentropic efficiency of the expansion unit is considered to be unknown, and a theoretical approach for the calculation of isentropic efficiency is presented. A number of influences are taken into account – dead volume, residual mass, liquid injection performance and wall heat transfer. Various working fluids are investigated in a wide range of temperatures (333K–573K), engine speeds (5 Hz–30 Hz) and stroke volumes (0.1 L–50 L). The isentropic efficiency of water as working fluid is in the range of 0.75–0.88 and drops significantly for high stroke volumes and engine speeds. In general, injection mass has the most impact on isentropic efficiency because it influences dead volume and injection performance. The injection mass increases with vapor density and therefore is significantly influenced by working fluid and temperatures. The Triangle Cycle is compared with Organic Rankine Cycles by using determined isentropic efficiency. The exergetic efficiency of the Triangle Cycle using water is up to 35–70% higher than that of supercritical Organic Rankine Cycles in situations with a heat source temperature of up to 450K.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3aheat transfer 3atemperature 3avapors1 aLöffler, Michael,1 aSchaber, Karlheinz0 tEnergy.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 57 p.295-307dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.11.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164500002200295520177300317583064402090592002802734650002302762650001402785650001402799650001902813650001402832650001702846650001502863650001102878650001902889650002202908650001402930653002202944653002002966653001302986653001902999700005603018773009203074856008103166852000903247655001203256IND60655239820221121160158.0190801e20190728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065523982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1167092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yaxian10aRETRACTION: Oridonin elevates sensitivity of ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin via suppressing cisplatin-mediated autophagy  aPre-press version  aCisplatin resistance has been found to contribute to the failure of ovarian carcinoma treatment. Oridonin is a natural en-kaurane tetracyclic diterpenoid compound discovered in Rabdosia rubescene (Henmsl.) Hara. Herein, we tested whether oridonin could exert chemo-sensitization activity on cisplatin-treated ovarian carcinoma cells.Firstly, A2780CP cells and SKOV3/DDP cells were exposed to cisplatin and/or oridonin treatment. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) kit and Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Annexin V-FITC and PI were carried out to test cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Then, pBeclin-1 was transfected to overexpress Beclin-1.3-Methyladenine (3-MA) acted as autophagy inhibitor, while rapamycin acted as autophagy activator. Finally, the influence of cisplatin and/or oridonin treatment on human normal ovarian epithelial IOSE 364 cell viability and apoptosis were also detected.Oridonin incubation notably elevated the cisplatin-caused reduction of A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell viabilities and enhancement of cell apoptosis. Cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell autophagy was dramatically inhibited by oridonin. Overexpression of Beclin-1 mitigated the influence of oridonin on cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell autophagy. Inhibition of cell autophagy by 3-MA promoted the oridonin + cisplatin-caused A2780CP and SKOV3/DDP cell apoptosis, while activation of cell autophagy had opposite effects. Oridonin and cisplatin co-treatment had no significant effects on IOSE 364 cell viability and apoptosis.The chemo-sensitization activity of oridonin on cisplatin-treated ovarian carcinoma cells was verified in this study. Oridonin elevated sensitivity of ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin via suppressing cisplatin-mediated autophagy.  aRetracted: September 2019, v.233, p.116709 ; 10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116709zGiven the comments of Dr Elisabeth Bik regarding this article “… the Western blot bands in all 400+ papers are all very regularly spaced and have a smooth appearance in the shape of a dumbbell or tadpole, without any of the usual smudges or stains.

This study selected the lepidopteran model insect silkworm (Bombyx mori) as the research object and revealed the influence of DMT on the reproduction of silkworms. This study used digital gene expression (DGE) and RT-qPCR analysis to compare gene expression changes in eggs laid by silkworms under the exposure of DMT (200 mg/L). A total of 320 differential genes were detected, of which 211 genes were up-regulated and 109 genes were down-regulated. The GO enrichment analysis bar graph shows those differential genes enriched in the BP's metabolic process, cellular process, CC's membrane part, cell, MF's catalytic activity, binding. KEGG enrichment analysis showed more differential genes enriched in signal transduction, endocrine system, cancers: Overview pathway. The results showed that the differential genes were mainly concentrated on promoting trehalase transporter genes, stress response-related genes, zinc finger protein genes, epidermal protein genes, and 5-HT pathway-related genes. The results of this study will provide important gene sequence information for insect toxicology studies, and also clarify the mechanism of influence of DMT on silkworm reproduction at the transcription level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3acatalytic activity 3adimethoate 3aendocrine system 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aserotonin 3asignal transduction 3asilkworms 3atoxicology 3atranscriptomics 3atrehalase 3azinc finger motif 0aSilkworm 0aDimethoate 0aRNA-Seq 0aDifferential expression genes1 aLiu, Fengdan1 aShi, Min1 aLi, Shuo1 aXie, Xiaofan1 aLi, Guannan1 aZhang, Xiaoning1 aZhu, Yong0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2022 May, v. 183 p.105081-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1050813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01280naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245008600158300001800244520018600262592002800448650002200476650001100498650002700509650002300536650001300559650001300572650001500585650002100600700001700621700002000638700001500658700003500673773012800708856007300836852000900909655001200918IND60658459420221118180720.0190817e20090708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065845942DNAL7 a10.1039/b908050c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathalla, Maher10aWater-soluble nanorods self-assembled via pristine C₆₀ and porphyrin moieties  ap. 4209-4211.  aA novel water-soluble nanorod is discussed, which is prepared via the self-assembly of pristine C₆₀ and a double-sided porphyrin projecting four β-cyclodextrins from each face.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acarbon 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3amoieties 3ananorods 3aporphyrins 3awater solubility1 aLi, Shaojun,1 aDiebold, Ulrike1 aAlb, Alina1 aJayawickramarajah, Janarthanan0 tChemical communications.g2009 July 8, , no. 28 p.4209-4211dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b908050c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013800171300001600309520110800325592002801433650002801461650001301489650003901502650001601541650001701557650001601574650002001590650001601610650001801626650001901644650001401663650002601677650001301703653001301716653002001729653002201749653002001771653002401791700001301815700001701828700001901845700001801864773010601882856008701988852000902075655001202084IND60576065320221120104335.0180831e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057606532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHang, Chunfeng10aNIR and UV-responsive degradable hyaluronic acid nanogels for CD44-targeted and remotely triggered intracellular doxorubicin delivery  ap. 547-555.  aHyaluronic acid (HA) is an endogenous polysaccharide that shows intrinsic targetability to CD44+ cancer cells. Here, we developed NIR and UV-responsive degradable nanogels from hyaluronic acid-g-7-N,N-diethylamino-4-hydroxymethylcoumarin (HA-CM) for CD44 targeted and remotely controlled intracellular doxorubicin (DOX) delivery. Nanometer-sized HA-CM nanogels could readily load DOX, and both NIR and UV irradiation could significantly enhance DOX release from the nanogels, resulting from light-triggered cleavage of urethane bonds that connect CM to HA. MTT assays showed that DOX-loaded HA-CM nanogels combined with NIR irradiation induced much higher antitumor activity to MCF-7 cells (CD44+) than to U-87MG cells (CD44-) and free HA pretreated MCF-7 cells. CLSM observations confirmed that DOX-loaded HA-CM nanogels were internalized by CD44+ cells via receptor mediated endocytosis mechanism, and intracellular DOX release was triggered by NIR. These HA-CM nanogels with easy preparation, CD44 targetability and photo-controlled intracellular drug release are interesting for cancer chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3acolloids 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aendocytosis 3ahyaluronic acid 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aultraviolet radiation 3aurethane 0aNanogels 0aLight-sensitive 0aTargeted delivery 0aAnticancer drug 0aCancer chemotherapy1 aZou, Yan1 aZhong, Yinan1 aZhong, Zhiyuan1 aMeng, Fenghua0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 158 p.547-555dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245009800205520137000303592002801673650002601701650001701727650001201744650002801756650001301784650002201797650002201819650001101841650001801852650001201870650003201882650001001914650002401924650001501948650000901963650001401972650001301986650002001999650004802019650002802067650003102095650004002126653001802166653001202184653003102196653002802227653002302255653003902278700001602317700001702333700001702350700001802367700005702385700001802442700006102460700005602521773009902577856008202676852000902758655001202767IND60655240020221122022643.0211129e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065524002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1167112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Hye-Yoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1004-467510aInsulin prevents pulmonary vascular leakage by inhibiting transglutaminase 2 in diabetic mice  aInsulin is a central peptide hormone required for carbohydrate metabolism; however, its role in diabetes-associated pulmonary disease is unknown. Here, we investigated the preventative effect of insulin against hyperglycemia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage and its molecular mechanism of action in the lungs of diabetic mice.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated transglutaminase 2 (TGase2) by sequentially elevating intracellular Ca²⁺ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs).Insulin inhibited VEGF-induced TGase2 activation, but did not affect intracellular Ca²⁺ elevation and ROS generation. Insulin prevented VEGF-induced vascular leakage by inhibiting TGase2-mediated c-Src phosphorylation, disassembly of VE-cadherin and β-catenin, and stress fiber formation. Insulin replacement therapy prevented hyperglycemia-induced TGase2 activation, but not ROS generation, in the lungs of diabetic mice. Insulin also prevented vascular leakage and cancer metastasis in the diabetic lung. Notably, vascular leakage was not detectable in the lungs of TGase2-null (Tgm2⁻/⁻) diabetic mice.These findings demonstrate that insulin prevents hyperglycemia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage in diabetic mice by inhibiting VEGF-induced TGase2 activation rather than ROS generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3abeta catenin 3acalcium 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3adiabetes 3aendothelial cells 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahumans 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin replacement therapy 3alungs 3amechanism of action 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3areactive oxygen species 3arespiratory tract diseases 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aHyperglycemia 0aInsulin 0aPulmonary vascular leakage 0aReactive oxygen species 0aTransglutaminase 2 0aVascular endothelial growth factor1 aSeo, Jae-Ah1 aJung, Se-Hui1 aLee, Yeon-Ju1 aHan, Eun-Taek1 aPark, Won Sun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5868-37971 aHong, Seok-Ho1 aKim, Young-Myeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2999-44111 aHa, Kwon-Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4219-17870 tLife sciences.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 233 p.116711-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1167113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245007800130300001300208500001400221520070000235592002800935650003000963650002500993650001101018650001601029650002101045650002001066650002001086650001301106650001301119650001301132650000901145650001901154650001901173650002101192650001101213651001001224653001501234653000801249773012901257852000901386655001201395IND60721448420221119091727.0201224e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072144842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhookan, A.K.10aManagement of sheath rot of rice under rice-rice cropping system in Assam  ap. 8-13.  aNAL-light  aA location-specific eco-friendly viable Integrated Disease Management (IDM) module for managing sheath rot disease of rice was formulated under the dominant rice-rice cropping system in Assam.

To understand the pathogenesis of EV71, however, it is important to investigate the spread of the viral genome. There have been no pathological studies of in situ EV71 viral RNA in inflammatory cells infiltrating various tissues of fatal cases. We therefore first investigated the distribution and classification of inflammatory cells in various tissues and then performed in situ EV71 RNA hybridization in these tissues to better understand the pathogenesis of EV71 infection. EV71 RNA was found mainly in inflammatory cells infiltrating the central nervous system (CNS), intestines, lungs, and tonsils. Most EV71 RNA-positive inflammatory cells in the CNS were macrophages/microglia and neutrophils infiltrating the perivascular cuffing, microglial nodule, neuronophagia, and meninges. CD68+ macrophages and CD15+ neutrophils were diffusely distributed in tissues with severe pathological changes. This study demonstrates the presence of EV71 RNA in inflammatory cells infiltrating tissues in fatally infected patients. Our findings suggest that fatal EV71 infection with extensive infiltration of macrophages/microglia and neutrophils into the CNS results in severe neurological lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus A 3aRNA 3agenome 3ahand, foot and mouth disease 3aintestines 3alungs 3amacrophages 3ameninges 3aneuroglia 3aneutrophils 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3atonsils 2aEnterovirus A, Humanxisolation & purification 2aGenome, Viral 2aHand, Foot and Mouth Diseasexmortalityxvirology. 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Cellularxphysiology 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aInflammationxvirology 2aRNA, Viralxisolation & purification 2aTissue Distribution1 aGao, Zifen1 aZong, Yuanyuan1 aBao, Linlin1 aXu, Lili1 aDeng, Wei1 aXu, Yanfeng1 aGao, Zhancheng1 aYao, Yanfeng1 aLi, Fengdi1 aLv, Qi1 aQin, Chuan0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Jan., v. 160, no. 1 p.81-90dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2233-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04291naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010100187300001200288520220800300592002802508650001602536650001802552650002902570650001102599650002002610650002402630650000902654650001002663650001202673650001702685650003902702650001102741650001002752650002402762650001602786650001402802650003002816650002202846650002102868650003102889650001002920650001102930650001402941650001302955650001602968650002002984650001503004650001103019650001603030650001103046650004003057650005403097650001103151650002903162650004103191650003703232650001603269650004003285650003003325773011303355856008103468990002303549852000903572655001203581IND60093623820221121235352.0141103e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009362382DNAL7 a209556912pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2010.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRastmanesh, Reza10aHigh polyphenol, low probiotic diet for weight loss because of intestinal microbiota interaction  ap. 1-8.  aThe relative proportion of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes is decreased in obese people. This imbalance in gut microbiota generates signals controlling the expression of genes by the epithelial intestinal cells. Both dairy and non-dairy probiotics increase body weight, reportedly through Lactobacillus species growth in the gut. On the other hand, daily intake of some fruits and drinks such as three apples or three pears or grapefruit, or green tea, which all are rich in polyphenols, can significantly reduce body weight in obese people. Metabolism of polyphenols by microbiota involves the cleavage of glycosidic linkages. Glycans, which are the product of glycosidic cleavage, are necessary for survival of the intestinal microbiota as a nutrient foundation. There are two pivotal points: (i) Firmicutes possess a disproportionately smaller number of glycan-degrading enzymes than Bacteroidetes, (ii) Firmicutes are more repressed than the Bacteroidetes by phenolic compounds’ antimicrobial properties. The Bacteroidetes community prevails following dietary polyphenol intake and its fermentation to phenolic compounds, due to having more glycan-degrading enzymes, so this may thus be a mechanism by which dietary polyphenols exert their weight lowering effect. I suggest that future studies utilize clone libraries and fingerprinting techniques enabling identification of the composition and community structure of the microbiota, and dot blot hybridization or fluorescent in situ hybridization to analyze abundance of particular taxa in obese and individuals. A supplementation with polyphenols with high bioavailability in obese individuals with higher Firmicutes/Bacteroides community ratio phenotype, when associated to a probiotic restricted diet, is proposed for weight loss; this hypothesis could have relevant implication in planning a successful dietary regimen and/or neutraceutical/pharmaceutical preparations for achieving and maintaining a normal body weight in obese individuals, especially including much more use of polyphenol-rich foodstuffs and/or polyphenol-rich syrups, and including low amounts of probiotic-rich foodstuffs like yogurt, soy yogurt, or as probiotic supplements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aLactobacillus 3aantimicrobial properties 3aapples 3abioavailability 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3afermentation 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afruits 3agenes 3aglycosidic linkages 3agrapefruits 3agreen tea 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3amilk substitutes 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apears 3apeople 3aphenotype 3aplanning 3apolyphenols 3apolysaccharides 3aprobiotics 3asyrups 3aweight loss 3ayogurt 2aFlavonoidsxadministration & dosage 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aMetagenomexdrug effects 2aObesityxdiet therapyxmicrobiology. 2aPhenolsxadministration & dosage 2aPolyphenols 2aProbioticsxadministration & dosage 2aWeight Lossxdrug effects0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.1-8dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2010.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245016000170300001600330520102100346592002801367650001301395650001201408650003301420650001501453650002701468650001301495650001201508650001601520651001801536653001701554653003401571653001601605653001601621653002101637700002601658700003001684773012801714856008001842852000901922655001201931IND60130103920221121011435.0151127e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013010392DNAL7 a10.2994/SAJHD1200019.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRecoder, Renato Sousa10aSpatial Variation in Morphometry in Vanzosaura rubricauda (Squamata, Gymnophthalmidae) from Open Habitats of South America and its Environmental Correlates  ap. 186-197.  aPatterns of geographical variation in morphology provide an empirical framework for testing the effects of ecological and historical factors on species differentiation. Environmental gradients play an important role in intraspecific differentiation through morphological adaptation in locations with distinct selective pressures. Vanzosaura rubricauda is a small microteiid lizard that is widespread in the great diagonal of dry biomes of South America, occurring in Cerrado, Caatinga, and Chaco open habitats with contrasting environmental conditions. Using multivariate morphometrics and spatial analysis, we show that V. rubricauda presents a structured pattern of geographic variation, with populations of the eastern Cerrado being distinct in morphometry. Geographical variation was observed in size and shape, with a general trend of contrast between trunk length and forelimb length among populations. Ecogeographical models that best explained geographic patterns of variation were aridity and precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSquamata 3acerrado 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3ageographical variation 3ahabitats 3alizards 3amorphometry 3aSouth America 0aEcogeography 0aIntraspecific Differentiation 0aMicroteiids 0aMorphometry 0aSpatial Analysis1 aRibeiro, Milton Cezar1 aRodrigues, Miguel Trefaut0 tSouth american journal of herpetology.g2013 Dec., v. 8, no. 3 p.186-197dBrazilian Society of Herpetologyx1808-97987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2994%2FSAJHD1200019.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245005400171300001600225520082500241592002801066650002201094650001001116650001401126650001201140650001401152650001601166700001701182700002401199700002301223700002301246700002401269773014301293856007901436852000901515655001201524IND60312916320221117034854.0150714e20141010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031291632DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12572192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustafsson, Martin V.10aPropagating phonons coupled to an artificial atom  ap. 207-211.  aQuantum information can be stored in micromechanical resonators, encoded as quanta of vibration known as phonons. The vibrational motion is then restricted to the stationary eigenmodes of the resonator, which thus serves as local storage for phonons. In contrast, we couple propagating phonons to an artificial atom in the quantum regime and reproduce findings from quantum optics, with sound taking over the role of light. Our results highlight the similarities between phonons and photons but also point to new opportunities arising from the characteristic features of quantum mechanical sound. The low propagation speed of phonons should enable new dynamic schemes for processing quantum information, and the short wavelength allows regimes of atomic physics to be explored that cannot be reached in photonic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3alight 3aphotonics 3aphotons 3avibration 3awavelengths1 aAref, Thomas1 aKockum, Anton Frisk1 aEkström, Maria K.1 aJohansson, Göran,1 aDelsing, P.q(Per),0 tScience.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 346, no. 6206 p.207-211dAmerican Association for the Advancement of SciencewJournal:jnl44791x0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12572193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01290naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003100138245007600169300001800245520024700263592002800510650001200538650001400550650002300564650002300587650000900610650001800619650001100637650001200648700001900660700003100679700002000710773012800730856007300858852000900931655001200940IND60657692420221119230333.0190816e20050704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065769242DNAL7 a10.1039/b505271h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Arellano, Camino10aEnantioselective hydrogenation of alkenes and imines by a gold catalyst  ap. 3451-3453.  aA new neutral dimeric gold(i) complex bearing the 1,2-bis[(2R,5R)-2,5-dimethylphospholanebenzene] [(R,R)-Me-Duphos] ligand has been synthesized which catalyzes the asymmetric hydrogenation of alkenes and imines under mild reaction conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenantioselectivity 3agold 3ahydrogenation 3aimines 3aligands1 aCorma, Avelino1 aIglesias Meléndez, Marta,1 aSánchez, Felix0 tChemical communications.g2005 July 4, , no. 27 p.3451-3453dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b505271h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245009000183300001600273520109100289592002801380650001901408650001101427650000901438650001001447650001101457650001201468650001201480650002101492650003501513650001401548650001301562650000901575650003401584650002001618650005601638650001301694650002001707650003401727650001701761650001001778650002101788650004801809650002001857700002101877700001701898700001901915700002101934773010901955856008102064852000902145655001202154IND50066737420221120221423.0150208e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006673742DNAL7 a233974612pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-013-0797-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, Robyn10aVibrissal touch sensing in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina): how do seals judge size?  ap. 521-533.  a“Whisker specialists” such as rats, shrews, and seals actively employ their whiskers to explore their environments and extract object properties such as size, shape, and texture. It has been suggested that whiskers could be used to discriminate between different sized objects in one of two ways: (i) to use whisker positions, such as angular position, spread or amplitude to approximate size; or (ii) to calculate the number of whiskers that contact an object. This study describes in detail how two adult harbor seals use their whiskers to differentiate between three sizes of disk. The seals judged size very fast, taking <400 ms. In addition, they oriented their smaller, most rostral, ventral whiskers to the disks, so that more whiskers contacted the surface, complying to a maximal contact sensing strategy. Data from this study supports the suggestion that it is the number of whisker contacts that predict disk size, rather than how the whiskers are positioned (angular position), the degree to which they are moved (amplitude) or how spread out they are (angular spread).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoca vitulina 3aadults 3arats 3aseals 3ashrews 3atexture 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aDiscrimination, Psychological. 2aEcosystem 2aJudgment 2aMale 2aMechanotransduction, Cellular 2aOceans and Seas 2aPhocaxanatomy & histologyxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aPressure 2aSize Perception 2aTask Performance and Analysis 2aTime Factors 2aTouch 2aTouch Perception 2aVibrissaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aVideo Recording1 aWieskotten, Sven1 aWengst, Nina1 aPrescott, Tony1 aDehnhardt, Guido0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2013 June, v. 199, no. 6 p.521-533dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-013-0797-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013500172300001600307520104400323592002801367650002501395650001701420650002001437650001801457650001101475650001801486650003101504650001701535650001501552650001101567650001501578653001801593653001801611653001101629653001701640653001701657700002201674700001801696773007901714856008601793852000901879655001201888IND60539383720221117090622.0160815e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053938372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJośko, Izabela14aThe effect of inorganic nanoparticles (ZnO, Cr2O3, CuO and Ni) and their bulk counterparts on enzyme activities in different soils  ap. 528-537.  aThe objective of the study was to determine the effect of nanoparticles (NPs) and their bulk counterparts on the enzymatic activity of two soils. The study comprised analyses of the effect of four NPs (ZnO, CuO, Cr2O3, Ni) on the activity of dehydrogenase, urease, acidic and alkaline phosphatase in two soils with different physicochemical properties. The effect of the concentration of NPs (10, 100 and 1000mg/kg), size of particles and contact time between NPs and soil (24 and 196days) was studied. Depending on the enzyme and soil type tested, an inhibitory or a stimulating effect of NPs on the activity of the enzymes was observed. The absence of the dose–effect relationship made it difficult to compare the effects among the individual NPs. It could be clearly noted, however, that relatively the most frequent negative effect was observed for CuO NPs. The levels of inhibition/stimulation of the NPs varied notably also in relation to the soil type, duration of contact between NPs and the soil, and particle size (nano, bulk).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acupric oxide 3aenzyme activity 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3asoil enzymes 3asoil types 3aurease 3azinc oxide 0aNanoparticles 0aDehydrogenase 0aUrease 0aPhosphatases 0aSoil enzymes1 aOleszczuk, Patryk1 aFuta, Barbara0 tGeoderma.g2014 Nov., v. 232-234 p.528-537dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01214naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245005100157300001800208520026400226592002800490650001200518650001900530650002300549650001600572650001200588650001400600700002500614700001900639700001900658773012900677856007300806852000900879655001200888IND60657692520221119230245.0190816e20050628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065769252DNAL7 a10.1039/b505278p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillar, Amparo10aFirst osmium-catalysed ketamination of alkenes  ap. 3304-3306.  aConditions for a first oxidative conversion of alkenes into 2-amino ketones are described, which yield racemic products within a direct oxidation pathway and 2-amino ketones with up to 99% enantiomeric excess from the corresponding enantiopure amino alcohols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aamino alcohols 3acatalytic activity 3aenantiomers 3aketones 3aoxidation1 aHövelmann, Claas H.1 aNieger, Martin1 aMuñiz, Kilian0 tChemical communications.g2005 June 28, , no. 26 p.3304-3306dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b505278p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245012500212300001600337520199100353592002802344650003002372650001702402650001502419650001502434650002102449650002102470650001502491650001502506650001602521650001102537650001302548650001802561650001502579651001402594651001002608653003102618653002402649653001702673653002402690653004602714653001802760773009902778856008602877852000902963655001202972IND60538012120221122151611.0190412e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053801212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuzuki, Yoshiaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1465-691910aRelationships between pollutant discharge and water quality in the rivers from “better” to “worse” water quality  ap. 256-269.  aThe long-term relationship between pollutant discharge and river water quality of biological/biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in the Yamato-gawa River, Japan, has been found to be similar to perturbation or dynamic equilibrium change of alternative stable states in the ecosystem fields with a linear relationship as a usual condition. Similar relationships have been observed in short-terms for single precipitation events both in the Richmond River, Australia, and in a mountainous watershed in Japan. On the contrary, nutrient concentrations have not changed in a long-term besides nutrient discharge increases in the Richmond River. In this paper, long-term chronological relationships of annual pollutant discharges and water quality in the Brisbane River, Australia, were investigated based on pollutant discharge estimations and water quality monitoring data as a case study in the “better” water quality river. Effects of precipitation variation were taken into account in the pollutant discharge estimations by introducing precipitation variance coefficient (PVC). Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the river were found to be improved with fluctuations in the lower Brisbane River Catchment during 1975–2012. Long-term dynamic equilibrium alterations of pollutant discharge and water quality were found for TN and TP at the first time in the Brisbane River. The investigated term was found to be divided into two phases, 1975–2001 and 2001–2012 for TN, and 1975–2007 and 2005–2012 for TP. Both pollutant discharges and pollutant concentrations in the river were smaller in Phase 2 than Phase 1. Based on the relationships in the three rivers, a hypothesis on pollutant discharge and water quality from “better” to “worse” river water environment was presented that rapid and/or excess pollutant discharge increases cause perturbation or dynamic equilibrium alterations with the basal relationships as the linear relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3amonitoring 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3ariver water 3arivers 3avariance 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aAustralia 3aJapan 0aDynamic equilibrium change 0aHysteresis response 0aPerturbation 0aPollutant discharge 0aPrecipitation variation coefficient (PVC) 0aWater quality0 tEcological indicators.g2015 May, v. 52 p.256-269dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013700165500001500302520180000317592002802117650001302145650001102158650001102169650003402180650001402214650002502228650002002253650002402273650001302297650001802310650002502328650001702353650002002370650003002390653000902420653001302429653000902442653001102451653000702462653000702469653000802476653000802484653000802492653000902500653000802509653001002517653000902527653000902536653000902545653000902554653001002563653001002573653002602583653001902609653001702628700001702645700005802662773008802720856008302808852000902891655001202900IND60701010020221118011520.0200819e20201005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070101002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1449242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yuxuan10aN-acetyltransferase 2 polymorphism is associated with bladder cancer risk: An updated meta-analysis based on 54 case-control studies  agolden set  aN-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) polymorphism could participate in the metabolism of carcinogens through regulating the activity of a series of critical enzymes. However, the effects of NAT2 polymorphism on bladder cancer (BCa) risk were still inconclusive. In order to illustrate whether NAT2 polymorphism may influence the susceptibility to BCa, we conducted this updated meta-analysis.Databases including PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) were systematically retrieved and we applied MetaGenyo to perform final meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) as well as 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and Bonferroni method was applied to correct the P-value for multiple comparisons. The registration of this study protocol is at PROSPERO and ID is CRD42019133957.Ultimately, 54 case-control studies were identified for final meta-analysis (13343 BCa cases and 18,586 controls). Overall analysis indicated that the slow genotype in NAT2 polymorphism was obviously associated with BCa risk (PBₒₙfₑᵣᵣₒₙᵢ < 0.001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that significant risk with the slow genotype was observed in Caucasians, Asians, smokers, non-exposed individuals, high grade bladder cancer (HGBC) patients and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients. In addition, the intermediate NAT2 genotype was revealed to increase the BCa risk of Asians and transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) patients. However, no correlation was identified in Africans with the NAT2 polymorphism.The slow NAT2 genotype was identified to be the risk genotype for BCa. The intermediate genotype could serve as the candidate risk genotype. The gene-smoking interaction with NAT2 polymorphism might accelerate the tumor progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aAsians 3aWhites 3aarylamine N-acetyltransferase 3acarcinoma 3acase-control studies 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme polymorphism 3agenotype 3ameta-analysis 3aneoplasm progression 3arisk factors 3asmoking (habit) 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 0aNAT2 0aPROSPERO 0aCNKI 0aPRISMA 0aOR 0aCI 0aBCa 0aNOS 0aPCR 0aRFLP 0aTCC 0aNMIBC 0aMIBC 0aHGBC 0aLGBC 0aNAT1 0aGSTP1 0aGSTM1 0aN-acetyltransferase 2 0aBladder cancer 0aPolymorphism1 aQi, Xiangjie1 aLiu, Xiaoqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4986-42430 tGene.g2020 Oct. 05, v. 757 p.144924-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1449243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010000171300001600271520138000287592002801667650002201695650002901717650001101746650003001757650001801787650002001805651001001825653004001835653003701875653001201912653002201924653001001946700001501956773009901971856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60538012220221122151603.0190412e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053801222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tianxiang10aDynamic successive assessment method of water environment carrying capacity and its application  ap. 134-146.  aWater environment carrying capacity (WECC) is an important foundation of sustainable socioeconomic development and may be affected by many factors such as water resources, water quality, economy, population and environmental protection. This article focuses on the temporal and spatial variability of WECC to explore a method of dynamic successive assessment. First, the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework is used to develop a systematic and causal indicator system representing the three aspects of water environment pressure carrying capacity (WEPCC), water environment state carrying capacity (WESCC) and water environment response carrying capacity (WERCC). The Variable Fuzzy Pattern Recognition (VFPR) model and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model are combined to successively and dynamically assess WEPCC, WESCC and WERCC, and after that the weighting method is used to calculate WECC. Furthermore, WECC is divided into 27 classes on the basis of WEPCC, WESCC and WERCC contributions. The proposed method is applied to the dynamic successive assessment of WECCs in China, including inter-province comparisons. The results show that the dynamic successive WECC assessment method is reasonable, and it can be used not only to accurately understand the changes of WECC through time but also to distinguish qualitative differences masked by similar WECC values.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrying capacity 3aenvironmental protection 3amodels 3asocioeconomic development 3awater quality 3awater resources 3aChina 0aWater environment carrying capacity 0aTemporal and spatial variability 0aDynamic 0aAssessment method 0aClass1 aXu, Shiguo0 tEcological indicators.g2015 May, v. 52 p.134-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012200161300001600283520102400299592002801323650001901351650001501370650001401385650001101399650002301410650001101433651001001444651002501454651001901479651001901498653002001517653003701537653001901574653001801593653001301611700001701624700001701641700001701658700001801675700002401693700001501717700001701732773010501749856008101854852000901935655001201944IND60622236720221118045117.0181124e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062223672DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683604hl718rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIorio, M.10aHigh-resolution petrophysical and palaeomagnetic study of late-Holocene shelf sediments, Salerno Gulf, Tyrrhenian Sea  ap. 426-435.  aRecords of geomagnetic secular variation have been obtained from three cores recovered from the Salerno Gulf (southern Italy). High-resolution petrophysical and palaeomagnetic measurements enabled the reconstruction of a composite curve of geomagnetic palaeosecular variation (PSV), which is compared with the reconstructed PSV curve from Britain and with the French archaeomagnetic data of the last 2.1ka. The good agreement of the Salerno Gulf record with the above data conforms that our PSV record reaches back for some 9.0ka. In addition to a thick pumice layer originated during the Somma-Vesuvius eruption at 79, two other tephra layers were recognized, at about 1.3 and 3.0ka BP, that are probably also of Vesuvian origin. The comparison provides an initial chronological framework for assessing the increasing trend of sedimentation rate and its significant changes at about 2.7ka and 7.0ka BP. This variation in the deposition rate suggests a link with climatic changes recognized in the Mediterranean region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3ageophysics 3amagnetism 3apumice 3asedimentation rate 3atephra 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 3aTyrrhenian Sea 3aUnited Kingdom 0aClimatic change 0apalaeomagnetic secular variation 0aTyrrhenian Sea 0aMediterranean 0aHolocene1 aSagnotti, L.1 aAngelino, A.1 aBudillon, F.1 aD'Argenio, B.1 aDinarès-Turell, J.1 aMacri, P.,1 aMarsella, E.0 tHolocene.g2004 Apr., v. 14, no. 3 p.426-435dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl718rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013300157520141500290592002801705650001501733650001401748650002701762650001101789650001601800650001101816650001501827650001801842700001801860773012701878856007402005852000902079655001202088IND60652838820221119164848.0190713e20190306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065283882DNAL7 a10.3390/su110514002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yifei 10aInertia Provision and Small Signal Stability Analysis of a Wind-Power Generation System Using Phase-Locked Synchronized Equation  aThe inertia and damping of the modern power system are consistently decreased when wind energy has a high penetration level into the grid. This paper proposes a novel solution through transforming the wind turbine generator into an equivalent motion equation mimicking the basic characteristics of the synchronous generator (SG). This synchronized equation builds upon the phase-locked loop (PLL) model of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG), which characterizes the inertia constant, damping coefficient, and synchronizing torque. Thanks to this work, the dynamic performance of the inverter-based asynchronous generator could be analyzed from the perspective of the classical rotor motion equation. It further enables us to employ the analogy method to provide the DFIG with automated frequency response ability and to estimate the inertia constant quantitatively. Results also manifest that based on the synchronized equation, the PLL forms a power system stabilizer to enhance the power system oscillation. Hence, parameters tuning in PLL for coordinating inertia provision and damping enhancement are introduced. The contribution of this study lies in that the equivalent synchronized equation is established to optimize the system operation without alterations in the existing control structure of the DFIG. The theoretical analysis and the strategy are verified through the power system simulator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aequations 3agenerators (equipment) 3amodels 3astabilizers 3atorque 3awind power 3awind turbines1 aYuan, Youxin 0 tSustainability.g2019 Mar. 06, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110514003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011400176300001400290520176900304592002802073650001602101650001402117650001802131650001202149650001302161650001802174650001202192650001002204650001002214650001802224650002402242650001202266653001902278653001302297653001602310653001802326653001302344700002102357700002002378700002002398773012602418856008302544852000902627655001202636IND60130104420221122232217.0151127e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013010442DNAL7 a10.2994/SAJH-D-13-00034.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeredia, Viviana Juárez10aMites in the Neotropical Lizard Liolaemus pacha (Iguania: Liolaemidae): Relation to Body Size, Sex and Season  ap. 14-19.  aParasites can significantly influence the health of the host by inhibiting important physiological and behavioral processes. Some factors like body size, age of host, sex, and season can influence parasite load in nature. Mites are ectoparasites that can occur in lizards, possibly having a negative impact on their host. Our goals were to identify the mite that infested the Neotropical lizard Liolaemus pacha and describe its anatomical distribution, evaluate if mite intensity affected lizard mass, assess the relationship between lizard body size and mite intensity, and calculate the prevalence and intensity of mites in these lizards, comparing males and females and the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. We analyzed preserved specimens and also studied lizards in their natural environment. We performed linear regression analyses between the intensity of mite infestation and snout-vent length and between lizard mass and intensity of mite infestation. To compare the intensity of mite infestation between sex and season, we used the Mann-Whitney Test. The mite was identified as a species of Pterygosoma Peters, 1849 (Prostigmata: Pterygosomidae). Mite infestation was mainly in the ventral area, particularly in the guiar and lateral regions. Lizard body size did not explain the intensity of mite infestation, nor was lizard mass influenced by the intensity of mite infestation. Males in their natural habitat presented, on average, more mites than females, which might be related to differences in behavior. There were no differences between seasons. This study constitutes the second Argentine record of the presence of the ectoparasite Pterygosoma sp. in a Liolaemus species and the first that explores its relation to ecological parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProstigmata 3abody size 3aectoparasites 3afemales 3ahabitats 3alinear models 3alizards 3amales 3amites 3aparasite load 3aregression analysis 3atropics 0aEctoparasitism 0aParasite 0aPterygosoma 0aSouth America 0aSquamata1 aVicente, Natalin1 aRobles, Cecilia1 aHalloy, Monique0 tSouth american journal of herpetology.g2014 Apr., v. 9, no. 1 p.14-19dBrazilian Society of Herpetologyx1808-97987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2994%2FSAJH-D-13-00034.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009700170300001600267520132300283592002801606650001901634650002201653650001501675650001001690650002201700650001301722650001101735650001101746650000901757651001401766653002401780653002001804653001501824653001901839700002401858773012401882856008602006961001302092852000902105655001202114IND60694403420221122042730.0200513e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069440342DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2004.111011202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarbo, John R10aEffect of screen floors on populations of honey bees and parasitic mites (Varroa destructor)  ap. 114-117.  aThis study compared brood production, honey consumption (in winter only), population growth of honey bees (Apis mellifera), and population growth of parasitic mites (Varroa destructor) in hives with open screen or wood as floor material. Two experiments were conducted in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA, one in winter (19 colonies) and one in summer (22 colonies). In both experiments, we established uniform colonies of honey bees by subdividing 30 kg of mite-infested bees. Each colony began with about 11 000 bees, no brood, and uniform populations of mites (127 and 480 mites per colony in winter and summer, respectively). The summer test included a third treatment (8 colonies) where a wooden tray (5 cm deep) closed the space beneath a screen floor. After the first 20 days of the experiments, when no adult bees or mites had yet been produced in any of the colonies, the treatments showed no differences in brood production, honey consumption, or survival of adult bees. At nine weeks, colonies with screen floors had fewer mites, a lower percentage of their mite population residing in brood cells (open screen only), and more cells of capped brood. These results suggest that colonies with open-screen floors may hold back the growth of mite populations by decreasing the rate at which mites invade brood cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa destructor 3aapiculture 3ahoney 3apopulation growth 3aresearch 3asummer 3awinter 3awood 3aLouisiana 0ascreen bottom board 0aparasitic mites 0ahoney bees 0abrood invasion1 aHarris, Jeffrey W.,0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 3 p.114-117dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2004.111011203Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01643naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007800166300001800244520048000262592002800742650002100770650001400791650001200805650001500817650002500832650001500857650001300872650001600885650001000901653003200911653001100943653001600954653002500970653001400995653000801009700001901017773010801036856008001144852000901224655001201233IND60614974120221123014918.0181003e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061497412DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858124397232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLapointe, J.-M.10aIntervertebral Disk Disease With Spinal Cord Penetration in a Yucatan Pig  ap. 1054-1056.  aA 9-month-old female Yucatan pig was euthanized after acute onset of paraplegia.

In areas with limited availability of animal manure, there is a need for considering various off-farm nutrient resources for such production. Different organic and waste-derived fertilizer materials were used for broccoli production at two latitudes (58° and 67°) in Norway during two years. The fertilizer materials were applied at two rates of total N (80 and 170 kg ha–1) and compared with mineral fertilizer (170 kg ha–1) and no fertilizer. Broccoli yield was strongly influenced by fertilizer materials (algae meal < unfertilized control < sheep manure < extruded shrimp shell < anaerobically digested food waste < mineral fertilizer). Yield, but not glucosinolate content, was linearly correlated with estimated potentially plant-available N. However, extruded shrimp shell and mineral NPK fertilizer gave higher glucosinolate contents than sheep manure and no fertilizer. Sensory attributes were less affected by fertilizer material and plant-available N. 3aBrassica oleracea 3aNPK fertilizers 3aalgae 3abroccoli 3acrop yield 3afood waste 3aglucosinolates 3ahuman health 3alatitude 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3aorganic foods 3asensory properties 3asheep manure 3ashrimp 3avegetable growing 3aNorway1 aBreland, Tor Arvid1 aHagen, Sidsel Fiskaa1 aBrandt, Kirsten1 aWold, Anne-Berit1 aBengtsson, Gunnar B.1 aSeljasen, Randi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Dec. 23, v. 63, no. 50 p.10757-10767dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04631  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245006300178300001600241520100000257592002801257650001601285650001501301650002001316650001501336650001601351650001401367650001301381650001001394651001301404653001501417653002601432700002401458700002201482700002501504700002501529700002101554773012401575856008601699961001301785852000901798655001201807IND60694403620221122042707.0200513e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069440362DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2004.111011222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaiyawong, Thadsanee10aMultivariate morphometric study of Apis florea in Thailand  ap. 123-127.  aMorphometric analyses of Apis florea in Thailand were carried out in order to detect differences within this species. The nine body parts selected for analysis were: proboscis, antenna, forewing, hindwing, hind leg, the third and sixth sternites, and the third and fourth tergites. Twenty-two characters, consisting of widths, lengths or angles, were measured. Factor analysis sorted 14 characters of worker bees into four factors: (Factor 1) characters associated with size, hind leg and antenna; (Factor 2) length of wing venation and forewing; (Factor 3) number of hamuli and venation angle 37; and (Factor 4) venation angle 34. The results of factor and cluster analyses using the 22 characters revealed that the A. florea of Thailand are distributed as one group. Four characters (forewing radial cell length, metatarsus length, 3rd sternite length and antenna length) can be used to separate by Student-Newman-Keuls Statistics the A. florea of Samui and Pha-ngan Islands from the mainland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis florea 3aapiculture 3afactor analysis 3ametatarsus 3amorphometry 3aproboscis 3aresearch 3awings 3aThailand 0ahoney bees 0amorphometric analysis1 aDeowanish, Sureerat1 aWongsiri, Siriwat1 aSylvester, H.

This game species is relatively abundant in forest ecosystems of southern Spain (province of Cádiz), at the European side of the Strait of Gibraltar. In this region, the herriza or Mediterranean heathland is a relatively abundant natural habitat of outstanding biodiversity value but frequently underappreciated due to its characteristic treeless feature. We searched available abundance data of roe deer in 182 hunting estates in the province of Cádiz during three four-year periods (2006–2009, 2010–2013, and 2014–2017) and obtained surface cover data of herriza habitat for each estate. We also collected data on other variables that could influence roe deer abundance, such as hunting estate surface area, and relative abundance of red deer (Cervus elaphus), a co-occurring game species. Then, using a spatially explicit approach, we explored the association of the Andalusian roe deer with the relative abundance of herriza and red deer in the hunting states. A significant, positive effect of the relative abundance of herriza in the hunting estates was found for the Andalusian roe deer abundance but not for the red deer. Although reasons for such positive association remain speculative, an ecosystem service potential of the herriza should be considered, not only to enhance the conservation of a protected, singular game species, but also to promote the conservation value of a unique natural habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aCervus elaphus 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3agame animals 3ahabitats 3aheathlands 3asurface area 3athreatened species 3aungulates 3aSpain 3aStrait of Gibraltar 0aAndalusian roe deer 0aCapreolus capreolus var. garganta 0aRed deer 0aSpatial autocorrelation1 aOjeda, Fernando0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 July 15, v. 468 p.118181-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1181813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011400166300002000280520171000300592002802010650002102038650001302059650001602072650001702088650001702105650001002122650001502132650002502147650001802172650001802190650001002208650001702218650002202235650003002257650002002287650001302307650001502320650002102335650001202356651002102368651001002389700001702399700001902416700001802435700001902453700002202472773016902494856008302663852000902746655001202755IND60688016220221122232809.0200723e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068801622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-08059-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Shweta10aBioaerosol impact on crop health over India due to emerging fungal diseases (EFDs): an important missing link  ap. 12802-12829.  aAtmospheric bioaerosols, which contain a diverse group of various biological materials, also include pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and fungal spores. The dispersal of various pathogens negatively impacts the human and ecosystem health. While the impact of pathogenic bacteria and viruses on human and ecosystem health is well documented, the impact of fungal spores on crop, however, is poorly characterized. An unprecedented increase in number of fungal and fungal-like diseases (emerging fungal diseases (EFDs)) in plants is threatening the food security and endangering the biodiversity. In present communication, we show an increasing trend in the fungal bioaerosol attacks on crops over India outstripping bacteria and viruses. We further argue about the complex interactions between the fungal species, and crop impact over India is unique and highly interconnected with the topography, meteorological variables, and season of the year. Under constantly warming scenario, the fungal attacks on plants are expected to rise and, in all likelihood, extend to the sensitive and fragile ecosystems like the Himalayan region and the Western Ghats. An increasing trend in EFDs calls for immediate coordinated efforts towards understanding the type and diversity of pathogenic fungal bioaerosols. There is, however, a lack over Indian region about biogeography of pathogenic fungi. The detailed biogeography would help in improving public and political awareness to formulate the effective policy decisions. Any further disregard and delay in recognizing the importance of EFDs to crop and sensitive ecosystems can have severe societal and ecological repercussions over Indian region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathogens 3abacteria 3abioaerosols 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3acrops 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3afood security 3afungal spores 3afungi 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3ameteorological parameters 3aplant pathogens 3apolitics 3atopography 3avirulent strains 3aviruses 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aGettu, Navin1 aSwain, Basudev1 aKumari, Kiran1 aOjha, Narendra1 aGunthe, Sachin S.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Apr., v. 27, no. 11 p.12802-12829dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08059-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04112naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245010000205300001600305506007600321520137700397536074601774592002802520506003702548650002402585650002402609650001702633650002002650650001802670650002102688650001102709650002002720650001202740650001902752650001102771650001702782650003002799650000902829650003102838650001102869650001002880653002402890653003902914653001302953653001002966653000802976653001202984653001702996653001003013700001603023700001303039700002103052700001303073700001603086700001803102700001903120700001803139700001803157700001603175700001603191773010603207856008003313852000903393655001203402IND60614974320221207123158.0181003e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061497432DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858124397252doi7 aPMC39634002pmcid7 a224463242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergin, I.

Women infected with the highly oncogenic genital human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 are at high risk for development of cervical cancer. Related oncogenic αPVs exist in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Here the authors identified 3 novel genital αPV types (PhPV1, PhPV2, PhPV3) by PCR in cervical samples from 6 of 15 (40%) wild-caught female Kenyan olive baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis). Eleven baboons had koilocytes in the cervix and vagina. Three baboons had dysplastic proliferative changes consistent with cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In 2 baboons with PCR-confirmed PhPV1, 1 had moderate (CIN2, n = 1) and 1 had low-grade (CIN1, n = 1) dysplasia. In 2 baboons with PCR-confirmed PhPV2, 1 had low-grade (CIN1, n = 1) dysplasia and the other had only koilocytes. Two baboons with PCR-confirmed PhPV3 had koilocytes only. PhPV1 and PhPV2 were closely related to oncogenic macaque and human αPVs. These findings suggest that αPV-infected baboons may be useful animal models for the pathogenesis, treatment, and prophylaxis of genital αPV neoplasia. Additionally, this discovery suggests that genital αPVs with oncogenic potential may infect a wider spectrum of non-human primate species than previously thought.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: JDB was partially supported by a Family Planning Fellowship grant and the National Institutes of Health grant K12 HD065057.

Even so, several synthetic sweeteners (e.g., aspartame, saccharin, sucralose) are becoming less popular due to health-related concerns, lower nutritional values, and controversies around their safety. Conversely, natural sweeteners confer favourable customer perceptions due to their association to a healthier lifestyle and higher nutritional values. This article discusses the evidence of natural sweeteners in the available commercial products. A comprehensive review of natural sweeteners is presented, which includes their resources, properties and extraction methods, as well as a discussion on several emerging technologies that offer improvements to the traditional extraction methods. Finally, the progress of natural sweeteners in the food industry is assessed, and the commercial food products containing these natural sweeteners are mentioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartame 3afood chemistry 3afood industry 3alifestyle 3amarkets 3asaccharin 3asucralose 0aNatural sweeteners 0aSteviol glycosides 0aNovel extraction methods 0aHoney 0aCommercial products1 aCorrea-Delgado, Mariela1 aCórdova-Almeida, Rafael1 aLara-Nava, David1 aChávez-Muñoz, Mariana1 aVelásquez-Chávez, Valeria Fernanda1 aHernández-Torres, Carlos Eduardo1 aGontarek-Castro, Emilia1 aAhmad, Mohd Zamidi0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 370 p.130991-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1309913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009200162300001800254520166500272592002801937650003101965650005801996650003002054650002102084651001302105700001402118773013502132856008102267852000902348655001202357IND60654237720221121032325.0190724e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065423772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-018-2734-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabeel, A.10aObserved, stochastically simulated, and projected precipitation variability in Pakistan  ap. 2239-2256.  aStochastic simulation of daily precipitation at 46 different weather stations across Pakistan is assessed for the 36-year baseline period during 1976–2011 using a stochastic precipitation generator, both on seasonal and annual basis. The precipitation projections of 15 intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) fourth assessment report (AR4)-based Atmospheric Oceanic General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) are assessed for three 20-year projected time periods centered at 2011–2030, 2046–2065, and 2080–2099, which are embedded in the stochastic precipitation generator. The slope difference method is used to delineate the three precipitation regimes in Pakistan: arid, semi-arid, and humid. The change in (i) amount of precipitation, (ii) number of wet days, (iii) amount of precipitation per wet day, and (iv) area of precipitation regimes are assessed for all three projection time periods relative to the baseline period. Pakistan has received 487.48 mm of average annual precipitation, with an average of 43.54 wet days year⁻¹ during 1976–2011, whereas simulated average annual precipitation is 513.70 mm with 43.60 wet days in a year. The stochastic precipitation generator has less than 2% error in simulating the mean annual numbers of wet days during the baseline period, whereas simulated mean annual precipitation is 11.78 mm wet day⁻¹ versus the observed 11.70 mm wet day⁻¹. There is an underestimation of ~ 1% in simulated mean wet spell length during the baseline period. The AOGCMs display varying increase (decrease) in humid and semi-arid (arid) areas in Pakistan in all the three projected time periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aweather stations 3aPakistan1 aAthar, H.0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2019 Aug., v. 137, no. 3-4 p.2239-2256dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2734-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006300169300001600232520160100248592002801849650001701877650001501894650001101909650001301920651001001933653002601943700001701969700001701986700001702003773012402020856008602144852000902230655001202239IND60694404620221120232921.0200513e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069440462DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2004.111011342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoyke, Jerzy10aPeriodic mass flights of the giant honey bee, Apis dorsata  ap. 181-186.  aThis article reports observations conducted in Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal, during March-April and October—December 1999. 14 continuous observations were carried out from 08:00 h to 19:00 h on 6 to 48 nests of Apis dorsata in different seasonal conditions. Detailed observations of 410 periodic mass flights (PMFs) were recorded. During the day, A. dorsata workers made 0–6 PMFs, each of which lasted about 5 min. Worker bees from 52% to 100% of colonies performed PMFs within a day. About 55% of colonies performed a second PMF and about 25% a third flight. Percentage of colonies performing PMFs and the number of PMF activities per colony were highest when the largest amount of brood was present in colonies. In cool conditions (average temp. 20.9 °C), PMF activity lasted between 4 and 7 h and peaked around noontime. In warm conditions (average 26–28 °C), the duration of this activity extended up to 9 h with no PMFs at noon. In hot conditions (average 33.6 °C), the duration of PMF activities was extended to 11 h; however, flights were made only in the morning between 8:00 h and 10:00 h and in the evening between 16:00 h and 18:00 h, with a 6-h gap of no PMF in between. The duration and distribution of PMF activities during the day were correlated with average daily temperatures. On the warmest days, more PMF activities (63–67%) were performed after the hottest midday hours were over. We suggest that both the short duration of 5 min of PMF activity as well as the distribution of PMFs during the day are strategies to avoid thermal disruption of the protective bee curtain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis dorsata 3aapiculture 3aflight 3aresearch 3aNepal 0aperiodic mass flights1 aKruk, Cezary1 aWilde, Jerzy1 aWilde, Maria0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 4 p.181-186dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2004.111011343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245007400166300001600240520084400256592002801100650001301128650001001141650003101151650001101182650001101193650000901204650001101213700001801224700001801242700001801260700002101278700002001299700002501319700001801344700001701362700002301379773014301402856007901545852000901624655001201633IND60312916720221117035332.0150714e20141010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031291672DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12557182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarvi, Hamidreza10aSidewinding with minimal slip: Snake and robot ascent of sandy slopes  ap. 224-229.  aLimbless organisms such as snakes can navigate nearly all terrain. In particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes ( Crotalus cerastes ) operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle. Together, these three approaches demonstrate how sidewinding with contact-length control mitigates failure on granular media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrotalus 3adunes 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3arobots 3asand 3asnakes1 aGong, Chaohui1 aGravish, Nick1 aAstley, Henry1 aTravers, Matthew1 aHatton, Ross L.1 aMendelson, Joseph R.1 aChoset, Howie1 aHu, David L.1 aGoldman, Daniel I.0 tScience.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 346, no. 6206 p.224-229dAmerican Association for the Advancement of SciencewJournal:jnl44791x0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12557183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245015500169520102900324592002801353650001701381650001901398650001901417650001501436650001401451650001701465650001801482650001301500650001901513650001501532650001101547650002101558650001401579650001701593650001601610653002301626653002001649653001601669653003101685700001701716700001601733700001501749700001401764773010001778856008701878852000901965655001201974IND60749354820221121141338.0211114e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074935482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1309922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zonglin10aDielectric barrier discharge plasma: A green method to change structure of potato starch and improve physicochemical properties of potato starch films  aThe effects of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment on the physicochemical properties of potato starch and its films were studied. The results showed that the plasma species caused etching lead to small cracks and pores in potato starch particles and that oxidation, de-polymerization, and crosslinking were the main mechanisms underlying the effects of DBD plasma treatment. As the treatment time extended, starch hydrolysis, turbidity, syneresis, and gelatinization temperatures increased first and then decreased, whereas the solubility, swelling power, and water absorption significantly increased (P < 0.05). There was a decrease in the retrogradation tendency of the starch gels. The surfaces of the DBD plasma-modified potato starch-based films were relatively flat. After a 9-min treatment, the films exhibited the lowest water vapor permeability and highest tensile strength. In conclusion, the use of DBD plasma is a simple and green method to enhance the properties of potato starch and its film.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3afood chemistry 3agelatinization 3ahydrolysis 3aoxidation 3apermeability 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3aretrogradation 3asolubility 3astarch 3atensile strength 3aturbidity 3awater uptake 3awater vapor 0aPackaging material 0aModified starch 0aCold plasma 0aPhysicochemical properties1 aGou, Qiaomin1 aYang, Lihua1 aYu, Qun-li1 aHan, Ling0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 370 p.130992-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1309923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245010400178300001600282520118000298592002801478650001201506650001301518650001701531650001701548650001301565650001001578650001301588650001401601650001701615650001601632651001201648651001201660653002201672653001701694653001901711653001301730653002001743653001201763653001701775773010401792856008201896852000901978655001201987IND60622237220221118054413.0181124e199807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062223722DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683986662966392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarmaja-Korjonen, Kaarina10aLatitudinal differences in the influx of microscopic charred particles to lake sediments in Finland  ap. 589-597.  aForest fires produced charcoal throughout the Holocene and charcoal was preserved in lake sediments. This study compares differences in sedimentary charcoal between southern and northern Finland. Yearly influx of the total surface area of the charcoal particles (μm² cm⁻² yr⁻¹) was estimated at different latitudes: two lakes from southern Finland (60° 21'N, 60° 59'N), two from the Kuusamo area (66° 21'N), NE Finland and one lake from NW Finnish Lapland (68° 40'N). The results show that the mean amount of charcoal deposited in southern Finland was about 10 times higher than that from Kuusamo and 100 times higher than that from NW Finnish Lapland. These differences existed for the whole Holocene and were accompanied by changes in temperature and humidity, as well as drastic changes in forest type. It is suggested that the climatically induced difference in forest biomass at different latitudes accounts for the differences in charcoal influx. Since high-resolution charcoal analyses are not available, it is not clear if the fires were also less frequent in the Kuusamo area; however, there is evidence from Lapland of very long intervals between fires.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acharcoal 3aforest fires 3aforest types 3ahumidity 3alakes 3alatitude 3asediments 3asurface area 3atemperature 3aFinland 3aLapland 0aCharcoal analysis 0aforest fires 0afire frequency 0aHolocene 0aclimatic change 0abiomass 0aFennoscandia0 tHolocene.g1998 July, v. 8, no. 5 p.589-597dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683986662966393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245014300158300002000301520202100321592002802342650000802370650001802378650001902396650001302415650001202428650001502440650001402455650002302469650001302492650001702505650001902522650002202541650001902563650001402582653001702596653002402613653001702637653001802654653001402672653002502686653002902711700001402740700001802754700001602772700004102788700002002829700002302849700002002872700001702892773012602909856008003035852000903115655001203124IND60577460220170927000000.0170809e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057746022DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b061452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Long10aEnhanced Long-term and Thermal Stability of Polymer Solar Cells in Air at High Humidity with the Formation of Unusual Quantum Dot Networks  ap. 26257-26267.  aDue to the practical applications of polymer solar cells (PSCs), their stability recently has received increasing attention. Herein, a new strategy was developed to largely enhance the long-term and thermal stability of PSCs in air with a relatively high humidity of 50–60% without any encapsulation. In this strategy, semiconductor PbS/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) were incorporated into the photoactive blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). By replacing the initial ligands of oleic acid with halide ligands on the surface of PbS/CdS QDs via solution-phase ligand exchange, we were able to form unusual, continuous QD networks in the film of P3HT:PCBM, which effectively stabilized the photoactive layer. Air-processed PSCs based on the stabilized P3HT:PCBM film showed excellent long-term stability under high humidity, providing over 3% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) simultaneously. Around 91% of pristine PCE was retained after 30 days storage in high-humidity air without encapsulation. This constitutes a remarkable improvement compared to ∼53% retained PCE for the QD-free devices, which can be ascribed to the efficient suppression of both PCBM aggregation and oxidation of the thiophene ring in P3HT, thanks to the formation of robust QD networks. Furthermore, the presence of QD networks was able to enhance the stability of the P3HT:PCBM film against thermal stress/oxidation under high-humidity environment (50–60%) as well. The device kept 60% of pristine PCE after thermal treatment for 12 h at 85 °C in air, which is more than twice higher than that for the QD-free device. To the best of our knowledge, the work represents the first unambiguous demonstration of the formation of QD networks in the photoactive layer and of their important contribution to the stability of PSCs. This strategy is highly promising for other fullerene-based PSCs and opens a new avenue toward achieving PSCs with high PCE and excellent stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aencapsulation 3aheat treatment 3ahumidity 3aligands 3aoleic acid 3aoxidation 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3asemiconductors 3athermal stability 3athermal stress 3athiophene 0aphotovoltaic 0aorganic solar cells 0aquantum dots 0anear infrared 0astability 0achemical degradation 0amorphology stabilization1 aYang, Fan1 aKim, Mee Rahn1 aLi, Pandeng1 aGangadharan, Deepak Thrithamarassery1 aMargot, Joëlle1 aIzquierdo, Ricardo1 aChaker, Mohamed1 aMa, Dongling0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Aug. 09, v. 9, no. 31 p.26257-26267dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b061453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008100165300001400246520160200260592002801862650001801890650001301908650001101921650001301932650001501945650001601960650001901976650001401995700006102009700002202070773012202092856008202214852000902296655001202305IND60687224220221118171641.0200328e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068722422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-019-00495-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun, Lukas12aA Turbulence Closure Study of the Flow and Thermal Fields in the Ekman Layer  ap. 25-55.  aWe assess the performance of turbulence closures of varying degrees of sophistication in the prediction of the mean flow and the thermal fields in a neutrally-stratified Ekman layer. The Reynolds stresses that appear in the Reynolds-averaged momentum equations are determined using both eddy-viscosity and complete differential Reynolds-stress-transport closures. The results unexpectedly show that the assumption of an isotropic eddy viscosity inherent in eddy-viscosity closures does not preclude the attainment of accurate predictions in this flow. Regarding the Reynolds-stress transport closure, two alternative strategies are examined: one in which a high turbulence–Reynolds–number model is used in conjunction with a wall function to bridge over the viscous sublayer and the other in which a low turbulence–Reynolds-number model is used to carry out the computations through this layer directly to the surface. It is found that the wall-function approach, based on the assumption of the applicability of the universal logarithmic law-of-the-wall, yields predictions that are on par with the computationally more demanding alternative. Regarding the thermal field, the unknown turbulent heat fluxes are modelled (i) using the conventional Fourier’s law with a constant turbulent Prandtl number of 0.85, (ii) by using an alternative algebraic closure that includes dependence on the gradients of mean velocities and on rotation, and (iii) by using a differential scalar-flux transport model. The outcome of these computations does not support the use of Fourier’s law in this flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat transfer 3aisotropy 3amodels 3amomentum 3aprediction 3atroposphere 3aturbulent flow 3aviscosity1 aYounis, Bassam A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3437-12191 aWeigand, Bernhard0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2020 Apr., v. 175, no. 1 p.25-55dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9360x0006-83147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-019-00495-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245008700158300002000245520151300265592002801778650000801806650002101814650001001835650001301845650002501858650001201883650002601895650001101921650001501932650001701947650001801964650001101982650001301993650002502006650001302031650001102044653001302055653001902068653001902087653001902106653002502125653002502150700001802175700001302193700002002206700001402226700001202240700001902252700001602271700003002287700001802317773012602335856008002461852000902541655001202550IND60577460320221119122032.0170809e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057746032DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b062822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Linli10aLightweight and Ultrastrong Polymer Foams with Unusually Superior Flame Retardancy  ap. 26392-26399.  aHigh-performance flame-retardant materials are urgently needed to address outstanding issues that pertain to safety. Traditional flame retardants are toxic to the environment and/or lack the physical properties required for use in many contemporary applications. Here, we show that isocyanate-based polyimide (PI) foam, a flammable material, can exhibit unusually superior flame retardancy as well as other excellent properties, such as being lightweight and displaying high mechanical strength, by incorporating red phosphorus (RP)-hybridized graphene. The covalent bonds formed between the graphene platelets and the PI matrix provide the resultant PI foam with a specific Young’s modulus (83 kNm kg–¹) that is comparable to or even higher than those displayed by state-of-the-art foams, including silica aerogels, polystyrene foams, and polyurethane foams. In addition, even a low content of the RP-hybridized graphene (2.2 wt %) results in an exceptionally higher limiting oxygen index (39.4) than those of traditional flame-retardant polymer-based materials (typically 20–30). The resultant PI foam also exhibits thermal insulation properties that are similar to that of air. Moreover, the RP-hybridized graphene is prepared using a one-step ball milling process in 100% yield, and does not require solvent or produce waste. The preparation of the flame-retardant PI foams can be scaled as the starting materials are commercially available and the techniques employed are industrially compatible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aflame retardants 3afoams 3agraphene 3ainsulating materials 3amilling 3amodulus of elasticity 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3apolystyrenes 3apolyurethanes 3asilica 3asolvents 3astrength (mechanics) 3atoxicity 3awastes 0agraphene 0ared phosphorus 0apolyimide foam 0afire retardant 0acompressive property 0athermal conductivity1 aXiao, Linhong1 aJia, Pan1 aGoossens, Karel1 aLiu, Peng1 aLi, Hui1 aCheng, Chungui1 aHuang, Yong1 aBielawski, Christopher W.1 aGeng, Jianxin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Aug. 09, v. 9, no. 31 p.26392-26399dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b062823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006800170300001400238520108700252592002801339650001001367650001501377650001501392650001601407650000901423650001001432650000901442650001401451650002201465650001101487650001201498653000901510653002101519653001601540653001401556653001101570653001301581700002001594773012601614856008301740852000901823655001201832IND60130105020221122022158.0151127e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013010502DNAL7 a10.2994/SAJH-D-13-00030.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanzera, Alejandra10aFeeding Biology of Lygophis anomalus (Dipsadidae, Xenodontinae)  ap. 75-82.  aWe studied the diet of the subtropical Lygophis anomalus through the analysis of 444 museum specimens collected along all its geographical range. Analysis of the stomach contents of specimens from all its distribution range indicate that this species feeds primarily on anurans, consuming reptiles like occasional items. Most of stomachs presented only one item, while only 14 snakes (16.87%) presented 2–7 items. Prey total length was 4–34% of the snout—vent length of the snakes. Prior to swallowing, the amphibians were usually oriented and ingested from the anterior portion of the body, but no significant relationship was found between volumes or total length of ingested prey and the direction of ingestion. We did not find sexual dimorphism in head length, and diet composition did not vary between sexes. These results and the absence of a significant relationship between snake and prey size suggests that L. anomalus is an opportunistic species that preys on several environments. Its feeding activity seems to depend more on the season that on the day/night cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnura 3aDipsadidae 3aamphibians 3adeglutition 3adiet 3afeeds 3ahead 3aingestion 3asexual dimorphism 3asnakes 3astomach 0aDiet 0aFeeding behavior 0aNeotropical 0aSerpentes 0aSnakes 0aSquamata1 aManeyro, Raúl,0 tSouth american journal of herpetology.g2014 Aug., v. 9, no. 2 p.75-82dBrazilian Society of Herpetologyx1808-97987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2994%2FSAJH-D-13-00030.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009000167520104300257592002801300650002801328650002201356650001401378650001801392650001901410650001201429650002201441650002401463650002201487653001901509653002401528653001801552653003301570653002101603653001501624653001401639700001901653700001301672700001101685700001801696773010001714856008701814852000901901655001201910IND60749355020221122225530.0220426e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074935502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1309942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Peihua10aApplication of deep learning for image-based Chinese market food nutrients estimation  aWith commercialization of deep learning (DL) models, daily precision dietary record based on images from smartphones becomes possible. This study took advantage of DL techniques on visual recognition tasks and proposed a suite of big-data-driven DL models regressing from food images to their nutrient estimation. We established and publicized the first food image database from the Chinese market, named ChinaMartFood-109. It contained 10,921 images with 23 nutrient contents, covering 18 main food groups. Inception V3 was optimized using other state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks, achieving up to 78 % and 94 % for top-1 and top-5 accuracy, respectively. Besides, this research compared three nutrient estimation algorithms and achieved the best regression coefficient (R2) by normalization + AM compared with arithmetic mean and harmonic mean, validating applicability in practice as well as theory. These encouraging results provide further evidence supporting artificial intelligence in the field of food analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acommercialization 3adatabases 3afood analysis 3afood chemistry 3amarkets 3amobile telephones 3aregression analysis 3avisual perception 0aFood nutrients 0aChinese market food 0aDeep learning 0aConvolutional neural network 0aFood composition 0aFood image 0aNutrients1 aLau, Chun Pong1 aYu, Ning1 aLi, An1 aSheng, Jiping0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 373 p.130994-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1309943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03899naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012900171300001600300520224700316592002802563650002502591650002302616650001602639650001902655650002002674650000902694650001702703650001502720650002302735650001402758650001802772650002202790650002502812650001802837650002002855650001802875651001102893653003302904653001302937653002802950653002402978653001803002653000803020653001003028653001003038653001403048653000803062700002103070700001903091700001703110773009903127856008603226852000903312655001203321IND60538013120221121055919.0190412e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053801312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanacker, Marie10aDetermining tipping points in aquatic ecosystems: The case of biodiversity and chlorophyll α relations in fish pond systems  ap. 184-193.  aThe management of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems requires knowing the state of water quality linked to regime shifts in various taxonomic groups. We examine this question by studying the fish ponds in the Dombes region, France. These waterbodies are characterized by a high diversity of species. High levels of nutrients due to certain fish farming practices may cause significant eutrophication leading to loss in biodiversity and a shift from high coverage of aquatic vegetation to phytoplankton dominance may also be observed. The aim of this study is to assess tipping points, thresholds for effect, along a gradient of chlorophyll α in different taxonomic groups: aquatic vascular plants, phytoplankton, dragonflies and aquatic macro-invertebrates. Tipping points are analyzed with three different statistical methods: a method which evaluates tipping points with a difference in the mean (TMEAN), a second method which evaluates tipping point by comparing the mean and linear regressions before and after the tipping point (FSTAT) and third a method which evaluates linear regressions with a pivotal tipping point (SEGMENTED). We also compare tipping points for the different taxonomic groups using five different diversity indices: Observed richness, Jackknife first order, Fisher's alpha, Simpson index and Evenness.Our results show that there is an important variation in tipping points following the three statistical methods, but the SEGMENTED is the best method for evaluating tipping points. We observe a high difference of tipping point values for the different taxonomic groups depending on the diversity indices used. Jackknife first order has a better performance to evaluate a eutrophic change according to the diversity than the other indices.In all taxonomic groups, aquatic vascular plants are the most impacted by the chlorophyll α and almost all their tipping points are observed around 60μg/L chlorophyll α concentrations. No significant relationship is found between chlorophyll α and phytoplankton diversity, while the two other groups, dragonflies and macro-invertebrates, are both impacted by the chlorophyll α but their relevant tipping points are situated in higher values than aquatic vascular plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aaquatic ecosystems 3achlorophyll 3aeutrophication 3afarming systems 3afish 3afish culture 3afish ponds 3amacroinvertebrates 3anutrients 3aphytoplankton 3aspecies diversity 3astatistical analysis 3asurface water 3avascular plants 3awater quality 3aFrance 0aDiversity index, dragonflies 0aFishpond 0aAquatic vascular plants 0aMacro-invertebrates 0aPhytoplankton 0aCHL 0aFSTAT 0aTMEAN 0aSEGMENTED 0aWFD1 aWezel, Alexander1 aPayet, Vincent1 aRobin, Joel,0 tEcological indicators.g2015 May, v. 52 p.184-193dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245008000181300001400261520101700275592002801292650002501320650001501345650001001360650001301370650002001383651001101403653001701414653001901431653001201450700002601462700002701488773012201515856008601637852000901723655001201732IND60694405420221121013108.0200513e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069440542DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2005.111011472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoguel-Ordoñez, Yolanda10aδ ¹³C isotopic index of honeys produced in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico  ap. 49-53.  aThe study was carried out in order to characterize honeys produced in the Yucatan peninsula by analysis of the δ ³C isotope and to detect whether adulterants were present. A total of 234 honey samples, the harvesting of which coincided with the main flowering season of tajonal (Viguiera dentata) and tzitzilche (Gymnopodium floribundum), were collected from the Mexican states of Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo. Two types of samples were taken: honeycomb honey (for characterization) and honey obtained from the main honey processing plants (to detect possible adulterations). The analyses were performed using stable carbon isotope ratio analysis. The isotopic values of pure honeys extracted from combs at the laboratory were:-26.3 ± 0.32 δ %° (n = 28) for tajonal and −24.5 ± 0.30 δ ° (n = 33) for tzitzilche. Adulterations were not detected in tajonal honeys; however, the tzitzilche honeys had 25.3% samples within the range of suspected adulteration and 5.7% within the range of adulterated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3aapiculture 3ahoney 3aresearch 3astable isotopes 3aMexico 0aadulteration 0aisotopic index 0aYucatan1 aEchazarreta, Carlos M1 aMora-Escobedo, Rosalva0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2005 Jan. 1, v. 44, no. 2 p.49-53dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2005.111011473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245018600162300002000348520130800368592002801676650003801704650002601742650001701768650001401785650001901799650002201818650001501840650001701855650003201872650001301904650003301917650001501950650001601965650001601981653002101997653002802018653001602046653002202062653001902084700002102103700001402124700001402138700001802152700001702170700001702187700001702204773012602221856008002347852000902427655001202436IND60577460520221119122113.0170809e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057746052DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b063032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Chunhong10aEnhanced Wettability and Thermal Stability of a Novel Polyethylene Terephthalate-Based Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride) Nanofiber Hybrid Membrane for the Separator of Lithium-Ion Batteries  ap. 26400-26406.  aIn this study, a novel membrane for the separator in a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery was proposed via a mechanically pressed process with a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofiber subject and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microfiber support. Important physical properties, such as surface morphology, wettability, and heat stability were considered for the PET-reinforced PVDF nanofiber (PRPN) hybrid separator. Images of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the PRPN hybrid separator had a homogeneous pore size and high porosity. It can wet out in battery electrolytes completely and quickly, satisfying wettability requirements. Moreover, the electrolyte uptake was higher than that of dry-laid and wet-laid nonwovens. For heat stability, no shrink occurred even when the heating temperature reached 135 °C, demonstrating thermal and dimensional stability. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the PRPN hybrid separator possessed a shutdown temperature of 131 °C, which is the same as conventional separators. Also, the meltdown temperature reached 252 °C, which is higher than the shutdown temperature, and thus can protect against internal cell shorts. The proposed PRPN hybrid separator is a strong candidate material for utilization in Li-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adimensional stability 3aelectrolytes 3afluorides 3aheat stability 3alithium batteries 3ananofibers 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseparators 3atemperature 3awettability 0ahybrid separator 0aPVDF nanofiber membrane 0awettability 0athermal stability 0aLi-ion battery1 aNagaishi, Tomoki1 aShi, Jian1 aLee, Hoik1 aWong, Pok Yin1 aSui, Jianhua1 aHyodo, Kenji1 aKim, Ick Soo0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Aug. 09, v. 9, no. 31 p.26400-26406dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b063033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245017100174520100900345592002801354650001501382650002601397650002001423650001901443650001301462650001001475650001901485650001301504650001301517653003401530653004201564653001001606653003201616653001001648653001701658700001901675700003201694700001601726700002601742700002301768773010001791856008701891852000901978655001201987IND60749355120221122225503.0211219e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074935512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1309972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoinfar, Soleyman10aDevelopment of a SPE/GC–MS method for the determination of organophosphorus pesticides in food samples using syringe filters packed by GNP/MIL-101(Cr) nanocomposite  aIn this study, we report the synthesis and application of a nanocomposite comprising metal–organic framework MIL-101(Cr) and graphene nanopowder (GNP) as a promising sorbent for the extraction of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) in juices, water, vegetables and honey samples. A syringe filter, for the first time, was used to host the synthesized nanocomposite and extract the OPPs followed by GC–MS analysis. Different characterization methods including XRD, FTIR, TGA, BET and SEM were employed to confirm the formation of studied nanocomposite. The results indicated that the GNP/MIL-101(Cr) could provide higher capacity for adsorption of OPPs and lower detection limit compared to pristine MIL-101(Cr). The detection limits were 0.005 to 15.0 µg/Kg and the linear range found between 0.05 and 400 µg/Kg. The proposed method showed very good repeatability with the RSD values ranging from 2.9% to 7.1%.

To address this question, we studied chronosequences of 24 Fagus sylvatica and 24 Picea abies stands in Poland, located both in lowlands and highlands (12 stands of each species per category). We cut and weighted 192 sample trees, and we measured carbon content in wood, bark, branches and leaves. We also developed allometric tree- and stand-level models of biomass and carbon mass. Using log-transformed linear models we checked the effect sizes of elevation category (lowland and highland) on estimate output. We found small, statistically insignificant differences in biomass allocation patterns, carbon content and allometric trajectories in trees between lowland and highland stands. Tree-level allometric models without elevation category had higher accuracy than models including elevation category and explained 96.8–99.8% of biomass variability. Biomass and carbon stock of species studied was positively correlated with stand volume, age, basal area and height, and negatively with stand density. However, the differences between lowlands and highlands were low and did not exceed 38 Mg ha⁻¹ (for P. abies foliage biomass, with model root mean squared error of 37.638 Mg ha⁻¹). Our results revealed transferability of models developed using lowland and highland populations of the studied species. This will increase confidence in methods used to estimate carbon pools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3aadministrative management 3aallometry 3abark 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3adry matter partitioning 3aforest ecology 3aleaves 3astand density 3awood 3aPoland 0aAllometric equations 0aBiomass allocation 0aCarbon content 0aEuropean beech 0aNorway spruce1 aDyderski, Marcin K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4453-27811 aHorodecki, Paweł1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7789-87230 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 474 p.118329-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1183293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245011900207300001600326520173500342592002802077650001102105650002602116650001102142650001502153650002202168650002202190650002102212650001602233650001602249650001102265700001502276700002402291773012402315856008202439852000902521655001202530IND60687224520221118171429.0200328e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068722452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-019-00497-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Edwin V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0653-154510aEffect of Clouds on the Diurnal Evolution of the Atmospheric Boundary-Layer Height Over a Tropical Coastal Station  ap. 135-152.  aThe growth of the daytime convective atmospheric boundary layer, which plays a pivotal role in the vertical mixing and dispersal of water vapour and pollutants, is modulated by cloud radiative effects. Assessment of this cloud effect is sparse in any geographical region and non-existent over tropical coastal regions. We investigate the effect of clouds on the diurnal evolution of boundary-layer height over tropical coastal location Thumba (8.5°N, 77°E) during onshore and offshore flow using multi-year (2010–2016) microwave radiometer profiler observations. The boundary-layer height during both cloudy and clear-sky periods increases rapidly from 0800 LT (local time = UTC + 5.1 h) to attain a daytime peak around noon (400–1500 m). The seasonal mean noontime boundary layer height during cloudy periods is lower than that during clear-sky periods by > 900 m (> 400 m) when offshore (onshore) flow prevails during winter and pre-monsoon seasons. The forenoon growth rate of the boundary-layer height during clear-sky offshore flow is rapid (> 380 m h⁻¹) compared to that during cloudy offshore (160 m h⁻¹), clear-sky onshore (160–250 m h⁻¹), and cloudy onshore (> 100 m h⁻¹) flow. Effects of shortwave cloud radiative forcing and soil temperature on the noontime boundary-layer height and their interdependencies are presented. These observations reveal the contrasting and significant effect of clouds on the growth of the daytime boundary layer during onshore and offshore flow, and the coupled effects of cloud radiative forcing and soil temperature on boundary-layer height over tropical coastal regions, which provide essential constraints for evaluating model simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3amicrowave radiometers 3amixing 3apollutants 3aradiative forcing 3asimulation models 3asoil temperature 3atroposphere 3awater vapor 3awinter1 aRajeev, K.1 aMishra, Manoj Kumar0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2020 Apr., v. 175, no. 1 p.135-152dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9360x0006-83147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-019-00497-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245007400175300001600249520093900265592002801204650001401232650002401246650002601270650001501296650001901311650001401330650002001344650001601364650000901380650001301389650001101402650001001413651001101423653002301434653002701457653002001484653002801504653001201532700001701544700002801561773012801589856008301717852000901800655001201809IND60130105620221122002021.0151127e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013010562DNAL7 a10.2994/SAJH-D-13-00028.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberto, Igor Joventino12aA New Species of Rhinella (Anura: Bufonidae) from Northeastern Brazil  ap. 190-199.  aWe describe a new species of anuran belonging to the Rhinella crucifer species group, from a relictual Atlantic Forest fragment located at the Serra de Baturité mountain range, State of Ceará, Northeastern Brazil.

The mean concentrations of the total As and Asi were 116.5 and 90.9 μg/kg, respectively. There were significant differences (P < 0.01) between the 11 provinces, and 1.1% of samples exceeded the maximum contaminant level established by Chinese legislation. According to the exposure assessment method of probabilistic simulation, all values of the target hazard quotients (THQs) for chronic noncarcinogenic risks (skin lesions as the point of departure) were below 1, suggesting that the Chinese population will not encounter a significant noncarcinogenic risk. However, the mean values of margin of exposure (MOE) for lung cancer risks ranging from 3.86 to 8.54 were under 100 for all age groups and genders of the Chinese population; moreover, MOE values for some major rice-producing and -consuming countries, such as Japan, Thailand, Bangladesh, and the United States, were all also below 100. More attention should be paid to carcinogenic risks from rice Asi intake, and some control measures to reduce rice Asi intake should be taken. 3aarsenic 3acontrol methods 3adietary exposure 3aexposure assessment 3alung neoplasms 3amaximum contaminant level 3arice 3arisk 3askin lesions 3aBangladesh 3aChina 3aJapan 3aThailand 3aUnited States1 aWang, Min1 aMao, Xuefei1 aQian, Yong-Zhong,1 aChen, Tianjin1 aZhang, Ying0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Dec. 23, v. 63, no. 50 p.10838-10845dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04164  aDNAL 7aarticle04294naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245011300191300001600304520211600320592002802436650002002464650001202484650001802496650002502514650001902539650003502558650002002593650001202613650002002625650001102645650002102656650001202677650002102689650003202710650001202742650003002754650002202784650003402806650006302840650003602903650004202939650003402981650002303015650003303038650002403071650005803095650000903153650005803162650003603220650001203256650001603268650005503284650001603339700002403355700002303379773011703402856008103519990002303600852000903623655001203632IND60093625020221122153153.0141103e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009362502DNAL7 a209344162pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2010.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiniarska, Katarzyna10aInhibition of renal gluconeogenesis contributes to hypoglycaemic action of NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin  ap. 119-126.  aNADPH oxidase, catalysing superoxide radical (O₂ ⁻) formation, is considered as a main source of reactive oxygen species in kidneys and its increased activity is supposed to be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, on renal gluconeogenesis, which is an important source of endogenous glucose under diabetic conditions. The following observations were made during the experiments performed on isolated renal proximal tubules of control and alloxan diabetic rabbits: (1) apocynin (200μM) inhibited the rate of glucose synthesis by 45–80%, depending on the substrate applied; (2) the rate of glucose production was also significantly diminished in the presence of TEMPOL (5mM), a superoxide radical scavenger, suggesting that the decrease in O₂ ⁻ formation might be involved in apocynin-evoked gluconeogenesis inhibition; (3) the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and/or aldolase were lowered in the presence of either apocynin or TEMPOL, as concluded from the intracellular levels of gluconeogenic intermediates. The data from in vivo experiments indicated that apocynin treatment (2g/l of drinking water): (1) significantly (by about 30%) attenuated serum glucose concentration in diabetic rabbits and did not affect glycaemia in control animals; (2) normalized diabetes-stimulated rate of glucose synthesis and slightly inhibited gluconeogenesis in control rabbits; (3) normalized diabetes-increased activity of mitochondrial PEPCK and lowered cytosolic PEPCK activity by about 20% below the value for untreated control animals; (4) slightly decreased the activity of mitochondrial PEPCK and did not change the activity of cytosolic one in control rabbits. Thus, it is concluded that: (1) the inhibition of NADPH oxidase might contribute to lowered rate of renal gluconeogenesis, probably due to decreasing PEPCK activity; (2) inhibition of renal gluconeogenesis is involved in apocynin hypoglycaemic action in vivo; (3) apocynin might be beneficial for diabetes treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aalloxan 3ablood glucose 3adiabetic nephropathy 3adrinking water 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3ain vivo studies 3aoxygen 3aproximal tubules 3arabbits 3asuperoxide anion 2aAcetophenonesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCreatininexblood 2aCyclic N-Oxidesxpharmacology 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFree Radical Scavengersxpharmacology 2aGluconeogenesisxdrug effects 2aGlutathionexblood 2aGlutathione Disulfidexblood 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aKidney Tubulesxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aNADPH Oxidasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphoenolpyruvatexmetabolism 2aRabbits 2aSpin Labels 2aSuperoxidesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aUreaxblood1 aGrabowski, Michał,1 aRogacki, Maciej K.0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.119-126dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2010.09.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014600167520095800313592002801271650002201299650001301321650001901334650002301353650001201376650001401388650002301402650001601425650004101441650000901482650001101491650001401502650001901516650001101535650001201546653001501558653002201573653001401595653001301609700001701622700001501639773010901654856008501763852000901848655001201857IND60694057820221121014450.0200607e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069405782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1064582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Meiyun10aEffects of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and Fe loading rate of Fe-modified ZSM-5 on selection of aromatics and kinetics of corn stalk catalytic pyrolysis  aTo solve the problems of complicated compounds and high oxygen content in pyrolysis bio-oil, Fe-modified ZSM-5 catalysts (wet-impregnation, SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratio: 30, 40, 50 and 60, Fe loading rate: 2 wt%, 4 wt%, 6 wt%, and 8 wt%) were prepared and employed to improve the selection of aromatics using Py-GC/MS and to investigate the kinetics of corn stalk catalytic pyrolysis by TGA tests and Friedman isoconversional kinetics method. Results revealed that the highest yields of aromatics were obtained using Fe/ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 40 and Fe loading rate of 4 wt%, which was 38.28%. The existence of Fe on ZSM-5 leads to an increase of monocyclic aromatics compared with parent ZSM-5. Effective activation energies for the catalytic pyrolysis of corn stalk over Fe(4)/ZSM-5(40) were decreased to 146.47–299.63 kJ mol⁻¹ compared with non-catalyst.

The 16 variables used for classification included length of different wing veins or their parts and width of antennal segments. The sex was found to have some influence on the data and was included in the study as another input variable. Better and reliable classification was obtained when data from both the right and left wings were entered, the data from one wing were however found to be sufficient. The prediction success (correct identification of unknown test samples) varied from 88 to 100% throughout the study depending especially on the number of specimens in the training set. Classification of the studied Diptera species using ANN is possible assuming a sufficiently high number (tens) of specimens of each species is available for the ANN training. The methodology proposed is quite general and can be applied for all biological objects where it is possible to define adequate diagnostic characters and create the appropriate database.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTachina 3acase studies 3adatabases 3amorphometry 3aneural networks 3aparasitoids 3aprediction 3awings 0aartificial neural networks 0aspecies identification 0aDiptera 0aTachinidae 0aTachina 0aEctophasia 0aparasitoids1 aMuráriková, Natália1 aMalenovský, Igor1 aHavel, Josef0 tBiologia.g2007 Aug. 1, v. 62, no. 4 p.462-469dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-007-0089-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010900166520129500275592002801570650001501598650001501613650001501628650002001643650001301663650001301676650001701689650001301706650002101719650001401740650001001754650000701764650001301771650001601784650001901800653000701819653001901826653002401845700001401869700001701883700002001900700001601920700001701936700001501953773010901968856008502077852000902162655001202171IND60694057920221121022209.0200607e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069405792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1064572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Zheng10aUsing excess O3 to facilitate the NO2 absorption in a sulfite solution: Process conditions and mechanism  aExcess O₃ is invariably used to ensure the effective oxidation of NO in the industrial simultaneous desulfurization and denitration through combined ozone oxidation and absorbent scrubbing. O₃ is difficult to fully react with NO considering the short residence time of flue gas, remaining O₃ transport into the subsequent absorption device, and even its escape into the atmosphere. To study the influence of excess O₃ on NO₂ absorption in sulfite solution, we simulated an integrative process of pre-oxidation and post-absorption. NO₂ removal efficiency was improved from 36.1% to 66.5% as the mole ratio of O₃/NO increased from 1.0 to 1.6. Additionally, the effects of temperature, pH, and reactant concentration with the remaining O₃ on NO₂ removal were evaluated. After 5 h of steady absorption, the concentration of total N species in the adsorbent was 82.8 mmol/L at a O₃/NO mole ratio = 1.6. However, this concentration was only 51.4 mmol/L at a O₃/NO mole ratio = 1.0, indicating that more NO₂ was absorbed, and the gas-liquid transfer of NO₂ was enhanced by the excess O₃ via oxidizing NO₂⁻ into NO₃⁻. This work contributes to re-utilizing remaining O₃ and reducing O₃ escape in simultaneous desulfurization and denitration technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3adesulfurization 3aflue gas 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3aozone 3apH 3asulfites 3atemperature 3atotal nitrogen 0aO3 0aNO2 absorption 0aGas-liquid transfer1 aGuo, Lina1 aZhang, Shule1 aXiong, Yongheng1 aMeng, Fanyu1 aZeng, Yiqing1 aZhong, Qin0 tFuel processing technology.g2020 Sept., v. 206 p.106457-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1064573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01962naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012200166300001600288520077300304592002801077650001101105650001301116650001501129650001501144650002001159650001901179650000901198650002701207650001401234650002001248650002501268650001601293700001901309700002201328700001901350773010501369856008101474852000901555655001201564IND50089578720221123005039.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008957872DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-013-0139-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yi-Chun10aIsolation and characterization of 18 microsatellite loci for an endangered fresh water crocodile Tomistoma schlegelii  ap. 495-498.  aTomistoma schlegelii is an endangered crocodilian with an adult population size less than 2,500 individuals. To make appropriate in situ and ex situ conservation strategies, it is essential to perform parentage assignment for breeding captive populations and to conduct population study in wild populations based on genetic data. However, there is no suitable genetic marker available for T. schlegelii. Here, we reported 18 novel microsatellite loci from the tomistoma. Allele numbers of these loci ranged from 2 to 16, and their observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.105 to 0.684. The probability for excluding false parental pairs using the 18 loci was 99.9999 %. These markers are useful not only in parentage assignment but also in population structure analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abreeding 3acrocodiles 3afreshwater 3agenetic markers 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3aprobability1 aLi, Shou-Hsien1 aChang, Ming-Hsung1 aChen, Szu-Lung0 tConservation genetics resources.g2014 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.495-498dSpringer-Verlagx1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-013-0139-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245011700170300002000287520129700307650001901604650001301623650002501636650002101661650001901682650000901701650001501710650001501725650001001740650002001750650001601770650001501786650001101801650001001812650002101822650002601843650000901869700002601878700001901904700002301923700002601946700002201972700003301994700001802027700001802045700002402063700002002087700002202107700002302129700001902152700001702171700001502188700002002203773016402223856004702387852000902434655001202443IND60519657020221121003458.0160509e20151223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051965702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b041192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonissen, Gunther10aMycotoxins Deoxynivalenol and Fumonisins Alter the Extrinsic Component of Intestinal Barrier in Broiler Chickens  ap. 10846-10855.  aDeoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins (FBs) are secondary metabolites produced by Fusarium fungi that frequently contaminate broiler feed. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of DON and/or FBs on the intestinal barrier in broiler chickens, more specifically on the mucus layer and antioxidative response to oxidative stress. One-day-old broiler chicks were divided into four groups, each consisting of eight pens of seven birds each, and were fed for 15 days either a control diet, a DON-contaminated diet (4.6 mg DON/kg feed), a FBs-contaminated diet (25.4 mg FB1 + FB2/kg feed), or a DON+FBs-contaminated diet (4.3 mg DON and 22.9 mg FB1 + FB2/kg feed). DON and FBs affected the duodenal mucus layer by suppressing intestinal mucin (MUC) 2 gene expression and altering the mucin monosaccharide composition. Both mycotoxins decreased gene expression of the intestinal zinc transporter (ZnT)-1 and regulated intracellular methionine homeostasis, which are both important for preserving the cell’s critical antioxidant activity. Feeding a DON- and/or FBs-contaminated diet, at concentrations close to the European Union maximum guidance levels (5 mg DON and 20 mg FB1 + FB2/kg feed) changes the intestinal mucus layer and several intestinal epithelial antioxidative mechanisms. 3aEuropean Union 3aFusarium 3aantioxidant activity 3abroiler chickens 3adeoxynivalenol 3adiet 3aepithelium 3afumonisins 3afungi 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3amethionine 3amucins 3amucus 3aoxidative stress 3asecondary metabolites 3azinc1 aVan Immerseel, Filip,1 aPasmans, Frank1 aDucatelle, Richard1 aJanssens, Geert P.

To better understand the genetic basis of cold tolerance in wheat, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of low-temperature tolerance at the seedling stage. A total of 543 accessions were genotyped by high-density 90K Illumina iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, based on phenotypic tests in six environments. We detected 63 loci including 76 significant SNPs associated with cold resistance. These significant SNPs were scattered over 18 chromosomes, which associated with 361 unique candidate genes. Furthermore, by combining transcriptome and GWAS analysis, we additionally identified 85 candidate genes related to cold resistance. These results offer new insights into the genetic basis of cold tolerance, and the linkage markers generated in this study should contribute to molecular-assisted breeding of cold tolerance in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0100600cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a17966314DcHebei Basic Key Research Program 3aTriticum aestivum 3acold tolerance 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3aseedlings 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atemperature 3atranscriptome 3awheat1 aLi, Jiahao1 aZhao, Ruiling1 aXu, Ke1 aXiao, Yirao1 aZhang, Shuhua1 aTian, Jichun1 aYang, Xueju0 tMolecular breeding.g2020 Apr., v. 40, no. 4 p.36-36dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-020-01115-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008000166300001600246520163500262536047801897592002802375650002302403650002102426650002302447650001002470650001302480650001602493650001402509650001602523650001302539650001402552650001402566650002602580650001302606650001802619650001302637650002402650650001002674650000902684650001402693650002302707653002302730653001902753653001702772653002202789653001002811773010602821856008002927852000903007655001203016IND60614975220221122050819.0181003e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061497522DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858124461482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattison, A. L.10aSubcuticular Urate Accumulation in an American Lobster (Homarus americanus)  ap. 451-456.  aAn unusually “lumpy” lobster, Homarus americanus, was presented to the Atlantic Veterinary College Lobster Science Centre for evaluation. The lobster was weak with numerous pale, raised, and flat areas (diameter, 3–15 mm) on the exoskeleton, some of which were ulcerated. On postmortem examination, the pale areas corresponded to accumulations of viscous to free-flowing white material, which was found in only the subcuticular connective tissues. No internal organs were affected. Direct light examination of nonstained impression smears of the material showed abundant crystals resembling uric acid, amorphous urates, and sodium urate, which were readily soluble in 1 M potassium hydroxide. Wright-Giemsa stained imprints showed numerous fine, rounded, nonstaining granules free in the background and within individual round cells. Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of urates or mixed urate salts. Hemolymph plasma urea (1.7 mmol/liter) and uric acid (287 μmol/liter) concentrations were slightly higher than those seen with 36-hour emersion. Histologic sections showed aggregates of vacuolated mononuclear cells in the loose subcuticular connective tissue occasionally infiltrating between underlying muscle fibers. Grossly visible urate deposits are occasionally documented in land crabs and rarely reported in the blue crab; none, however, are associated with deformation of the cuticle. Possible etiologies include increased uric acid intake or production or decreased excretion. Anecdotal reports of similarly affected lobsters have been received but are intermittent and undocumented.  aFunding The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for the Atlantic Lobster Moult and Quality project delivered by the AVC Lobster Science Centre represents a consortium of private sector companies, fishermen’s organisations, First Nations and provincial and federal government agencies, including the Atlantic Innovation Fund through the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomarus americanus 3aanimal pathology 3aconnective tissues 3acrabs 3acrystals 3adeformation 3aexcretion 3aexoskeleton 3agranules 3ahemolymph 3ahistology 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alobsters 3amuscle fibers 3anecropsy 3apotassium hydroxide 3asalts 3aurea 3auric acid 3aveterinary schools 0aHomarus americanus 0aclawed lobster 0asubcuticular 0aconnective tissue 0aurate0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 50, no. 3 p.451-456dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858124461483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012700163300001400290520131200304592002801616650001501644650001901659650001401678650002301692650001401715650001301729650002101742650001301763650001301776650001301789650001101802650002001813650003401833653001401867653001201881653004301893700001601936700001601952700005401968700005302022700002002075773009902095856008302194852000902277655001202286IND60686399320221120064055.0200621e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068639932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zifei10aTetramethylammonium neodecanoate as a recyclable catalyst for acidolysis reaction of epichlorohydrin with neodecanoic acid  ap. 44-51.  aThe acidolysis of epoxides is an important series reaction applied in the polymer industry including coating and rubber. Glycidyl neodecanoate, which is a green material of environmentally friendly coatings, is synthesized through the acidolysis reaction of epichlorohydrin (ECH) with neodecanoic acid. We developed a green catalyst named tetramethylammonium neodecanoate (TMAN) for this reaction. TMAN is totally recyclable and the reaction system can be homogeneous, thus combining the advantages of tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium salts, meanwhile eliminating their drawbacks. Comparing with tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC) which is a traditional industrial catalyst, the amount of side product dichlorohydrin can be reduced by more than 50%, effective utilization of ECH and yield of the main product can be increased by 5% and 2% respectively, and the reaction time can be reduced by 20% or more. We suggested a main catalytic reaction network including the conversion of TMAN to TMAC at the late stage of the reaction, and TMAC can be easily recycled and reused to prepare TMAN. More importantly, after the replacement of material acid and the carboxylic anion of catalyst, this efficient catalytic system and the mechanism network can be applied to other acidolysis reactions of epoxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidolysis 3aammonium salts 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achlorides 3acoatings 3aepichlorohydrins 3aepoxides 3aindustry 3apolymers 3arubber 3atertiary amines 3atetramethylammonium compounds 0aCatalysis 0aEpoxide 0aAcidolysis reaction of epichlorohydrin1 aHu, Yunpeng1 aDu, Chencan1 aDeng, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5053-67651 aWang, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0873-64211 aLuo, Guangsheng0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 May, v. 385 p.44-51dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245014000161300001400301520130600315592002801621650001901649650002001668650001401688650001101702650003001713650001501743650001101758650001301769650001001782650001101792650001301803650001901816650001901835650001801854653001801872653003101890653002201921653002901943700001501972700001701987700001502004700001902019700001802038773009902056856008302155852000902238655001202247IND60686399420221120053024.0200621e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068639942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Min10aUltra stable multinuclear metal complexes as homogeneous catalysts for visible-light driven syngas production from pure and diluted CO2  ap. 70-75.  aFor high reactivity but poor stability of homogeneous metal complexes in CO₂ photoreduction, development of durable systems is still a big challenge. Herein, pentanuclear Co(II) complex [Co₅(btz)₆(NO₃)₄(H₂O)₄] (1, btz = benzotriazolate) is explored for converting CO₂ to syngas which shows high stability and reactivity in both pure and diluted CO₂. Compared with mononuclear structure, multinuclear complex exhibits 212-fold enhancement in reactivity, up to ~2748 TONs, with wide adjustability of H₂/CO ratio from 16:1 to 2:1. This reactivity could be maintained over 200 h which is an order of magnitude higher than the durability of mononuclear complex and exceeds most reported homogeneous molecular catalysts. High reactivity is also achieved in extreme low CO₂ content (5%). Structural analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support that multinuclear structure and the low energy barrier for photocatalytic intermediate may account for the durable and efficient performance of complex 1. The multinuclear strategy is also adopted to nickel complex. This work probes origin of metal-node-dependent performance for CO₂ photoreduction, providing new insights in design of durable and efficient metal complexes for photocatalysis and other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3adensity functional theory 3adurability 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3alight 3anickel 3anitrates 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoreduction 3asynthesis gas 0aCO2 reduction 0aMultinuclear metal complex 0aSyngas production 0aTransition-metal complex1 aWang, Cong1 aSun, Chun-Yi1 aZhang, Min1 aWang, Xin-Long1 aSu, Zhong-Min0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 May, v. 385 p.70-75dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245007800175300001600253520115300269592002801422650001301450650002301463650001201486650001301498650001201511650001001523650001901533650002601552650001401578650001101592650000901603650001401612650001101626650000901637650001601646650001301662700002301675700002301698773009601721856004801817852000901865655001201874IND50074030920221120023838.0140316e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007403092DNAL7 a10.1134/S106422931403003X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobrovol’skaya, T.

Each of the ecological factors that prevent the decomposition of the high-moor peat by different groups of microorganisms is considered. The acid reaction, low temperatures, and lack of nutrients were found not to be the primary factors inhibiting the destruction of the peat. The limited content of oxygen in the peatbogs leads to a drastic decrease in the number of mycelial microorganisms and a reduction of the activity of hydrolytic and oxidizing enzymes. The main factor inhibiting the decomposition of sphagnum is its mechanical and chemical stability, since animals crushing sphagnum are absent in the soil, and this moss has polysaccharides of special composition. The toxicity of phenol compounds, which is manifested under the aerobic conditions, prevents the activity of all the hydrolytic enzymes. This is the main reason for the slow decomposition of sphagnum peat and the long-term preservation of the residues of bodies and food in high-moor peatlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3aaerobic conditions 3aanimals 3acrushing 3aenzymes 3afoods 3amicroorganisms 3amosses and liverworts 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aphenol 3asoil 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aGolovchenko, A.

During the investigation, a total of 31 V. vulnificus strains were isolated from seafood (n = 17) and environmental water samples (n = 14) until the cold‐water seasons (November and December). Among the 31 isolates, 24 strains proved resistant to at least one of the eight tested classes of antibiotics and 13 multidrug resistant strains were detected from it. Interestingly, the environmental isolates showed significantly higher resistance than the seafood isolate, as shown by the diameters of the inhibition zones in three antibiotic classes: cephems, aminoglycosides and folate pathway inhibitors. Therefore, the presence and antibiotic resistance of V. vulnificus should be monitored throughout the year, including the cold‐water seasons, in order to properly protect human health. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Even though raw seafoods, oysters in particular, are known to harbor Vibrio vulnificus and are frequent sources of human infection, the presence of this pathogen in Korean seafood has been relatively less well documented. In this study, we detected high percentages of antibiotic resistance, as well as the presence of V. vulnificus in seafood and environmental waters including the cold‐water seasons. These data can be used in risk assessment protocols designed to establish safety in seafood against V. vulnificus in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aestuarine fish 3afolic acid 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aoysters 3apathogens 3araw seafoods 3arisk assessment 3aKorean Peninsula1 aCHORESCA JR, CASIANO H.1 aSHIN, SANG PHIL1 aHAN, JEE EUN1 aJUN, JIN WOO1 aPARK, SE CHANG0 tJournal of food safety.g2011 Nov., v. 31, no. 4 p.518-524dBlackwell Publishing Incx0149-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4565.2011.00329.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01422naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013900175300001600314520054300330592002800873650001200901650000900913650001800922650001600940700002200956773007300978856008401051852000901135655001201144IND60096537620221117234251.0141104e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009653762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatin, Meisam Habibi10aEntropy generation analysis of heat and mass transfer in mixed electrokinetically and pressure driven flow through a slit microchannel  ap. 207-217.  aThe entropy generation analysis of heat and mass transfer in a slit microchannel is performed in this study.

Countries have to report their annual emissions, which are usually calculated by using the default value of 0.3 for FracLEACH, a factor that represents the fraction of nitrogen losses compared to total nitrogen inputs and sources. In our study we used 22 lysimeters, covering a wide range of soils, climatic conditions and management practices in Austria, to evaluate nitrogen losses through leaching and to calculate FracLEACH. The terms of the nitrogen mass balance of the lysimeters were directly measured for several years. Both grassland and arable land plots gave significantly smaller values of FracLEACHthan the default value. For grassland, FracLEACHvalues of only 0.02 were found which varied very little over the entire observation period. For arable sites, FracLEACHvalues were higher (around 0.25) and showed significant variability between years due to variations in crop rotation, fertilization rates, and yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3aclimatic factors 3acrop rotation 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aleaching 3alysimeters 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrous oxide 3arunoff 3aAustria1 aBlöschl, Günter1 aFeichtinger, Franz1 aHerndl, Markus1 aKlammler, Gernot1 aHösch, Johannes1 aErhart, Eva1 aStrauss, Peter0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2015 Apr., v. 101, no. 3 p.351-364dSpringer-Verlagx1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-015-9682-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010900172300001600281520108700297592002801384650002301412650001201435650001101447650001901458650002201477650001101499650001901510650001201529650002901541650002201570650001101592650001701603700001601620700002001636773007301656856008401729852000901813655001201822IND60096537720221117234305.0141104e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009653772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemet, Gregory F.10aModeling the future costs of carbon capture using experts' elicited probabilities under policy scenarios  ap. 218-228.  aWe use expert elicitations of energy penalties and literature-derived estimates of basic cost parameters to model the future costs of 7 types of carbon capture technology applied to coal power plants. We conduct extensive sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of various parameters on additional levelized electricity costs ($/MWh) and costs of avoided CO₂ emissions ($/tCO₂) in 2025. Although the expert elicitation of energy penalties under various policy conditions spans a considerable range, we find that costs are more sensitive to assumptions about overnight capital costs and discounting. We run Monte Carlo simulations to specify a distribution of the minimum costs of capture across these 7 technologies and find that in 74% of cases, the minimum cost of capture is determined by one of three technologies. Despite these concentrated outcomes, we see benefits to technology portfolio diversification in that a full portfolio of technologies approximately doubles the likelihood of achieving a $60/tCO₂ cost target versus focusing on a single capture technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acapital 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apower plants1 aBaker, Erin1 aJenni, Karen E.0 tEnergy.g2013 July 1, v. 56 p.218-228dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008100168300001600249520120400265592002801469650001901497650001901516650003101535650002301566650001901589650001801608650001301626650001901639650001401658650001501672650002001687650001501707650000901722650002701731700002401758773011001782856008101892852000901973655001201982IND60123838520221120175238.0150407e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012383852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-015-9683-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRütting, Tobias10aNitrogen cycle responses to elevated CO2 depend on ecosystem nutrient status  ap. 285-294.  aNitrogen (N) limitation of terrestrial ecosystems is a crucial factor for predicting how these ecosystems respond and feedback to climate change. Nitrogen availability for plants in terrestrial ecosystems depends on the internal soil N cycle and inputs to the ecosystem via biological N₂fixation. We reviewed the effect of elevated atmospheric CO₂concentrations (eCO₂) on gross soil N transformations to advance our understanding of ecosystem responses to eCO₂. Overall, neither gross mineralization nor gross nitrification was altered by eCO₂. However, emerging from ecosystem specific analysis, we propose a new conceptual model for eCO₂effects on gross mineralization based on ecosystem nutrient status: gross mineralization is only stimulated in N limited ecosystems, but unaffected in phosphorus limited ecosystems. Moreover, the ratio of ammonium oxidation to immobilization is decreased under eCO₂, indicating a tighter N cycle with reduced ecosystem N losses. This new conceptual model on N cycle responses to eCO₂should be tested in the future in independent experiments and it provides a new concept for refining mechanistic models of ecosystem responses to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3amechanistic models 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3aplants (botany) 3aprediction 3asoil 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aAndresen, Louise C.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2015 Apr., v. 101, no. 3 p.285-294dSpringer-Verlagx1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-015-9683-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245004700213300001800260506007600278520086900354592002801223506003701251650001901288650001901307650001601326650001001342650001001352650001901362650001301381650001501394653000901409653000901418653000801427653001001435653002601445653002201471653002201493653002501515653000801540653001001548700002401558773012201582856008501704852000901789655001201798IND60554270520221207091722.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055427052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.02.0192doi7 aPMC51415142pmcid7 a269234332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMather, Kieren J.10aImaging of myocardial fatty acid oxidation  ap. 1535-1543.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMyocardial fuel selection is a key feature of the health and function of the heart, with clear links between myocardial function and fuel selection and important impacts of fuel selection on ischemia tolerance. Radiopharmaceuticals provide uniquely valuable tools for in vivo, non-invasive assessment of these aspects of cardiac function and metabolism.

However, they suffer low aerodynamic efficiency and consequently low power produced. It is proposed to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of Wells turbines by optimizing the blade pitch angle. A fully automated optimization algorithm is implemented in the present work. Two different airfoil geometries are numerically investigated; the standard NACA 0021 and an airfoil with optimized profile “AOP”. Optimization results show that self pitch control of Wells turbines can substantially improve the turbine efficiency while slightly delaying the turbine starting point. The optimum blade pitch angle depends on airfoil geometry and turbine solidity. Up to 2.3% increase in NACA 0021 turbine efficiency and 6.3% improvement of AOP efficiency are achieved by optimizing the blade pitch angle. Self pitch control is feasible for improving Wells turbine efficiency, especially with the application of inlet guide vanes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy conversion 3aturbines 3avanes 3awater power1 aShaaban, S.0 tEnergy.g2013 July 1, v. 56 p.229-239dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002600188245009600214300001600310506007600326520156700402592002801969506003701997650004902034650001502083650002302098650002702121650001702148650001502165700001802180700002302198700001902221773010002240856008102340852000902421655001202430IND60119842920221207065822.0150427e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011984292DNAL7 a248592172pmid7 aPMC42843802pmcid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1895-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardwick, Laura J.

The correlation between cell cycle lengthening and differentiation has been reported across several types of cell lineage and from diverse model organisms, both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, different cell fates might be determined during different phases of the preceding cell cycle, indicating direct cell cycle influences on both early lineage commitment and terminal cell fate decisions. Significant advances have been made in the last decade and have revealed multi-directional interactions between the molecular machinery regulating the processes of cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Here, we first introduce the modes of proliferation in neural progenitor cells and summarise evidence linking cell cycle length and neuronal differentiation. Second, we describe the manner in which components of the cell cycle machinery can have additional and, sometimes, cell-cycle-independent roles in directly regulating neurogenesis. Finally, we discuss the way that differentiation factors, such as proneural bHLH proteins, can promote either progenitor maintenance or differentiation according to the cellular environment. These intricate connections contribute to precise coordination and the ultimate division versus differentiation decision.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acentral nervous system 3aneurogenesis 3astem cells1 aAli, Fahad R.1 aAzzarelli, Roberta1 aPhilpott, Anna0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 Jan., v. 359, no. 1 p.187-200dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1895-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002300176245009300199300001500292520104800307592002801355650002401383650002501407650000901432650001801441650002001459650001901479650001101498650001401509700002801523700002201551700002201573773015101595856006901746856010301815990002301918852000901941655001201950IND60643537720221120115121.0190510e20140621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064353772DNAL7 a10.3791/515962doi7 aPMC42033062pmcid7 a249991082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, Jessica R.10aDissection and downstream analysis of zebra finch embryos at early stages of development  ap. e51596.  aThe zebra finch (Taeniopygiaguttata) has become an increasingly important model organism in many areas of research including toxicology1,2, behavior3, and memory and learning4,5,6. As the only songbird with a sequenced genome, the zebra finch has great potential for use in developmental studies; however, the early stages of zebra finch development have not been well studied. Lack of research in zebra finch development can be attributed to the difficulty of dissecting the small egg and embryo. The following dissection method minimizes embryonic tissue damage, which allows for investigation of morphology and gene expression at all stages of embryonic development. This permits both bright field and fluorescence quality imaging of embryos, use in molecular procedures such as in situ hybridization (ISH), cell proliferation assays, and RNA extraction for quantitative assays such as quantitative real-time PCR (qtRT-PCR). This technique allows investigators to study early stages of development that were previously difficult to access.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3adevelopmental stages 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3aimage analysis 3amemory 3asongbirds1 aStanciauskas, Monika E.1 aAralere, Tejas S.1 aSaha, Margaret S.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 June 21, , no. 88 p.e51596-e51596dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/515963Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51596/dissection-downstream-analysis-zebra-finch-embryos-at-early-stages  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245006200187300001600249500001500265520150200280592002801782650002601810650001601836650002701852650001501879650001201894650002001906650001601926650002901942650001301971650001501984650002101999653001302020700002002033773010002053856008102153852000902234655001202243IND60119843120221119040540.0150427e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011984312DNAL7 a248943272pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1909-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReiprich, Simone10aFrom CNS stem cells to neurons and glia: Sox for everyone  ap. 111-124.  a2019-12-04  aNeuroepithelial precursor cells of the vertebrate central nervous system either self-renew or differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes or astrocytes under the influence of a gene regulatory network that consists in transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers and microRNAs. Sox transcription factors are central to this regulatory network, especially members of the SoxB, SoxC, SoxD, SoxE and SoxF groups. These Sox proteins are widely expressed in neuroepithelial precursor cells and in newly specified, differentiating and mature neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and influence their identity, survival and development. They exert their effect predominantly at the transcriptional level but also have substantial impact on expression at the epigenetic and posttranscriptional levels with some Sox proteins acting as pioneer factors, recruiting chromatin-modifying and -remodelling complexes or influencing microRNA expression. They interact with a large variety of other transcription factors and influence the expression of regulatory molecules and effector genes in a cell-type-specific and temporally controlled manner. As versatile regulators with context-dependent functions, they are not only indispensable for central nervous system development but might also be instrumental for the development of reprogramming and cell conversion strategies for replacement therapies and for assisted regeneration after injury or degeneration-induced cell loss in the central nervous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3aepigenetics 3acentral nervous system 3aastrocytes 3aneurons 3aregulator genes 3avertebrates 3atranscription (genetics) 3amicroRNA 3astem cells 3aneurodevelopment 0aproteins1 aWegner, Michael0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 Jan., v. 359, no. 1 p.111-124dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1909-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012800171300001400299520150100313592002801814650001001842650001601852650002001868650001701888650001201905650002101917650001901938650001901957650002101976650001401997650001002011650003302021650001302054650002002067653002002087653000702107653001402114653001702128653001002145700001702155700001802172700001602190700001802206773011702224856008802341852000902429655001202438IND60637918120221122031818.0190906e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063791812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.2712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Weiwei10aInvestigation of the fouling behaviors correlating to water characteristics during the ultrafiltration with ozone treatment  ap. 53-61.  aThis study investigated the fouling behavior and mechanism of ozone treatment correlating to water characteristics for micro-polluted water during ultrafiltration (UF). The results indicated that pre-ozonation efficiently mitigated membrane fouling of natural organic matter (NOM). The higher ozone doses were, the more the performance transmembrane pressures (TMPs) decreased. Ozone mainly converted macro molecule organics into low molecule organics. Macro molecular biopolymers (BP) can be removed up to 35.5% with an ozone treatment of 9 mg/L, while low molecular weight building blocks of acids and humics (BB) and neutrals (LMWN) increased 7.25% and 14.62%, respectively, with an ozone treatment of 9 mg/L. Analysis of fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) indicated that ozone mainly removed soluble microbial organics and fulvic-like and humic-like organics but not tyrosine organics. Hydrophobic organics (HPO) were reduced with an increase of ozone doses, especially macro molecular BP and humic substances (HS), and the neutral hydrophilic fraction (N-HPI) was enhanced. Ozone treatment helped to reduce the interception of BP and HS in HPO and improved the interception of BP and HS in N-HPI, as well as BB and LMWN, in both fractions. Principal component analysis suggested that BP, as well as UV254, had high correlations with a membrane fouling index, which can be used as the fouling indicator during ozone treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3abiopolymers 3afactor analysis 3afluorescence 3afouling 3ahumic substances 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3aozonation 3aozone 3aprincipal component analysis 3atyrosine 3aultrafiltration 0aUltrafiltration 0aFI 0aOxidation 0aEEMs-PARAFAC 0aHPSEC1 aLv, Weiguang1 aZhou, Wenzong1 aHu, Mengliu1 aDong, Bingzhi0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 676 p.53-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.2713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245013200209300001400341506007600355520117800431592002801609506003701637650001501674650002101689650001301710650000901723650001201732650001001744650001701754650001901771650001101790650001701801650002301818651001001841653002101851653002501872653001001897653002601907700001701933700001901950700006501969700001802034773009002052856008602142852000902228655001202237IND60635885820221207085221.0190628e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063588582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.03.0052doi7 aPMC65589932pmcid7 a312176602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChanna, Hira10aWhat drives smallholder farmers’ willingness to pay for a new farm technology? Evidence from an experimental auction in Kenya  ap. 64-71.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe use an incentive compatible experimental auction to measure demand for a new agricultural technology, a triple layered hermetic storage bag. When used properly, the bag creates an airtight seal that reduces storage loss from insect pests and neutralizes aflatoxin contamination in stored grain. We find that demand for this new technology is highly elastic (4.3) and that the wholesaler could increase profit by lowering the price. We also find that farmers’ valuation for the bag is not significantly different based on the medium through which information about it is communicated to them, either text, audio or video messages. This suggests that practitioners should use the cheapest option for disseminating information, which is text messaging in this context. In addition, we find that farmers who have prior awareness of the bag are willing to pay 20% more on average than those previously unaware of it. In total, the highly elastic demand for the improved bags, along with the fact that prior awareness of the bag leads to higher willingness to pay, suggests that a one-time price subsidy for the new technology could spur demand and increase future adoption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaflatoxins 3aairtight storage 3aauctions 3abags 3afarmers 3afarms 3ainsect pests 3aneutralization 3aprices 3astored grain 3awillingness to pay 3aKenya 0aHermetic storage 0aExperimental auction 0aKenya 0aMedium of information1 aChen, Amy Z.1 aPina, Patricia1 aRicker-Gilbert, Jacob1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9092-19161 aStein, Daniel0 tFood policy.g2019 May, v. 85 p.64-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245016000210520120400370592002801574650001801602650002101620650002001641650001601661650002101677650001101698650001501709650002301724650003201747650002301779650001601802653001701818653002101835653004101856700001701897700001601914700001501930700001501945700001901960773011301979856008502092852000902177655001202186IND60686399820221119140455.0200516e20200524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068639982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4609532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3434-470410aHollow fiber-solid phase microextraction of phthalate esters from bottled water followed by flash evaporation gas chromatography-flame ionization detection  aA solid phase microextraction coupled with flash evaporation gas chromatography method was applied to the determination of phthalate esters (PAEs). Polysulfone (PSF) hollow fiber at 1 cm length was employed as extraction element to adsorb PAEs directly. Predominant parameters including stirring velocity, salt concentration, extraction time and extraction temperature were optimized. PSF fiber with absorbed PAEs was put into a small sample cup. The extracted analytes were thermally desorbed at 300 °C in a pyrolyzer, and then entered into a column for separation. The linearity of the method was satisfactory over a concentration range of 2–1000 µg/L with the correlation coefficients r>0.99 for all analytes except dimethoxyethyl phthalate. The relative standard deviations for peak areas were below 9.5% (n = 6). The developed technique achieved high enrichment factors (280–9930 times) and low limits of detection (0.001–0.130 µg/L). The recoveries over the range of 87.0–117.7% were obtained by analyzing real spiked samples. The results demonstrated that this was a simple, environmentally friendly and accurate method for the determination of PAEs in bottled water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottled water 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3aevaporation 3aflame ionization 3amixing 3aphthalates 3asalt concentration 3asolid phase microextraction 3astandard deviation 3atemperature 0aHollow fiber 0aPhthalate esters 0aFlash evaporation gas chromatography1 aTu, Chaochao1 aLiu, Huijun1 aWang, Lili1 aZhu, Zuoyi1 aWatanabe, Ichi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 May 24, v. 1619 p.460953-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4609533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04173naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100007000155245012700225520187200352592002802224650002302252650002002275650001202295650001602307650001402323650001102337650001402348650001102362650002502373650001702398650002202415650001502437650001202452650002102464651001102485653001902496653001502515653001802530653001202548653001102560653000702571653000702578653000702585653000702592653000702599653000702606653000702613653000702620653000702627653000702634653000702641653000702648653000702655653000802662653000902670653000902679653000902688653000702697653000802704653000802712653000802720653000802728653000702736653000802743653000702751653000802758653000702766653000702773653000802780653000702788700006502795700006002860700002202920700006602942700007003008700002703078773009103105856009003196852000903286655001203295IND60770715920221121224820.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077071592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Hernández, Ixchel M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0480-765910aTrace element and lipidomic analysis of bottlenose dolphin blubber from the Yucatan coast: Lipid composition relationships  aBottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems where they are in continuous contact with multiple abiotic and biotic stressors in the environment. Due to their role as predators, they can bioaccumulate contaminants and are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems. The northern zonal coast of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico has a high incidence of anthropogenic activities. The principal objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) to determine the presence of trace metals and their correlation with lipids in bottlenose dolphin blubber, and 2) to use a lipidomics approach to characterize their biological responses. Levels of trace elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Pb) were analyzed using ICP-MS and lipids were measured using a targeted lipidomics approach with LC-MS/MS. Spearman correlation analysis was used to identify associations between lipids and trace elements. The influences of gender, stranding codes, presence of stomach content, growth stages and body length were also analyzed. Blubber lipid composition was dominated by triacylglycerols (TAG). Our results demonstrated the presence of heavy-metal elements such as Cd and As, which were correlated with different lipid species, mainly the ceramides and glycerophospholipids, respectively. Organisms with Cd showed lower concentrations of ceramides (CER, HCER and DCER), TAG and cholesteryl esters (CE). Trace elements Cr, Co, As and Cd increased proportionately with body length. This study provides a novel insight of lipidomic characterization and correlations with trace elements in the bottlenose dolphin which might contribute to having a better understanding of the physiological functions and the risks that anthropogenic activities can bring to sentinel organisms from coastal regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTursiops truncatus 3abioaccumulation 3ablubber 3abody length 3aceramides 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3agender 3aglycerophospholipids 3aheavy metals 3alipid composition 3alipidomics 3astomach 3atriacylglycerols 3aMexico 0aTrace elements 0aLipidomics 0aMarine mammal 0aBlubber 0aICP-MS 0aAl 0aCr 0aMn 0aFe 0aCo 0aNi 0aCu 0aZn 0aAs 0aSe 0aCd 0aPb 0aSM 0aCER 0aHCER 0aDCER 0aLCER 0aCE 0aTAG 0aDAG 0aMAG 0aLPC 0aPC 0aLPE 0aPE 0aLPG 0aPG 0aPI 0aLPS 0aPS1 aNouri, Mohammad-Zaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4506-15311 aKozuch, Marianne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3236-41271 aDenslow, Nancy D.1 aDíaz-Gamboa, Raúl E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6979-17581 aRodríguez-Canul, Rossanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0469-14891 aCollí-Dulá, Reyna C.0 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 299 p.134353-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001700176245014300193300001500336520206300351592002802414650003102442650001802473650001602491650002302507650002302530650003502553650001302588650001102601650001302612650001302625650001702638650003402655650003302689650001302722650001702735650001202752650001902764650002302783700001802806700001902824700001802843700001702861700002202878700002702900773015102927856006903078856010503147990002303252852000903275655001203284IND60643537820221120104710.0190510e20140430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064353782DNAL7 a10.3791/515972doi7 aPMC41844052pmcid7 a248365402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Ashim10aSurgical retrieval, isolation and In vitro expansion of human anterior cruciate ligament-derived cells for tissue engineering applications  ap. e51597.  aInjury to the ACL is a commonly encountered problem in active individuals. Even partial tears of this intra-articular knee ligament lead to biomechanical deficiencies that impair function and stability. Current options for the treatment of partial ACL tears range from nonoperative, conservative management to multiple surgical options, such as: thermal modification, single-bundle repair, complete reconstruction, and reconstruction of the damaged portion of the native ligament. Few studies, if any, have demonstrated any single method for management to be consistently superior, and in many cases patients continue to demonstrate persistent instability and other comorbidities. The goal of this study is to identify a potential cell source for utilization in the development of a tissue engineered patch that could be implemented in the repair of a partially torn ACL. A novel protocol was developed for the expansion of cells derived from patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. To isolate the cells, minced hACL tissue obtained during ACL reconstruction was digested in a Collagenase solution. Expansion was performed using DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). The cells were then stored at -80 ºC or in liquid nitrogen in a freezing medium consisting of DMSO, FBS and the expansion medium. After thawing, the hACL derived cells were then seeded onto a tissue engineered scaffold, PLAGA (Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid) and control Tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). After 7 days, SEM was performed to compare cellular adhesion to the PLAGA versus the control TCPS. Cellular morphology was evaluated using immunofluorescence staining. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) micrographs demonstrated that cells grew and adhered on both PLAGA and TCPS surfaces and were confluent over the entire surfaces by day 7. Immunofluorescence staining showed normal, non-stressed morphological patterns on both surfaces. This technique is promising for applications in ACL regeneration and reconstruction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanterior cruciate ligament 3acell adhesion 3acomorbidity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afetal bovine serum 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afreezing 3ahumans 3anitrogen 3apatients 3apolystyrenes 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astaining 3astreptomycin 3athawing 3atissue culture 3atissue engineering1 aSharif, Kevin1 aWalters, Megan1 aWoods, Mia D.1 aPotty, Anish1 aMain, Benjamin J.1 aEl-Amin III, Saadiq F.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Apr. 30, , no. 86 p.e51597-e51597dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/515973Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51597/surgical-retrieval-isolation-vitro-expansion-human-anterior-cruciate  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245012800185300001600313520176700329592002802096650001202124650001602136650001502152650001402167650001002181650002202191650001202213650001402225650001302239650001302252650001402265650001802279653002502297653002302322653001302345653001602358653001502374700003802389700002402427700002202451700003302473773011002506856008702616852000902703655001202712IND60576062520221120232931.0190408e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057606252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade-la-Fuente-Blanco, Arancha10aCross-modal interactions and effects of the level of expertise on the perception of bitterness and astringency of red wines  ap. 155-161.  aThe present study investigates the role of sensory interactions and the level of expertise of consumers on the perception of bitterness and astringency in a red wine complex matrix.In the first experiment, a commercial red wine was spiked with quinine sulphate to produce two levels of bitterness. Seven samples with high and seven with low bitterness were further spiked with one of the following aroma vectors: vegetal, herbal, spicy, roasted, animal, dried fruit or with tartaric acid to modulate sourness. In the second experiment, the wine was spiked with an astringent proanthocyanidin fraction to produce two levels of astringency and with one of the seven vectors used in the first experiment or with quinine sulphate to modulate bitterness. Fourteen and 16 spiked samples of experiments 1 and 2, respectively, were sensory evaluated together with control samples to assess the intensity of the six aroma vectors, sourness, bitterness and astringency. Evaluation was performed using a descriptive analysis technique based on intensity rating by three groups of participants with different levels of expertise. The effect of the addition of one aroma vector, sourness or bitterness on bitter or astringent intensity was evaluated by ANOVA.No significant effect of aroma, sourness or bitterness was observed for astringent intensity, confirming that in these red wines, cross-modal interactions are not relevant in astringency. Bitter-aroma interactions were demonstrated for animal aroma just for less-experienced consumers (novices) attributed to a hedonic synergism. Significant decreases in bitterness due to sour vector were observed regardless consumer expertise. This could be explained in terms of interactions at both cognitive and receptor level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aastringency 3abitterness 3acognition 3aodors 3aproanthocyanidins 3aquinine 3ared wines 3asourness 3asulfates 3asynergism 3atartaric acid 0aSensory interactions 0aLevel of expertise 0aRed wine 0aAstringency 0aBitterness1 aFernández-Zurbano, Purificación1 aValentin, Dominique1 aFerreira, Vicente1 aSáenz-Navajas, María-Pilar0 tFood quality and preference.g2017 Dec., v. 62 p.155-161dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245010200170520162700272592002801899650002501927650001701952650001801969650002301987650001402010650000902024653001702033653001702050653001402067653002202081653002302103700005402126700001502180700001702195700001902212700001902231700005302250700001602303773009102319856009002410852000902500655001202509IND60770716020221121212422.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077071602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, Binbin10aEnvironmental behaviors and degradation methods of microplastics in different environmental media  aMicroplastics, as a group of emerging contaminants, are widely present in environmental media and have the potential to endanger the ecological environment and human health. Due to the inconsistencies and difficulties inherent in the analysis of microplastic particles, global monitoring data on the distribution of microplastics in the environment are still far from sufficient. The fate and migration of microplastics in the environment are also uncertain. Therefore, there have been increasing reviews on the distribution, biological effects, migration, and health risks of microplastics. However, reports focusing on the degradation of microplastics are still rare. Understanding and commanding the environmental behavior of microplastics are of great significance to explore the treatment of microplastic pollution. Although some preliminary studies on microplastics have been carried out, there is still an urgent need to conduct a comprehensive study on environmental behaviors and degradation methods of microplastics in different environmental media. This article summarizes the recent advances on microplastics, basically includes the distribution and ecological impact of microplastics in soil and water environments, then elaborates the migration behavior and influencing factors of microplastics, and focuses on the research progress of microplastics degradation methods. On this basis, the problems existing in the current research and the future development directions have been proposed. This review could provide a more systematic reference for the development and research of microplastics in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3ahuman health 3amicroplastics 3amigratory behavior 3apollution 3asoil 0aMicroplastic 0aDistribution 0aMigration 0aBiological effect 0aDegradation method1 aWang, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2773-23701 aChen, Miao1 aLee, Xinqing1 aZhang, Xueyang1 aWang, Shengsen1 aYu, Zebin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5595-355X1 aWu, Panfeng0 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 299 p.134354-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008900170300001800259520096900277592002801246650000901274650001601283650002501299650002201324650001901346650000901365650000901374650001501383650001601398650002001414650002801434650001801462651000901480653001701489653004201506653001801548653002701566700003001593700002401623700001701647700002301664700002101687773012401708856008501832852000901917655001201926IND60672917320221119185523.0191017e20191003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291732DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2019.16599652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSihag, Parveen10aModelling of infiltration using artificial intelligence techniques in semi-arid Iran  ap. 1647-1658.  aInfiltration plays a fundamental role in streamflow, groundwater recharge, subsurface flow, and surface and subsurface water quality and quantity. In this study, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models were used to determine cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate in arid areas in Iran. The input data were sand, clay, silt, density of soil and soil moisture, while the output data were cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate, the latter measured using a double-ring infiltrometer at 16 locations. The results show that SVM with radial basis kernel function better estimated cumulative infiltration (RMSE = 0.2791 cm) compared to the other models. Also, SVM with M4 radial basis kernel function better estimated the infiltration rate (RMSE = 0.0633 cm/h) than the ANFIS and RF models. Thus, SVM was found to be the most suitable model for modelling infiltration in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3afuzzy logic 3agroundwater recharge 3ainfiltration rate 3ainfiltrometers 3asand 3asilt 3asoil water 3astream flow 3asubsurface flow 3asupport vector machines 3awater quality 3aIran 0ainfiltration 0aadaptive neuro fuzzy inference system 0arandom forest 0asupport vector machine1 aSingh, V.

This paper focuses on the segmentation of the subjects after such a task. An adaptation of the latent class segmentation, based on the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, to the multivariate nature of the data is developed, allowing the study of the dependencies between attributes. This technique is applied to a comparison between concert halls’ acoustics. The influence of context (type of music and position of the seat in the hall) on the preference for the concert halls is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aconsumer preferences 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3amusic 3asensory properties 0aMultivariate paired comparison 0aSegmentation 0aBradley model 0aConcert halls1 aCourcoux, Ph.1 aKuusinen, A.1 aLokki, T.0 tFood quality and preference.g2017 Dec., v. 62 p.120-127dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2016.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014300168300001300311520125900324592002801583650002001611650001901631650002401650650001401674650002601688650001801714650001701732650002201749650001801771700001701789700002301806773010801829856008101937852000902018655001202027IND60123839020221120170418.0150427e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012383902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-014-2244-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikryukov, V.

The operational taxonomic unit richness and evenness in the communities of both target groups decreased under contamination. The community structure of contaminated and control areas differed for SF, whereas they were similar for AMF. According to spatial structure analysis results on a scale of tens of meters, a gradual change of composition with distance was revealed for the SF community within 30-m intervals in the control sites. No spatial autocorrelation was found for AMF in the control sites. However, pronounced patchiness was characteristic of both SF and AMF communities within 10 m of contaminated sites. In the contaminated area, no specific spatial structure determinants of the studied communities was found among environmental factors such as water content, heavy metal concentrations in the forest litter, sample plot localization relative to canopy density, and herb vegetation diversity and abundance. However, in the control sites, AMF richness depended on herb abundance and litter chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aboreal forests 3acommunity structure 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest litter 3aheavy metals 3amycorrhizal fungi 3awater content1 aDulya, O.

Various studies have revealed that both biofilm and microbial secretion can exacerbate membrane fouling. Recently, we constructed a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) system for treating micro-polluted surface water in order to identify the primary cause for oxygen transfer rate (OTR) decline. It was found that microbial secretion had a more prominent negative effect than that caused by biofilm, as manifested by the fact the effect of microbial secretion (66.49%) was greater than the resistance of biofilm (38.83%). Fouling decreased the total pore volume of all membrane. The peak location of adsorption capacity was more likely to occur at smaller pore sizes with longer running time. Notably, continuous fluorescence distribution between the separating layer and pores like finger in MABR system exhibited an increasing trend with the operation time, indicating a gradual increase of microbial viability. Core protein structure was revealed by different bond peaks (0–90 d). Specifically, for different organic components of EPS, the hydrophilic HIS was the main content, while the mass transfer resistance caused by the gel increased, which reduced the contact angle and increased the bubble point pressure. Therefore, effects of EPS content and composition should be considered during the application of water treatment techniques based on MABR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaeration 3abiofilm 3acontact angle 3adecline 3afluorescence 3agels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amass transfer 3aoxygen 3aprotein structure 3asecretion 3asurface water 3aviability 3awater treatment 0aMembrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) 0aPore volume 0aOxygen transfer rate (OTR) 0aExtracellular polymeric substances (EPS) 0aMicrobial secretion1 aWu, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0691-78271 aRen, Le,1 aWang, Yue1 aWang, Yufeng1 aZhang, Hongwei0 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 299 p.134355-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013900177300001800316520092500334536013001259592002801389596011101417650001501528650002801543650001701571650002101588650002001609650002001629650001601649650001001665651001001675653003201685653003301717653001901750653002801769653001201797700003101809700001601840700002101856773012401877856008502001852000902086655001202095IND60672917620221119185334.0191017e20191003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067291762DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2019.16614172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezaie-Balf, Mohammad10aEnhancing streamflow forecasting using the augmenting ensemble procedure coupled machine learning models: case study of Aswan High Dam  ap. 1629-1646.  aThe potential of the most recent pre-processing tool, namely, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), is examined for providing AI models (artificial neural network, ANN; M5-model tree, M5-MT; and multivariate adaptive regression spline, MARS) with more informative input–output data and, thence, evaluate their forecasting accuracy. A 130-year inflow dataset for Aswan High Dam, Egypt, is considered for training, validating and testing the proposed models to forecast the reservoir inflow up to six months ahead. The results show that, after the pre-processing analysis, there is a significant enhancement in the forecasting accuracy.

The analytical technique can measure the generated carbon dioxide from the redox reaction between iodate and sodium oxalate in the presence of strong acid. The formed carbon dioxide from this reaction in a closed vial is measured by GC. It was observed that the redox reaction in the vial was completed in 40 min at 95 °C. The results indicated that this analytical technique is precise (RSD ≤ 2.69%) and accurate (relative errors ≤ 7.21%). The present approach is fast and simple, providing a robust avenue to the routine estimation of iodate in iodized salt in a wide variety of applications from processing to quality monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aiodates 3aiodized salt 3amonitoring 3aoxalates 3aredox reactions 3asodium 0aIodate 0aHeadspace gas chromatography 0aIodized edible salt 0aCarbon dioxide1 aYu, Kong-Xian1 aGong, Yi-Xian0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Jan. 11, v. 1584 p.187-191dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245014200179300001600321520150500337592002801842650001801870650002101888650002101909650002301930650002101953650001401974650001301988650002302001650004302024650001402067650001002081650001402091650003002105650001202135650002202147650000902169650001602178653002902194653001802223653001802241653002502259700002502284700002402309700002702333773012902360856008202489852000902571655001202580IND60576063020221122065650.0190408e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057606302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2017.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElayapillai, Sugantha Priya10aAmeliorative effect of α-tocopherol on polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) induced testicular Sertoli cell dysfunction in F1 prepuberal rats  ap. 681-694.  aThe study was conducted to investigate the protective role of α-tocopherol against polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) induced effect in Sertoli cell function of F1 prepuberal rats. Dams were grouped into six; each group consists of six animals. Group 1–control treated with corn oil as vehicle, group II- 0.5mgPCBs/kg bw/day, group III- 0.5mgPCBs/kg bw/day with α-tocopherol (50mg α-tocopherol/kg bw/day), group IV- 1mgPCBs/kg bwt/day, group V- 1mgPCBs/kg bw/day with α-tocopherol (50mg α-tocopherol/kg bw/day) and group VI − α-tocopherol alone treated orally from postpartum day1-20. Male offspring rats were euthanized on post natal day 21. Testes were collected for the histological examination and Sertoli cell isolation. The protein levels of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, androgen binding protein, androgen receptor, estrogen receptor α & β, Inhibin-β, transferrin, claudin-11, occludin, E-cadherin, connexin-43, c-fos, c-jun, SF1, USF1 & 2 were studied using western blot method. The testicular architecture was affected in the PCBs exposed rats but this effect was restored by α-tocopherol supplementation. PCBs decreased the protein levels of FSHR, AR, ABP, ERα & β, transferrin, claudin-11, occludin, E-cadherin, connexin-43, c-fos, c-jun, SF1, USF1 & 2 whereas inhibin-β protein level was found to be increased in Sertoli cells. These results suggested that α-tocopherol has ameliorative role against PCBs induced testicular Sertoli cell dysfunction in F1 progeny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSertoli cells 3aWestern blotting 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aandrogen receptors 3abinding proteins 3acadherins 3acorn oil 3aestrogen receptors 3afollicle-stimulating hormone receptors 3ahistology 3amales 3aoccludins 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aprogeny 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atransferrin 0aPolychlorinated biphenyl 0aα-tocopherol 0aSertoli cells 0aBlood testis barrier1 aTeekaraman, Dhanaraj1 aPaulraj, Raja Singh1 aJagadeesan, Arunakaran0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2017 Oct. 02, v. 69, no. 8 p.681-694dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2017.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245016800168300001600336520161200352592002801964650001401992650001002006650001402016650001202030650001502042650001502057650001702072650001702089650001502106650002002121650001102141650001802152650002002170651001102190653001602201653002802217653001602245653001402261653000902275653001702284700002002301700002102321700002602342773009402368856008402462852000902546655001202555IND60535586420221118062920.0190318e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053558642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavison, Jenny10aCaught in a ‘spiral’. Barriers to healthy eating and dietary health promotion needs from the perspective of unemployed young people and their service providers  ap. 146-154.  aThe number of young people in Europe who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) is increasing. Given that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds tend to have diets of poor nutritional quality, this exploratory study sought to understand barriers and facilitators to healthy eating and dietary health promotion needs of unemployed young people aged 16–20 years. Three focus group discussions were held with young people (n = 14). Six individual interviews and one paired interview with service providers (n = 7). Data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically content analysed. Themes were then fitted to social cognitive theory (SCT). Despite understanding of the principles of healthy eating, a ‘spiral’ of interrelated social, economic and associated psychological problems was perceived to render food and health of little value and low priority for the young people. The story related by the young people and corroborated by the service providers was of a lack of personal and vicarious experience with food. The proliferation and proximity of fast food outlets and the high perceived cost of ‘healthy’ compared to ‘junk’ food rendered the young people low in self-efficacy and perceived control to make healthier food choices. Agency was instead expressed through consumption of junk food and drugs. Both the young people and service providers agreed that for dietary health promotion efforts to succeed, social problems needed to be addressed and agency encouraged through (individual and collective) active engagement of the young people themselves.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3adrugs 3aeducation 3aelderly 3aemployment 3afast foods 3afood choices 3ahealthy diet 3ainterviews 3anutritive value 3apeople 3aself-efficacy 3asocial problems 3aEurope 0aFood choice 0aSocial Cognitive Theory 0aQualitative 0aInterview 0aNEET 0aYoung people1 aShare, Michelle1 aHennessy, Marita1 aKnox, Barbara Stewart0 tAppetite.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 85 p.146-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245006400157300002000221520191200241592002802153650001602181650001502197650003602212650002402248650001702272650003902289650001302328650002102341650002602362650002302388650001202411650001302423650002502436650002202461650002502483700005702508700001602565700001502581700001302596700005402609773014902663856007602812852000902888655001202897IND60679483020221118165312.0191228e20191127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067948302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b107052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Shuai10aControl of Protein Conformation and Orientation on Graphene  ap. 20335-20343.  aGraphene-based biosensors have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages of label-free detection and high sensitivity. Many such biosensors utilize noncovalent van der Waals force to attach proteins onto graphene surface while preserving graphene’s high conductivity. Maintaining the protein structure without denaturation/substantial conformational change and controlling proper protein orientation on the graphene surface are critical for biosensing applications of these biosensors fabricated with proteins on graphene. Based on the knowledge we obtained from our previous experimental study and computer modeling of amino acid residual level interactions between graphene and peptides, here we systemically redesigned an important protein for better conformational stability and desirable orientation on graphene. In this paper, immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody-binding domain of protein G (protein GB1) was studied to demonstrate how we can preserve the protein native structure and control the protein orientation on graphene surface by redesigning protein mutants. Various experimental tools including sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, attenuated total refection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy were used to study the protein GB1 structure on graphene, supplemented by molecular dynamics simulations. By carefully designing the protein GB1 mutant, we can avoid strong unfavorable interactions between protein and graphene to preserve protein conformation and to enable the protein to adopt a preferred orientation. The methodology developed in this study is general and can be applied to study different proteins on graphene and beyond. With the knowledge obtained from this research, one could apply this method to optimize protein function on surfaces (e.g., to enhance biosensor sensitivity).  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abiosensors 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomputer simulation 3adenaturation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agraphene 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3apeptides 3aprotein conformation 3asimulation models 3avan der Waals forces1 aZou, Xingquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9716-97711 aTian, Jiayi1 aHuang, Hao1 aGuo, Wen1 aChen, Zhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8687-83480 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Nov. 27, v. 141, no. 51 p.20335-20343dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b107053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245008200173520140300255592002801658650001101686650002101697650001501718650001501733650001901748650001401767650001701781650001001798650001601808650002101824650001201845650001801857650001001875650001701885650001501902653002401917653002701941653002701968653000801995653000802003653000802011653002202019700002702041700002002068700001902088700002002107700005802127700002102185700002402206700002502230700002002255700006202275700005702337773009102394856009002485852000902575655001202584IND60770716520221121101905.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077071652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabiee, Navid10aSynthesis of green benzamide-decorated UiO-66-NH2 for biomedical applications  aMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) biocompatible systems can host enzymes/bacteria/viruses. Herein we synthesized a series of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)-decorated UiO-66-NH₂ based on Citrus tangerine leaf extract for drug delivery and biosensor applications. Five chemically manipulated FAAH-like benzamides were localized on the UiO-66-NH₂ surface with physical interactions. Comprehensive cellular and molecular analyses were conducted on HEK-293, HeLa, HepG2, PC12, MCF-7, and HT-29 cell lines (cytotoxicity assessment after 24 and 48 h). MTT results proved above 95 and 50% relative cell viability in the absence and presence of the drug, respectively. A complete targeted drug-releasing capability of nanocarriers was demonstrated after capping with leaf extract from Citrus tangerine, with a stimuli-responsive effect in acidic media. Targeted delivery was complete to the nucleus and cytoplasm of HT-29 cell, but merely to the cytoplasm of HeLa cell lines. Nanocarrier could be targeted for drug delivery to the cytoplasm of the HeLa cell line and to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HT-29 cell lines. MOF-based nanocarriers proved authentic in vivo towards kidney and liver tissues with targeted cancerous cells efficiently. Besides, FAAH-like molecules revealed optical biosensor potential with high selectivity (even ˂5 nM LOD) towards ssDNA, sgRNA, and Anti-cas9 proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aamide hydrolases 3abenzamides 3abiosensors 3acell viability 3acytoplasm 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3afatty acids 3ahuman cell lines 3akidneys 3aleaf extracts 3aliver 3ananocarriers 3atangerines 0aFAAH-Like molecules 0aTargeted drug delivery 0aFluorescence biosensor 0aDNA 0aRNA 0aMOF 0aAnti-cas9 protein1 aGhadiri, Amir Mohammad1 aAlinezhad, Vida1 aSedaghat, Anna1 aAhmadi, Sepideh1 aFatahi, Yousef1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0374-21411 aMakvandi, Pooyan1 aSaeb, Mohammad Reza1 aBagherzadeh, Mojtaba1 aAsadnia, Mohsen1 aVarma, Rajender S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9731-62281 aLima, Eder C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8734-12080 tChemosphere.g2022 July, v. 299 p.134359-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1343593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04298naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024004100132040001800173100001600191245011800207300001600325506002800341506003600369506007600405506003100481520180500512592002802317596018402345506003702529650001902566650001702585650001402602650002402616650001502640650001002655650001302665650001602678650001702694650001602711650001302727650002602740650001302766650002402779650002502803650002002828650002402848650001702872650002302889650001002912650003302922650001702955650001502972650003302987650001303020650002303033650001803056650001303074650002203087653002403109653003103133653002603164653002103190653002303211700002203234700001903256700001703275773010503292856008503397903002403482961001303506852000903519655001203528IND60576063220221207113927.0190408e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057606322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.07.0182doi7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.07.0182chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Weiming10aMicrobial communities in the cysts of soybean cyst nematode affected by tillage and biocide in a suppressive soil  ap. 396-406.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSuppressive soil harbors biological agents with potential for managing plant diseases. However, given the rich and complex composition of suppressive factors, the microbes involved in disease suppression have been difficult to identify. We conducted amplicon-based metagenomic analysis of microbial communities in the cysts of soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) from an SCN-suppressive field to study bacteria and fungi involved in SCN suppression. The experiment was a split-plot design with conventional tillage and no-till as main treatments, and formaldehyde as a biocide and no-formaldehyde (control) as sub-treatments. All plots were planted with SCN-susceptible soybean from 2009 to 2013. Tillage had little effect on SCN, while formaldehyde increased SCN population density, suggesting biological factors are involved in SCN suppression. SCN cysts were collected at planting and midseason in 2013 for bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS1 sequencing. Tillage did not affect bacterial and fungal diversity, composition, or relative abundance of taxa. However, formaldehyde lowered bacterial community diversity, and changed the bacterial and fungal community composition when compared to the control. Formaldehyde reduced the bacterial genera Lysobacter and Actinocorallia, which are frequently isolated from cysts, but increased the relative abundance of Pseudomonas in the cysts. Streptomyces were found to be more dominant at planting than at midseason. The fungi important in regulating SCN population such as Pochonia, Exophiala, and Clonostachys had lower relative abundance, whereas Trichoderma and Phoma had higher relative abundance under formaldehyde treatment than control. Our study suggests that both bacteria and fungi played important roles in suppression of the SCN.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research Initiative (NRI) Arthropod and Nematode Biology and Management Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinocorallia 3aClonostachys 3aExophiala 3aHeterodera glycines 3aLysobacter 3aPhoma 3aPochonia 3aPseudomonas 3aStreptomyces 3aTrichoderma 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiocides 3acommunity structure 3aconventional tillage 3adisease control 3aexperimental design 3aformaldehyde 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ametagenomics 3ano-tillage 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplanting 3apopulation density 3aribosomal RNA 3asoybeans 3asuppressive soils 0aMicrobial community 0aNext generation sequencing 0aSoybean cyst nematode 0aSuppressive soil 0aBiological control1 aSamac, Deborah A.1 aLiu, Xingzhong1 aChen, S.

This is aimed to demonstrate the variety which exists between different classification methods as well as to help identify years which can be more confidently classified as CP events. Classifying CP El Niños based on the greatest convergence between methods and between SST datasets provides a more robust identification of these events. Analysis of the SST patterns of the CP years identified demonstrates several misclassifications, stressing the importance of not relying solely on indices. After removal, 14 years which are classified the most consistently as CP events include the following: 1885/1886, 1914/1915, 1940/1941, 1958/1959, 1963/1964, 1968/1969, 1977/1978, 1986/1987, 1990/1991, 1991/1992, 1994/1995, 2002/2003, 2003/2004, and 2004/2005. Our findings also indicate the intermittent appearance of CP events throughout the time period investigated, inciting the role of multidecadal natural climate variability in generating CP El Niños.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3asurface water temperature1 aZanchettin, D.1 aBothe, O.1 aTimmreck, C.1 aMatei, D.1 aJungclaus, J.

These are potentially very attractive for transport applications. First, the influence of processing on elementary fiber tensile properties is shown to be limited. Then the preforms are evaluated in polypropylene matrix composites and mechanical properties are determined. The structure of non-woven reinforcements is strongly dependent on the manufacturing route. By varying the fiber content it is shown that the most efficient reinforcement for flax fibers is the mat produced by paper processing. The new spunlaced reinforced composites are shown to have slightly lower tensile properties (15% lower strength, and 25% lower stiffness) compared to mat composites at equivalent volume fraction, but further optimization is possible for these materials. Based on the measured constituent properties micromechanics models have been used to estimate composite stiffness. A good correlation is obtained between test results and model predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3afiber content 3aflax 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3apaper 3apapermaking 3apolypropylenes 3aprediction 3atensile strength 0aFlax fibers 0aNon-wovens 0aComposite materials 0aPolypropylene1 aDavies, Peter1 aBaley, Christophe0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2016 May, v. 83 p.194-205dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012500168520198800293592002802281650002302309650001102332650002102343650001902364650002902383650001102412650001602423650001402439650002002453650001702473650002102490650001102511650001702522650001902539650000802558650001002566650001702576650001802593650002502611650002002636650001802656650001302674651001002687653002002697653001202717653002902729653003002758653002302788700001502811700001702826700001702843700001502860700001702875700001702892700001502909700001702924773011902941856008803060852000903148655001203157IND60741689520221118113440.0211227e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074168952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1483762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yitong10aSpectroscopic fingerprints to track the fate of aquatic organic matter along an alpine headstream on the Tibetan Plateau  aThe fragile aquatic ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau is severely threatened by human activities and climate change. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a vital indicator of surface water quality; however, its comprehensive molecular analysis is challenged due to its low concentration (total organic carbon less than 0.5 mg/L) in alpine areas. This study proposes the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (FEEM) to fingerprint DOM in a typical headstream in the Namco basin, one of the largest lake regions in Tibet. We found that the FEEM can sensitively detect low-concentration pollution traces and the variation of DOM along the flow from the ice sheet, through the wetland, eventually to the estuary of the lake. The fluorescence intensity indices for biodegradable carbon (fT/C) and humification (HIXₑₘ) responded drastically along the flow. Fluorescence regional integrals (FRIs) clearly reflected the overall increase of protein-like substances and decrease of humus-like substances along the flow, whereas this tendency was reversed when passing through the wetland. The FRIs-derived secondary parameters (HPP, HMP, WLP and SSP) further sensed likely variations in hydrophobicity, humification degree, excited-state fluorophore energy and Stokes shift. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) of the FEEM signals witnessed the trade-off among tyrosine-like organics (C1 peak), tryptophan-like byproducts (C2 peak) and humus-like remains (C3 peak) along the flow. The C1 component can be traced back to the vicinity of the ice sheet exit, presumably due to human and animal activities. The wetland can absorb or convert part of the C1 component into C2 or C3 products, demonstrating the function of regulating water quality and buffering environmental impacts. The spectroscopic indicators evaluated in this study may provide tools for diagnosing early traces of water pollution and ecological instability in alpine areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abasins 3abiodegradability 3aclimate change 3adissolved organic matter 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aestuaries 3afactor analysis 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3ahumification 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3alakes 3aspectroscopy 3asurface water 3atotal organic carbon 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aChina 0aTibetan Plateau 0aWetland 0aDissolved organic matter 0aFluorescence spectroscopy 0aSpectral indicator1 aXiao, Kang1 aDu, Jianqing1 aHan, Bingjun1 aLiu, Qiang1 aNiu, Haishan1 aRen, Weishan1 aTan, Jihua1 aWang, Yanfen0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 792 p.148376-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1483763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245006400162300001200226520103100238592002801269650002001297650001401317650002501331650001101356650001501367650001501382700001901397700002501416700002901441773009501470856007401565852000901639655001201648IND60548256920221117195450.0160903e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054825692DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028419622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte, Carlos M.10aTesting the predictive power of seagrass depth limit models  ap. 652.  aThe power of equations predicting seagrass depth limit (Zc) from light extinction (K z) was tested on data on seagrass depth limits collected from the literature. The test data set comprised 424 reports of seagrass colonization depth and water transparency, including data for 10 seagrass species. This data set confirmed the strong negative relationship betweenZ c andK z. The regression equation in Duarte (1991) overestimated the realized seagrass colonization depths at colonization depths < 5 m, while there was no prediction bias above this threshold. These results indicated that seagrass colonizing turbid waters (K z 0.27 m⁻¹) have higher apparent light requirements than those growing in clearer waters. The relationship between seagrass colonization depth and light attenuation shifts at a threshold of light attenuation of 0.27 m⁻¹, requiring separate equations to predictZ c for seagrass growing in more turbid waters and clearer waters, and to set targets for seagrass restoration and conservation efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aequations 3ahabitat conservation 3amodels 3aprediction 3aseagrasses1 aMarbà, Núria1 aKrause-Jensen, Dorte1 aSánchez-Camacho, María0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2007 Aug., v. 30, no. 4 p.652-652dSpringer-Verlagx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028419623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011500170300001600285520088100301592002801182650002101210650001201231650001001243650001201253650001501265650001601280650002401296650000901320650001101329650001201340650001601352650001101368700002001379700002201399700002701421700002101448700001701469700002301486773009501509856008501604852000901689655001201698IND60087874920221118013936.0141102e20120104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008787492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermiati, Euis10aImprovement of microwave-assisted hydrolysis of cassava pulp and tapioca flour by addition of activated carbon  ap. 939-942.  aThe superior effects of addition of activated carbon were evidenced for microwave assisted hydrolysis of starches in cassava pulp and tapioca flour under hydrothermal conditions varying irradiation temperature (160–230°C at 5min), duration of heating time (5–18min at 210°C) and amount of activated carbon at 0.5–2.0:1:20 of activated carbon:solid:liquid ratio.

In this study, the AERMOD dispersion model has been applied as a tool for the analysis of the values of pollutant emissions from the flares of the Maroon gas refinery located in the suburb of Ahvaz, Iran. First, the values of pollutant emissions from the refinery’s flares were investigated by measurement and using the emission factors during cold and warm seasons of 2018. The gas burns continuously in two flares and the other 11 flares are used in emergency situations and only their spark plugs are lit. The type of compounds and their molar, volumetric, and weight percentages were determined by gas chromatography (GC) injection. By entering data such as emission rate, flare characteristics, and topographic and meteorological data of the study area into the AERMOD model, dispersion of pollutants was predicted by using the AERMOD model in the region with an area of 2500 km². The statistical evaluation showed that the maximum 8-h concentration of CO in the cold season was 133441 μg/m³ which was higher than the standard and reached 9755 μg/m³ in the warm season that was close to the standard. The maximum hourly concentration of SO₂ was in the cold season with 215 μg/m³ that was higher than the standard value, occurred in a local scale of 50 km². This can be attributed to the high concentration of SO₂ wet deposition. According to the direction of the wind from the northwest, pollutant emissions can lead to adverse health effects on the population of refinery employees, residents around the refinery, and occupants of passing vehicles. The concentration of pollutants generated due to the high volume of heavier compounds in the gas in the winter season was higher than that of the warm season. Comparison of maximum concentrations of the predicted results with the national and international standards showed that SO₂ and CO concentration is higher than standard values. In total, according to the evaluation of the predictions made, the performance of the AERMOD model was acceptable in the prediction of pollutant concentrations in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acold 3acold season 3agas chromatography 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3apollutants 3apollution 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asuburban areas 3atopography 3awarm season 3awet deposition 3awind direction 3awinter 3aIran1 aGoudarzi, Gholamreza1 aSabzalipour, Sima1 aRouzbahani, Maryam Mohammadi1 aMobarak Hassan, Elham0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 40 p.56996-57008dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14493-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013400167500001500301520136100316592002801677650002701705650002601732650002201758650001001780650001901790650001801809650001501827650001001842650001701852650001801869650001501887650001101902650001101913650000901924650001701933650002001950650003401970650001802004653002802022653002702050653002402077653002102101653002202122700001902144773012402163856008202287852000902369655001202378IND60654467720221120172400.0190807e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065446772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2019.1032472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hai-yan,14aThe main active constituents and detoxification process of Ginkgo biloba seeds and their potential use in functional health foods  a2019-12-06  aGinkgo biloba leaves and seeds have been used as a food and traditional herbal remedies for thousands of years. Extracts from G. biloba leaves, especially EGb761, have been investigated extensively to determine their chemical components and pharmacological effects, specifically on degenerative nerve diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. G. biloba seeds, another important part of Ginkgo biloba, have been consumed as a food and medicinal nuts for thousands of years. The seeds are rich in carbohydrates, protein, fat and phytochemicals and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat asthma, cough, enuresis, pyogenic skin infections and intestinal tract worm infections. Recently, G. biloba seeds have also been reported to have neuroprotective effects. Therefore, it is important to promote the intake of G. biloba seeds. However, there are few reports that comprehensively summarize G. biloba seeds. To develop a full understanding of G. biloba seeds and provide a scientific basis for the development of this edible seed, this review summarizes the major components of G. biloba seeds and their bioactivities, processing methods and updated information on the pharmacological functions. Additionally, side effects, such as allergies, haemorrhaging or excessive bleeding, that occurred in people with allergies also have been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneuroprotective effect 3aprocessing technology 3aAlzheimer disease 3aseeds 3aphytochemicals 3acarbohydrates 3ahemorrhage 3acough 3anerve tissue 3askin diseases 3aintestines 3aasthma 3aleaves 3anuts 3ahealth foods 3aadverse effects 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aGinkgo biloba 0aNeuroprotective effects 0aEdible medicinal foods 0aGinkgo biloba seeds 0ahypersensitivity 0aProcessing method1 aZhang, Yu-Qing0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2019 Oct., v. 83 p.103247-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2019.1032473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008800173300001400261520076800275592002801043650001601071650001301087650001601100650001301116650002301129650001801152650002001170650001201190650002001202650001901222650001101241650002201252650001801274650001301292650001501305650002601320650001901346650002201365650001101387653001001398653001001408653001201418653001901430700005901449700003401508700002901542700001801571773008801589856008601677852000901763655001201772IND60634557020221119145016.0190326e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063455702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Taheur, Fadia10aReview: Biotechnology of mycotoxins detoxification using microorganisms and enzymes  ap. 12-22.  aMycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by various toxigenic fungi belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium. They have mutagenic, teratogenic, carcinogenic, immunosuppressive and endocrine disrupting effects on both humans and animals. The ubiquitous occurrence and heat stability of these mycotoxins during food and feed processing pose serious health problems in human and animals. Therefore successful biotechnological detoxification tools are in great demand. Recently, the use of bacteria, yeast, moulds and enzymes to mitigate/bind or biodegrade various mycotoxins is a novel strategy used for mycotoxins removal. In this review, recent development in biological control of mycotoxins removal and detoxification will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aFusarium 3aPenicillium 3abacteria 3abiological control 3abiotechnology 3acarcinogenicity 3aenzymes 3afeed processing 3aheat stability 3ahumans 3aimmunosuppression 3amolds (fungi) 3amutagens 3amycotoxins 3asecondary metabolites 3ateratogenicity 3atoxigenic strains 3ayeasts 0aFungi 0aYeast 0aBinding 0aDetoxification1 aKouidhi, Bochra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7118-98541 aAl Qurashi, Yasir Mohammed A.1 aBen Salah-Abbès, Jalila1 aChaieb, Kamel0 tToxicon.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 160 p.12-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001800164245006300182300001400245520107200259592002801331650002401359650001201383650001401395650000901409650001701418650003501435650001201470650002801482650002601510650006101536650001101597650002001608650000901628650003901637650004101676650001201717650001301729700001901742773010401761852000901865856008201874655001201956IND8506162720221118000559.0181009e198501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850616272DNAL7 a31564432pmid7 a10.1177/0300985885022001112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRender, J.

Ocular vascular lesions consisted of iridal congestion with iridal hemorrhage and associated acute iritis and aqueous flare in some rabbits. Cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolation, and loss of staining affinity that represented hydropic change were present in both layers of ciliary epithelium and the inner layer of iridal epithelium. Cells in the outer layer of the iridal processes and the ciliary ridge, were most severely affected. Vacuoles were also present in the retinal pigment epithelium and scattered throughout the outer plexiform layer of the retina with a few in the inner and outer nuclear layers. Ocular alterations were prevented by simultaneous administration of nicotinamide and their development appeared related to nicotinamide deficiency. No ocular alterations were caused by nicotinamide administration alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3awounds and injuries 3arabbits 3apoisoning 3aeyes 3anicotinamide 2a6-Aminonicotinamidexpoisoning 2aAnimals 2aCiliary Bodyxpathology 2aEpitheliumxpathology 2aEye Diseasesxchemically inducedxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aIrisxpathology 2aMale 2aNiacinamidexanalogs & derivatives 2aPigment Epithelium of Eyexpathology 2aRabbits 2aVacuoles1 aCarlton, W.

In comparison, spectroscopic techniques have successfully overcome some of these disadvantages and can supplement or replace them. As soil is a complex media, it is difficult to assign specifically spectral features for physicochemical properties of soil. This study discusses the combined application of Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled to EDX microprobe (SEM/EDX) methods for estimating soil physicochemical properties. For this purpose, 30 topsoil samples were measured according to standard methods of soil analysis. All spectra were collected in the mid-infrared (MIR) from 4000 to 650 cm⁻¹. Chemometric methods were used in the analysis of multivariate data using the Quant2 package in OPUS 7 software and improved the prediction of soil properties using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that specific surface area (SSA MB-titration) had the best predictions for the soil properties in ATR-FTIR study with a RPD of 2.08, RMSE of 13.50 m² g–¹, and R² of 0.77 (very good); followed by cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, SSA (BET), Al, clay, and Ca (good); saturation, sand, silt/clay, electrical conductivity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, K, silt, Fe, C, and Si (fair); O, Mg, pH, bulk density, porosity, total pore volume, and particle density (poor). Also, we found that SEM-EDX is able to perform a rapid simultaneous multielement analysis without any special soil sample preparation. Consequently, modern techniques, such as ATR-FTIR and SEM-EDX can be used for such studies according to the information needed and the time required for the sample preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3abulk density 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3achemometrics 3aclay 3acomputer software 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aimage analysis 3airon 3aleast squares 3amagnesium 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aporosity 3aprediction 3asand 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3asilt 3asoil sampling 3asurface area 3atopsoil1 aHamidi, S.

One of the major sources of BPA comes from the plastic bottles used to pack milk and soft drinks. The purpose of the present study was to assess and compare the risk associated with BPA transfer from plastic bottles to milk and soft drinks being stored in summer and winter conditions. A sensitive and reliable method of solid phase extraction cartridge packed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was employed. In milk samples (supplied in plastic bottles) of winter season, BPA levels were 0.17–0.32 mg/ kg. In milk samples of summer season, BPA levels were 0.77–1.59 mg/ kg. In soft drink samples of winter, BPA levels were between 0.14 and 0.3 mg/kg. While in 4-month-aged summer soft drink samples, BPA levels were 0.7–1.02 mg/kg of food. The daily exposure dose (DED) of BPA in milk samples of winter season was 1.42–2.67 μg/kg which was below the standard tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 50 μg of BPA/kg of body weight as per USEPA. The DED of BPA in milk samples of summer season was 5.58–10 μg/kg of body weight which was also less than TDI. For soft drink samples, BPA from winter samples was ranged from 1.17 to 1.67 μg/kg of body weight while for summer 4-month-aged samples was 2.5–7.08 μg/kg of body weight. Both types of samples were still less than TDI of BPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aacceptable daily intake 3abisphenol A 3abody weight 3acarbon nanotubes 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3ahealth effects assessments 3amilk 3apollution 3apublic health 3aresearch 3arisk 3asoft drinks 3asolid phase extraction 3asummer 3atoxicity 3awinter1 aJalees, Muhammad Irfan1 aQurat-ul-Ain, 1 aHussain, Ghulam1 aAnis, Mehwish1 aIslam, Ummara0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 40 p.57090-57098dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14653-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016000170520130200330592002801632650001901660650001801679650001501697650001901712650002601731650002601757650001301783650002201796650002001818650001601838650001701854650001401871650001901885650001901904650000901923650001301932653002201945653003701967653002802004653002302032653002302055700001502078700001902093700001402112700001802126700001902144700001702163700001802180773011902198856008802317852000902405655001202414IND60741689820221118113438.0211227e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074168982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1483812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongdou10aChitosan as additive affects the bacterial community, accelerates the removals of antibiotics and related resistance genes during chicken manure composting  aManures, storages for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), pollute soil and water as well as endanger human health. Recently, we have been searching a better solution to remove antibiotics and ARGs during aerobic composting. Here, the dynamics of chitosan addition on the profiles of 71 ARGs, bacterial communities, chlortetracycline (CTC), ofloxacin (OFX) were investigated in chicken manure composting and compared with zeolite addition. Chitosan addition effectively reduces antibiotics contents (CTC under detection limit, OFX 90.96%), amounts (18) and abundance (56.7%, 11.1% higher than zeolite addition) of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) after 42 days composting. Network analysis indicated that a total of 27 genera strains assigned into 4 phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes) were the potential hosts of ARGs. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that bacterial community succession is the main contributor in the variation of ARGs. Overall, chitosan addition may effect bacterial composition by influencing physic-chemical properties and the concentration of antibiotics, Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺ to reduce the risk of ARG transmission. This study gives a new strategy about antibiotics and ARGs removal from composting on the basis of previous studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial communities 3achitosan 3achlortetracycline 3adetection limit 3aenvironment 3ahuman health 3aofloxacin 3apoultry manure 3arisk reduction 3asoil 3azeolites 0aChitosan addition 0aAntibiotic resistance gene (ARG) 0aPotential host bacteria 0aAerobic composting 0aIn-feed antibiotic1 aYe, Xuhong1 aChen, Songling1 aSun, Aobo1 aDuan, Xinying1 aZhang, Yanqing1 aZou, Hongtao1 aZhang, Yulong0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 792 p.148381-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1483813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01950naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010000166300001400266520079100280592002801071650002201099650001401121650001101135650002101146650001501167650001901182650001201201650001901213650002101232650001101253650003701264700002001301700001901321773010601340856008601446990002301532852000901555655001201564IND60113205820221117083332.0141111e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011320582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwa, Yoon14aThe electrochemical characteristics of Ag₂S and its nanocomposite anodes for Li-ion batteries  ap. 24-29.  aThe suitability of silver sulfide (Ag₂S) and its nanocomposite Ag₂S/C, prepared by simple solid-state synthetic routes such as high-energy mechanical milling and heat treatment, for use as anode materials in rechargeable Li-ion batteries has been investigated.

Along with another thermoacidophilic archaeon,Sulfolobus solfataricus, it is known to metabolize glucose by the non-phosphorylated Entner-Doudoroff (nED) pathway. In the course of these studies, the specific activities of glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase and glycerate kinase, two enzymes that are involved in the downstream part of the nED pathway, were found to be much higher inT. acidophilum than inS. solfataricus. To characterize glycerate kinase, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity fromT. acidophilum cell extracts. TheN-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme was in exact agreement with that of Ta0453m in the genome database, with the removal of the initiator methionine. Furthermore, the enzyme was a monomer with a molecular weight of 49 kDa and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics withK ₘ values of 0.56 and 0.32 mM forDL-glycerate and ATP, respectively. The enzyme also exhibited excellent thermal stability at 70°C. Of the seven sugars and four phosphate donors tested, onlyDL-glycerate and ATP were utilized by glycerate kinase as substrates. In addition, a coupled enzyme assay indicated that 2-phosphoglycerate was produced as a product. When divalent metal ions, such as Mn²⁺, Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Zn²⁺, Ca²⁺, and Sr²⁺, were substituted for Mg²⁺, the enzyme activities were less than 10% of that obtained in the presence of Mg²⁺. The amino acid sequence ofT. acidophilum glycerate kinase showed no similarity withE. coli glycerate kinases, which belong to the first glycerate kinase family. This is the first report on the biochemical characterization of an enzyme which belongs to a member of the second glycerate kinase family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamino acid sequences 3acalcium 3acobalt 3adatabases 3adivalent metals 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme kinetics 3agenome 3aglucose 3aglyceraldehyde 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3amethionine 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3astrontium 3athermal stability 3azinc1 aJung, Jin Hwa1 aLee, Sun Bok0 tBiotechnology and bioprocess engineering.g2006 Aug., v. 11, no. 4 p.344-350dThe Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineeringx1226-83727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF030262513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012000169300001600289520192200305592002802227650001502255650001202270650002402282650001902306650002602325650001202351650001402363650001602377650002002393650004102413650000902454650002202463650000902485650001302494650001302507650001402520650000902534650001502543650001302558650002002571653004002591653002402631653002402655653002302679700002002702700001402722700001802736700001802754773009202772856008602864852000902950655001202959IND60576995920221119053837.0181010e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057699592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÜzer, Ayşem10aIndirect Determination of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN) with a gold nanoparticles−based colorimetric sensor  ap. 243-249.  aPentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol, used as an energetic and filling material for military and civilian purposes and rarely for terrorist actions. As there is no reliable nano-colorimetric method for PETN assay, we developed an indirect method based on the determination of nitrite, obtained by reduction of nitrate derived from the alkaline hydrolysis of PETN with H2O2. We colorimetrically determined the final product, nitrite, by both conventional Griess reaction and a recently developed gold nanoparticle-4-aminothiophenol-N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine (AuNP−4-ATP+NED) method. Nitramines (RDX and HMX), if present, could be degraded by alkaline hydrolysis, without affecting PETN. The analytical performance characteristics of the developed assays as molar absorptivity (ε), limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were: ɛ=1.06×10⁵ L mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹, LOD=0.03mgL⁻¹ and LOQ=0.11mgL⁻¹ for indirect Griess method; ɛ=1.9×10⁴Lmol⁻¹ cm⁻¹; LOD=0.12mgL⁻¹ and LOQ=0.4mgL⁻¹ for AuNP−4-ATP+NED method. Both methods were applied to a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of PETN and TNT (corresponding to the composition of military explosive ‘Pentolite’). In order to eliminate the interference from TNT, the Meisenheimer anion of TNT formed in alkaline medium was retained on a strongly basic anion exchange resin column. As PETN had a very low solubility in water, common soil ions could be eliminated by prewashing the sample with water, or in acetone-water mixtures, Ca²⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, SO4²⁻, and NO3⁻ could be tolerated at equal (1:1) mass ratios. Soil nitrates and nitrites, at a mass ratio of 50:1, could be separated from PETN with the aid of their insolubilities in acetone and of their retention affinity toward a strongly basic anion-exchange resin. The developed method was statistically validated against a reference GC-MS method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetone 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3aanion exchange 3aanion exchange resins 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agold 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aions 3anitrates 3anitrites 3apotassium 3asoil 3asolubility 3asulfates 3atrinitrotoluene 0aPentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) 0aExplosive detection 0aColorimetric sensor 0aGold nanoparticles1 aYalçın, Uğur1 aCan, Ziya1 aErçağ, Erol1 aApak, Reşat,0 tTalanta.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 175 p.243-249dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166300001800261520156200279592002801841650001001869650001201879650001701891650001001908650002201918650001201940650001501952650002701967650001201994651001002006700001802016700001702034700001502051700001402066700001602080773009902096856008102195852000902276655001202285IND60439864420221121215700.0151024e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043986442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-015-0227-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Jiangtao10aModerate grazing promotes genetic diversity of Stipa species in the Inner Mongolian steppe  ap. 1783-1794.  aCONTEXT: Disturbances may affect the spatial patterns of plant genetic diversity, but these effects are not yet well understood for lack of direct experimental evidence. Grazing is one of such environmental disturbance factors which may lead to small-scale spatial heterogeneity in natural grasslands. OBJECTIVES: Our main goal was to determine whether a grazing disturbance alters population genetic diversity and genetic structure of the dominant species in the Inner Mongolia Steppe. METHODS: We performed inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular marker analysis on populations of Stipa grandis and S. krylovii which were exposed to five consecutive years of varying degrees of grazing disturbance. RESULTS: The amplification results showed that the genetic diversity of both S. grandis and S. krylovii populations varied under different grazing intensities; the highest diversity (Nei’s index and Shannon’s index) were under moderate disturbance, whereas the lowest under the heavy grazing. The coefficient of gene differentiation (GST) of S. grandis and S. krylovii populations were 16.82 and 21.00 °%, respectively. These results suggest that the genetic diversity of these two dominant populations was altered by the small-scale grazing disturbance, which provides new evidence supporting the theories of landscape genetics. CONCLUSIONS: The enhancement of moderate grazing on genetic diversity implies the necessity to involve animal grazing in the design of management regimes for biodiversity conservation of the Inner Mongolia steppes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStipa 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agrazing 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asteppes 3aChina1 aLiang, Cunzhu1 aNiu, Yongmei1 aJiang, Wei1 aWang, Wei1 aWang, Lixin0 tLandscape ecology.g2015 Nov., v. 30, no. 9 p.1783-1794dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-015-0227-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245005900162300002000221520098100241592002801222650001501250650000901265650001401274650001501288650001701303700001701320700002401337700002501361700001701386700002301403700001901426773013401445856007501579852000901654655001201663IND60539451520170629000000.0160816e20140813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053945152DNAL7 a10.1021/ja505563e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtte, Franziska
L.10aOrdered Monolayers of Free-Standing Porphyrins on Gold  ap. 11248-11251.  aThe controlled attachment of chromophores to metal or semiconducting surfaces is a prerequisite for the construction of photonic devices and artificial surface-based light-harvesting systems. We present an approach to mount porphyrins in ordered monolayers on Au(111) by self-assembly and verify it, employing STM, absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations. The usual adsorption geometry of planar chromophores, flat on the surface or densely packed edge-on, is prevented by mounting the porphyrins upright on a molecular platform. An ethynyl unit as spacer and pivot joint provides almost free azimuthal rotation of the unsubstituted porphin. However, rotation of the larger triphenylporphyrin unit is sterically restricted: because the diameter of the substituted porphyrin is larger than the distance to its next neighbors, the phenyl substituents of neigboring molecules interact by dispersion force, which leads to an alignment of the azimuthal rotators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3agold 3aphotonics 3aporphyrins 3aspectroscopy1 aLemke, Sonja1 aSchütt, Christian,1 aKrekiehn, Nicolai R.1 aJung, Ulrich1 aMagnussen, Olaf M.1 aHerges, Rainer0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Aug. 13, v. 136, no. 32 p.11248-11251dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja505563e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04218naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245015800165300001800323520196600341592002802307650001402335650001102349650001902360650002302379650001102402650001902413650002102432650002602453650001602479650001302495650001702508650001302525650000702538650001902545650001102564650001602575700001802591700001602609700002002625700002202645700001802667700002002685700002202705700002002727700001702747700002602764700002002790700002902810700002202839700005802861700001902919700002402938700006002962700005903022700002103081700002303102700005903125700006203184700005403246773014703300856007603447852000903523655001203532IND60743309520221121061523.0210707e20210624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074330952DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c037722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuppertsberg, Anne10aSquaric Ester-Based, pH-Degradable Nanogels: Modular Nanocarriers for Safe, Systemic Administration of Toll-like Receptor 7/8 Agonistic Immune Modulators  ap. 9872-9883.  aSmall-molecular Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonists hold promise as immune modulators for a variety of immune therapeutic purposes including cancer therapy or vaccination. However, due to their rapid systemic distribution causing difficult-to-control inflammatory off-target effects, their application is still problematic, in particular systemically. To address this problem, we designed and robustly fabricated pH-responsive nanogels serving as versatile immunodrug nanocarriers for safe delivery of TLR7/8-stimulating imidazoquinolines after intravenous administration. To this aim, a primary amine-reactive methacrylamide monomer bearing a pendant squaric ester amide is introduced, which is polymerized under controlled RAFT polymerization conditions. Corresponding PEG-derived squaric ester amide block copolymers self-assemble into precursor micelles in polar protic solvents. Their cores are amine-reactive and can sequentially be transformed by acid-sensitive cross-linkers, dyes, and imidazoquinolines. Remaining squaric ester amides are hydrophilized affording fully hydrophilic nanogels with profound stability in human plasma but stimuli-responsive degradation upon exposure to endolysosomal pH conditions. The immunomodulatory behavior of the imidazoquinolines alone or conjugated to the nanogels was demonstrated by macrophages in vitro. In vivo, however, we observed a remarkable impact of the nanogel: After intravenous injection, a spatially controlled immunostimulatory activity was evident in the spleen, whereas systemic off-target inflammatory responses triggered by the small-molecular imidazoquinoline analogue were absent. These findings underline the potential of squaric ester-based, pH-degradable nanogels as a promising platform to permit intravenous administration routes of small-molecular TLR7/8 agonists and, thus, the opportunity to explore their adjuvant potency for systemic vaccination or cancer immunotherapy purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aamides 3acancer therapy 3acomposite polymers 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3aimmunostimulants 3aintravenous injection 3amacrophages 3amicelles 3ananocarriers 3ananogels 3apH 3apolymerization 3aspleen 3avaccination1 aKaps, Leonard1 aZhong, Zifu1 aSchmitt, Sascha1 aStickdorn, Judith1 aDeswarte, Kim1 aCombes, Francis1 aCzysch, Christian1 aDe Vrieze, Jana1 aKasmi, Sabah1 aChoteschovsky, Niklas1 aKlefenz, Adrian1 aMedina-Montano, Carolina1 aWinterwerber, Pia1 aChen, Chaojian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2588-24471 aBros, Matthias1 aLienenklaus, Stefan1 aSanders, Niek N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4585-03431 aKoynov, Kaloian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4062-88341 aSchuppan, Detlef1 aLambrecht, Bart N.1 aDavid, Sunil A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1655-46411 aDe Geest, Bruno G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9826-61701 aNuhn, Lutz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0761-11060 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 June 24, v. 143, no. 26 p.9872-9883dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c037723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010400161520227000265592002802535650001102563650001102574650002102585650001302606650001102619650002902630650001902659650002102678650001002699700002502709700001602734773012002750856007402870852000902944655001202953IND60782520820221121124214.0220708e20220625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078252082DNAL7 a10.3390/w141320362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNosrati, Kourosh 10aInteraction of Irregular Distribution of Submerged Rigid Vegetation and Flow within a Straight Pool  aThe interaction of bedform and vegetation cover significantly affects the turbulent flow parameters. To investigate this interaction, experiments were carried out in both a gravel-bed river and a laboratory flume. The purpose of field investigations was to find the slopes for both the entrance section and exit section of pools, the grain size of the bed material, and the flow condition. Based on field data, without considering any scaling analysis, a straight pool was constructed in a laboratory flume that was 0.9 m wide, 0.6 m deep, and 14 m long. The entry and exit slopes of the straight pool were 7.4° and 4°, respectively. The straight pool had vertical side walls and a gravel bed with a median grain size of d₅₀ = 23.3 mm. Plastic cylinders planted in an irregular pattern in the channel beds were used to model rigid submerged vegetation. The velocity components were recorded by using an ADV at 200 Hz. In this study, the distributions of velocity, Reynolds stress, and TKE were investigated for flows in the presence of submerged rigid vegetation in channel beds with various area densities of vegetation. Results show that the shape of Reynolds stress distribution depends on the entrance and exit slopes of the pool, as well as the irregular distribution pattern of vegetated elements. Inside the pool with the presence of submerged vegetation in the channel bed, the maximum TKE appears above the bed surface with a larger distance depending on the area density of vegetation in the channel bed. However, the momentum exchange and turbulent energy are likely influenced by the secondary circulation of the flows associated with the irregular distribution of vegetated elements in the channel bed. Results of the quadrant analysis show that the momentum between the flow, bedform, and vegetated elements is mostly transferred by sweep and ejection events. The outward event tends to grow toward the water surface, reaching the highest amount near the water surface. At the pool entrance section where the flow is decelerating, the ejection event is dominant near the bed while the sweep event is strong near the water surface. With the decrease in the vegetation density in the pool bed, both the ejection and outward events become dominant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3agravel 3ahydraulic flumes 3amomentum 3arivers 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3aturbulent flow 3avegetation cover 3awater1 aAfzalimehr, Hossein 1 aSui, Jueyi 0 tWater.g2022 June 25, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141320363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011800172300001600290520197600306592002802282650000802310650001902318650002002337650001502357650001302372650001902385650001602404650002402420650003002444650001202474650001902486650001402505650001002519651001102529653001602540653001402556653004302570653001702613653001402630653001502644700002202659700002302681700002002704700002002724700001602744700002502760773009502785856008702880852000902967655001202976IND60557330820221119054446.0190408e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055733082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsvik, Pål A.10aMulti-laboratory evaluation of a PCR method for detection of ruminant DNA in commercial processed animal proteins  ap. 140-146.  aIn 2013, the European Union (EU) allowed the inclusion of non-ruminant processed animal proteins (PAP) in fish feeds. Plans also exist to allow non-ruminant PAP in poultry and pig feeds but to keep intraspecies recycling forbidden (e.g. poultry to poultry or pig to pig). However, due to the fear of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), PAP from ruminant species remains illegal to use in feeds. To ensure feed safety, nations across Europe need to safeguard that commercial fish feeds do not contain PAP from ruminant species. In this work we report a multi-laboratory study on the detection of ruminant PAP in commercial PAP feed ingredients. A total of 19 non-ruminant PAP, provided by the European Fat Processors and Renderers Association (EFPRA), were analyzed for ruminant content with the European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL)-validated PCR assay by three labs and compared to the result obtained with an immunoassay-based method (MELISA-TEK). Ruminant PAP was detected in five of the 19 non-ruminant PAP samples with both methods, but there were methodological and multi-laboratory differences for the PCR method. Compared to the results with the EU-reference laboratory, 3 false-negatives were found by the two other laboratories. We speculate that the discrepancies seen for some of the samples determined with the PCR method rely on the homogenization and grinding step, which is not described in detail in the EURL Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), shift in the normal distribution of Ct-values near the cut-off of the PCR method, or PCR inhibition. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the presence of ruminant DNA in commercially available non-ruminant PAP by use of two methods for the detection of PAP in commercial feed ingredients, and highlights the importance of thorough homogenization prior to DNA extraction and assessment of normal distribution of Ct-values for successful PCR detection at low ruminant DNA contamination levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEuropean Union 3aanimal proteins 3afish feeds 3agrinding 3ahomogenization 3aingredients 3anormal distribution 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry 3aprion diseases 3aruminants 3aswine 3aEurope 0aFeed safety 0aFish feed 0aBovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) 0aRuminant PAP 0aPCR assay 0aMELISA-TEK1 aFumière, Olivier1 aMargry, Rob J.C.F.1 aBerben, Gilbert1 aLarsen, Natalia1 aAlm, Martin1 aBerntssen, Marc H.G.0 tFood control.g2017 Mar., v. 73 p.140-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012700168300001600295520099700311592002801308650002601336650002701362650001301389650002301402650001301425650001201438650001301450650003101463650001901494650001401513650002001527650001501547653001301562653003201575653002901607653002601636653002701662653001401689700001501703700001601718700001401734700001701748700005601765700001901821773009501840856008701935852000902022655001202031IND60557330920221119054613.0190408e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055733092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.07.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzelmad, K.10aAdhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus xylosus to materials commonly found in catering and domestic kitchens  ap. 156-163.  aThe aim of this work was to investigate the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus xylosus on marble, granite, polypropylene, stainless steel 304 and stainless steel 316.

Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phase perovskites are promising alternatives to achieve high-quality blue PeLEDs. However, the current exploration of DJ phase perovskites is focused on symmetric divalent cations, and the corresponding efficiency of blue PeLEDs is still inferior to that of green and red ones. In this work, we report a new type of DJ phase CsPb(Br/Cl)₃ perovskite via introduction of an asymmetric molecular configuration as the organic spacer cation in perovskites. The primary and tertiary ammonium groups on the asymmetric cations bridge with the lead halide octahedra forming the DJ phase structures. Stable photoluminescence spectra were demonstrated in perovskite films owing to the suppressed halide segregation. Meanwhile, the radiative recombination efficiency of charges is improved significantly as a result of the confinement effects and passivation of charge traps. Finally, we achieved an external quantum efficiency of 2.65% in blue PeLEDs with stable spectra emission under applied bias voltages. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of asymmetric cations used in PeLEDs, which provides a facile solution to the halide segregation issue in PeLEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3alead 3amolecular conformation 3aphotoluminescence1 aOno, Luis K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3176-18761 aTong, Guoqing1 aBu, Tongle1 aZhang, Hui1 aDing, Chenfeng1 aZhang, Wei1 aQi, Yabing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4876-80490 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 143, no. 47 p.19711-19718dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c077573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245011300212300001400325520244100339592002802780650001502808650001102823650000902834650001602843650001502859650005002874650002402924650001602948650001502964650002402979650001203003650001603015651001803031653002903049653002903078653003003107653003403137653001803171700001603189773020503205856008703410852000903497655001203506IND60625577020221119122436.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062557702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, P.q(Peng),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1568-151810aVariability in annual temperature cycle in the urban areas of the United States as revealed by MODIS imagery  ap. 65-73.  aDue to its large spatial coverage and frequent revisit, satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) has been recently used to explore annual temperature cycle (ATC) variations at regional and global scales. However, variability in seasonality of LSTs has not been examined in detail, particularly in urban areas where elevated temperatures are normally observed. By assuming repetitive temperature cycles, this study aims to reveal differences in ATC parameters between urban and rural areas and the impacts of surface urban heat island (UHI) on the ATC range over the continental United States. To this end, urban areas of larger than 10 km2 (a total of 1856 urban polygons) in the continental United States were identified from the map of urban extents produced by Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light data from 2012. The corresponding rural polygons of the same size were generated by using a buffer method. The ATC parameters were optimized using a sinusoidal function fitted with the 8-day MODIS LST composite data. Results showed that urban and rural areas exhibited a significant difference, with a p-value <0.01, in the ATC parameters, including mean annual surface temperature (MAST), yearly amplitude of surface temperature (YAST), and the revised phase shift parameter. The higher MAST and YAST, but lower phase shift values, were mainly associated with the urban areas. This finding indicated that urban areas contributed to changes in extreme temperatures (the minimum and maximum temperatures) as well as to an overall warming. The regression analysis suggested that surface UHI intensities were positively correlated with the differences in MAST (R2 = 0.9) and YAST (R2 = 0.5) between urban and rural areas, but negatively correlated (R2 = 0.2) with the differences in the revised phase shift parameter. In addition, highest surface UHIs (∼3 k) and largest differences in ATC parameters were observed in tropical regions, followed by temperature zones, continental (cold) zones, and arid zones. Overall, this study revealed that urbanization-induced land cover changes could influence urban systems by enhancing temperature variations. However, it should be cautioned that uncertainty in the analysis may arise from the characterization of surface UHIs for the selected ∼2000 cities with varying configuration and morphological dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3acities 3acold 3aheat island 3aland cover 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3asatellites 3asurface temperature 3atropics 3auncertainty 3aUnited States 0aAnnual temperature cycle 0aLand surface temperature 0aSurface urban heat island 0aKöppen-Geiger climatic zones 0aMODIS imagery1 aWeng, Qihao0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2018 Dec., v. 146 p.65-73dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Arg. germplasm as determined using multivariate analysis  aJatropha platyphylla is a species of the Euphorbiaceae family with kernels rich in oil and protein with no toxicity. The aim of this study was to analyze the morphological variability and oil content of J. platyphylla in tropical deciduous forests of Mexico to determine the characteristics and establish domestication strategies. Principal component and cluster analyses were performed with 11 traits: plant height, stem diameter, canopy spread, number of branches, total fruit production, dry fruit weight, seed weight, seed diameter, kernel weight, shell weight and oil content. Significant differences were found in eight of the traits. Grid maps of the distribution pattern, total fruit production and oil percentage were generated. In principal components analysis the three components explained 70.2% of the variance in the data and showed that the traits that contributed most to the variance were the morphological characteristics of seeds. In the cluster analysis, seven clusters were obtained, of which three clusters grouped the germplasms with the highest oil percentages. The variations in oil content and morphological variables suggested opportunities for viable selection in domestication and genetic improvement programs, considering that J. platyphylla is a wild species. Exploring adapted varieties and producing interspecies hybrids can create added value to these little explored species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDM 0aLC 0aLH 0aPP 0aPR 0aQP 0aTP 0aPH 0aDBH 0aCS 0aBP 0aTFP 0aDFW 0aSW 0aSD 0aKW 0aSS 0aOP 0aPCA 0aCVs 0amasl 0aJatropha platyphylla 0aMorphological traits 0aOil content 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aSpatial distribution1 aAlcaraz Meléndez, Lilia,1 aLeón-Félix, Josefina1 aHeredia, José Basilio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1017-957X1 aSoto-Landeros, Federico1 aAngulo-Escalante, Miguel A.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 261 p.108968-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1089683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245011700175300002000292520119600312592002801508650001201536650002101548650001101569650001301580650001101593650002101604650001301625700001701638773012901655856008201784852000901866655001201875IND60566859720221120045720.0170413e20160630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056685972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b042162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristoffersen, Henrik
H.10aInteraction between Monomeric Vanadium Oxide Clusters Supported on Titania and Its Influence on Their Reactivity  ap. 13610-13621.  aDensity functional theory is used to study monomeric vanadium oxide clusters formed by exposing to oxygen a rutile TiO₂(110) surface on which vanadium atoms have been preadsorbed. Past calculations examined such systems by using one V atom per supercell. This forces all VOₓ clusters to be identical and precludes interactions between them. To examine the consequences of this choice, we examine a VOₓ and a VOy cluster in the same supercell. We find that the most stable configuration is obtained when the supercell contains one VO₂ and one VO₃ cluster. The stabilization occurs because of a Lewis acid–base interaction: VO₂ donates electron charge to VO₃ and this lowers the energy substantially. No such interactions were found when the supercell contained VOₓ clusters with the same number of oxygen atoms. These finding demonstrate that in some cases it is essential to have two clusters in the supercell and that results obtained with one cluster in the supercell can be misleading. We have also studied the reactivity of the clusters with hydrogen, which is considered a descriptor of the ability of the cluster to catalyze the breaking of a C–H bond in an alkane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3achemical bonding 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3atitanium dioxide 3avanadium1 aMetiu, Horia0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 June 30, v. 120, no. 25 p.13610-13621dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b042163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010200163300001600265520206100281592002802342650001902370650001502389650001202404650001902416650001202435650001502447650001602462651001002478700001802488700001502506700001602521700001902537700001702556700001502573773009902588856008202687852000902769655001202778IND60121530220221118232022.0210615e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012153022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-014-9828-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xingwu10aExperimental Warming Increases Seasonal Methane Uptake in an Alpine Meadow on the Tibetan Plateau  ap. 274-286.  aIncreased understanding of the response of soil methane (CH₄) uptake in alpine meadow ecosystems to warming and grazing could reduce uncertainty in estimates of the soil-atmospheric CH₄ budget. To determine the effects of warming and grazing on soil CH₄ uptake at different timescales (that is, daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual), we conducted a controlled warming and grazing experiment [that is, no warming with no grazing (NWNG), no warming with grazing (NWG), warming with no grazing (WNG), and warming with grazing (WG)] in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau from 2006 to 2009. Soil CH₄ uptake was mainly affected by warming and sample date and their interaction. Warming treatment regardless of grazing significantly increased seasonal average CH₄ uptake by 31-39% during the growing season (from May to September) and by 162% during the non-growing season (from October to April next year) in 2007–2008, whereas only WNG increased seasonal average CH₄ uptake by 87–138% compared with NWNG during the non-growing seasons in 2006–2007 and 2008–2009. Warming in WNG and WG increased annual CH₄ uptake by 50–87% compared with NWNG or NWG. Moreover, warming regardless of grazing and warming with grazing (compared with NWNG) significantly increased the contribution to annual uptake of CH₄ uptake during the non-growing season in 2007–2008 and 2008–2009. However, moderate grazing did not significantly influence soil CH₄ uptake, although grazing with warming decreased CH₄ uptake by 43% during the growing season in 2006. Soil moisture explained 16–25% of the CH₄ variation during the growing season, but there was no significant relationship between soil CH₄ uptake and soil moisture during the non-growing season. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to the stimulating effect of warming on soil CH₄ uptake during the non-growing season due to its greater response to warming and different stimulating mechanisms compared to responses during the growing season in the alpine meadow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3aecosystems 3agrazing 3agrowing season 3amethane 3asoil water 3auncertainty 3aChina1 aWang, Shiping1 aHu, Yigang1 aLuo, Caiyun1 aZhang, Zhenhua1 aNiu, Haishan1 aXie, Zubin0 tEcosystems.g2015 Mar., v. 18, no. 2 p.274-286dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9828-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002800149245018200177300001600359520102800375592002801403650002101431650002501452650002701477650001901504650001701523650001801540650002301558650001601581650002101597650001201618650004401630650002601674700002001700700002601720700002101746700002101767773010101788856008501889852000901974655001201983IND4502887020221120123453.0141111e20111210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450288702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.07.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Ken’ichiro10aBiosynthesis of glycolate-based polyesters containing medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoates in recombinant Escherichia coli expressing engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase  ap. 214-217.  aGlycolate(GL)-based polyesters were for the first time produced in the recombinant Escherichia coli fatty acid β-oxidation pathway reinforcing mutant LS5218, using extracellularly added GL as a monomer precursor. Cells expressing a Ser325Thr/Gln481Lys mutant of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase (PhaC1STQK) from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, propionyl-CoA transferase from Megasphaera elsdenii and enoyl-CoA hydratase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on GL and dodecanoate were found to produce novel copolymers of GL with 3-hydroxyalkanoates (3HAs) (C₄–C₁₂), P(GL-co-3HA), with a weight-average molecular weight of 34,000. The ¹H and ¹³C NMR analyses of the copolymer revealed the incorporation of GL units into the polymer chain. This result demonstrates that PhaC1STQK polymerized glycolyl-CoA as a monomer substrate.

B.10aFluorinated Boron Nitride Nanotube Quantum Dots: A Spin Filter  ap. 11494-11498.  aSpin filtering requires a selective transmission of spin-polarized carriers. A perfect spin filter allows all majority (or minority) spin carriers to pass through a channel while blocking the minority (or majority) carriers. The quest for a novel low-dimensional metal-free magnetic material that would exhibit magnetism at a higher temperature with an excellent spin filtering property has been intensively pursued. Herein, using a first-principles approach, we demonstrate that the fluorinated boron nitride nanotube (F-BNNT) quantum dot, which is ferromagnetic in nature, can be used as a perfect spin filter with efficiency as high as 99.8%. Our calculation shows that the ferromagnetic spin ordering in F-BNNT is stable at a higher temperature. Comparison of the conductance value of the F-BNNT quantum dot with that of the pristine BNNT quantum dot reveals a significantly higher conductance in F-BNNT, which is in very good agreement with the experimental report (Tang, C., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 6552).  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3ananotubes 3aquantum dots 3atemperature1 aPati, Ranjit0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Aug. 13, v. 136, no. 32 p.11494-11498dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja505757f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013500161300001600296520064800312592002800960650002100988650001001009650001601019650002401035650002301059650001101082650002101093650001101114650001401125650002401139700001701163700001801180700001601198700001401214700001601228773013001244856008201374852000901456655001201465IND60588983620221120090127.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058898362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-017-0220-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Wei10aBrain lipid binding protein mediates the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells by regulating ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vitro  ap. 156-162.  aBrain lipid binding protein (BLBP) is highly expressed in the radial glial cells (RGCs) of the central nervous system (CNS), in glioblastomas, and, in vitro, in U251 cells.

Our previous work showed that the two distinct subunits (Hc1 and Hc2) of haemocyanin (Hc), a copper‐containing protein, display embryo‐specific high expression that is essential for embryonic development and survival in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. Here we investigated the role of haemocyanins in oxygen sensing and supply in the embryo of this locust. Putative binding sites for hypoxia‐regulated transcription factors were identified in the promoter region of all of the Hc1 and Hc2 genes. Embryonic expression of haemocyanins was highly upregulated by ambient O₂ deprivation, up to 10‐fold at 13% O₂ content. The degree of upregulation of haemocyanins increased with increasing levels of hypoxia. Compared with low‐altitude locusts, embryonic expression of haemocyanins in high‐altitude locusts from Tibetan plateau was constitutively higher and more robust to oxygen deprivation. These findings strongly suggest an active involvement of haemocyanins in oxygen exchange in embryos. We thus propose a mechanistic model for embryo respiration in which haemocyanin plays a key role by complementing the tracheal system for oxygen transport during embryogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLocusta migratoria 3aaerobiosis 3aaltitude 3abinding sites 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3ahemocyanin 3ahypoxia 3alocusts 3amechanistic models 3amigratory behavior 3aoxygen 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aChina1 aMa, R.1 aDing, D.1 aWei, L.1 aKang, L.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2017 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.461-468dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl52413x0962-10757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/imb.123103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245014500208300001600353520180900369592002802178650001202206650003602218650001502254650002002269650001402289650002902303650001502332650001102347650001502358650001402373651001802387653005202405653004102457653001602498653003002514700001602544700002302560700001802583700001602601700002202617700005402639700002402693700001602717700001502733700001902748700002102767700002002788700001902808700001702827773020702844856008703051961001203138852000903150655001203159IND60625577320221119122422.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062557732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Limin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2843-694412aA new generation of the United States National Land Cover Database: Requirements, research priorities, design, and implementation strategies  ap. 108-123.  aThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released four National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3aautomation 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adecision support systems 3aland cover 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprotocols 3aUnited States 0aUnited States National Land Cover Database 2016 0aMulti-temporal land cover and change 0aMethodology 0aImplementation strategies1 aJin, Suming1 aDanielson, Patrick1 aHomer, Collin1 aGass, Leila1 aBender, Stacie M.1 aCase, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6342-58531 aCostello, Catherine1 aDewitz, Jon1 aFry, Joyce1 aFunk, Michelle1 aGranneman, Brian1 aLiknes, Greg C.1 aRigge, Matthew1 aXian, George0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2018 Dec., v. 146 p.108-123dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Daytime averages and peak differences in O<inf>3</inf> concentrations from weekdays to weekends were used as a proxy of WE occurrence. All MAs exhibited the occurrence of WE in all years at least in one monitoring site. Substantial differences in O<inf>3</inf> daytime averages and peaks from weekdays to weekends have decreased over time in all MAs, and since 1998 and 2013 for the MCMA and GMA, respectively, higher O<inf>3</inf> levels during weekends are typical during most of the year. The largest variations in the O<inf>3</inf> WE were observed at downwind and urban core sites of the MCMA and GMA. Significant increasing trends (p < 0.05) in the O<inf>3</inf> WE magnitude were observed for Sundays at all sites within the MCMA, with trends in annual averages ranging between 0.33 and 1.29 ppb O<inf>3</inf> yr&minus;1. Within the GMA, for Sundays, fewer sites exhibited increasing trends in the WE occurrence and at lower growth rates (0.32 and 0.48 ppb yr&minus;1, p < 0.1) than within the MCMA, while within the MMA no apparent trends were observed in marked contrast with the MCMA and GMA. Our findings suggest that policies implemented have been successful in controlling weekday ground-level O<inf>3</inf> within the MCMA and GMA, but further actions must be introduced to control the increases in the O<inf>3</inf> WE magnitude and spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3ametropolitan areas 3amonitoring 3aozone 3aMexico1 aLopez-Farias, Rodrigo1 aPiña-Mondragón, José  J.1 aPichardo-Corpus, Juan  A.1 aDelgadillo-Ruiz, Olivia1 aFlores-Torres, Arnoldo1 aGarcía-Reynoso, Agustín1 aRuiz-Suárez, Luis  G.1 aMendoza, Alberto0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100933303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015900171300001600330520153600346592002801882650002101910650001101931650002801942650001001970650001501980650001001995650001102005650001202016650003202028650003102060650000902091650002102100650001402121650002002135650001002155650001302165651001002178653002102188653003102209653006202240653002402302700001502326700001602341700001402357700001802371700005502389700001602444700001602460700001702476700001602493773009502509856008702604852000902691655001202700IND60557331220221119003433.0190408e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055733122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.08.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Huijuan10aSubtyping Salmonella enterica serovar Derby with multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)  ap. 474-484.  aSalmonella Derby is one of the most prevalent serovars in pork and the most common serotype isolated from infants and toddlers. However, Salmonella Derby is also poorly understood, so we used Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) to subtype 100 Salmonella Derby isolates from pig farms, pig slaughterhouses, retail markets and humans that were collected during different years in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, in respect to the transmission of clonal groups of the serovar along the food chain. MLST analysis showed that two sequence type (ST) patterns (ST40 and ST71) were shared, and ST40 was the most common sequence type among isolates from four different sources. CRISPRs typing identified 32 different Derby CRISPR types (DCTs); ST40 and ST71 strains had 21 and 11 DCTs respectively, demonstrating the distinctiveness of the CRISPR regions among the isolates from the four sources during a seven-year period. It demonstrated that Salmonella Derby clones persisted in the same places and spread along the pork production chain. Overall, 100 spacers were analysed, including 61 for CRISPR1 (18 new) and 39 for CRISPR2 (17 new). Interestingly, we also found that the spacer arrangements were distinct between ST40 and ST71 strains, except for strain 13-S1. This analysis revealed that CRISPR genes are highly polymorphic even in the same serotype, which could be tremendously useful for bacterial subtyping during molecular epidemiological investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Derby 3aclones 3aepidemiological studies 3afarms 3afood chain 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainfants 3alivestock and meat industry 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apork 3aretail marketing 3aserotypes 3aslaughterhouses 3aswine 3atoddlers 3aChina 0aSalmonella Derby 0aMultilocus sequence typing 0aClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 0aMolecular subtyping1 aHu, Yachen1 aLi, Qiuchun1 aTao, Jing1 aCai, Yinqiang1 aWang, Yanan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7461-21951 aLi, Jingwen1 aZhou, Zihao1 aPan, Zhiming1 aJiao, Xinan0 tFood control.g2017 Mar., v. 73 p.474-484dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.08.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04617naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011500171300001500286500001900301520289000320592002803210650002503238650000803263650002003271650001003291650002303301650001903324650000903343650000903352650001903361650001703380650001803397650001403415650001503429650001503444650001203459650001003471650002303481650002703504650001403531650001403545650001403559653001403573653002203587653001503609653003703624653003803661653003203699653002103731700001903752700002103771700002003792773011203812856008203924852000904006655001204015IND60714152520221117230103.0201206e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071415252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2020.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Cristian10aBoth quiescent and proliferating cells circulate in the blood of the invasive apple snail Pomacea canaliculata  ap. 95-103.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGastropod hematopoiesis occurs at specialized tissues in some species, but the evidence also suggests that hemocyte generation is maybe widespread in the connective tissues or the blood system in others. In Ampullariidae (Caenogastropoda), both the kidney and the lung contain putative hematopoietic cells, which react to immune challenges. In the current study, we wanted to explore if hematopoiesis occurs in the blood of Pomacea canaliculata. Thus, we obtained circulating hemocytes from donor animals and tested their ability to proliferate in the blood of conspecific recipients. We tracked cell proliferation by labeling the donors' hemocytes with the fluorescent cell proliferation marker carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Transferred CFSE-labeled hemocytes survived and proliferated into the recipients’ circulation for at least 17 days. We also determined the cell cycle status of circulating hemocytes by using the propidium iodide (PI) and acridine orange (AO) staining methods. Flow cytometry analyses showed that most PI-stained hemocytes were in the G1 phase (~96%), while a lower proportion of cells were through the G2/S-M transition (~4%). When we instead used AO-staining, we further distinguished a subpopulation of cells (~5%) of low size, complexity-granularity, and RNA content. We regarded this subpopulation as quiescent cells. In separate experimental sets, we complemented these findings by assessing in circulating hemocytes two evolutionary conserved features of quiescent, undifferentiated cells. First, we used JC-1 staining to determine the mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψₘ) of circulating hemocytes, which is expected to be low in quiescent cells. Most hemocytes (~87%) showed high aggregation of JC-1, which indicates a high Ψₘ. Besides that, a small hemocyte subpopulation (~11%) showed low aggregation of the dye, thus indicating a low Ψₘ. It is known that the transition from a quiescent to a proliferating state associates with an increase of the Ψₘ. The specificity of these changes was here controlled by membrane depolarization with the Ψₘ disruptor CCCP. Second, we stained hemocytes with Hoechst33342 dye to determine the efflux activity of ABC transporters, which participate in the multixenobiotic resistance system characteristic of undifferentiated cells. Most hemocytes (>99%) showed a low dye-efflux activity, but a small proportion of cells (0.06–0.12%) showed a high dye-efflux activity, which was significantly inhibited by 100 and 500 μM verapamil, and thus is indicative of an undifferentiated subpopulation of circulating hemocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that, among circulating hemocytes, there are cells with the ability to proliferate or to stay in a quiescent state and behave as progenitor cells later, either in the circulation or the hematopoietic tissues/organs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPomacea canaliculata 3aRNA 3aacridine orange 3ablood 3acell proliferation 3aconspecificity 3adyes 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3ahematopoiesis 3ahemocytes 3aimmunology 3ainterphase 3akidneys 3alungs 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3apropidium 3ashellfish 3averapamil 0aStem cell 0aHemocyte transfer 0aCell cycle 0aMitochondrial membrane potential 0aMultixenobiotic resistance system 0aAngiostrongylus cantonensis 0aInvasive species1 aSimon, Valeska1 aConget, Paulette1 aVega, Israel A.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2020 Dec., v. 107 p.95-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008400164300001600248520133400264592002801598650000801626650001101634650001101645650001501656650001801671650001901689650001401708650001601722650001501738651001501753700001301768700001501781700001501796773010201811856008101913852000901994655001202003IND60121530420221118231921.0150405e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012153042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-014-9983-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jinbao10aImpact of Surface Waves on the Steady Near-Surface Wind Profiles over the Ocean  ap. 111-127.  aThe impacts of surface waves on the steady near-surface wind profiles in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are studied based on the Ekman theory, modified by introducing a wave-induced component on the total stress. An analytic solution is presented for the wave-modified Ekman model for an eddy viscosity coefficient varying linearly with height. The solution can be determined by the two-dimensional wavenumber spectrum of ocean waves, the wave-growth or decay rate, the geostrophic wind velocity, the Coriolis parameter and the densities of air and water. Wind profiles are calculated as examples for two cases: one with a monochromatic wave and the other with a fully-developed wind-generated sea. The effects of the surface waves on the wind profiles in the marine ABL are illustrated, and solutions proposed are compared with those of the model where the wave-induced stress is neglected. The solutions are also compared with observations from a tower on Östergarnsholm Island in the Baltic Sea. Illustrative examples and the comparisons between observations and the theoretical predictions demonstrate that the surface waves have a considerable impact, not only on the near-surface mean wind profile, but also on the turbulence structure of the marine ABL, as they change qualitatively the structure of the ABL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3amodels 3aoceans 3aprediction 3asurface waves 3aturbulent flow 3aviscosity 3awater waves 3awind speed 3aBaltic Sea1 aFan, Wei1 aLi, Shuang1 aZhou, Ming0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2015 Apr., v. 155, no. 1 p.111-127dSpringer-Verlagx0006-83147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-014-9983-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012600170300001600296520156000312592002801872650001501900650002001915650002901935650001101964650001401975650001501989653002302004653001102027653002702038653001602065653001902081653000802100700001702108700001702125773020702142856008702349852000902436655001202445IND60625577520221119122411.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062557752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Hongchao10aDEM refinement by low vegetation removal based on the combination of full waveform data and progressive TIN densification  ap. 260-271.  aFiltering of low vegetation with height less than approximately 1.5 m is a challenging problem, especially in mountainous areas covered by heavy low foliage, bushes and sub-shrubberies, etc. The paper proposes an approach for obtaining a more accurate Digital Elevation Model (DEM) by removing low vegetation from point cloud. The approach combines point cloud with full waveform data, and begins by filtering point cloud by way of progressive TIN densification (PTD) method. Ground points are thus extracted, but mixed with false ground points, which are mainly from low vegetation and other manmade low objects. Gaussian decomposition by grouping Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm with F test is performed for the full waveforms corresponding to the extracted ground points. Echo widths and backscattering coefficients are calculated based on the parameters extracted from the decomposition, and used to discriminate points of low vegetation from points of other low objects, allowing the false ground points reflected from low vegetation to be labeled. New elevation values are calculated from the last echoes of the waveforms from low vegetation, and the DEM is updated by replacing the original elevations with the calculated ones. The resultants are assessed both quantitatively by check points and qualitatively by rendered DEM and contour lines generated from it. The accuracy of the refined DEM with low vegetation removal increases by 31% compared with the original DEM in the experiment, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adigital elevation models 3aleaves 3amountains 3avegetation 0aFull waveform data 0aF test 0aGaussian decomposition 0aPoint cloud 0aLow vegetation 0aDEM1 aZhou, Weiwei1 aZhang, Liang0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2018 Dec., v. 146 p.260-271dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Particularly, in sea urchins, the immune system has been shown to be complex, especially in terms of the variety of immune genes and molecules described. A key component of the response to external pathogens are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are a well-characterized class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that participate in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Despite the fact that TLRs have been described in several sea urchin species, for the red sea urchin (Loxechinus albus), which is one of the most important sea urchins across the world in terms of fisheries, limited information on the TLR-mediated immune response exists. In the present study, for the first time, we evaluated the effect of thermal stress, LPS and poly I:C treatment on the coelomocyte immune response of Loxechinus albus to determine how these factors modulate TLR and strongylocin (antimicrobial peptides of echinoderms) responses. We show that the tlr3-like, tlr4-like, tlr6-like and tlr8-like transcripts are modulated by poly I:C, while LPS only modulates the tlr4-like response; there was no effect of temperature on TLR expression, as evaluated by RT-qPCR. Additionally, we showed that strongylocin-1 and strongylocin-2 are modulated in response to simulated viral infection with poly I:C, providing the first evidence of strongylocin expression in L. albus. Finally, we determined that temperature and LPS modify the viability of coelomocytes, while poly I:C treatment did not affect the viability of these cells. This study contributes to the knowledge of immune responses in sea urchins to improve the understanding of the role of TLRs and strongylocins in echinoderms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acoelomocytes 3afish 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3ashellfish 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3aviability 3aRed Sea 0aRed sea urchin 0aToll-like receptor 0aStrongylocins 0aEchinoderms1 aVillagra, Maximiliano1 aGonzález, Joaquín,1 aFuentes, Marcia1 aEstrada, Juan Manuel1 aValenzuela, Cristian1 aMolina, Alfredo1 aValdés, Juan Antonio,0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2020 Dec., v. 107 p.187-193dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009600171300001600267520100400283592002801287650001601315650000801331650001001339650003701349650002001386650001601406650001901422650002101441650002401462650002101486650002201507700002201529700001801551700002101569700002601590700002301616700001701639700001701656700001901673773012701692856008201819852000901901655001201910IND60089580320221121014722.0141102e20120525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008958032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, My Hanh Thi10aPhosphorylation by AtMPK6 is required for the biological function of AtMYB41 in Arabidopsis  ap. 181-186.  aMitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) are involved in a number of signaling pathways that control plant development and stress tolerance via the phosphorylation of target molecules. However, so far only a limited number of target molecules have been identified. Here, we provide evidence that MYB41 represents a new target of MPK6. MYB41 interacts with MPK6 not only in vitro but also in planta. MYB41 was phosphorylated by recombinant MPK6 as well as by plant MPK6. Ser²⁵¹ in MYB41 was identified as the site phosphorylated by MPK6. The phosphorylation of MYB41 by MPK6 enhanced its DNA binding to the promoter of a LTP gene. Interestingly, transgenic plants over-expressing MYB41ᵂᵀ showed enhanced salt tolerance, whereas transgenic plants over-expressing MYB41S²⁵¹ᴬ showed decreased salt tolerance during seed germination and initial root growth. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of MYB41 by MPK6 is required for the biological function of MYB41 in salt tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3agenes 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aroot growth 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3asignal transduction 3astress tolerance 3atransgenic plants1 aNguyen, Xuan Canh1 aLee, Kyunghee1 aKwon, Young Sang1 aPham, Huyen Trang Thi1 aPark, Hyeong Cheol1 aYun, Dae-Jin1 aLim, Chae Oh1 aChung, Woo Sik0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 May 25, v. 422, no. 1 p.181-186dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245007500168300002000243520141200263592002801675650001401703650001601717650001101733650001501744650002301759650001901782650001601801700002801817700002901845700002901874773012901903856008202032852000902114655001202123IND60566860320221120130106.0170413e20160630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056686032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b047412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhaskar, Prashant10aRadiatively Dominated Charge Carrier Recombination in Black Phosphorus  ap. 13836-13842.  aWe show that black phosphorus is a highly efficient infrared emitter. To study the carrier dynamics, excess electron–hole pairs were generated in bulk black phosphorus by irradiation with 3 MeV electron pulses. The transient microwave conductivity due to excess charges was measured as a function of time for different initial charge densities at temperatures in the range 203–373 K. A new global analysis scheme, including the treatment of intrinsic carriers, is provided, which shows that the recombination dynamics in black phosphorus, a low bandgap semiconductor, is strongly influenced by the presence of intrinsic carriers. The temperature dependence of the charge mobility and charge carrier decay via second-order radiative recombination is obtained from modeling of the experimental data. The combined electron and hole mobility was found to increase with temperature up to 250 K and decrease above that. Auger recombination is negligible for the studied densities of excess electron–hole pairs up to 2.5 × 10¹⁷ cm–³. For this density the major fraction of the excess electrons and holes undergoes radiative recombination. It is further inferred that for excess charge densities of the order of 10¹⁸ cm–³ electrons and holes recombine with near unity radiative yield. The latter offers promising prospects for use of black phosphorus as efficient mid infrared emitter in devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrons 3airradiation 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3aphysical chemistry 3asemiconductors 3atemperature1 aAchtstein, Alexander W.1 aVermeulen, Martien

Antigen pool testing can increase the test rate and shorten the screening time, thus being a valuable approach for epidemic prevention and control. However, the overall percent agreement (OPA) with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one-half to three-quarters, hampering it from being a comprehensive method, especially pool testing, beyond the gold-standard PCR. Here, a multiantibodies transistor assay is developed for sensitive and highly precise antigen pool testing. The multiantibodies capture SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 proteins with different configurations, resulting in an antigen-binding affinity down to 0.34 fM. The limit of detection reaches 3.5 × 10–¹⁷ g mL–¹SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein in artificial saliva, 4–5 orders of magnitude lower than existing transistor sensors. The testing of 60 nasopharyngeal swabs exhibits ∼100% OPA with PCR within an average diagnoses time of 38.9 s. Owing to its highly precise feature, a portable integrated platform is fabricated, which achieves 10-in-1 pooled screening for high testing throughput. This work solves the long-standing problem of antigen pool testing, enabling it to be a valuable tool in precise diagnoses and population-wide screening of COVID-19 or other epidemics in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantigens 3adetection limit 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asaliva 3atransistors1 aGuo, Mingquan1 aWu, Yanling1 aCao, Ban-Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3673-73061 aWang, Xuejun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7034-04601 aWu, Yungen1 aKang, Hua1 aKong, Derong1 aZhu, Zhaoqin1 aYing, Tianlei1 aLiu, Yunqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5521-23161 aWei, Dacheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3593-98970 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 143, no. 47 p.19794-19801dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c085983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245010600167300001500273520183000288592002802118650002402146650002102170650001902191650002502210650001502235650001602250650002002266650003002286650002902316650002102345650002102366650001402387650002502401650002602426650002002452651001002472653003202482653001602514653001702530653001502547653002902562653003102591700001802622700001702640773011902657856008802776852000902864655001202873IND60571051920221122130447.0180830e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057105192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yili10aEnvironmental performance evaluation of different municipal solid waste management scenarios in China  ap. 98-106.  aCurrently, the overwhelming majority of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been treated in sanitary landfills and incineration plants in China. In future, with the popularization of separate waste collection, it is logical to treat the biodegradable components using biological treatment technologies. To determine the advantages and disadvantages of each waste management strategy, both life-cycle inventory analysis and impact assessment are applied. The advantages and disadvantages of each waste management strategy is evaluated using environmental performances of these management methods on multi-dimensions as waste reduction, stabilization, material recovery, energy recovery, and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. These results showed that the scenarios of raw MSW landfilling would result in minimal waste reduction (34.8%) and stabilization (87.8%) rate as well as significant amounts of GHG emissions (116.7–192.2kg-CO2Eq/t). On the other hand, the incineration scenario exhibited significant superiorities on these dimensions with a 79.2% reduction rate, 100% stabilization rate, and 124.3kg-CO2Eq/t GHG reduction. Moreover, 1163.1MJ/t of electricity could be recovered from the incineration process. The unique advantage of these scenarios with separated biodegradable components treated by biological methods was the land application of the biological treated residue. A maximum of 89.3kg/t or 122.0kg/t material could be recovered when composting or anaerobic digestion (AD) of the biodegradable fractions with incineration of the high calorific value components (HCVCs), followed by residue landfilling. However, when the waste-generated bio-fertilizer could not be applied by field, these waste management scenarios with classified treatment would yield less competitive benefits in each evaluation dimension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiofertilizers 3abiological treatment 3acomposting 3aelectricity 3aenergy recovery 3aenvironmental performance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aland application 3alandfills 3alife cycle inventory 3amunicipal solid waste 3awaste reduction 3aChina 0aMunicipal solid waste (MSW) 0aLandfilling 0aIncineration 0aComposting 0aAnaerobic digestion (AD) 0aLife cycle inventory (LCI)1 aXing, Peixuan1 aLiu, Jianguo0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2017 Oct., v. 125 p.98-106dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001400183245012200197300002000319506007600339520107700415592002801492506003701520650001501557650001501572650002201587650001901609650001501628650000901643650001601652650001201668650001101680650001801691650001401709650001501723650003401738650001601772700002301788700001601811700001301827700001401840700001501854700001701869700001701886700001601903700001701919700002001936700001701956773013401973856007802107852000902185655001202194IND60541667420221207142554.0161112e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054166742DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b085332doi7 aPMC48982692pmcid7 a265627392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuan10aIonic Functionalization of Hydrophobic Colloidal Nanoparticles To Form Ionic Nanoparticles with Enzymelike Properties  ap. 14952-14958.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInorganic colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by a layer of hydrophobic surfactant on their surfaces have poor solubility in the aqueous phase, thus limiting their application as biosensors under physiological conditions.

Surfaces of neutral hydrophobic NPs were converted to multicharged ions, thus making them soluble in water. Furthermore, peroxidase-like activity was observed for ionic FePt, Fe₃O₄, Pd, and CdSe NPs, of which FePt and CdSe catalyzed the oxidation of the colorless substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to the blue-colored product in the absence of H₂O₂, while Pd and Fe₃O₄ catalyzed the oxidization of TMB in the presence of H₂O₂. With the benefit of the ionic functionalization protocols described herein, colloidal NPs should gain wider use as biomarkers, nanozymes, and biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3aions 3airon oxides 3aligands 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3asolubility 3astandard operating procedures 3asurfactants1 aPurich, Daniel L.,1 aWu, Cuichen1 aWu, Yuan1 aChen, Tao1 aCui, Cheng1 aZhang, Liqin1 aCansiz, Sena1 aHou, Weijia1 aWang, Yanyue1 aYang, Shengyuan1 aTan, Weihong0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 137, no. 47 p.14952-14958dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b085333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002800181245008900209300001800298506007600316520138900392592002801781506003701809650002801846650001201874650001401886650001801900650002001918650001001938650002601948650001201974650001501986650001302001650001802014650001702032650001402049650002702063650003502090650001802125650003102143650004202174650002102216650002002237650001502257650002402272650005102296650004402347700001902391700002102410700002002431773013702451856004302588852000902631655001202640IND4468263820221207142706.0120523e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446826382DNAL7 a224924522pmid7 aPMC33705462pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.07201-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMastropaolo, Matthew D.10aNovel Genes Involved in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 Motility and Biofilm Formation  ap. 4318-4329.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdnA in Pseudomonas fluorescens, an ortholog of FleQ in P. aeruginosa, regulates both motility and flagellum-mediated attachment to various surfaces. A whole-genome microarray determined the AdnA transcriptome by comparing the gene expression pattern of wild-type Pf0-1 to that of Pf0-2x (adnA deletion mutant) in broth culture. In the absence of AdnA, expression of 92 genes was decreased, while 11 genes showed increased expression. Analysis of 16 of these genes fused to lacZ confirmed the microarray results. Several genes were further evaluated for their role in motility and biofilm formation. Two genes, Pfl01_1508 and Pfl01_1517, affected motility and had different effects on biofilm formation in Pf0-1. These two genes are predicted to specify proteins similar to the glycosyl transferases FgtA1 and FgtA2, which have been shown to be involved in virulence and motility in P. syringae. Three other genes, Pfl01_1516, Pfl01_1572, and Pfl01_1573, not previously associated with motility and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas had similar effects on biofilm formation in Pf0-1. Deletion of each of these genes led to different motility defects. Our data revealed an additional level of complexity in the control of flagellum function beyond the core genes known to be required and may yield insights into processes important for environmental persistence of P. fluorescens Pf0-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abiofilm 3aflagellum 3agene deletion 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3aprediction 3aproteins 3atranscriptome 3atransferases 3avirulence 2aArtificial Gene Fusion 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenes, Reporter 2aLocomotion 2aMicroarray Analysis 2aPseudomonas fluorescensxgeneticsxphysiology. 2abeta-Galactosidasexanalysisxgenetics.1 aSilby, Mark W.1 aNicoll, Julie S.1 aLevy, Stuart B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2012 June 15, v. 78, no. 12 p.4318-4329dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.07201-11  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009900174300001600273520108900289592002801378650001401406650001601420650001301436650000901449650001101458650002501469650000901494650002001503650001301523650001501536653001301551653002001564653001301584653001401597653002201611653003001633700002801663700002401691773012101715856008201836852000901918655001201927IND60089763620221121214839.0160728e20130628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008976362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.05.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizurini, Daniella M.10aAegyptin inhibits collagen-induced coagulation activation in vitro and thromboembolism in vivo  ap. 235-239.  aAegyptin is a mosquito salivary gland protein and potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Aegyptin binds to the von Willebrand factor-binding site on collagen and prevents its interaction with platelets. Because collagen also induces plasma clotting by activation of factor XII, we evaluated the effects of aegyptin on collagen-induced coagulation activation and how it interferes with thrombosis in three different in vivo models. Our results demonstrate that aegyptin abolishes collagen-induced clot formation and thrombin generation in platelet-free plasma. Aegyptin has no antithrombotic activity in the arteriovenous shunt model (collagen-independent) but it prevents laser-induced collagen-mediated thrombus formation in rats. Furthermore, aegyptin protects mice from collagen and epinephrine-induced thromboembolism. Therefore, aegyptin has a dual antithrombotic mechanism: inhibition of platelet-collagen interaction and collagen’s pro-coagulant activity. This is the first description of a collagen-binding protein that also inhibits collagen-mediated coagulant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3acoagulation 3acollagen 3amice 3amodels 3aplatelet aggregation 3arats 3asalivary glands 3athrombin 3athrombosis 0aAegyptin 0aMosquito saliva 0aCollagen 0aPlatelets 0aBlood coagulation 0aPulmonary thromboembolism1 aFrancischetti, Ivo M.B.1 aMonteiro, Robson Q.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 June 28, v. 436 p.235-239dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.05.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245006600181520106300247592002801310650003501338650001901373650004601392650000901438650001801447650002401465650001201489650001701501650001301518650001101531650003101542650004001573651001301613653001401626653001901640653001001659700003801669700002801707700002201735700003701757700002501794700003301819773010001852856008701952852000902039655001202048IND60674380820221121105927.0200320e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067438082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1254602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavecci-Mendonça, Bruna10aStudy of proteins with mercury in fish from the Amazon region  aThe high concentrations of mercury found in Amazon have been intensively studied by the scientific community in the last decades. These mercurial species bind preferentially to proteins. Therefore, this work proposal sought to obtain the fractionation, identification and study of mercury – bound proteins present in samples of muscular and hepatic tissue from fish collected in the reservoir of the Jirau Hydroelectric Power Plant – on the Madeira River. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) for protein fractionation, graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) for the quantification of mercury and Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) were used for the identification of proteins. Concluding the work with analysis of graphics from the Blast2go program. Two mercury – bound proteins were identified as triosephosphate isomerase A and Protein FAM45A. The data generated by the bioinformatics programs confirm the tendency of these proteins to be linked to mercury and elucity the possibles existing physiological and cellular interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioinformatics 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afish 3afractionation 3ahydroelectric power 3amercury 3apower plants 3aproteins 3arivers 3atriose-phosphate isomerase 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3aAmazonia 0aESI-MS/MS 0aBioinformatics 0aGFAAS1 aCavalcante de Souza Vieira, José1 aMonteiro de Lima, Paula1 aLeite, Aline Lima1 aBuzalaf, Marília Afonso Rabelo,1 aZara, Luiz Fabrício1 ade Magalhães Padilha, Pedro0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 309 p.125460-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1254603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245008600159300002000245520123900265592002801504650002701532650002201559650000801581650002601589650002001615650002001635650001701655650001301672650002601685650001101711650003201722650000901754650000901763650001301772700001601785700002001801700006201821700006201883773014901945856007702094852000902171655001202180IND60758718120221118071520.0211202e20211118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075871812DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c087392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Ru-Qiang10aMetallocalix[4]arene Polymers for Gravimetric Detection of N-Nitrosodialkylamines  ap. 19809-19815.  aN-Nitrosamines are found in food, drugs, air, water, and soil. They pose a significant risk to human health because of their carcinogenicity; consequently, materials that can be used to selectively and sensitively detect nitrosamines are needed. In this work, we designed and synthesized two polymers bearing calix[4]arene or 4-tert-butylcalix[4]arene tungsten–imido complexes (PCalixH and PCalixtBu) as N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) receptors. The interaction between metallocalix[4]arene monomers/polymers and NDMA was confirmed by ¹H NMR and IR spectroscopy. Single-crystal X-ray analysis further revealed that the host–guest interaction is based on binding of the terminal oxygen of NDMA to tungsten within the calixarene cavity. Gravimetric detection of NDMA was performed on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in air. Both polymers show responses to NDMA, with PCalixtBu exhibiting a low theoretical limit of detection of 5 ppb for NDMA. The sensor also shows high selectivity toward NDMA and moderate humidity tolerance. This work provides a sensitive sensor for detection of NDMA and also offers a class of new, selective, and efficient NDMA receptors for the future design of NDMA sensors and NDMA extraction materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acarcinogenicity 3adetection limit 3ahuman health 3ahumidity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3arisk 3asoil 3atungsten1 aYuan, Weize1 aCroy, Robert G.1 aEssigmann, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2196-56911 aSwager, Timothy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3577-05100 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 143, no. 47 p.19809-19815dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c087393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009100168300001600259520183700275592002802112650001802140650002202158650001802180650002102198650001902219650001902238650001502257650001802272650001702290650001602307650001502323650003702338650001302375650001902388650001402407650003202421700002002453700002102473700001702494700001802511773012702529856008202656852000902738655001202747IND60089580620221120233738.0141102e20120525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008958062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.1622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, Young-Jun10aClusterin induces the secretion of TNF-α and the chemotactic migration of macrophages  ap. 200-205.  aTumor associated macrophages are known to be closely linked with tumor progression and metastasis. On the other hand, clusterin is overexpressed in several tumor types and regarded as a putative tumor-promoting factor due to this overexpression and the subsequent induction of chemoresistance. In our previous study, clusterin was found to induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in macrophages, and MMP-9 is known to be essential for tumor cell migration and invasion via basement membrane breakdown. Because paracrine interactions between tumor cells and surrounding macrophages regulate metastasis, these findings raise the possibility that clusterin promotes the secretion of cytokines in macrophages in addition to MMP-9. Here, we demonstrate that clusterin upregulates the expressions of chemotactic cytokines, that is, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in Raw264.7 macrophages. In particular, clusterin stimulated TNF-α secretion via the activations of ERK, JNK, and PI3K/Akt pathways in a time and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, clusterin-induced TNF-α secretion was found to play a critical role in the chemotactic migration of Raw264.7 macrophages. It was also found that clusterin acts directly as a chemoattractant for macrophages. Together, these results suggest that clusterin stimulates the expression and secretion of TNF-α, which plays a critical role in promoting macrophage chemotaxis, via ERK, JNK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. Collectively, these findings describe a novel function for clusterin as an inducer of TNF-α in macrophages and their chemotactic migration, and suggest that clusterin has a tumor-promoting effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3abasement membrane 3acell movement 3achemoattractants 3achemokine CCL2 3achemokine CCL5 3achemotaxis 3adose response 3agelatinase B 3amacrophages 3ametastasis 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anecrosis 3aneoplasm cells 3asecretion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aKang, Byeong-Ho1 aChoi, Byong-Kwan1 aPark, In-Sun1 aMin, Bon-Hong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 May 25, v. 422, no. 1 p.200-205dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245008400159300001800243520130100261592002801562650001601590650001501606650001101621650002301632650001201655650001801667700001901685700001501704700001901719700005401738773014701792856007601939852000902015655001202024IND60743310820221121231536.0210707e20210623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074331082DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c041122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuai10aCopper(I)-Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation of Unsymmetrical Secondary Phosphines  ap. 9912-9921.  aA copper(I)-catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of HPAr¹Ar² with alkyl halides is uncovered, which provides an array of P-stereogenic phosphines in generally high yield and enantioselectivity. The electrophilic alkyl halides enjoy a broad substrate scope, including allyl bromides, propargyl bromide, benzyl bromides, and alkyl iodides. Moreover, 11 unsymmetrical diarylphosphines (HPAr¹Ar²) serve as competent pronucleophiles. The present methodology is also successfully applied to catalytic asymmetric double and triple alkylation, and the corresponding products were obtained in moderate diastereo- and excellent enantioselectivities. Some ³¹P NMR experiments indicate that bulky HPPhMes exhibits weak competitively coordinating ability to the Cu(I)-bisphosphine complex, and thus the presence of stoichiometric HPAr¹Ar² does not affect the enantioselectivity significantly. Therefore, the high enantioselectivity in this reaction is attributed to the high performance of the unique Cu(I)-(R,RP)-TANIAPHOS complex in asymmetric induction. Finally, one monophosphine and two bisphosphines prepared by the present reaction are employed as efficient chiral ligands to afford three structurally diversified Cu(I) complexes, which demonstrates the synthetic utility of the present methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aalkylation 3acopper 3aenantioselectivity 3aligands 3astoichiometry1 aXiao, Jun-Zhao1 aLi, Yan-Bo1 aShi, Chang-Yun1 aYin, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9604-51980 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 June 23, v. 143, no. 26 p.9912-9921dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c041123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014600163300001600309520109500325592002801420650002201448650002401470650001701494650001701511650001301528650001101541650001501552650001301567650002001580650001701600700001301617700001701630700001701647700001501664700001501679700001401694700001401708700001701722773012701739856008201866852000901948655001201957IND60089580720221120233747.0141102e20120525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008958072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huan10aCGK733 enhances multinucleated cell formation and cytotoxicity induced by taxol in Chk1-deficient HBV-positive hepatocellular carcinoma cells  ap. 103-108.  aHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly human cancers. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the predominant risk factors associated with the development of HCC and complicates the treatment of HCC. In this study, we demonstrate that a HBV-positive HCC cell line HepG2.2.15, was more resistant to chemotherapy agents than its parental HBV-negative cell line HepG2. HBV-positive HCC cells exhibited defective Chk1 phosphorylation and increased chromosomal instability. CGK733, a small molecule inhibitor reportedly targeting the kinase activities of ATM and ATR, significantly enhanced taxol-induced cytotoxicity in HBV-positive HepG2.2.15 cells. The mechanism lies in CGK733 triggers the formation of multinucleated cells thus promotes the premature mitotic exit of taxol-induced mitotic-damaged cells through multinucleation and mitotic catastrophe in HBV-positive HepG2.2.15 cells. These results suggest that CGK733 could potentially reverse the taxol resistance in HBV-positive HCC cells and may suggest a novel strategy to treat HBV-infected HCC patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3achronic hepatitis B 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3apaclitaxel 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3arisk factors1 aZuo, Bin1 aWang, Haibin1 aRen, Laifeng1 aYang, Peng1 aZeng, Ming1 aDuan, Dan1 aLiu, Cong1 aLi, Mingyuan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 May 25, v. 422, no. 1 p.103-108dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012800164300001600292520205600308592002802364650002302392650002302415650002502438650001202463650001502475650002302490650002202513650001802535650001002553651001002563700001502573700001602588700001502604773013402619856008202753852000902835655001202844IND60588984520221122234538.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058898452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-017-0422-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Jianwei10aAssessing forest sustainability trajectory with temporal changes in timber output and ecological reserve: the case of China  ap. 171-176.  aWe classified forest resources into four modes: high timber output and high ecological reserve (Mode T-E); high timber output and low ecological reserve (Mode T-e); low timber output and low ecological reserve (Mode t-e); and low timber output and high ecological reserve (Mode t-E). Ecological reserve is stand volume per unit area of natural forests and total area of natural forests; timber output is defined as total area of timber forests and unit area of timber production. We used this classification system to examine forest development in China between 1950 and 2013. Data were acquired mainly from forest inventory statistics published by China’s Forestry Administration between the 1970s and 2013. I Information from the 1950s was acquired from relevant literature. Our analysis suggests that China’s forest resources transitioned from Mode t-E to Mode T-e during the period between the early 1950s and late 1970s, resulting in the destruction of both ecological vigor and timber resources. During the following 20 years, strategies were implemented to improve the ecological reserve and increase timber supply, resulting in a decline in the rate of forest degradation. Over the past decade, China’s forest resources have reached Mode T-E as a result of improvements in both the ecological reserve and the timber supply. Currently, the total area of timber forests is relatively low, representing the limiting factor for improvement in overall forest functionality. Nevertheless, along with increased efforts to protect natural forests and develop fast-growing forest plantations, it is hopeful that China’s forest resources will achieve a sustainable state. The four-mode TOER (timber output, ecological reserve) method introduced in this paper is a simple but an effective approach for characterizing the overall quality and quantity of forest resources. The data used for this type of evaluation are typically easy to obtain and reliable. This methodology has potential to be applied to forests in various regions and countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aforest plantations 3aforestry development 3aforests 3astatistics 3atemporal variation 3atimber production 3atimber supply 3avigor 3aChina1 aZhao, Yang1 aShi, Longyu1 aLi, Fengri0 tJournal of forestry research.g2018 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.171-176dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-017-0422-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245018700167300002000354520128400374592002801658650001601686650002201702650001501724650002001739650001301759650001301772650001801785650001201803650001401815650001301829650001301842650002301855650002001878650001601898650002101914700002401935700002101959773012901980856008202109852000902191655001202200IND60566860720180615000000.0170413e20160630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056686072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b049022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehrendt, Gereon10aHydrogenation Reaction Pathways in the Systems Li3N–H2, Li3N–Mg–H2, and Li3N–MgH2–H2 by in Situ X-ray Diffraction, in Situ Neutron Diffraction, and in Situ Thermal Analysis  ap. 13450-13455.  aThe phase diagram Li–Mg–N–H offers ample opportunities for potential hydrogen storage systems. Three systems based on lithium nitride, Li₃N, were investigated by time-resolved in situ methods (thermal analysis, X-ray and neutron diffraction) at temperatures up to 703 K and hydrogen gas pressures up to 9.4 MPa. Pure lithium nitride reacts in a one-step reaction to lithium amide according to Li₃N + 2H₂ → LiNH₂ + 2LiH at 1.0 MPa hydrogen pressure. Equimolar mixtures of lithium nitride with magnesium hydride, both at 1.5 and 9.4 MPa hydrogen gas pressure, react in the same way up to 543 K, i.e., magnesium hydride does not participate in the reaction. At higher temperatures, lithium magnesium nitride is formed according to the endothermic reaction LiNH₂ + MgH₂ → LiMgN + 2H₂ at moderate (≤1.5 MPa) and via the exothermic reaction Li₃N + MgH₂ → LiMgN + 2LiH at higher hydrogen gas pressures (5.0 MPa). Mixed imide Li₂Mg(NH)₂ is formed when an excess of Li₃N is used in the reaction. The hydrogenation of mixtures of lithium nitride with magnesium starts with the formation Li₂NH and Li₄NH, followed by the mixed imide Li₂Mg(NH)₂ at higher temperatures and finally the formation of Mg₃N₂ and LiH. Deuterides react accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aendothermy 3aheat production 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3alithium 3amagnesium 3aneutrons 3anitrides 3aphysical chemistry 3aphysical phases 3atemperature 3athermal analysis1 aReichert, Christian1 aKohlmann, Holger0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 June 30, v. 120, no. 25 p.13450-13455dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b049023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010400171300001600275520145200291592002801743650001501771650001401786650002001800650001301820650001101833650001301844653002201857653001201879653000801891653001701899653002001916700005601936700002001992700001902012773020702031856008702238852000902325655001202334IND60625578220221119122101.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062557822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Junqiao10aHSW: Heuristic Shrink-wrapping for automatically repairing solid-based CityGML LOD2 building models  ap. 289-304.  aThe Level-of-Detail (LOD) 2 building models defined in CityGML are used widely in three-dimensional (3D) city applications. Many of these applications demand valid solid-based geometry (closed 2-manifold), which is crucial for analytical and computational purposes. However, this condition is often violated in practice because of the way LOD2 models are constructed and exchanged. Examples of the resulting errors include missing surfaces, intersecting building parts, and superfluous interior geometry. In this study, we present a heuristic shrink-wrapping algorithm for reconstructing valid solid-based LOD2 buildings by repairing and generalizing invalid input models. A single building model is first decomposed as intersection-free and reassembled by constrained tetrahedralization. The bounding membrane is then shrunk by incrementally carving the selected boundary tetrahedra and wrapping the expected shape of the building. In the algorithm, combinations of heuristics are proposed to guide the carving process. Topological and geometrical constraints are proposed to ensure the validity and exactness of the output model. The semantics of the input geometry are preserved and missing semantics are deduced based on pragmatic rules. We evaluated the performance of the algorithm using 3D building models, including CityGML datasets. The results showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance at repairing 3D building models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abuildings 3adata collection 3ageometry 3amodels 3atopology 0a3D building model 0aCityGML 0aLOD 0aModel repair 0aShrink-wrapping1 aLedoux, Hugo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1251-86541 aStoter, Jantien1 aFeng, Tiantian0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2018 Dec., v. 146 p.289-304dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The occurrence and antibiotics susceptibility profiles of clinical isolates of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc) from suspected cases of contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) were investigated in small ruminants of three climatic- southern, central and northern- regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Specie specific-PCR for Mmc confirmed 24% (198/825) isolates with significantly (P˂0.001) higher number (83/275; 30.18%) recovered from the northern-, followed by southern- (68/275; 24.73%) and central-regions (47/275; 17.09%), respectively. Subsequently, a total of 54 PCR-confirmed isolates (18 from each zone) were subjected to antibiogram assay. Five different common antimicrobial agents including ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, gentamycin, oxytetracycline and tylosin were tested by disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of Mmc isolates indicated that enrofloxacin exhibited the highest (P˂0.001) in vitro antibacterial activity with a maximum zone of inhibition (19±0.71mm) and the lowest MIC (0.001±0.0002mg/mL) amongst the tested antimicrobial agents, followed by gentamycin (11±0.45mm and 0.01±0.001mg/mL zone of inhibition and MIC, respectively). All these isolates were found resistant against tylosin, oxytetracycline and ceftiofur sodium: antibiotics that are favored in clinical cases of CCPP. This study concludes a high occurrence of Mmc in small ruminants during infection of CCPP, and increased resistance rate against commonly used antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma mycoides 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aceftiofur 3acontagious caprine pleuropneumonia 3aenrofloxacin 3afinancial economics 3agentamicin 3agoats 3amycoplasmosis 3aoxytetracycline 3asheep 3atylosin 3aPakistan 0aMycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri 0aMycoplasmosis 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aSheep and goats1 aSaddique, Umer1 aAhmad, Shakoor1 aHayat, Yousaf1 aRahman, Sadeeq ur1 aHassan, Mohammad Farooque1 aAli, Tariq0 tSmall ruminant research.g2017 Aug., v. 153 p.118-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245014800162300001800310520198500328592002802313650001502341650001502356650002902371650002102400650001702421650002602438650001402464650001102478650001802489650002802507650002202535650001702557650001702574650001102591650001602602700002202618700002102640700005902661700006302720773014702783856007602930852000903006655001203015IND60743310920221121231642.0210707e20210623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074331092DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c041732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRout, Yogajivan10aTuning the Fluorescence and the Intramolecular Charge Transfer of Phenothiazine Dipolar and Quadrupolar Derivatives by Oxygen Functionalization  ap. 9933-9943.  aA series of new naphthalimide and phenothiazine-based push–pull systems (NPI-PTZ1–5), in which we structurally modulate the oxidation state of the sulfur atom in the thiazine ring, i.e., S(II), S(IV), and S(VI), was designed and synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction. The effect of the sulfur oxidation state on the spectral, photophysical, and electrochemical properties was investigated. The steady-state absorption and emission results show that oxygen functionalization greatly improves the optical (absorption coefficient and fluorescence efficiency) and nonlinear optical (hyperpolarizability) features. The cyclic voltammetry experiments and the quantum mechanical calculations suggest that phenothiazine is a stronger electron donor unit relative to phenothiazine-5-oxide and phenothiazine-5,5-dioxide, while the naphthalimide is a strong electron acceptor in all cases. The advanced ultrafast spectroscopic measurements, transient absorption, and broadband fluorescence up conversion give insight into the mechanism of photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. A planar intramolecular charge transfer (PICT) and highly fluorescent excited state are populated for the oxygen-functionalized molecules NPI-PTZ2,3 and NPI-PTZ5; on the other hand, a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state is produced upon photoexcitation of the oxygen-free derivatives NPI-PTZ1 and NPI-PTZ4, with the fluorescence being thus significantly quenched. These results prove oxygen functionalization as a new effective synthetic strategy to tailor the photophysics of phenothiazine-based organic materials for different optoelectronic applications. While oxygen-functionalized compounds are highly fluorescent and promising active materials for current-to-light conversion in organic light-emitting diode devices, oxygen-free systems show very efficient photoinduced ICT and may be employed for light-to-current conversion in organic photovoltaics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3across-coupling reactions 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorescence 3alight emitting diodes 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphenothiazine 3aphotochemical reactions 3aquantum mechanics 3asolar energy 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur 3avoltammetry1 aMontanari, Chiara1 aPasciucco, Erika1 aMisra, Rajneesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3225-21251 aCarlotti, Benedetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2980-25980 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 June 23, v. 143, no. 26 p.9933-9943dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c041733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013200161300001400293500001500307520185700322592002802179650002902207650001902236650002102255650001302276650002402289650001102313650002202324650000902346650001102355650002502366650004402391650002302435650001902458650002002477650002002497651001002517653001902527700001702546700001502563700001502578700001602593700002002609773013202629856008202761852000902843655001202852IND60588984620221122234459.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058898462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-017-0430-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Kai10aEffects of continuous nitrogen addition on microbial properties and soil organic matter in a Larix gmelinii plantation in China  ap. 85-92.  a2019-12-06  aContinuous increases in anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition are likely to change soil microbial properties, and ultimately to affect soil carbon (C) storage. Temperate plantation forests play key roles in C sequestration, yet mechanisms underlying the influences of N deposition on soil organic matter accumulation are poorly understood. This study assessed the effect of N addition on soil microbial properties and soil organic matter distribution in a larch (Larix gmelinii) plantation. In a 9-year experiment in the plantation, N was applied at 100 kg N ha⁻¹ a⁻¹ to study the effects on soil C and N mineralization, microbial biomass, enzyme activity, and C and N in soil organic matter density fractions, and organic matter chemistry. The results showed that N addition had no influence on C and N contents in whole soil. However, soil C in different fractions responded to N addition differently. Soil C in light fractions did not change with N addition, while soil C in heavy fractions increased significantly. These results suggested that more soil C in heavy fractions was stabilized in the N-treated soils. However, microbial biomass C and N and phenol oxidase activity decreased in the N-treated soils and thus soil C increased in heavy fractions. Although N addition reduced microbial biomass and phenol oxidase activity, it had little effect on soil C mineralization, hydrolytic enzyme activities, δ¹³C value in soil and C–H stretch, carboxylates and amides, and C–O stretch in soil organic matter chemistry measured by Fourier transform infrared spectra. We conclude that N addition (1) altered microbial biomass and activity without affecting soil C in light fractions and (2) resulted in an increase in soil C in heavy fractions and that this increase was controlled by phenol oxidase activity and soil N availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3amineralization 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen 3asoil organic matter 3aamides 3amicrobial biomass 3asoil 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aforest plantations 3aLarix gmelinii 3aenzyme activity 3astable isotopes 3aChina 0aorganic matter1 aZhu, Jiaojun1 aGu, Jiacun1 aXu, Shuang1 aYu, Lizhong1 aWang, Zhengquan0 tJournal of forestry research.g2018 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.85-92dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-017-0430-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100001800195245015500213506007600368506003100444520117900475592002801654596008301682596004501765596002701810596002001837506003701857650002301894650000901917650001501926650001501941650001401956650001801970650000901988650002101997650002802018650001502046650001902061650002102080650002002101650001402121653001402135653001802149653002202167653001902189653001402208653003002222700001802252700001802270700003302288773010002321856008702421852000902508655001202517IND60674381120221207101113.0191231e20200425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067438112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1256992chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1256992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Tiantian10aManipulation of the dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) matrix by hydrothermal and high-pressure treatments: Impact on in vitro bile salt-binding ability  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe capacity of high-fiber foods to sequester BS during digestion is considered a mechanism to lower serum-cholesterol. We investigated the effect of hydrothermal (HT) and high-hydrostatic-pressure (HHP) on the bile salt (BS)-binding ability of dry beans, and how this relates to changes in bean microstructure, fiber content (insoluble-IDF/soluble-SDF), and viscosity. HT and HHP-600 MPa led to significant IDF reduction, including resistant starch (RS), whereas 150–450 MPa significantly increased RS, without modifying IDF/SDF content. Microscopy analysis showed that heating disrupted the bean cell wall integrity, protein matrix and starch granules more severely than 600 MPa; however, tightly-packed complexes of globular starch granules-protein-cell wall fiber formed at HHP ≤ 450 MPa. While HT significantly reduced BS-binding efficiency despite no viscosity change, HHP-treatments maintained or enhanced BS-retention. 600 MPa-treatment induced the maximum BS-binding ability and viscosity. These results demonstrate that BS-binding by beans is not solely based on their fiber content or viscosity, but is influenced by additional microstructural factors.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cArcher Daniels Midland  cHealth Research0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abile 3abile salts 3acell walls 3adry beans 3afiber content 3aheat 3ahigh fiber foods 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3aresistant starch 3astarch granules 3aviscosity 0aDry beans 0aDietary fiber 0aBile salt-binding 0aMicrostructure 0aViscosity 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure1 aO'Keefe, Sean1 aDuncan, Susan1 aFernández-Fraguas, Cristina0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Apr. 25, v. 310 p.125699-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1256993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245007800174300001600252520224500268592002802513650002602541650003102567650002902598650001402627650001302641650000902654650001102663650001302674650000902687650001402696650001802710651001302728653001902741653001502760653001402775653002902789653002702818773010802845856009002953852000903043655001203052IND60571052320221120182940.0190405e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057105232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQueiroga, M.C.10aPrevalence and aetiology of sheep mastitis in Alentejo region of Portugal  ap. 123-130.  aMastitis in ewes is responsible for massive economic expenses. Other than the loss of ewes due to clinical mastitis, when subclinical mastitis occurs, because it is not readily detected, the milk with the causative pathogens is used to make dairy products. This fact is disadvantageous both for the technological process and for the consumer security. The knowledge of prevalence and aetiological agents of mastitis is of outmost importance to carry out an effective control of mastitis in sheep. The aim of this work is to bring out ovine mastitis information in Portugal.We conducted a study focused on 18 milking producing sheep flocks to determine the prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis and to assess the aetiology of mastitis in sheep.Four hundred and fourteen milk samples randomly collected from sheep with subclinical mastitis and 27 milk samples from animals with clinical mastitis were bacteriological analysed according to an adaptation of the National Mastitis Council methodology. Anaerobic bacteria were also assessed. The identification was processed based on biochemical characterization, using the API system, API Staph, API 20 Strep, API 20 E, API 20 NE and API Coryne (BioMérieux).The results revealed high subclinical mastitis (SCM) prevalence (32.2%) and low clinical mastitis (CM) prevalence (1.7%). There was a higher prevalence in mechanically milked sheep than in hand milked animals.Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) were in account of 42.9% of the CM events. Staphylococcus epidermidis represented 25% of all CM causative agents. Regarding subclinical mastitis, 70.1% of aetiological agents were identified as CNS species. From these, 43.4% were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis accounting for 30.4% of total aetiological agents of SCM. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 22 specimens (6.2%) from SCM cases, which is of outmost importance in terms of public health, and Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated 15 times (4.2%) and showed to be in account of subclinical outbreaks with high prevalence rates.The fact that the majority of mastitis events were due to coagulate negative staphylococci out stresses the need for a proper management and rigorous hygienic milking procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aanaerobes 3abacteria 3aewes 3aflocks 3amastitis 3amilk 3apathogens 3apublic health 3aPortugal 0aSheep mastitis 0aPrevalence 0aAetiology 0aCalifornia mastitis test 0aIntramammary infection0 tSmall ruminant research.g2017 Aug., v. 153 p.123-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009300165300001800258520202600276592002802302596008402330596007702414596007302491650001102564650002302575650003002598650001802628650001502646650001902661650001302680650002202693650002002715650002002735700001702755700005602772773011902828856008502947852000903032655001203041IND60773378320221121084321.0220413e20220322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077337832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c001192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aStereochemistry-Induced Discrimination in Reaction Kinetics of Photo-RAFT Initialization  ap. 2463-2474.  aPhotoinduced reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (photo-RAFT) polymerization combines conventional RAFT polymerization with photochemistry, in which the carbon radicals (R radicals) are generated from RAFT agents (except the cases using external radical photoinitiators) by direct photolysis or photoredox catalysis. As one of the key components, RAFT agent is responsible for living control of photo-RAFT polymerization and various reaction kinetics in the processes of activation/deactivation, propagation, and termination. Despite considerable efforts having been devoted to investigating structural effect of RAFT agents on polymerization kinetics, the impact of stereochemistry in RAFT agents is still underexplored. In this article, we presented a significant stereochemical effect of initial RAFT agents on the kinetics of a photo-RAFT polymerization during the initialization period (the period of consumption of initial RAFT agent). Specifically, two diastereomeric RAFT agents were synthesized and employed for photo-RAFT polymerization. Under a condition of low monomer/RAFT agent ratio, we observed distinct consumption rates of two RAFT agents in separated polymerization systems, with one diastereomer faster than the other. A similar result was observed in the mixed polymerization system (a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomeric RAFT agents), demonstrating a discrimination in RAFT agent consumption in spite of the presence of RAFT chain transfer. Additionally, this discrimination was also present in thermally initiated RAFT polymerization, whereas an opposite trend was observed in the separated systems. The kinetics of initialization processes was analyzed with the aid of density functional theory calculations, which provided plausible explanation of such discrimination. The reported stereochemical effect applies to long dormant RAFT polymer chains beyond the initialization period, in which different stereochemical R groups are always present over the course of RAFT polymerization.  aPublisher supplied data  aFT160100095cAustralian Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923  aNAcUniversity of New South Walesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001773  aNAcChina Scholarship Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004543 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3adiastereomers 3aphotolysis 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3areaction kinetics 3aredox reactions 3astereochemistry1 aLin, Shiyang1 aXu, Jiangtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9020-70180 tMacromolecules.g2022 Mar. 22, v. 55, no. 7 p.2463-2474dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c001193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245005800166300001800224520170200242592002801944650002101972650001901993650004402012650001102056650001602067700002702083700002402110700002002134700001802154700002202172700002002194773010502214856008602319852000902405655001202414IND60579539220180731000000.0170822e20170822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057953922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b006982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSotta, Paul10aNonentropic Reinforcement in Elastomer Nanocomposites  ap. 6314-6322.  aWe use an innovative combination of measurements to study reinforcement in a series of SBR elastomers filled with various amounts of submicrometric precipitated silica. While mechanical measurements give access to the overall response of the nanocomposite material, measurements of the chain segment average orientation induced upon uniaxial stretching give selective access to the response of the elastomer matrix only. Average segment orientation is measured by X-ray scattering. Reinforcement effects are analyzed in terms of the enhancement ratio of the mechanical modulus or induced segmental orientation in a reinforced sample over the corresponding quantity measured in the pure matrix. Cross-link densities are measured independently by NMR to account for possible impact of fillers on the cross-link density. It is demonstrated that in filled materials the orientational enhancement ratio does not decrease significantly as temperature increases, while the mechanical reinforcement ratio decreases as temperature increases, as it is known already. Also, the mechanical reinforcement ratio increases considerably as the silica fraction increases beyond a threshold, which is generally attributed to percolation or onset of filler networking, while the orientational reinforcement ratio qualitatively follows a Guth and Gold type of variation, associated solely with the geometrical (or hydrodynamical) local strain amplification contribution. Comparison of both mechanical and orientational responses thus allows discriminating and quantifying rigid network contribution from strain amplification contribution to reinforcement as a function of either temperature or filler volume fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray scattering 3ananocomposites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asilica 3atemperature1 aAlbouy, Pierre-Antoine1 aAbou Taha, Mohammad1 aLong, Didier R.1 aGrau, Pauline1 aFayolle, Caroline1 aPapon, Aurélie0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Aug. 22, v. 50, no. 16 p.6314-6322dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b006983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011500164300002000279520134300299592002801642650001701670650001901687650002001706650002301726650001601749650002201765650001701787650001701804650002601821650001101847650001001858650001801868650001401886650001801900650001501918650001701933650001601950700001401966700002001980700002002000700001802020700001702038773012902055856008202184852000902266655001202275IND60566861020221122235329.0170413e20160630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056686102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b052002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Fu-Cheng10aMechanistic Study of Gas-Phase Controlled Synthesis of Copper Oxide-Based Hybrid Nanoparticle for CO Oxidation  ap. 13638-13648.  aWe report a systematic study of gas-phase controlled synthesis of copper oxides-based hybrid nanoparticles for catalytic CO oxidation. The complementary physical, spectroscopic, and microscopic analyses were conducted to obtain a better understanding of the material properties, including particle size, crystallinity, elemental composition, and oxidation state. Results showed that the synthesized nanoparticles exhibited highly durable catalytic activity and stability, also the particle size, crystallite size, and chemical composition were tunable by choosing suitable chemical compositions of precursors and temperatures. The crystallite size of CuO influenced the reducibility of CuO by CO and the subsequent catalytic activity of CO oxidation. The hybridization process of CeO₂ and CuO induces the formation of new active sites at the Cu–Ce–O interface, which enhances reproducibility of CuO and the catalytic activity. However, the reproducibility of CuO and catalytic activity were considerably decreased when CeO₂ was replaced with the inert Al₂O₃. This work describes a prototype method to form highly pure and well-controlled hybrid nanocatalysts, which can be used to establish the correlation of material properties versus reducibility and subsequent catalytic activity for energy and environmental applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3acupric oxide 3aelemental composition 3aenergy 3agases 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3aprototypes 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aLu, Yi-Fu1 aChou, Fang-Chun1 aCheng, Chung-Fu1 aHo, Rong-Ming1 aTsai, De-Hao0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 June 30, v. 120, no. 25 p.13638-13648dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b052003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03972naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014600168300001800314520189900332592002802231596011402259596007002373650001602443650001502459650001302474650001902487650001402506650001302520650001502533650004402548650001502592650002602607650001602633700002102649700005702670700002002727700001702747700005902764700005302823700002502876700006702901700006302968700008203031700006203113700006603175773011903241856008503360852000903445655001203454IND60773378420220413000000.0220413e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077337842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c001292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosati, Marta10aJanus-Type Dendrimers Based on Highly Branched Fluorinated Chains with Tunable Self-Assembly and ¹⁹F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Properties  ap. 2486-2496.  aTuning the self-assembly of dendritic amphiphiles represents a major challenge for the design of advanced nanomaterials for biomimetic applications. The morphology of the final aggregates, in fact, critically depends on the primary structure of the dendritic building blocks as well as the environmental conditions. Here we report a new family of fluorinated Janus-type dendrimers (FJDs), based on a short-chain and branched fluorinated synthon with 27 magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms, linked to bis-MPA polyester dendrons of different generations. Increasing size, flexibility, and number of peripheral hydroxyl groups, we observed a peculiar self-assembly behavior in bulk and in aqueous media as a consequence of the subtle balance between their fluorinated and hydrophilic portions. The lowest generation FJDs formed spherical nanoparticles in water, e.g., micelles, showing a single ¹⁹F NMR peak with good signal-to-noise ratio and over time stability, making them promising as ¹⁹F-MRI traceable probes. The highest generation FJD, instead, presented an interesting morphological transition from multilamellar dendrimersomes to tubules as a consequence of a subtle balance of intra- and intermolecular forces that compete at the interface. Interestingly, a reduction of the local mobility of CF₃ groups passing from dendrimersomes to tubules switches off the ¹⁹F NMR signal. The transition mechanism has been rationalized by coarse-grain simulations as well as demonstrated by using cosolvents of different nature (e.g., fluorinated) that promote conformational changes, ultimately reflected in the self-assembly behavior. Short and branched fluorinated chains have here been demonstrated as new moieties for the design of FJDs with tunable self-assembly behavior for potential applications as biocompatible ¹⁹F MRI probes in the construction of theranostic platforms.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017MYBTXCcMinistero dell?Istruzione, dell?Universit? e della Ricercadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003407  a1175999cRegione Lombardiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009882 3abiomimetics 3adendrimers 3afluorine 3ahydrophilicity 3amagnetism 3amicelles 3anew family 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyesters 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asurfactants1 aAcocella, Angela1 aPizzi, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4180-91511 aTurtù, Giorgio1 aNeri, Giulia1 aDemitri, Nicola1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0288-32331 aNonappa, 1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6804-41281 aRaffaini, Giuseppina1 aDonnio, B.q(Bertrand),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5907-77051 aZerbetto, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2419-057X1 aBombelli, F.

Various elements, including N, O, Si, P, S, Sn, Ge, and Se, have been reported to participate in radical aryl migrations. However, radical aryl migration from a boron center has not been reported to date. In this communication, radical 1,5-aryl migration from boron to carbon in aryl boronate complexes is presented. C-radicals readily generated through radical addition onto alkenyl aryl boronate complexes are shown to engage in 1,5-aryl migration reactions to provide 4-aryl-alkylboronic esters. As boronate complexes can be generated in situ by the reaction of alkenylboronic acid esters with aryl lithium reagents, the aryl moiety is readily varied, providing access to a series of arylated products starting from the same alkenylboronic acid ester via divergent chemistry. Reactions proceed with high diastereoselectivity under mild conditions, and also the analogous 1,4-aryl shifts are feasible. The suggested mechanism is supported by DFT calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3acarbon 3adiastereoselectivity 3alithium 3amoieties1 aMück-Lichtenfeld, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9742-74001 aDaniliuc, Constantin G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6709-36731 aStuder, Armido1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1706-513X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 June 20, v. 143, no. 25 p.9320-9326dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c042173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245005700164300002000221520104500241592002801286650001401314650002401328650001301352650002201365650001301387700002401400700002301424700006301447773014901510856007701659852000901736655001201745IND60758718620220219000000.0211202e20211118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075871862DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c090902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrparvar, Saber10aDesign of Azobenzene beyond Simple On–Off Behavior  ap. 19856-19864.  aAzobenzenes are without a doubt the most widely used light-induced switching units, and there is a plethora of application examples ranging from supramolecular chemistry to material science and biological chemistry. Here, we present a smart azobenzene, in which the photoswitching capability of the azobenzene moiety can be reversibly switched on and off using a second unit (redox switch). This second switching unit is based on the variation of the strength of a chalcogen bond between the azo group and a Te–Ph unit in ortho position to the azo group. This allows the selective switching of only one azobenzene unit in the presence of other azobenzene switches. The entire double-switch is a very simple, small system that can also be easily synthesized. As a result, this double-switch can be used as a smarter replacement for the established azobenzene system in the future. For example, in contrast to the latter this double-switch could be employed to store state information analogous to a flip-flop in digital electronic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3aBiological Sciences 3ajournals 3amaterials science 3amoieties1 aScheller, Zoe Nonie1 aWölper, Christoph1 aHaberhauer, Gebhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5427-75100 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 143, no. 47 p.19856-19864dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c090903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012800166300001800294520142700312592002801739650002601767650001501793650001401808650001701822650002901839650001801868700002301886700002301909700002201932773011301954856004802067852000902115655001202124IND4476027120221118000930.0121003e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447602712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-012-1380-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Adrian A.10aExperimental evidence that workers recognize reproductives through cuticular hydrocarbons in the ant Odontomachus brunneus   ap. 1267-1276.  aEusociality is characterized by a reproductive division of labor, wherein workers respond to the presence of reproductive individuals by refraining from reproduction themselves and restricting the reproductive efforts of others. Our understanding of how eusociality is maintained therefore depends on characterizing the mechanism by which workers detect the presence of a reproductive. Variations in cuticular hydrocarbons correspond to changes in reproductive ability in ants, and experimental studies are beginning to reveal the function of hydrocarbons as signals. In this study, we compare the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of dominant and reproductive workers and queens of the ant Odontomachus brunneus with profiles of non-reproductive workers. Using split/reunification tests we document the existence of worker policing in both queenless and queenright colonies; supernumerary reproductives were treated aggressively by nestmates. Finally, we induce aggression and replicate queen-like submissive nestmate responses by supplementing the hydrocarbon profile of workers with (Z)-9-nonacosene, a compound that was significantly more abundant on the cuticles of reproductives. In three bioassays, we compare this manipulation to various control manipulations of the hydrocarbon profile and demonstrate that workers gauge the reproductive activity of nestmates through changes in their cuticular hydrocarbon profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdontomachus brunneus 3aaggression 3abioassays 3ahydrocarbons 3areproductive performance 3areproductives1 aMillar, Jocelyn G.1 aHanks, Lawrence M.1 aSuarez, Andrew V.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2012 Sept., v. 66, no. 9 p.1267-1276dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-012-1380-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245021500160520225800375592002802633650001102661650001102672650001602683650002202699650001602721650002602737650002002763650001102783650001502794650002302809650002302832650001802855650002302873651001002896700002002906700002002926700001902946700002002965773012002985856007403105852000903179655001203188IND60782522620221121092220.0220708e20220627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078252262DNAL7 a10.3390/w141320522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarouich, Hanaa 10aSearching for Sustainable-Irrigation Issues of Clementine Orchards in the Syrian Akkar Plain: Effects of Irrigation Method and Canopy Size on Crop Coefficients, Transpiration, and Water Use with SIMDualKc Model  aCitrus is one of the most valuable crops in Syria, with the largest production areas in the Tartus and Latakia provinces. Water-saving policies have been adopted to modernize the irrigation systems and increase water productivity. Following dedicated research, this study aimed to evaluate the water balance in clementine trees irrigated with diverse methods and schedules using the SIMDualKc software model. Two experiments are reported: one with 10–14 years old trees irrigated with different methods (2007−2011) and the other with the same trees but now 18−20 years old, irrigated with different schedules (2015−2019). The SIMDualKc model successfully simulated the soil water contents measured in the various field plots, with root mean square error values lower than 0.004 m³ m⁻³ and modeling efficiencies up to 0.83. The model-calibrated standard basal crop coefficients (Kcb) were approximately constant throughout all growing stages, assuming values of 0.54−0.55 for the mature trees having smaller height (h) and fraction of ground cover (fc), and 0.64 for older trees with larger canopies, i.e., larger h and fc. With drip irrigation, single Kc had a higher value (1.14) at the end, non-growing, and initial stages, and a lower value (0.75–0.76) during mid-season (Kc ₘᵢd), because precipitation was lesser then, contributing less to soil evaporation. On the other hand, Kc values were nearly constant with micro-sprinkler and surface irrigation techniques because the ground was fully wetted. The Kcb values derived from the fraction of ground cover and height (A&P approach) were similar to those obtained from the model, thus showing that the A&P approach represents a practical alternative to estimate Kcb in the practice of irrigation management. The soil water balance further revealed a large weight of the terms corresponding to the non-beneficial water consumption and non-consumptive water use when the fraction wetted was large and the application efficiencies were low. These terms were reduced, namely, evaporation losses when drip irrigation was used. This study, thus, provides a valuable tool for improving the irrigation management, water saving, and water productivity of Syrian citrus production systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3acanopy 3aclementines 3acomputer software 3aevaporation 3airrigation management 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3asoil water 3asoil water balance 3asurface irrigation 3atranspiration 3awater conservation 3aSyria1 aKarfoul, Razan 1 aRamos, Tiago B.1 aMoustafa, Ali 1 aPereira, L.

Firstly, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the volatile oils against H. pylori were determined using broth dilution method. SPSS17.0 was used to account 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50). Moreover, the anti-biofilm activity of the volatile oils was determined by crystal violet measurement and fluorescence microscope. Finally, gastric epithelial cells (GES-1 cells) were co-incubated with H. pylori with or without volatile oils treated. Real-time PCR and western blot were performed to detect the translocation of virulence factor Cag A. We found that Atractylodes lancea volatile oils inhibited the growth of H. pylori in a concentration dependent manner. The MIC and IC50 of volatile oils against H. pylori were 7.5 mg/mL and 2.181 mg/mL respectively. Fluorescence microscopy and crystal violet measurement indicated that volatile oils at sub-MIC concentration could reduce biofilm formation of H. pylori. In addition, volatile oils decreased the translocation of Cag A and reduced inflammatory cytokine IL-8 in GES-1 cells. Our results suggested that Atractylodes lancea volatile oils could be a potential compound of a novel class of H. pylori inhibitors with anti-H. pylori effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtractylodes lancea 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aWestern blotting 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3adigestive system diseases 3aepithelial cells 3aessential oils 3afluorescence microscopes 3afluorescence microscopy 3agastric mucosa 3agentian violet 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-8 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aplankton 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atraditional medicine 3avirulence 0aVolatile oils 0aH. pylori 0aCag A 0aIL-81 aWang, Xiaochun1 aLing, Feng1 aWang, Hua1 aZhang, Ping1 aShao, Shihe0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2019 Oct., v. 135 p.103641-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011300169300001400282520074100296592002801037650002301065650002101088650001501109650002201124650001501146650001301161650001401174650001301188700001301201700001701214700001601231700001901247700001401266773010501280856008601385990002301471852000901494655001201503IND60113202520221117082046.0141111e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011320252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Ligang10aEnhanced activity of molybdovanadophosphoric acid modified Pt electrode for the electrooxidation of methanol  ap. 14-19.  aThe Keggin-structure molybdovanadophosphoric acid (H₃₊ ₓPMo₁₂₋ ₓVₓO₄₀, x=1, 2, 3, denoted as PMV) modified Pt electrode was studied by electrochemical measurements for methanol oxidation. It was discovered that both the catalytic activity and stability of the PMV modified Pt electrode were significantly enhanced. With the increase of the vanadium content in PMV, the catalytic activity and stability for methanol electrooxidation were also increased. The enhancements were attributed to the special properties of PMV, which increased the electron transfer coefficient of the rate-determining step. Therefore, the PMV has potential application as promoter for methanol electrooxidation in direct methanol fuel cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3afuel cells 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3avanadium1 aLv, Qing1 aSun, Xiujuan1 aYao, Shikui1 aLiu, Changpeng1 aXing, Wei0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 664 p.14-19dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245022800165300001400393520122600407592002801633650001001661650002101671650002001692650000901712650004301721650000901764650002201773650000901795650001201804650001701816650001301833650002301846650004401869700002401913773013901937856008102076852000902157655001202166IND60661090720221121211433.0190828e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066109072DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348190701042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmelin, V.

The ranges of detectable concentrations of N-nitrosamines are from 0.001–5 to 2–100 ng/mL for liquid (water, beer) and from 2–50 to 4–100 ng/g for solid (meat, fish, mussels, malt, grain, sausage, wieners, and bockwursts) products. The limits of detection are 0.0005–2 ng/mL, 2–5 ng/g for liquid and solid products, respectively. The recovery of analytes is from 62 to 105%. The matrix effect was estimated in determining N-nitrosamines in samples of different nature. The matrix effect is negligible (≤20%) in the determination of N-nitrosamines in water and is significant for beer, meat products, grain, malt, and fish (>20%). A procedure is proposed for the rapid identification and determination of N-nitrosamines by the standard addition method and using matrix calibration. The relative standard deviation of the results of analysis does not exceed 17%. The duration of sample identification is 40 min; the determination of the detected analytes takes 1–1.5 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3afish 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amalt 3amass spectrometry 3ameat 3amussels 3anitrosamines 3asausages 3astandard deviation 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aBol’shakov, D.

Acknowledging that young-of-the-year (YOY) fish assemblages are highly dependent on riverine habitat conditions, the development of a YOY-based tool might be very useful or even essential in the design and implementation of conservation or restoration plan of large rivers, in measuring more straight-forward the losses and gains of hydro-ecological functionalities. In the past 20years, new modeling techniques have emerged from a growing sophistication of statistical model applied to ecology. âMachine learning methodsâ (ML) are now recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of understanding and prediction of ecological phenomena. The aim of this work was to select the appropriate statistical technique to model YOY assemblages according to different meso-scale habitat variables that are meaningful to planners. To do this, two âMachine Learningâ methods, Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), were compared to Generalized Linear Models (GLM). We modeled the occurrence of 9 species from the Seine River basin (France) in order to compare models abilities to accurately predict the presence and absence of each species. BRT appeared to be the best technique for modeling 0+ fish occurrences in our dataset.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3arivers 3adata collection 3aartificial intelligence 3awatersheds 3afish 3ariverine habitat 3aprediction 3aFrance 0astatistical models1 aOberdorff, T.1 aBelliard, J.1 aLeprieur, F.0 tEcological informatics.g2011 Sept., v. 6, no. 5 p.276-285dElsevier B.V.x1574-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006900169300001400238520178500252592002802037650002002065650002902085650002002114650001102134650002302145650002702168650001202195650001302207650001102220650001502231650001702246650001602263650002402279650001002303651001002313653001702323653002002340653002202360653001902382653001602401653002402417700001602441700001702457700001402474700001702488700001402505700001602519700001502535700001302550700001802563700001202581700002202593700001702615773010502632856008502737852000902822655001202831IND60576993320221119053349.0190214e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057699332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tianming12aA science-based approach to guide Amur leopard recovery in China  ap. 47-55.  aThe future of the critically endangered Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) is at a crucial point, and effective conservation strategies implemented within its primary historical range in Northeast China may determine the fate of this species. However, when a conservation plan was first developed for the species, scarce information on the leopards' status existed. To illustrate regional conservation challenges, we focused on the Hunchun Nature Reserve and the surrounding area along the China-Russia border, a potential stronghold for Amur leopard conservation. We conducted large-scale data analysis with a field camera-trapping network to present the first population estimates for this species using a spatially explicit capture–recapture approach. We then used a zero-inflated regression model to analyze the relationship of leopards with major prey species and anthropogenic disturbances. Our results indicate that leopards are returning to China, but most of them are part of a “border population” or are transient; their numbers are far too few to establish a healthy population. The spatial counts of leopards were noticeably high in areas with high prey richness and areas far from settlements and roads. Areas with few prey species and high human and cattle use exhibited a greater probability of “excess absences” of leopards. Mitigating human disturbances by progressively minimizing cattle and human impacts on the forest should be pursued along with habitat expansion for large ungulates, whose presence is essential for leopard occupancy. This study provides crucial information to support Chinese government recovery efforts and for refining conservation practices in human-dominated landscapes to ensure the long-term survival of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera pardus 3aanthropogenic activities 3acamera trapping 3acattle 3aconservation areas 3aconservation practices 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aprey species 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3aroads 3aChina 0aAmur leopard 0aCamera trapping 0aHuman disturbance 0aCattle grazing 0aHabitat use 0aZero-inflated model1 aFeng, Limin1 aYang, Haitao1 aHan, Boyu1 aZhao, Yiheng1 aJuan, Lin1 aLü, Xinyue1 aZou, Liang1 aLi, Tong1 aXiao, Wenhong1 aMou, Pu1 aSmith, James L.D.1 aGe, Jianping0 tBiological conservation.g2017 June, v. 210 p.47-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01947naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009400165300001800259520100700277592002801284650001501312650001301327650001801340650002401358650001601382700001601398700001701414700001801431773008901449856008601538852000901624655001201633IND60084877320221121201650.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008487732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aOptimization design of slotted fin by numerical simulation coupled with genetic algorithm  ap. 4441-4450.  aUsing a novel method that couples genetic algorithm (GA) with numerical simulation, the geometric configuration for a two-dimensional slotted fin has been optimized in this paper. The objective of optimization is to maximize the heat transfer capacity of slotted fin, and minimize the pressure drop penalty of fluid flow through the fin. The key of this method is the fitness function of GA, which were (j/j₀)/(f/f₀) and j/j₀. In this complex multiparameter problem, the numerical simulation is a crucial step to calculate the Colburn factor j and friction factor f. The results showed that for two-dimensional slotted fin considered, the j factor is increased by 229.22%, the f factor is increased by 196.30%, and the j/f ratio was increased by 11.11% at Re=500 based on optimal integrated performance (j/j₀)/(f/f₀); the j factor is increased by 479.08% at Re=500 based on optimal heat exchange capacity j/j₀.

Biologic behavior of the neoplasms could not be ascertained from histologic examination.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahorses 3aneoplasms 3ahistopathology 2aAnimals 2aCryptorchidismxcomplicationsxveterinary. 2aHorse Diseasesxetiologyxpathology. 2aHorses 2aLeydig Cell Tumorxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aTesticular Neoplasmsxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary.1 aMcEntee, K.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 24, no. 3 p.231-234dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985887024003063Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02834naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014400167300001800311520175500329592002802084650001902112650001102131650001902142650002902161650001502190650001302205650002602218650001702244700002202261700002402283773009902307856008102406852000902487655001202496IND60439861720221122013245.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043986172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-015-0169-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaur, Albert H.14aThe spatial dimension of urban greenhouse gas emissions: analyzing the influence of spatial structures and LULC patterns in European cities  ap. 1195-1205.  aCONTEXT: Integrative mitigation and adaptation strategies are needed to counter climate change. Indicators can be valuable that focus on the specific relevance of cities’ socioeconomic and spatial properties. While previous analyses have identified socioeconomic influences on urban greenhouse gas emissions, information about the role of spatial urban structures and land use and land cover patterns is sparse. OBJECTIVE: This study advances the use of spatial metrics for analyzing the linkages between the spatial properties of a city and its greenhouse gas emissions. METHODS: The relationship between nine types of spatial structure, four land use and land cover-based indicators, and the emissions of 52 European cities is investigated by spatially and statistically analyzing high resolution data from European Union’s “Urban Atlas”. RESULTS: Spatial determinants of urban greenhouse gas emissions are identified, indicating a strong connection between urban sprawl and increasing emissions. In particular, high amounts of sparsity in the urban fabric within large distances to the city center relate to increased per capita emissions. Thus, a 10 % reduction of very low density urban fabrics is correlated with 9 % fewer emissions per capita. In contrast, high amounts of fragmented, dense urban patches relate with lower emissions. CONCLUSIONS: This study links urban spatial properties and land use and land cover compositions to greenhouse gas emissions and advances the understanding of urban sprawl. Future research needs to combine knowledge about socioeconomic drivers with information about the identified spatial influences of urban greenhouse gas emissions to help cities realize their climate change mitigation potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acities 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland cover 3aland use 3asocioeconomic factors 3aurbanization1 aForster, Michael,1 aKleinschmit, Birgit0 tLandscape ecology.g2015 Aug., v. 30, no. 7 p.1195-1205dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-015-0169-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014600172300001600318520140900334592002801743650002201771650001301793650002401806650001201830650003501842650001101877650001201888650001201900650001301912650001101925650001101936650002001947650001501967650000901982650000901991650001402000650001402014650002402028650001502052650001102067650001602078650001302094650001402107650001102121650001302132650000902145653001102154653001102165653002902176653001402205700002102219700001502240773009202255856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60603241020221120105320.0180713e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060324102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlsson, Stefan10aComparison of MP AES and ICP-MS for analysis of principal and selected trace elements in nitric acid digests of sunflower (Helianthus annuus)  ap. 124-132.  aThe use of nitrogen as plasma gas for microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (MP AES) is an interesting development in analytical science since the running cost can be significantly reduced in comparison to the inductively coupled argon plasma. Here, we evaluate the performance of the Agilent 4100 MP AES instrument for the analysis of principal metals (Ca, K, Mg, and Na), lithogenic metals (Al, Fe, and Mn) and selected trace metals (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) in nitric acid plant digests. The digests were prepared by microwave-assisted dissolution of dry plant material from sunflower (Helianthus annuus) in concentrated nitric acid. Comparisons are made with analysis of the same solutions with ICP-MS (Agilent 7500cx) using the octopole reaction system (ORS) in the collision mode for As, Fe, and V.The limits of detection were usually in the low µgL⁻¹ range and all principal and lithogenic metals were successfully determined with the MP AES and provided almost identical results with the ICP-MS. The same applies for the selected trace metals except for As, Co and Mo where the concentrations were below the detection limit with the MP AES. For successful analysis we recommend that (i) only atom lines are used, (ii) ionization is minimized (e.g. addition of CsNO3) and (iii) the use of internal standards should be considered to resolve spectral interferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aaluminum 3aargon (noble gases) 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abarium 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aionization 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amicrowave treatment 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3anitric acid 3anitrogen 3apotassium 3asodium 3avanadium 3azinc 0aMP AES 0aICP-MS 0aMacro and trace elements 0aDigestion1 aSjöberg, Viktor1 aOgar, Anna0 tTalanta.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 135 p.124-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245009900163300001600262500002000278520198000298592002802278650001502306650001302321650002002334650001102354650001402365650001402379650001702393650001902410700002402429700002102453773010502474856007402579852000902653655001202662IND60580018920221122000558.0170907e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058001892DNAL7 a10.1111/syen.122432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMICHAT, MARIANO C.10aHigher‐level phylogeny of diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) based on larval characters  ap. 734-767.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA comprehensive higher‐level phylogeny of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) based on larval characters is presented. Larval morphology and chaetotaxy of a broad range of genera and species was studied, covering all currently recognized subfamilies and tribes except for the small and geographically restricted Hydrodytinae, where the larva is unknown. The results suggest several significant conclusions with respect to the systematics of Dytiscidae including the following: monophyly of all currently recognized subfamilies, although Dytiscinae when considered in a broad context is rendered paraphyletic by Cybistrinae; currently recognized tribes are monophyletic except for Agabini, Hydroporini and Laccornellini; inter‐subfamily and inter‐tribe relationships generally show weak support, except for a few well supported clades; three distinct clades are recognized within Dytiscinae [Dytiscini sensu lato (i.e. including the genera Dytiscus Linnaeus and Hyderodes Hope), Hydaticini sensu lato, and Cybistrini]; and recognition of Pachydrini as a distinct tribe. Other less robust results include: Methlini sister to the rest of Hydroporinae; relative basal position of Laccornini, Hydrovatini and Laccornellini within Hydroporinae; close relationship of Agabinae and Copelatinae; Matinae nested deep within Dytiscidae, as sister to a large clade including Colymbetinae, Coptotominae, Lancetinae and Dytiscinae sensu lato; the sister‐group relationship of Agabetini and Laccophilini is confirmed. The results presented here are discussed and compared with previous phylogenetic hypotheses based on different datasets, and the evolution of some significant morphological features is discussed in light of the proposed phylogeny. All suprageneric taxa are diagnosed, including illustrations of all relevant synapomorphies, and a key to separate subfamilies and tribes is presented, both in traditional (paper) format and as an online Lucid interactive identification key.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDytiscidae 3aInternet 3adata collection 3alarvae 3amonophyly 3aparaphyly 3asynapomorphy 3ataxonomic keys1 aAlarie, Y.q(Yves),1 aMILLER, KELLY B.0 tSystematic entomology.g2017 Oct., v. 42, no. 4 p.734-767dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/syen.122433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009200172300001400264520083300278592002801111650002301139650001501162650001501177650001801192700001801210700001901228700002001247700001501267700001301282700002001295773010601315856008601421990002301507852000901530655001201539IND60113202920221117082400.0141111e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011320292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Ping-Ping12aA SERS study of thiocyanate adsorption on Au-core Pd-shell nanoparticle film electrodes  ap. 70-75.  aWe have systematically studied the adsorption of thiocyanate (SCN⁻) on gold-core palladium-shell nanoparticles (Au@Pd NPs) with different Pd shell thicknesses by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). When the Pd shell thickness is increased from one to ten atomic layers, the νCN stretching frequency increases 6cm⁻¹ for S-bound SCN⁻ and 10cm⁻¹ for N-bound SCN⁻. It infers that the CN stretching frequency is quite sensitive to electronic properties of the NP surface, but even more so when bonding to Pd occurs through the N atom (at negative potentials) than when it occurs through the S atom (at positive potentials). Data for a second probe, p-aminothiophenol (PATP), was compared to that of SCN⁻; however, PATP was found to be less sensitive than SCN⁻ to the surface electronic properties of Au@Pd NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aelectrodes 3ananoparticles1 aLi, Jian-Feng1 aLin, Xiao-Dong1 aAnema, Jason R.1 aWu, De-Yin1 aRen, Bin1 aTian, Zhong-Qun0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 665 p.70-75dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.11.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245011900161300002000280520164500300592002801945596006101973650002202034650002402056650001102080650002502091650002502116650002602141650001502167650000902182650001902191650001302210650001502223650001602238650001702254650002002271651001002291700005702301700001502358700001502373700001602388700001702404773015502421856008302576852000902659655001202668IND60753136820221122155705.0211009e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075313682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14565-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Li10aN, P, and COD conveyed by urban runoff: a comparative research between a city and a town in the Taihu Basin, China  ap. 56686-56695.  aStormwater runoff containing various pollutants exerts adverse effects on receiving water bodies and deteriorates the urban aquatic environment. Although numerous studies have been conducted on runoff pollution, research comparing its characteristics in cities with those in towns is rare in the literature. To close this gap, the present study was conducted. The instantaneous concentrations of ammonia-N, TN, TP, and COD during the rainfall events in the town were higher than those in the city in most conditions. The outfall concentrations increased with the increase of rainfall intensity. EMCs (the average value of EMC) and CV (coefficient of variation) of TN and DTN in the town were higher than those in the city, which may lie in the differences of urban environment planning and management, road cleaning methods, garbage disposal methods, industrial enterprise, etc. On the one hand, EMCs and CV of TP in the city’s industrial areas were lowest among three functional areas, while on the other hand, in the town it was in the commercial areas rather than the industrial areas that EMCs and CV were the lowest, which may be caused by the low level of economic development of small towns in China. The concentrations of COD in the town were generally higher than that in the city. Compared with the city, the correlation among COD and various forms of N was stronger in the town, which may illustrate a stronger similarity of pollutant sources in the town. According to the results, road runoff in the town contributed more to urban aquatic pollution; thus, further research should concentrate on this particular type of runoff.  aPublisher supplied data  a51739002,51479064, 51979079 and 51879078cHua Yuan Group 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquatic environment 3abasins 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic development 3amunicipal solid waste 3apollutants 3arain 3arain intensity 3aresearch 3astormwater 3aurban areas 3aurban runoff 3awater pollution 3aChina1 aLiu, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5472-45791 aWang, Peng1 aHua, Zulin1 aZhang, Yuan1 aXue, Hongqin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 40 p.56686-56695dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14565-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02038naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013200167300001800299520074000317592002801057650001401085650002601099650001501125650001301140650001901153650001401172650002301186650002301209650001301232650003601245650001301281650001401294650001101308653002701319653001401346653001701360653001401377653001801391773010401409856008201513852000901595655001201604IND60634554620221119144506.0190328e20190412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063455462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.12.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaloğlu, Nazan10aN-heterocyclic carbene based ruthenium complexes for selective β-C(sp3)-H functionalization of N-fused saturated cyclic amines  ap. 2265-2272.  aHerein, a series of new ruthenium(II) complexes with the general molecular formula [RuCl2(arene)(NHC)], (arene = η6-p-cymene, NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) were synthesized from in situ prepared silver(I)-NHCs by the transmetallation method.

Error spectra of a multidimensional absorption spectral analytic signal of commercial gasolines and compounds of their individual fractions (components) were studied in measurements in the mid-IR region. The effect of a change of the proportion of the main constituents (aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene catalysate, isomerizate, methyl tert-butyl ether, and isopentane) in the compound on the spectra of commercial gasolines was evaluated. Multidimensional measurements of light absorption by gasolines in a wide spectral region and difference spectra were used. It was shown that spectral noise does not form limitations in spectroscopic measurements, while uncontrollable variations in the process conditions can form significant deviations in the absorption spectra, leading to problems in using calibration characteristics based on commercial gasoline samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abenzene 3acalibration 3agasoline 3apentane 3aspectral analysis1 aGaneev, A.

To date, China has established 11 types of PAs, whose conservation objectives vary from protecting biodiversity and geological features, preserving scenic landscapes and seascapes, to restoring and maintaining ecosystem services. Covering over 17% of the land and 3.5% of the marine territory of China, the PAs have had beneficial effects on conservation in this country. However, the success of these PAs is largely restricted by ecological gaps in PA structure, defects of the management system, and is also negatively influenced by local development and urbanization driven by a growing economy. To improve the conservation efficiency of China's PAs, we suggest structural adjustment based on integrative research, practical strategies to alleviate administrative conflicts, increased engagement of local communities, transparent allocation of conservation funding, strengthened supervision and penalty mechanisms for destructive activities, and improved large-scale designation to coordinate demands of conservation and socioeconomic development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aconservation areas 3aconservation status 3aecosystem services 3afunding 3alandscapes 3asocioeconomic development 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aProtected area 0aConservation 0aEffectiveness 0aManagement 0aChina1 aLuo, Zhenhua1 aMallon, David1 aLi, Chunwang1 aJiang, Zhigang0 tBiological conservation.g2017 June, v. 210 p.89-100dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011900164520228200283592002802565650001202593650001602605650002402621650001302645650001102658650001902669650001802688650001802706650001502724650001802739650001702757650003502774650002502809650002202834650003802856653001202894653001002906653000902916653001702925700001702942700002502959700001302984700002002997700002003017700002003037773010303057856008603160852000903246655001203255IND60654465420221119192619.0190801e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065446542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Juan10aAssociation of IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-β1 gene polymorphisms with brucellosis: A systematic review with meta-analysis  aBrucellosis is one of the major public health problems worldwide. Several current studies have provided data that polymorphisms in the interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta1(TGF-β1) gene were associated with the susceptibility to human brucellosis, but the results remain inconsistent.The aim of present study was to investigate the relationship between IL-6 (−174 G/C), IL-10 (−1082 A/G, −819C/T) and TGF-β1 (codon 10, codon 25) gene polymorphisms and brucellosis.We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, OVID-EBMR, and the Cochrane Library up to Oct. 30, 2018. The search was designed using the following key words: “brucellosis” or” “brucella melitensis”, “IL-10” or “interleukin10” or “interleukin-10”, “IL-6” or “interleukin6” or “interleukin-6”, “TGF-β1” or “TGF-beta1” or “transforming growth factor β1”, “polymorphism” and “single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)”. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to measure the strength of association between TGF-β1, IL-10 and IL-6 polymorphisms and brucellosis risk. All the statistical analyses were conducted by Review manager 5.3 software.A total of 8 studies involving 1308 cases and 902 controls met the inclusion criteria for IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β1 polymorphisms and brucellosis risk. There was a slightly trend of increasing risk of brucellosis in individuals with the G allele compared with individuals with the C allele (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.85–1.33, P = 0.57) in IL-6 polymorphism. However, statistical analysis showed that these differences are not significant. Our results suggested TGF-β1 (codon 25 G/C) GG genotype may be considered as a risk factor for brucellosis (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.12–2.50, P = 0.01). Herein, we failed to find any significant association between IL-10 (−1082 A/G, −819C/T), TGF-β1 (codon 10C/T) gene polymorphism and susceptibility to brucellosis in all gene models.IL-6 (−174 G/C), IL-10 (−1082 A/G, −819C/T), and TGF-β1 (codon 10C/T) polymorphisms is not a risk factor for brucellosis infection. TGF-β1 codon 25 GG genotype may be considered as a risk factor for brucellosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abrucellosis 3aconfidence interval 3agenotype 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3ameta-analysis 3aodds ratio 3apublic health 3arisk factors 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astatistical analysis 3asystematic review 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aTGF-β1 0aIL-10 0aIL-6 0aPolymorphism1 aHe, Hong-Yan1 aOjha, Suvash chandra1 aShi, Han1 aSun, Chang-Feng1 aDeng, Cun-Liang1 aSheng, Yun-Jian0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2019 Oct., v. 135 p.103640-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001600273520094700289592002801236650001901264650002301283650001401306650001101320650002101331650001301352650001801365650001601383700002401399700001901423700001801442773014201460856008101602852000901683655001201692IND60661091320221120071050.0190828e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066109132DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348190901812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamokhin, P.

The gas circuit includes four detectors, three packed columns, two precolumns (to prevent water and organic compounds from entering molecular sieve columns) in combination with two relief valves and two pressure regulators for the implementation of the back purging of precolumns. The system is assembled based on a Khromatek-Kristall 5000 chromatograph. The determination is carried out at a constant temperature of 140°C. The duration of analysis is not more than 12 min. Because of the presence of a flame ionization detector, it is possible to detect trace amounts of hydrocarbons, as well as ethane in the presence of large amounts of CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3adetectors 3aethane 3aflame ionization 3anitrogen 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aBelostotskii, I.

OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to test for thresholds in species richness of forest-breeding birds in relation to deciduous, coniferous, mixed, and total forest cover in two landscapes varying in the amount of forest present, and to determine whether thresholds for each forest type were coincident within and among landscapes, and across two spatial scales. METHODS: We used Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas data to calculate species richness of forest-breeding birds. Percent deciduous, coniferous, mixed, and total forest cover were determined in 250 m radius circles around survey locations (local scale) and for 10 × 10 km squares (landscape scale) in the fragmented, sparsely forested Mixedwood Plains ecozone and in the more continuously forested Ontario Shield ecozone. Best-fit models explaining variation in species richness were selected from candidate sets of models that included 1–6 variables in addition to segmented or linear terms for forest cover. RESULTS: Threshold models had support at the local and landscape scales, and for all forest types. Thresholds ranged from 4 to 45 % cover, being slightly higher in the more continuously forested landscape, and for more prevalent forest types. CONCLUSIONS: Thresholds can provide useful targets for conservation efforts, but it is crucial to recognize that habitat levels should be maintained above threshold values to avoid ecological degradation, and to address the habitat requirements of species with occupancy thresholds above those of the assemblage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding 3aforest types 3aguidelines 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific variation 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aOntario1 aJenkins, Eva1 aCouturier, Andrew1 aCadman, Mike0 tLandscape ecology.g2015 Aug., v. 30, no. 7 p.1273-1290dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-015-0183-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001400192245007100206300001600277506007600293520079500369592002801164506003701192650002401229650002101253650001101274650003001285650004401315650003901359650002001398650001101418650001901429700002501448700001301473700002201486700001901508700002401527700001801551773009501569856008501664852000901749655001201758IND60087872920221207054410.0141102e20120104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008787292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.08.0752doi7 aPMC32259622pmcid7 a221402852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Chao10aSemi-synthesis of chondroitin sulfate-E from chondroitin sulfate-A  ap. 822-829.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChondroitin sulfate-E (chondroitin-4,6-disulfate) was prepared from chondroitin sulfate-A (chondroitin-4-sulfate) by regioselective sulfonation, performed using trimethylamine sulfur trioxide in formamide under argon.

Several brands of these expanding wood glues (those containing diphenylmethane diisocyanate [MDI]) have the potential to form gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies if ingested. The ingested adhesive forms an expanding ball of glue in the esophagus and gastric lumen. This expansion is caused by a polymerization reaction using the heat, water, and gastric acids of the stomach. A firm mass is created that can be 4-8 times its original volume. As little as 2oz of glue have been reported to develop gastric foreign bodies. The obstructive mass is reported to form within minutes of ingestion of the adhesive. The foreign body can lead to esophageal impaction and obstruction, airway obstruction, gastric outflow obstruction, mucosal hemorrhage, ulceration, laceration, perforation of the esophageal and gastric linings, and death. Clinical signs following ingestion include anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, tachypnea, and abdominal distention and pain, and typically develop within 12 hours. Clinical signs may depend upon the size of the mass. If left untreated, perforation and rupture of the esophagus or stomach can occur. The glue mass does not stick to the GI mucosa and is not always detectable on abdominal palpation. Radiographs are recommended to confirm the presence of the “glue-ball” foreign body, and radiographic evidence of the obstruction may be seen as early as 4-6 hours following ingestion. Emesis is contraindicated owing to the risk of aspiration of the glue into the respiratory tree or the subsequent lodging of the expanding glue mass in the esophagus. Likewise, efforts to dilute the glue and prevent the formation of the foreign body through administration of liquids, activated charcoal, or bulk-forming products to push the foreign body through the GI tract have proven ineffective. Even endoscopy performed to remove the foreign body has been shown to be unreliable. The safest, most effective, and successful therapy is surgical intervention to remove the GI foreign body. If performed early enough, complete recovery of the animal can be expected. Differential diagnoses for polyurethane adhesive ingestion include any potential cause of GI obstruction. The public is largely unaware of the hazards that ingestion of this product may produce. Public education efforts are needed to inform pet owners about the hazards of these glues and the overall importance of providing our companion animals with safe, poison-free environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aactivated carbon 3aadhesives 3aanorexia 3adeath 3aeducation 3aendoscopy 3aesophagus 3aforeign bodies 3aheat 3ahemorrhage 3ahousehold products 3aingestion 3alodging 3amedicine 3amucosa 3apain 3apets 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3aradiography 3arespiratory system 3arisk 3astomach 3avomiting 3awood 3aUnited States 0apolyurethane adhesive ingestion 0aesophageal foreign body 0agastric foreign body 0aexpansive glue foreign body 0agastrotomy1 aBronstein, Alvin C.0 tTopics in companion animal medicine.g2013 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.28-31dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000157x1938-97367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.tcam.2013.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010800170300002000278520152600298592002801824650004401852650002201896650001501918650001501933650002201948650001101970650002001981650001502001650001302016650001402029650001402043650001102057650001902068650001702087650000702104650001402111650002202125650001302147650002302160650001702183650001602200650001902216650003702235650001902272700001902291700001602310700001602326773015502342856008302497852000902580655001202589IND60753137220221120150734.0211009e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075313722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14662-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkbas, Yusuf Azmi10aSorption of Ce(III) on magnetic/olive pomace nanocomposite: isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic studies  ap. 56782-56794.  aUsed for various high-tech applications, cerium is an important rare earth element (REE), and its sorption on various solids also is important considering purification and environmental and radioactive waste disposal. In view of the industrial and environmental terms, it is important to remove Ce³⁺ ions from an aqueous solution. Magnetite and magnetic olive pomace nanocomposite were thus fabricated by a partial reduction co-precipitation approach. The structure and morphological properties of the prepared nano-material and nanocomposite were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and BET surface area analysis. The effects of parameters such as solution pH, contact time, initial Ce(III) concentration, and temperature on the sorption efficiency were studied. The maximum sorption capacities of the magnetite (MNP) and magnetic olive pomace nanocomposite (MOP) for Ce(III) ions were found to be 76.92 and 90.90 mgg⁻¹, respectively. The sorption data fitted well with Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the sorption was non-spontaneous and endothermic. This paper reports the preparation of MNP and novel MOP and their application as efficient, sustainable adsorbents alternative to commercial ones for adsorption of cerium ions from aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acerium 3acoprecipitation 3aendothermy 3akinetics 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3aolive pomace 3apH 3apollution 3aradioactive waste 3aresearch 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awaste disposal1 aYusan, Sabriye1 aSert, Senol1 aAytas, Sule0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 40 p.56782-56794dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14662-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245010900181300001400290520100400304592002801308650001601336650002501352650001101377650002001388650002101408650001501429650000901444650000901453650001601462650001801478650000701496650002701503650001101530650002301541700002201564700003301586773010601619856008601725990002301811852000901834655001201843IND60113203420221117082148.0141111e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011320342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhavani Devi, Loganathan10aHighly sensitive detection of proteins using voltammetric assay in the presence of silver nanostructures  ap. 20-25.  aA novel voltammetric protein assay has been demonstrated using bovine serum albumin in the presence of silver nanostructures (AgNs) formed electrochemically on gold substrates modified by self-assembled monolayer of thioctic acid. It is shown that the prepared AgNs exhibit voltammetric response characteristic of Ag and shows near Nernstian response at physiological pH. The advantages of the electrochemical assay compared to conventional protein analysis are the wide linear concentration range (10⁻⁴–10⁻¹¹g/mL) and trace level detection limits (50pg/mL). The result of this electrochemical analysis agreed well with an independent spectrophotometric method using Bradford reagent, but thedetectionlimit is far superior using the electrochemical method. Further, the modified electrode exhibits high sensitivity and long term stability. We invoke a new concept of surface enhanced activity of Ag⁺ ions at the electrochemical interface by the negatively charged bovine serum molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abovine serum albumin 3acattle 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aions 3alipoic acid 3ananomaterials 3apH 3aphysiological response 3asilver 3aspectrophotometers1 aBerchmans, Sheela1 aMandal, A.

The biodiversity trends in tropical areas are largely unclear. In addition, habitat loss and fragmentation and illegal wildlife use threaten biodiversity in these regions. Herein, we report abundance and species richness trends for birds in the tropical Hainan Province (Island), China, based on extensive transect surveys conducted in 10km×10km grid cells across the majority of the island between 1997–1998 and 2012–2013. We also quantified the effects of changes associated with land use, natural forests, agriculture, human populations, protected areas and wildlife-rearing farms on the abundance of birds. We found that 145 bird species suffered significant declines in abundance and species richness between two time periods of the survey. 28 species exhibited a decline in abundance, while 33 species showed an increase. Other species showed no significant changes in abundance. More common bird species declined more rapidly than less abundant species. The abundance trend in a grid cell (log ratio: 2012–2013/1997–1998) increased with the proportion of protected area but decreased with a reduction in natural forests and an increase in the number of wildlife-rearing farms. These results suggest that the avian decline on Hainan Island is mainly due to deforestation and illegal wildlife use. To slow this decline, it is necessary to increase protected area coverage and networks on the island, strengthen natural forest protection, and reinforce regulations to reduce habitat destruction and illegal wildlife use by wildlife-rearing farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeforestation 3afarms 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahuman population 3aland use 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atropical birds 3awildlife 3aChina 0aBird decline 0aAbundance 0aRichness 0aLoss of natural forest 0aIllegal wildlife use 0aWildlife-rearing farms1 aLin, Siliang1 aHe, Jiekun1 aXin, Yu1 aZhang, Linxiao1 aJiang, Haisheng1 aLi, Yiming0 tBiological conservation.g2017 June, v. 210 p.9-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006000172300001600232520151600248592002801764650001701792650001401809650001501823651001001838700002401848773011401872856008201986852000902068655001202077IND60548254920221117195646.0190321e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054825492DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-009-0057-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDatta-Roy, Aniruddha14aThe Out-of-India hypothesis: What do molecules suggest?  ap. 687-697.  aThe remarkable geological and evolutionary history of peninsular India has generated much interest in the patterns and processes that might have shaped the current distributions of its endemic biota. In this regard the “Out-of-India” hypothesis, which proposes that rafting peninsular India carried Gondwanan forms to Asia after the break-up of Gondwana super continent, has gained prominence. Here we have reviewed molecular studies undertaken on a range of taxa of supposedly Gondwanan origin to better understand the Out-of-India scenario. This re-evaluation of published molecular studies indicates that there is mounting evidence supporting Out-of-India scenario for various Asian taxa. Nevertheless, in many studies the evidence is inconclusive due to lack of information on the age of relevant nodes. Studies also indicate that not all Gondwanan forms of peninsular India dispersed out of India. Many of these ancient lineages are confined to peninsular India and therefore are relict Gondwanan lineages. Additionally, for some taxa an “Into India” rather than “Out-of-India” scenario better explains their current distribution. To identify the “Out-of-India” component of Asian biota it is imperative that we understand the complex biogeographical history of India. To this end, we propose three oversimplified yet explicit phylogenetic predictions. These predictions can be tested through the use of molecular phylogenetic tools in conjunction with palaeontological and geological data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3aIndia1 aPraveen Karanth, K.0 tJournal of biosciences.g2009 Nov., v. 34, no. 5 p.687-697dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-009-0057-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010900166300002000275520130100295592002801596650001001624650002501634650002701659650001401686650002901700650001301729651001101742651001101753651001201764651001001776700002101786700006301807773015501870856008302025852000902108655001202117IND60753137320221120150548.0211009e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075313732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14618-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkumus, Ilyas10aRenewable, non-renewable energy consumption and economic growth nexus in G7: fresh evidence from CS-ARDL  ap. 56595-56605.  aThis study investigates the effects of renewable energy (REN) consumption and non-renewable energy (NREN) consumption on economic growth in G7 countries with annual data covering the period 1980–2016 using a new panel data estimator that provides robust results under cross-sectional dependence, slope heterogeneity, and can be used whether series are integrated in different orders. In addition, the causality between the variables is analyzed with the panel bootstrap Granger causality method takes cross-sectional dependency and slope heterogeneity into account. According to Cross-sectionally Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) results, the coefficients of REN and NREN consumption are positive and statistically significant in both the short- and long-run. Furthermore, NREN consumption has a greater impact on enhancing economic growth than REN consumption. The panel bootstrap causality analysis reveals that the growth hypothesis (GH) is valid in REN in Canada, Italy, and the USA; neutrality is valid in REN in France, Japan, and the UK; the feedback hypothesis (FE) is valid for REN only in Germany. For NREN, the GH is valid for Canada, France, and Germany; the conservation hypothesis (CH) is valid in Italy and the UK. Finally, the FH is valid in Japan and the USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aeconomic development 3anonrenewable resources 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources 3aresearch 3aCanada 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aItaly1 aGuzel, Arif Eser1 aDestek, Mehmet Akif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2514-94050 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 40 p.56595-56605dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14618-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245008200181300001600263520132400279592002801603650001501631650002501646650001701671650001401688650001801702650001801720650001101738650001501749650001101764650002801775650001601803650001801819650001201837650002301849650002001872650001601892653000601908653000801914653001201922653000701934653001001941653000901951653000801960653000801968653000701976653000901983653000901992653001302001653001002014653000802024653001202032653000702044653001102051653001102062653001002073653001002083653001502093653001602108653001202124653002502136653002702161653001502188700002802203700003202231700001902263700002102282700002902303773011302332856008602445852000902531655001202540IND60526492920221120035534.0190408e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052649292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad-Qasem, Margarita H.10aDrying and storage of olive leaf extracts. Influence on polyphenols stability  ap. 232-239.  aThere is an increasing demand for natural antioxidants in the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries which has led to the search not only for natural extracts but also for strategies with which to increase long-term storage stability. The aim of this work was to assess the influence of the drying and storage of olive leaf extracts on the bioactive potential and stability of polyphenols. Olive leaves were hot air dried (120°C) and freeze dried. Then the extracts were obtained by maceration (ethanol–water, 80:20, v/v). Afterwards, a part of the extracts was hot air dried at 120°C and vacuum dehydrated at 55°C. Thus, the extracts, in liquid and powder forms, were stored at 4, 25 and 35°C for 4 weeks. During this period, the extracts were characterized by determining the antioxidant capacity (AC), the total phenolic content (TPC) and the concentration of the major phenolic compounds.The experimental results highlighted that drying the raw material not only influenced the initial extract composition but also the bioactive potential evolution during storage. Regardless of the method used, extract dehydration reduced both the AC and TPC by around 10%. Finally, storage conditions (temperature and extract form) did not have a significant (p<0.05) effect on the extracts’ antioxidant potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acosmetics 3afreeze drying 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amaceration 3aolives 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolyphenols 3araw materials 3astorage 3astorage conditions 3astorage quality 3atemperature 0aF 0aHAD 0aHAD-120 0aFD 0aA-120 0aV-55 0aTPC 0aGAE 0aAC 0aFRAP 0aTPTZ 0aHPLC-DAD 0aMS-MS 0aESI 0aLC–MS 0aUV 0a120(L) 0a120(P) 0a55(L) 0a55(P) 0aOlive leaf 0aDehydration 0aStorage 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aTotal phenolic content 0aOleuropein1 aAhmad-Qasem, Begoña H.1 aBarrajón-Catalán, Enrique1 aMicol, Vicente1 aCárcel, Juan A.1 aGarcía-Pérez, José V.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2016 Jan., v. 79 p.232-239dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012200166300001600288520129200304592002801596650004401624650001401668650002001682650001901702650001101721650004101732650002301773650001201796650001201808650002101820650001601841650002101857650004401878650001901922650002001941650001301961700002001974700001701994700001502011700001402026700001602040700001502056700001702071773009502088856008502183852000902268655001202277IND60087873220221122002703.0141102e20120104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008787322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yikai10aStructural characterization of a sulfated glucan isolated from the aqueous extract of Hedysarum polybotrys Hand.-Mazz  ap. 160-169.  aA water-soluble sulfated glucan, SHG, was isolated from Hedysarum polybotrys Hand.-Mazz using anion-exchange and gel-permeation chromatography. Elemental analysis indicated that SHG was a sulfated polysaccharide containing small amount of sulfate groups (1.47mass%). The molecular weight was estimated to be 1.72×10⁵Da by high-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) and size exclusion chromatography–multi angle laser light scattering (SEC–MALLS). SHG took random coil compact conformation in 0.1M NaNO₃. Compositional analysis revealed that SHG was composed of glucose only. On the base of partial acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of ¹H, ¹³C, β-correlation spectroscopy (β-COSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), the results showed that SHG was composed of α-d-(1→4)-linked glucopyranosyl residues, with branches at C-6 consisting of non-reducing terminal approximately every eight residues. Sulfate groups may attach to the backbone at O-6, occasionally occurring per thirty-eight anhydrous glucose units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHedysarum 3aacid hydrolysis 3aanion exchange 3acarbon 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agel chromatography 3aglucans 3aglucose 3alight scattering 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asodium nitrate 3astable isotopes 3asulfates1 aZhao, Lianggong1 aLiu, Xiaohua1 aHu, Fangdi1 aCui, Fang1 aBi, Yingyan1 aMa, Yufeng1 aFeng, Shilan0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Jan. 4, v. 87, no. 1 p.160-169dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01469naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245006400162300001600226500002000242520055300262592002800815650001200843650001800855650001000873650001200883650001500895650001400910651001400924700001700938773010500955856007401060852000901134655001201143IND60580019520221122232017.0170907e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058001952DNAL7 a10.1111/syen.122522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichelsen, Verner10aUlurumyiidae – a new family of calyptrate flies (Diptera)  ap. 826-836.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new monotypic and monospecific family Ulurumyiidae fam.n., type genus Ulurumyia gen.n., is erected for the species Ulurumyia macalpinei sp.n. from southeastern Australia.

Tailpipe emissions and engine parameters were first measured experimentally to form a comprehensive database for network training and testing. Individual predictive models were constructed using the optimization layer-by-layer neural network. Simulation results demonstrated that the networks, as virtual sensors, can accurately predict the engine parameters and emissions quantitatively and qualitatively with RMS errors below 9%. The second part of this paper then presents a virtual sensor control model which is the combination of the two individual emissions and engine predictive models developed previously. The main objective of this part is to control the exhaust emissions within the desired limits by predicting optimum engine parameters with the use of artificial neural network virtual sensors. Results showed that the emissions levels were successfully controlled within the defined limits, with maximum tolerance of 6%. This first part of this paper demonstrated that with the use of artificial neural network virtual sensors, emissions and engine parameters can be accurately predicted. Hence with accurate virtual sensors, emissions were then controlled within the desired limits by optimizing the engine parameters. This proposed work demonstrated a viable and accurate methodology in emissions predictive and control. By applying virtual sensor models, the need additional, cumbersome and costly measuring and monitoring devices can be eliminated.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aemissions 3agasoline 3amonitoring 3aneural networks 3aprediction1 aKarri, Vishy0 tApplied energy.g2011 Dec., v. 88, no. 12 p.4505-4516dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.05.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01925naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007500161300001600236520114200252592002801394650001001422650001101432650001001443650000801453650001001461773009301471856007401564852000901638655001201647IND60548255320221117195426.0160903e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054825532DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027178942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlar, Amar J. S.10aExcess of counterclockwise scalp hair-whorl rotation in homosexual men  ap. 251-255.  aWhile most men prefer women as their sexual partners, some are bisexual and others are homosexuals. It has been debated for a long time whether a person’s sexual preference is innate, learned, or due to a combination of both causes. It was recently discovered that the human right-versus-left-hand use preference and the direction of scalp hair-whorl rotation develop from a common genetic mechanism. Such a mechanism controls functional specialization of brain hemispheres. Whether the same mechanism specifying mental makeup influences sexual preference was determined here by comparing hair-whorl rotation in groups enriched with homosexual men with that in males at large. Only a minority of 8.2% (n = 207) unselected ‘control’ group of males had counterclockwise rotation. In contrast, all three samples enriched with homosexual men exhibited highly significant (P< 0.0001), 3.6-fold excess (29.8%,n = 272) counterclockwise rotation. These results suggest that sexual preference may be influenced in a significant proportion of homosexual men by a biological/genetic factor that also controls direction of hair-whorl rotation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3ahumans 3amales 3amen 3awomen0 tJournal of genetics.g2004 Dec., v. 83, no. 3 p.251-255dSpringer Indiax0022-13337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027178943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015000172300001400322520153000336592002801866650001601894650002101910650001801931650002001949650001001969650001001979650001501989650001402004650001302018653002702031653002002058653003002078653002002108700001502128700001402143700001602157700001602173700001902189773007502208856008902283852000902372655001202381IND60545430620221117235807.0160902e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054543062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.02.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Miaomiao10aDiastereoisomer-specific effects of hexabromocyclododecanes on hepatic aryl hydrocarbon receptors and cytochrome P450s in zebrafish (Danio rerio)  ap. 24-31.  aIn order to elucidate the mechanism for diastereoisomer-specific toxicity and metabolism of hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) in biota, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to different concentrations of individual HBCD diastereoisomers (α-, β- and γ-HBCD) in water for 7 and 21d. We examined the gene expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and cytochrome P450 (CYP), as well as ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in zebrafish livers. Exposure to different HBCD diastereoisomers caused different expression of AHRs in zebrafish livers. For instance, 10 and 100μgL−1 of α- and β-HBCD up-regulated the expressions of ahr1a and ahr1b in zebrafish liver, whereas 10 and 100μgL−1 of γ-HBCD down-regulated them after 7d exposure. α-HBCD showed the most significant up-regulation of ahr1a and ahr1b expression, whereas γ-HBCD showed the most significant down-regulation of their expression among three HBCD diastereoisomers. Moreover, HBCDs could affect the expression of CYP1s as well as EROD activity in a gene-specific and diastereoisomer-specific manner. α-, β- and γ-HBCD inhibited cyp1a expression but enhanced the expression of cyp1b1 and cyp1c1. α-, β- and γ-HBCD showed different degrees of effect on the same CYP1 gene in a concentration-dependent way. The different effects of HBCD diastereoisomers on these genes we examined and EROD activity not only indicate diastereoisomer-specific toxic effect, but also in turn explain diastereoisomer-specific accumulation of HBCDs in zebrafish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3acytochrome P-450 3adiastereomers 3agene expression 3agenes 3aliver 3ametabolism 3areceptors 3atoxicity 0aHexabromocyclododecane 0aDiastereoisomer 0aAryl hydrocarbon receptor 0aCytochrome P4501 aFang, Chao1 aQiu, Ling1 aDong, Sijun1 aZhang, Xian1 aYan, Changzhou0 tChemosphere.g2015 Aug., v. 132 p.24-31dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.02.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015200166500002200318520075300340592002801093650001801121650002501139650002301164650001401187650002201201650001701223653002001240653002001260653001801280653004101298700001901339700002001358700005101378773008701429856008501516852000901601655001201610IND60634555420221119144841.0190326e20190222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063455542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2019.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Yuting10aTotal synthesis of penta-Me amurensin H and diptoindonesin G featuring a Rh-catalyzed carboacylation/aromatization cascade enabled by CC activation  aPre-press version  aOligostilbenoids represented a family of natural products, which contained one or several multifused benzofuran substructures and displayed promising biological activities towards cancer as well as immunological therapeutic targets.
