Small (<2 cm), non-dietary gastropods in archaeological shell middens also provide important clues regarding human resource procurement in littoral areas and coastal paleoenvironments. We present data from two sites on the California Channel Islands to demonstrate the range of information that can be gained by analyzing small gastropod shells. Identifications revealed the remains of over 4500 non-dietary small gastropods from 75 taxa. Human harvesting of marine macrophytes is suggested by the presence of 18 species that are predominantly associated with seaweeds and seagrasses. Quantification measures revealed high diversity and equitability indices, oscillating taxonomic richness, and decreasing densities through time at both sites. Likelihood ratio tests revealed differences in assemblage composition between Early Holocene and later components at one site, and demonstrated similarities in the relative composition of non-dietary shell assemblages between both sites during the Middle Holocene. Incorporating detailed studies of less conspicuous “incidental” shellfish remains in archaeological midden studies has the potential to contribute to our understanding of past human land use practices and littoral paleoecology. Our findings are applicable to archaeologists working in coastal settings around the world, as well as marine ecologists interested in intertidal paleo-habitats and kelp forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aHolocene epoch 3aarchaeology 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3akelp forests 3aland use 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3amolluscs 3apaleoecology 3aseagrasses 3ashellfish 0aCoastal archaeology 0aShell midden analysis 0aKelp associates 0aSeagrass associates 0aIncidental shells 0aCalifornia Channel Islands1 aVellanoweth, René L.1 aLapeña, Queeny G.1 aThornber, Carol S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0034-10350 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 Sept., v. 49 p.343-360dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017000170300001600340520147200356592002801828650002101856650002401877650001701901650001101918650002101929650001301950650001901963650001501982650001201997650002302009650001102032650002602043650001602069650001002085650000902095650001902104650002102123650002002144651001002164653002802174653001502202653002802217653001502245653001802260653001602278700002002294700002302314700002302337773009902360856008502459852000902544655001202553IND60762384420221119115135.0220205e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076238442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.12.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Pera, Adolfo10aEnvironmental sustainability of an integrate anaerobic digestion-composting treatment of food waste: Analysis of an Italian plant in the circular bioeconomy strategy  ap. 341-351.  aIn light of the adoption of recent global policies and strategies for a more sustainable food waste management system and a greater control of environmental impacts, this study describes a circular bioeconomy plant model, currently operating in South Italy, for treatment and enhancement of organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The key basis for plant activity is dry anaerobic digestion of separately collected organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SC-OFMSW) followed by digestate composting process. Biomethane for use in the transport sector is obtained by biogas cleaning and upgrading, while high-quality compost for organic farming is produced by digestate composting. Plant activities are completed by the transformation of part of the produced waste into refuse derived fuel (RDF) to be allocated to waste-to-energy plants and the treatment of odour emissions which allows the recovery of ammonium sulphate as a fertilizer. A rooftop photovoltaic system supplies most of electric energy needed by the plant. For plant activities relative to 2020, carbon footprint was equal to −112 kg CO₂eq. for Mg of organic waste, while depletion of fossil resources was estimated at −89.6 kg oil eq. Mg⁻¹ of waste. Primary energy demand of food waste treatment system was −2.66 GJ Mg⁻¹ of input waste. Replacement of natural gas with biomethane for transport sector provided the greatest improvement contribution for all the examined categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium sulfate 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioeconomics 3abiogas 3acarbon footprint 3acomposts 3aelectric power 3afood waste 3afossils 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3anatural gas 3aodors 3aoils 3aprimary energy 3asolar collectors 3awaste treatment 3aItaly 0aDry anaerobic digestion 0aComposting 0aFood waste valorisation 0aBiomethane 0aGHG emissions 0aSouth Italy1 aSellaro, Miriam1 aBencivenni, Egidio1 aD'Amico, Francesco0 tWaste management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 139 p.341-351dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013200164300001400296520164200310592002801952650002401980650002402004650002002028650001502048650001402063650001802077650002202095650001002117650002002127650002002147650001202167650002402179650001602203650001202219650001602231650002602247650003602273650001702309650003202326653001402358653001702372653002902389653003102418653001002449653002902459700002902488700001202517700001602529700001902545773008302564856008402647852000902731655001202740IND60560344020221122080007.0170713e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056034402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2016.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Ning14aThe Fli-1 transcription factor is a critical regulator for controlling the expression of chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 2 (CXCL2)  ap. 59-66.  aMammalian cells produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to innate immune signals and their expression is tightly regulated. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2), also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 2-alpha (MIP2-alpha), is an inflammatory chemokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family. CXCL2 is chemotactic for neutrophils and elevated expression of CXCL2 is associated with many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The Fli-1 gene belongs to the large Ets transcription factor family, whose members regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including the immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that endothelial cells transfected with Fli-1 specific siRNA produce significantly less CXCL2 compared to cells transfected with control siRNA after stimulation by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligands, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The production of CXCL2 in endothelial cells stimulated with LPS stimulation is dose-dependent. We found that Fli-1 binds to the CXCL2 promoter as established by Chromatin immunoprecipitation‎ (ChIP) assay. Transient transfection assays show that Fli-1 drives transcription from the CXCL2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner and Fli-1 regulates the expression of CXCL2 largely by directly binding to the promoter. Targeted knockdown and transient transfection experiments suggest that both Fli-1 and the p65 subunit of NF-κB affect the activation of CXCL2 in an additive manner. These results indicate that Fli-1 is a novel, critical transcription factor that regulates the expression of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptors 3aautoimmune diseases 3achemokine CXCL2 3achemotaxis 3achromatin 3adose response 3aendothelial cells 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3aligands 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amammals 3aneutrophils 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransfection 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aChemokine 0aInflammation 0aLipopolysaccharide (LPS) 0aTranscription factor Fli-1 0aCXCL2 0aToll-like receptor (TLR)1 aLennard Richard, Mara L.1 aYu, Jin1 aKindy, Mark1 aZhang, Xian K.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2017 Jan., v. 81 p.59-66dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2016.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01682naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245006000159300002000219520071200239592002800951650001400979650001100993650004401004700001601048700002301064700001901087700001701106700002401123773013401147856007801281852000901359655001201368IND60586421020221118135636.0171213e20171122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058642102DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b094392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUbe, Hitoshi12aA Circularly Arranged Sextuple Triptycene Gear Molecule  ap. 16470-16473.  aHerein we report the synthesis of a circularly arranged sextuple triptycene gear molecule, hexakis(10-dodecyloxy-9-triptycyl)ethynylbenzene, via the trimerization of the corresponding triyne with a cobalt catalyst. The six triptycene gears are closely engaged with each other as confirmed by single crystal X-ray structure analysis, and their motion in solution was established by NMR spectroscopy. Notably, when one bulky RuCp* complex was attached to one triptycene gear, the whole movement of the six gears was highly restricted via their mechanical engagement.

Confined thin epitaxial Ca₀.₅Sr₀.₅TiO₃ solid-solution films with systematically varying thicknesses in between two parent perovskite materials of calcium titanate and (001)-oriented strontium titanate are grown, and thermoreflectance techniques are used to accurately measure the thermal boundary conductance across the confined solid-solution films, showing that the thermal resistance does not substantially increase with the addition of solid-solution films with increasing thicknesses from ∼1 to ∼10 nm. Contrary to the macroscopic understanding of thermal transport where adding more material along the heat propagation direction leads to larger thermal resistances, our results potentially offer experimental support to the computationally predicted concept of vibrational matching across interfaces. This concept is based on the fact that a better match in the available heat-carrying vibrations due to an interfacial layer can lead to lower thermal boundary resistances, thus leading to an enhancement in thermal boundary conductance across interfaces driven by the addition of a thin “vibrational bridge” layer between two solids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3astrontium 3athermal conductivity 0athermal boundary conductance 0ainterfacial solid-solution films 0avibrational bridge 0aperovskite oxides1 aCheaito, Ramez1 aGaskins, John T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8622-59021 aMimura, Takanori1 aBrown-Shaklee, Harlan J.1 aMedlin, Douglas L.1 aIhlefeld, Jon F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-81361 aHopkins, Patrick E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3403-743X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 13, no. 10 p.12541-12549dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c206083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015100157300001600308520142900324592002801753596010801781650002501889650002001914650001101934650003001945650003101975650001002006650001102016650001702027650001402044650002102058650002702079650002502106650002402131650001202155650002902167650002002196653001702216653002002233653001802253653001502271653001802286700001502304700001502319700001802334700001702352700001402369700005702383700001702440773012702457856007402584852000902658655001202667IND60673754120221118111805.0191019e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067375412DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcy2522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shuzhi10aTranscriptomic and Metabolic Profiling Reveals ‘Green Ring’ and ‘Red Ring’ on Jujube Fruit upon Postharvest Alternaria alternata Infection  ap. 844-861.  aAlternaria alternata is the major threat to postharvest storage of jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit. We found that natural A. alternata infection can cause very typical phenotype of ‘green ring’ and ‘red ring’ surrounding the disease spot on the jujube fruit. The phenotype was successfully modeled and constructed on jujubes by artificial inoculation with the pathogen. Furthermore, the pathogenic infection is evidenced essential to the onset of the phenotype. The ‘red ring’ circle is proved to be pre-fixed to block the ‘green ring’ area as a battlefield combating the pathogen’s attack. We monitored the global transcriptomic profiling of ‘green ring’ and ‘red ring’ tissues from jujubes infected with A. alternata, in comparison with the mock-inoculated fruit and the control intact fruit. Large amount of differentially expressed genes were obtained in ‘green ring’, followed by ‘red ring’. Transcriptional alterations associated with the core and peripheral phenylpropanoid and lignin pathways, plant hormonal metabolisms were greatly influenced in the ‘green ring’ and ‘red ring’ by the A. alternata infection. The integrated analysis of transcriptomic profiling and metabolic changes revealed the differentially but delicately coordinated activation of these biological processes in the ‘green ring’ and ‘red ring’ on jujubes in defensing the fungal infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a31371846a31872907cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aAlternaria alternata 3aZiziphus jujuba 3afruits 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alignin 3ametabolomics 3aphenotype 3aphenylpropanoids 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest storage 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 0aJujube fruit 0aPhenylpropanoid 0aPlant hormone 0aResistance 0aTranscriptome1 aYan, Jiaqi1 aWang, Meng1 aDing, Xinyuan1 aZhang, Yinan1 aLi, Wusun1 aCao, Jiankang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6171-11701 aJiang, Weibo0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 60, no. 4 p.844-861dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy2523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014400157300001800301500002000319520166200339592002802001596005702029650001702086650001102103650001002114650001102124650001502135650001402150650003002164650001202194650001002206651000902216700005602225700006002281700002902341700005702370773013602427856007502563852000902638655001202647IND60776379720221118054825.0220505e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077637972DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.140782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalehi, Roya10aGenetic characterization of Blastocystis from poultry, livestock animals and humans in the southwest region of Iran—Zoonotic implications  ap. 1178-1185.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBlastocystis is the most common intestinal parasite found in epidemiological studies in Iran. The genus Blastocystis comprises multiple subtypes (ST), evincing the existence of extensive intrageneric diversity. Meanwhile, information on Blastocystis STs in domestic animals in Iran is limited. This study was designed to identify the prevalence and subtype distribution of Blastocystis in domestic animals and to evaluate the extent of zoonotic origin of human Blastocystis carriage. A total of 395 faecal samples from farm animals (220 from poultry, 100 from sheep and 75 from cattle) and 23 Blastocystis positive samples from humans (available from the previous report of this study and included for reference) from the Khuzestan province, southwestern Iran, were analysed. Standard parasitological methods and PCR‐based analysis of the SSU‐rRNA gene were used. Overall, 115 (29.1%; 95% CI, 26.5%–31.6%) of the animals were positive for Blastocystis sp. by parasitological methods. The highest colonization rate was found in cattle (50.6%, 38/75), followed by sheep (32.0%, 32/100) and poultry (20.4%, 45/220). Eight Blastocystis STs were identified among 55 sequenced isolates from animals (n = 32) and humans (n = 23): ST3 (27.3%), ST14 (25.4%), ST1 (12.7%), ST7 (12.7%), ST2 (9.1%), ST6 (7.3%), ST5 (3.6%) and ST10 (1.8%). Blastocystis ST1 and ST3 were found in both human and non‐human hosts, and examples of shared alleles (strains) were observed. Meanwhile, ST2 was observed only in humans, ST5 only in sheep, ST6 only in poultry and ST10 in only cattle. This is the most comprehensive report of Blastocystis STs in farm animals in Iran.  aPublisher supplied data  a6443cShahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences 3aBlastocystis 3acattle 3afarms 3ahumans 3aintestines 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry 3asheep 3aIran1 aRostami, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1358-13211 aMirjalali, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2568-90221 aStensvold, Christen Rune1 aHaghighi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9227-42730 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.1178-1185dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.140783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010400167300001600271520154700287592002801834650003301862650001801895650001401913650002001927650001101947650001901958650002001977650000901997650001102006650001402017650003602031700002202067700001602089700001902105700001902124700002202143700001702165700001802182700005702200773011502257856008302372852000902455655001202464IND60630594520221120040637.0190213e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063059452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b011752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlug, Yoel A.14aThe HIV gp41 Fusion Protein Inhibits T-Cell Activation through the Lentiviral Lytic Peptide 2 Motif  ap. 818-832.  aThe human immunodeficiency virus enters its host cells by membrane fusion, initiated by the gp41 subunit of its envelope protein. gp41 has also been shown to bind T-cell receptor (TCR) complex components, interfering with TCR signaling leading to reduced T-cell activation. This immunoinhibitory activity is suggested to occur during the membrane fusion process and is attributed to various membranotropic regions of the gp41 ectodomain and to the transmembrane domain. Although extensively studied, the cytosolic region of gp41, termed the cytoplasmic tail (CT), has not been examined in the context of immune suppression. Here we investigated whether the CT inhibits T-cell activation in different T-cell models by utilizing gp41-derived peptides and expressed full gp41 proteins. We found that a conserved region of the CT, termed lentiviral lytic peptide 2 (LLP2), specifically inhibits the activation of mouse, Jurkat, and human primary T-cells. This inhibition resulted in reduced T-cell proliferation, gene expression, cytokine secretion, and cell surface expression of CD69. Differential activation of the TCR signaling cascade revealed that CT-based immune suppression occurs downstream of the TCR complex. Moreover, LLP2 peptide treatment of Jurkat and primary human T-cells impaired Akt but not NFκB and ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that immune suppression occurs through the Akt pathway. These findings identify a novel gp41 T-cell suppressive element with a unique inhibitory mechanism that can take place post-membrane fusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytokines 3agene expression 3ahumans 3alytic peptides 3amembrane fusion 3amice 3amodels 3asecretion 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aSchwarzer, Roland1 aRotem, Etai1 aCharni, Meital1 aNudelman, Alon1 aGramatica, Andrea1 aZarmi, Batya1 aRotter, Varda1 aShai, Yechiel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4151-55130 tBiochemistry.g2019 Jan. 02, v. 58, no. 6 p.818-832dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b011753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245008100212300001600293520150300309592002801812650001801840650001401858650002401872650001101896650001801907650001301925650001901938650001701957650001801974650001901992650001302011650002402024650002602048700001802074700002102092700003102113700006002144700006702204773011702271856008402388852000902472655001202481IND60683815320221121153938.0200211e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068381532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b016122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWohlhauser, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5155-111810aOne-Component Nanocomposites Based on Polymer-Grafted Cellulose Nanocrystals  ap. 821-834.  aCellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are widely used as reinforcing fillers in polymers due to their exceptionally high stiffness and strength and because the biological species from which they are isolated represent renewable resources. However, aggregation of the CNCs, which is concomitant with limited reinforcement, is often difficult to avoid. One-component nanocomposites (OCNs) based on polymer-grafted nanoparticles can solve this problem because this approach affords, by design, materials in which no such aggregation is possible. At the same time, chain entanglements between the CNC-grafted polymer chains provide stress transfer among the particles. To demonstrate this, we investigated OCNs based on polymethacrylate-grafted CNCs. A previously unaccessed compositional space, that is, OCNs with a CNC content of 10 or 20 wt %, was explored. Cotton linter-based CNCs were modified via surface-photoinitiated free radical polymerization, which involved the functionalization of the CNC surfaces with benzophenone moieties as photoradical initiator species and the subsequent surface-photoinitiated polymerization of methyl or hexyl methacrylate under UV irradiation at 365 nm. The resulting particles readily dispersed in THF. Solvent-casting and compression-molding afforded films of homogeneous appearance, which display remarkable improvements in stiffness or toughness and strength in comparison to conventional two-component nanocomposites of unmodified CNCs and the respective polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzophenones 3acellulose 3acompression molding 3acotton 3afree radicals 3amoieties 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3arenewable resources 3aultraviolet radiation1 aKuhnt, Tobias1 aMeesorn, Worarin1 aMontero de Espinosa, Lucas1 aZoppe, Justin O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3599-92271 aWeder, C.q(Christoph),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7183-17900 tMacromolecules.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 53, no. 3 p.821-834dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b016123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100000700141245011800148300001600266500001500282520099600297592002801293650001201321650001001333650002101343650001201364650003301376650001201409650001501421650002001436650001401456653001901470653000901489653001601498653001101514653002901525700000701554700000701561700000701568700000701575700000701582700000701589773013701596856007701733852000901810655001201819IND60516538020221117204446.0160326e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051653802DNAL7 a10.1638/2015-0074.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aClinical infection of two captive asian elephants (elephas maximus) with elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus 1b  ap. 319-324.  a2019-12-06  aThe ability of prior infection from one elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) type to protect against clinical or lethal infection from others remains an important question. This report describes viremia and subsequent shedding of EEHV1B in two juvenile 4-yr-old Asian elephants within 3 wk or 2 mo following significant infections caused by the rarely seen EEHV4. High levels of EEHV1B shedding were detected in the first elephant prior to emergence of infection and viremia in the second animal. The EEHV1B virus associated with both infections was identical to the strain causing infection in two herd mates previously. High EEHV viremia correlated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which was followed by leukocytosis and thrombocytosis when clinical signs started to resolve. The observations from these cases should be beneficial for helping other institutions monitor and treat elephants infected with EEHV1, the most common virus associated with lethal hemorrhagic disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aherds 3athrombocytopenia 3aviremia 3aElephantid betaherpesvirus 1 3aviruses 3aleukopenia 3aElephas maximus 3ajuveniles 0aAsian elephant 0aqPCR 0aFamciclovir 0aEEHV1B 0aElephantid herpesvirus 11 a, 1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 1 a, 0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.319-324dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2015-0074.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011500158300001800273520041400291592002800705650001500733650001300748650001800761650001700779650001700796650001300813650002200826700001400848700001800862700001300880700001700893700001700910773014300927856007401070852000901144655001201153IND60671286220221118183758.0191002e20150923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067128622DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb01164g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Lingjie10aHigh-efficiency immunoassay platforms with controllable surface roughness and oriented antibody immobilization  ap. 7499-7502.  aHigh-efficiency immunoassay platforms with controlled surface roughness (single- and dual-scale structured surface) were prepared by combining a facile layer-by-layer particle deposition approach with oriented immobilization of antibodies through boronic acid moieties.

The cannabinoids obtained from Cannabis sativa exhibited their actions via cannabinoid-1 and -2 receptors, which also provides a platform for endocannabinoids to act. The endocannabinoid system comprises endocannabinoid molecules involved in signaling processes, along with G-protein coupled receptors and enzymes associated with ligand biosynthesis, activation and degradation. The action of endocannabinoid system in immune system regulation, via primary CB2 activation, followed by inhibition of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, auto-antibodies and MMPs, FLSs proliferation and T-cell mediated immune response, are elaborated as potential therapeutic regimes in rheumatoid arthritis. The involvement of endocannabinoid system in immune cells like, B cells, T cells and macrophages, as well as regulatory actions on sensory noniceptors to ameliorate pain is significantly highlighted in the review, elaborating the actions of endocannabinoid signaling in mitigating the disease events. The review also focuses on enhancement of endocannabinoid tone, either by inhibiting the degradation enzymes, like FAAH, MAGL, COX, CytP450, LOX, etc. or by retarding cellular uptake processes. Moreover, the review portrays the optimizing role of endocannabinoid system, in abbreviating the symptoms and complications of rheumatoid arthritis in patients and mitigating inflammation, pain and immune mediated effects significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3aG-proteins 3aT-lymphocytes 3aautoantibodies 3abiosynthesis 3acannabinoids 3acartilage 3acytokines 3adrug therapy 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aligands 3amacrophages 3apain 3arheumatoid arthritis 0aAutoimmune 0aCannabinoids 0aImmune response 0aProinflammatory cytokines 0aAuto-antibodies 0aSensory nociceptors 0aInflammation1 aBehl, Tapan1 aBungau, Simona1 aZengin, Gokhan1 aKumar, Arun1 aEl-Esawi, Mohamed A.1 aKhullar, Gaurav1 aVenkatachalam, Thangavel1 aArora, Sandeep0 tLife sciences.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 257 p.118109-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1181093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01291naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245009500162300001600257520031700273592002800590650002300618650002300641650001000664650001500674653002900689653001500718653002000733773015000753856007700903852000900980655001200989IND60521728120221120231814.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052172812DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1984-03082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillner, Helge14aDas Infrarotspektrum von matrixisoliertem SFCl / Infrared Spectrum of Matrix Isolated SFCl  ap. 314-316.  aThe new compound SFCl was obtained by UV photolysis of FC(O)SCl in rare gas matrix and by UV photolysis of Cl₂/SF₃SF in the gas phase.

I find that a non-trivial bid cap affects an agent’s expected payment in three ways: An “anti-competition effect” which is associated with this agent’s own signal, a pro-competitive “good news effect” which is associated with her opponents’ signals and which alleviates the winner’s curse, and an “inference effect” caused by affiliation of signals. Unlike the former two effects, the “inference effect” is a double-edged sword. It is anti-competitive when the cap is relatively low and pro-competitive when a cap is relatively high.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 0aC72 0aD44 0aD82 0aAll-pay auction 0aInterdependent valuation 0aAffiliation 0aBid cap0 tEconomics letters.g2019 Apr., v. 177 p.60-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2019.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245013500163300001600298520154900314592002801863650001201891650002001903650002501923650001801948650001801966650001001984650001801994650001102012650002702023650001602050650002102066650001202087650001902099651001502118651001002133653003302143653001402176653001202190653002402202653002202226700002302248700002202271700002202293773013702315856007702452852000902529655001202538IND60516538220221117204439.0160326e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051653822DNAL7 a10.1638/2015-0080.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonadeo, Brett C.10aEstimated composition of diets fed to captive black-and-white ruffed lemurs (varecia variegata) at 33 u.s. zoological institutions  ap. 150-160.  aData on captive diets for black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) are limited. Information on food items used, inclusion amounts, and the chemical composition of diets is needed to improve the management of nutrition-related health problems seen in captive lemurs (e.g., obesity) that have not been reported in their wild counterparts. To determine the ingredient and nutrient composition of diets for captive V. variegata, U.S. zoological institutions were surveyed. Chemical composition of reported diets was estimated using Nutritionist Pro™ (Axxya Systems, Stafford, Texas 77477, USA), and these values were compared numerically to wild lemur diets from the literature. Institutions included from six to greater than 30 different ingredients in their diets, including fruits (0.0–84.1%), vegetables (7.5–70.0%), greens (1.0–28.5%), and commercially available feeds (1.5–68.6%). Nutrient concentrations of captive diets ranged as follows: dry matter (DM), 14.5–67.6%; organic matter, 93.1–97.2% DM basis (DMB); crude protein, 7.9–23.9% DMB; fat, 2.0–6.5% DMB; total dietary fiber, 10.1–28.1% DMB; and N-free extract, 38.9–74.4% DMB. Captive diets had lower fat and total dietary fiber and higher protein and N-free extract compared to wild fruit items from Madagascar. Reducing the amount of fruit in captive diets for V. variegata would be expected to decrease digestible carbohydrate content and increase fiber content of these diets, which has implications for the prevalence of obesity in captive animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVarecia 3acaptive animals 3acarbohydrate content 3acrude protein 3adietary fiber 3afeeds 3afiber content 3afruits 3agreen leafy vegetables 3aingredients 3anutrient content 3aobesity 3aorganic matter 3aMadagascar 3aTexas 0aBlack-and-white ruffed lemur 0anutrition 0aprimate 0atotal dietary fiber 0aVarecia variegata1 aKerr, Katherine R.1 aMorris, Cheryl L.1 aSwanson, Kelly S.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.150-160dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2015-0080.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245008400161300001600245520168300261592002801944650001901972650002301991650003202014650001602046650001102062650001602073650002102089650001102110650001402121650001002135650001402145650002202159650001202181650001302193650001402206650001902220650001002239650001402249650001402263650001302277650000902290650000902299653002102308653001402329653001202343653001402355653001102369700002002380700001902400773013702419856007702556852000902633655001202642IND60516538320221117204529.0160326e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051653832DNAL7 a10.1638/2015-0086.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Kadie10aRetrospective evaluation of histopathologic findings in captive gazelle species  ap. 113-119.  aCapturing disease trends among different species has indisputable value to both veterinary clinicians and zoo managers for improving the welfare and management of zoo species. The causes of mortality for eight species of gazelle (addra gazelle, Nanger dama; dorcas gazelle, Gazella dorcas; Grant's gazelle, Nanger granti; sand gazelle, Gazella leptoceros; Saudi goitered gazelle, Gazella subgutturosa; Soemmerring's gazelle, Nanger soemmerringii; Thomson's gazelle, Eudorcas thomsonii; and Speke's gazelle, Gazella spekei) are presented from an 18-yr period (1996 2014). The leading cause of mortality for all species was trauma, followed by bronchopneumonia, and failure to thrive/maternal neglect. Nephritis and rumenitis/abomasitis/enteritis were common ancillary lesions across all species. On average, female gazelle lived twice as long as male gazelle, with an average overall adult survival time of 9.3 yr. Dorcas, Thomson's and addra gazelle females had the longest average survival time (10–13 yr). Calves up to 6 mo of age died most frequently from failure of passive transfer or maternal neglect. Thyroid carcinoma was frequently identified in Thomson's gazelle. Sand and Speke's gazelle frequently died from systemic amyloidosis, and Saudi goitered gazelle were more likely to have renal amyloidosis. Hematuria syndrome was the second most common cause of death in Grant's gazelle. The majority of lesions identified in this study that cause or contribute to mortality are preventable with appropriate management. Knowledge of disease trends in captive gazelle populations can help guide veterinary care, management decisions, and collection management planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGazella dorcas 3aGazella leptoceros 3aGazella subgutturosa marica 3aNanger dama 3aadults 3aamyloidosis 3abronchopneumonia 3acalves 3acarcinoma 3adeath 3aenteritis 3afailure to thrive 3afemales 3agazelles 3ahematuria 3ahistopathology 3amales 3amortality 3anephritis 3aplanning 3asand 3azoos 0aBronchopneumonia 0aenteritis 0agazelle 0amortality 0atrauma1 aGarner, Michael1 aStedman, Nancy0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.113-119dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2015-0086.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014100169300001600310520072100326592002801047650003201075650003301107650001001140650001101150650001201161650002201173650002301195650001801218650001401236650002201250700002301272700005901295700001801354700002001372700005901392773011501451856008301566852000901649655001201658IND60630594920221117175548.0190213e20190108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063059492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b011942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Kouhei10aPhospholipid Membrane Fluidity Alters Ligand Binding Activity of a G Protein-Coupled Receptor by Shifting the Conformational Equilibrium  ap. 504-508.  aThe affinity of a ligand for a receptor on the cell surface will be influenced by the membrane composition.

Consequently, the magnitude of the diurnal cycle in surface ozone is changing in several regions of the world. Changes in the diurnal cycle of ozone have implications for the metrics used to assess the impact of ozone on human health and vegetation, since different metrics are sensitive to different portions of the diurnal cycle. We use a high resolution model simulation to examine global changes in the magnitude of the diurnal cycle of O3 between 1980 and 2015. The simulation reproduces the negative trends in the tropospheric NO2 column over the eastern United States and Europe, and the positive trends over East Asia, seen by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). It also gives a reasonable reproduction of the change in the diurnal cycle of surface ozone seen at rural sites in the eastern United States between the 1990s and 2000s. The simulation shows that the magnitude of the surface O3 diurnal cycle is increasing in regions with positive changes in NOx emissions, such as South and East Asia, and decreasing in regions with reductions in NOx emissions. It also shows changes in the diurnal cycle of the tropospheric ozone column, although these have fewer regions with statistically significant trends. These changes suggest that daily mean ozone is responding less than the mid-day ozone measured by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and OMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aemissions 3ahuman health 3amonitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3areproduction 3asimulation models 3aspectrometers 3atroposphere 3avegetation 3aEast Asia 3aEastern United States 3aEurope 0aOzone 0aDiurnal cycle 0aOMI 0aTrends 0aGlobal modeling1 aZiemke, Jerald R.1 aOman, Luke D.1 aLamsal, Lok N.1 aOlsen, M.

This reliance, in a long run, is not a secure option. However, renewable energy sources can contribute to a sustainable electricity generation system; but diversifying fuel supply chain is a complex process. Therefore, the aim of this paper is two folds. Firstly, various renewable resources potential are reviewed, and secondly an assessment model is developed for prioritizing renewable options. Four major resources, hydropower, solar, wind, biomass (including biogas and municipal solid waste) are considered. Their electricity generation potential, along with any likely shortcoming is also discussed. Moreover, using a multi-perspective approach based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP), an assessment model is developed. AHP model employs four main criteria, technical, economical, social and environmental aspects, and twelve sub-criteria. From the review it was found that renewable resources seem to have a sufficient potential to develop a sustainable electricity system. Furthermore, AHP model prioritize those resources, revealing that solar is the most favorable resource followed by biomass. Hydropower and wind however, are ranked third and fourth, respectively. The model also shows that each resource is inclined towards a particular criterion; solar towards economical, biomass towards social, hydropower towards technical, and wind towards environmental aspect. Besides reporting AHP model for the first time in Malaysian context, the assessment performed in this study, can serve decision makers to formulate long-term energy policy aiming for sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3abiomass 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy policy 3afossil fuels 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 3awater power 3awind 3aMalaysia 0aRenewable energy 0aMalaysia 0aDecision support 0aAnalytic hierarchy process 0aElectricity1 aTahar, Razman Mat0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Mar., v. 63 p.458-466dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009500155300002000250520120300270592002801473650001601501650001501517650001101532650001101543650001101554650001401565650002301579650001501602650002101617650001601638650001801654650001401672650001401686650001101700650002001711650001901731650001601750700001701766700001601783700001301799700001301812700001401825773012401839856007401963852000902037655001202046IND60667137020221119212616.0190919e20150119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066713702DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14353a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dong10aCarbon-supported hollow palladium nanoparticles with enhanced electrocatalytic performance  ap. 10944-10950.  aCarbon-supported palladium nanoparticles (NPs) with hollow interiors (hPdNPs/C) are fabricated via a facile approach. In this strategy, core–shell NPs with an Ag core and an Ag–Pd alloy shell (Ag@Ag–Pd) are first synthesized in oleylamine by a galvanic replacement reaction between Ag seed particles and Pd²⁺ ion precursors. Then the core–shell Ag@Ag–Pd NPs are loaded on the XC-72 carbon supports and refluxed in acetic acid to remove the original organic surfactant. The carbon-supported core–shell Ag@Ag–Pd NPs are subsequently agitated in saturated Na₂S or NaCl solution for 24 h to eliminate the Ag component from the core and shell regions, leading to the formation of hPdNPs/C. Specifically, the hPdNPs/C generated by NaCl treatment exhibit superior catalytic activity and durability for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), compared with the commercial Pd/C catalysts from Johnson Matthey, mainly due to the high electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of the hollow structure, whereas the hPdNPs/C obtained by Na₂S treatment display very poor catalytic performance due to the serious poisoning induced by S²⁻ adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadsorption 3aalloys 3aamines 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aformic acid 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3asilver 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfide 3asurfactants1 aCui, Penglei1 aHe, Hongyan1 aLiu, Hui1 aYe, Feng1 aYang, Jun0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 19, v. 5, no. 15 p.10944-10950dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra14353a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04187naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100002900187245010100216300002100317506007600338506003100414520207700445592002802522596007902550596008302629596006902712506003702781650002602818650001202844650003202856650001702888650001602905650002502921650001502946650001002961650001502971650001602986650002203002650001303024650002503037650002403062650001703086650001203103650002003115651001303135653001503148653002103163653001203184653001603196653001603212700002103228700002003249700002803269773018403297856008303481852000903564655001203573IND60635279020221207055224.0220207e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063527902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2019.03.0082chorus7 a10.1016/j.jand.2019.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrescott, Melissa Pflugh10aResources, Barriers, and Tradeoffs: A Mixed Methods Analysis of School Pre-Consumer Food Waste  ap. 1270-1283.e2.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFood waste is a global problem. School food waste before the point of purchase, pre-consumer waste, has been little studied. Our aim was to elicit a comprehensive assessment and understanding of pre-consumer food waste amounts, behaviors, policies, and attitudes. This study used mixed methods, featuring a convergent parallel design using key respondent interviews (n=20) and 80 hours of structured kitchen observations, including food waste measurement. School and district kitchens (n=14) using stratified random sampling to ensure school level and kitchen type reflected the population of three Colorado school districts in 2016-2017. Kitchen managers, district-level nutrition services directors, and sustainability staff were interviewed. Mean food waste volumes and percentages were calculated. Linear regressions were used to determine the relationship between school kitchen characteristics and food waste volumes. Interviews were coded to identify common themes. Trim waste and overproduction contributed the most to overall pre-consumer food waste; substandard foods and overproduction were the most common reasons for edible waste. Several competing priorities conflicted with schools’ and districts’ waste reduction efforts: food safety, promoting diet quality, food choice, and customer satisfaction. Batch cooking, production record use, shallow salad bar pans, and other inventory management techniques facilitated waste reduction. Staffing, space, and time constraints made it more difficult to implement these strategies. Increased food choice options were positively associated with pre-consumer waste volume (β=49.5, P=0.04), and this relationship remained significant once regression models adjusted for district, salad bar use, and new menu items (β=70.3, P=0.05). School nutrition programs are complex, and a systems approach is warranted to reduce overall waste in the context of existing food safety and nutrition policies. More research is needed to elucidate the impact of food choice on overall food waste of the school meal system.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Agriculture, Philippinesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100012933  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUniversiteit Stellenboschdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000044770 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconsumer satisfaction 3acooking 3afood and nutrition programs 3afood choices 3afood safety 3afood service workers 3afood waste 3afoods 3ainterviews 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3akitchens 3anutritional adequacy 3aregression analysis 3aschool meals 3aschools 3awaste reduction 3aColorado 0aFood waste 0aSchool nutrition 0aSystems 0aFoodservice 0aPlate waste1 aHerritt, Cameron1 aBunning, Marisa1 aCunningham-Sabo, Leslie0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2019 Aug., v. 119, no. 8 p.1270-1283.e2dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2019.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245013500196300001800331506007600349520039900425592002800824506003700852650001600889650001800905650001700923650002000940650001400960650002300974650001800997700001801015700001701033700001601050773014101066856007401207852000901281655001201290IND60671286520221207140009.0191002e20151008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067128652DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb01171j2doi7 aPMC46751692pmcid7 a266604682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, E.

Mitophagy protects against kidney injury. However, the mechanistic interplay between cell senescence and mitophagy in RTECs is not clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibition of RTEC senescence and renal fibrosis by quercetin and explore the underlying mechanisms. We found that quercetin attenuated RTEC senescence induced by angiotensin II (AngII) in vitro and unilateral ureteral obstruction in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that mitochondrial abnormalities such as elevated reactive oxygen species, decreased membrane potential, and fragmentation and accumulation of mitochondrial mass, occurred in AngII-treated RTECs. Quercetin treatment reversed these effects. Furthermore, quercetin enhanced mitophagy in AngII-treated RTECs, which was markedly reduced by treatment with mitophagy-specific inhibitors. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) was involved in quercetin-mediated PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-associated mitophagy activation. Pharmacological antagonism of SIRT1 in AngII-treated RTECs blocked the effects of quercetin on mitophagy and cellular senescence. Finally, quercetin alleviated kidney fibrosis by reducing RTEC senescence via mitophagy. Collectively, the antifibrotic effect of quercetin involved inhibition of RTEC senescence, possibly through activation of SIRT1/PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. These findings suggest that pharmacological elimination of senescent cells and stimulation of mitophagy represent effective therapeutic strategies to prevent kidney fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonism 3acell senescence 3aepithelial cells 3afibrosis 3akidneys 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitophagy 3aquercetin 3areactive oxygen species 3asirtuins 3atherapeutics 0aQuercetin 0aSenescence 0aMitophagy 0aMitochondria 0aFibrosis1 aYang, Qunfang1 aZhang, Xuan1 aQin, Rongxing1 aShan, Wenjun1 aZhang, Haigang1 aChen, Xiaohong0 tLife sciences.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 257 p.118116-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1181163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013900160300002000299520058300319592002800902650001100930650002100941650000900962650002200971650001800993700002001011700001601031700001901047773012301066856007401189852000901263655001201272IND60664583520221123011838.0190912e20130805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458352DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42759e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun-Kyung10aSynthesis of nano-Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ decorated on non-oxidized carbon nanotubes with enhanced rate capability for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 14267-14272.  aIn this study, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ nanoparticles (15–20 nm) uniformly decorated on non-oxidized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for use as the anode material in Li-ion batteries.

While undisturbed cooling of hot THF solution of 1 led to the formation of microcrystals, bath-sonication of a similar solution resulted in predominant fibrillation with concomitant gelation. Spectroscopic studies indicated that 1 assembled predominantly by H-bonding interactions between the amide groups. Interestingly, we did not find any evidence of conformational change in 1 during sonication through a variety of techniques employed. However, the morphology of assemblies of 1 could be readily modified in a controlled fashion via sonication at early crystal growth stage. Exposing the resulting nanofibrillar assemblies to certain anions dismantled them, and induced macroscopic gel-to-sol transition. The relative rates of this disassembly were governed by the size of anions and their binding constants with 1. ¹H NMR titration experiment revealed strong interaction of fluoride and chloride anions with the amide protons of 1. The binding constants of the fluoride and chloride ions with 1 were calculated for the first time in this class of molecules, and were found to be 120 and 33 M⁻¹ respectively, correlating with the basicity of these ions. Deprotonation of 1 and evidence of HF₂⁻ formation was also observed at high fluoride concentrations.

To examine this, we assessed the physicochemical property, homologous alignment, and phylogenetic analyses of the ACSL1 amino acid sequence using bioinformatics tools. The analysis indicated that the ACSL1 amino acid sequence varies in animals, and the duck ACSL1 protein is most closely related to that of chicken. Two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were identified at 1749 and 1905 bp of the coding region of ACSL1 by sequencing. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein levels in abdominal fat, breast muscle, and liver tissue of Pekin duck (BD) and Cherry Valley duck (CD). mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher in BD than in CD in abdominal fat and liver tissue (P < 0.05). In breast muscle, the mRNA level of ACSL1 was also significantly higher in BD than in CD (P < 0.05), and protein expression in BD tended to be higher than that of CD. These results suggest that ACSL1 may contribute to lipid deposition and meat quality in ducks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPekin 3aabdominal fat 3aamino acid sequences 3abioinformatics 3abreast muscle 3achickens 3aducks 3agene expression 3agenes 3alipids 3aliver 3ameat quality 3aphylogeny 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aSNPs 0alipid deposition 0aduck 0aACSL11 aWang, Zhixiu1 aZhang, Hongliang1 aLi, Xiangxiang1 aZhang, Yang1 aXu, Qi1 aChang, Guobin1 aZhang, Hao1 aChen, Guohong0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2021 Sept. 24, v. 102, no. 1 p.117-123dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x1918-18257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/CJAS-2020-01313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011300156300001800269500002000287500001500307520155900322592002801881650001101909650001501920650001001935650001501945650002001960650001401980650001501994650001602009650001202025650002202037650001402059650002602073651001202099653001502111700002102126700002302147700002102170700002102191700001802212700002202230700002002252700001502272773010202287856007302389852000902462655001202471IND60572215120221121005707.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221512DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.138872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaenen, Lies10aSpatio‐temporal analysis of Nova virus, a divergent hantavirus circulating in the European mole in Belgium  ap. 5994-6008.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aOver the last decade, the recognized host range of hantaviruses has expanded considerably with the discovery of distinct hantaviruses in shrews, moles and bats. Unfortunately, in‐depth studies of these viruses have been limited. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of the spatial distribution, genetic diversity and evolution of Nova virus, a hantavirus that has the European mole as its natural host. Our analysis demonstrated that Nova virus has a high prevalence and widespread distribution in Belgium. While Nova virus displayed relatively high nucleotide diversity in Belgium, amino acid changes were limited. The nucleocapsid protein was subjected to strong purifying selection, reflecting the strict evolutionary constraints placed upon Nova virus by its host. Spatio‐temporal analysis using Bayesian evolutionary inference techniques demonstrated that Nova virus had efficiently spread in the European mole population in Belgium, forming two distinct clades, representing east and west of Belgium. The influence of landscape barriers, in the form of the main waterways, on the dispersal velocity of Nova virus was assessed using an analytical framework for comparing Bayesian viral phylogenies with environmental landscape data. We demonstrated that waterways did not act as an environmental resistance factor slowing down Nova virus diffusion in the mole population. With this study, we provide information about the spatial diffusion of Nova virus and contribute sequence information that can be applied in further functional studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3ashrews 3ahost range 3amoles 3alandscapes 3aOrthohantavirus 3aphylogeny 3aChiroptera 3aamino acids 3aviruses 3agenetic variation 3awaterways 3anucleocapsid proteins 3aBelgium 0aHantavirus1 aDellicour, Simon1 aVergote, Valentijn1 aNauwelaers, Inne1 aDe Coster, Sarah1 aVerbeeck, Ina1 aVanmechelen, Bert1 aLemey, Philippe1 aMaes, Piet0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 23 p.5994-6008dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.138873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010300165300001600268520121200284592002801496650001401524650001301538650001101551650001101562650001201573650001301585650001201598650001801610650001101628700001401639700001901653700005501672773008701727856008501814852000901899655001201908IND60628087120221122050628.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Peibo10aConstructing flexible coaxial-cable structured sulfur cathode with carbon nanomaterials on textile  ap. 525-531.  aLithium-sulfur battery is an attractive energy storage system owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, the insulating nature of sulfur and “shuttle effect” of intermediate lithium polysulfides hinders its practical utilization. Herein, we demonstrate a facile dip-coating process to construct coaxial-cable carbon structure directly on the fibers of textile as sulfur host. Specifically, textile is dip-coated in the suspension of CNTs, CNT/sulfur hybrid and graphene in sequence. After drying, three corresponding layers are spontaneously formed on the fibers of the textiles due to Van der Waals force. The composite cathode delivers a reversible discharge capacity as high as 913.0 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.5 C and excellent cycling stability with a retention rate of 88% after 200 cycles with a sulfur loading of 3 mg cm⁻². The excellent performance is ascribed to the high absorption capability of polysulfides in the hierarchical porous structures, excellent conductivity of CNT, and effective shuttle suppression of polysulfides by graphene sheet. The process reported in this work can provide a new way to synthesize flexible and robust sulfur cathode for LiS battery application.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acathodes 3adrying 3aenergy 3afabrics 3agraphene 3alithium 3ananomaterials 3asulfur1 aHuang, Xi1 aCen, Dingcheng1 aBao, Zhihao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8708-75100 tCarbon.g2019 Apr., v. 144 p.525-531dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01666naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015600154300002000310520043600330592002800766650004400794650001500838650002500853650002200878650001900900650001900919650001900938650001900957650000900976650002000985650002101005700001701026700001701043700001301060773012401073856007401197852000901271655001201280IND60664583820221123011805.0190912e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458382DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42762e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRtimi, S.10aInnovative semi-transparent nanocomposite films presenting photo-switchable behavior and leading to a reduction of the risk of infection under sunlight  ap. 16345-16348.  aNovel sputtered polyethylene–TiO₂ (PE–TiO₂) thin films induce fast bacterial inactivation with concomitant photo-switchable hydrophobic to hydrophilic transition under light.

Such multiplexed protein arrays are predicted to have an important future in personalized medical diagnostics, especially for cancer and heart disease. Sandwich immunoassays for proteins benefit greatly in sensitivity from the use of nanostructured sensor surfaces and multilabeled detection strategies involving nano- or microparticles. In these assays, capture agents such as antibodies or aptamers are attached to sensor surfaces in the array. Target proteins with large binding constants for the affinity agents are captured from liquid samples with high efficiency, either on the sensors or on magnetic bioconjugate particles decorated with many copies of labels and antibodies. After target proteins are captured on the sensor surfaces, the labels are detected by electrochemical techniques. This feature article begins with an overview of the recent history of nanoparticles in electrochemical protein sensors, then moves on to specific examples from our own laboratories. We discuss fabrication of nanostructured sensors and arrays with the aim of multiplexed detection as well as reusability. Following this, we describe systems that integrate particle-based protein sensing with microfluidics for multiplexed protein detection. We end with predictions on the diagnostic future of protein detection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3abiocompatible materials 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrochemistry 3aheart diseases 3aimmunoassays 3aliquids 3amagnetism 3amicrofluidic technology 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aprediction 3aprotein microarrays 3aproteins1 aBishop, Gregory W.1 aDoan, Nhi M.1 aPapadimitrakopoulos, Fotios0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2013 Nov. 27, v. 2, no. 1 p.12-30dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21323d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245018000158300002000338520114600358592002801504650002101532650002301553650001401576650001601590650000901606650001801615650001701633650001901650650001901669650001701688650001601705650001301721650001301734650001801747650002401765650001301789700001901802700001501821700001801836773012501854856007401979852000902053655001202062IND60664583920221123011534.0190912e20130927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458392DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42763c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Kang-Yu10aAmphiphilic photocleavable block copolymers based on monomethyl poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(4-substituted-ε-caprolactone): synthesis, characterization, and cellular uptake  ap. 18453-18463.  aThis paper presents the synthesis of a novel amphiphilic block copolymer containing photodegradable linkers as junction points between hydrophilic and hydrophobic chains. MPEG-ONB-PXCL block copolymers were synthesized by a combination of ROP and “clicks” from a difunctional photoresponsive initiator (ONB). The copolymers are biodegradable and biocompatible, and can self-assemble into photoresponsive micelles. When polymer solutions were exposed to UV, we observed significant changes in the structure and morphology of particles. Fluorescence emission measurements showed that Nile red (NR), a hydrophobic dye, encapsulated by the MPEG-ONB-PXCL micelles, is released upon irradiation because of disruption of the micelles. Light-triggered bursts were observed for Indomethacin (IMC)-loaded MPEG-ONB-PXCL micelles upon at 30 min of light irradiation. No significant toxicity of these nanoparticles was found, at concentrations up to 1000 μg mL⁻¹, before or after light irradiation. The doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded micelles facilitated improved uptake of DOX by HeLa cells within 60 min, and were retained primarily in the cytoplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3acytoplasm 3adoxorubicin 3adyes 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aindomethacin 3airradiation 3alactones 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene glycol 3atoxicity1 aWang, Shiu-Wei1 aHua, Mu-Yi1 aLee, Ren-Shen0 tRSC advances.g2013 Sept. 27, v. 3, no. 40 p.18453-18463dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra42763c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009300159300001800252500002000270520160400290592002801894650002001922650001601942650001801958650001501976650001001991650001302001650001902014650002402033650002202057650002002079650002402099650002302123650001502146650001502161650002102176650002502197650001002222650001602232650001402248650003002262650001902292650002902311651002202340651001202362651001002374651001202384651001002396700002102406700002202427700002502449700002702474700002402501700002002525700001802545700002002563700001802583773010202601856007302703852000902776655001202785IND60572215420221121005539.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221542DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.138782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossmann, Lars10aTrade‐off between taxon diversity and functional diversity in European lake ecosystems  ap. 5876-5888.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInferring ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services through inspections of the species inventory is a major aspect of ecological field studies. Ecosystem functions are often stable despite considerable species turnover. Using metatranscriptome analyses, we analyse a thus‐far unparalleled freshwater data set which comprises 21 mainland European freshwater lakes from the Sierra Nevada (Spain) to the Carpathian Mountains (Romania) and from northern Germany to the Apennines (Italy) and covers an altitudinal range from 38 m above sea level (a.s.l) to 3110 m a.s.l. The dominant taxa were Chlorophyta and streptophytic algae, Ciliophora, Bacillariophyta and Chrysophyta. Metatranscriptomics provided insights into differences in community composition and into functional diversity via the relative share of taxa to the overall read abundance of distinct functional genes on the ecosystem level. The dominant metabolic pathways in terms of the fraction of expressed sequences in the cDNA libraries were affiliated with primary metabolism, specifically oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis and the TCA cycle. Our analyses indicate that community composition is a good first proxy for the analysis of ecosystem functions. However, differential gene regulation modifies the relative importance of taxa in distinct pathways. Whereas taxon composition varies considerably between lakes, the relative importance of distinct metabolic pathways is much more stable, indicating that ecosystem functioning is buffered against shifts in community composition through a functional redundancy of taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyta 3aChlorophyta 3aChrysophyceae 3aCiliophora 3aalgae 3aaltitude 3acDNA libraries 3acommunity structure 3acomplementary DNA 3adata collection 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3afreshwater lakes 3afunctional diversity 3agenes 3ainventories 3amountains 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aphotosynthesis 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aCarpathian region 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aRomania 3aSpain1 aBeisser, Daniela1 aBöck, Christina,1 aChatzinotas, Antonis1 aJensen, M.q(Manfred),1 aPreisfeld, Angelika1 aPsenner, Roland1 aRahmann, Sven1 aWodniok, Sabina1 aBoenigk, Jens0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 23 p.5876-5888dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.138783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011600163300001600279520108800295592002801383650002301411650001501434650002601449650001801475650001101493650001401504650001101518650001301529650001701542650001401559650002301573650001901596700002601615700002301641700003101664700002201695773013901717856007401856852000901930655001201939IND60670690720221122083608.0191002e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067069072DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb21328e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernini, María C.10aScreening of bio-compatible metal–organic frameworks as potential drug carriers using Monte Carlo simulations  ap. 766-774.  aA series of bio-compatible metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied as potential carriers for drug delivery applications. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed to study the adsorption of the model drug ibuprofen. Simulations were first validated with available experimental data for ibuprofen adsorption and release in MIL-53, MIL-100 and MIL-101. In the second stage, the study was extended to three additional MOFs with interesting properties in terms of bio-compatibility and porosity: CDMOF-1, based on edible precursors; MOF-74 containing a highly biocompatible metal (Mg); and BioMOF-100, a mesoporous MOF with extremely high pore volume. By comparing with experimental data, we show how GCMC simulation is able to predict the macroscopic performance of new porous MOFs in drug delivery applications, providing useful molecular-level insights and giving thermodynamic and structural details of the process. Adsorption isotherms, snapshots, energy of adsorption and radial distribution functions were used to analyse the drug delivery process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3adrug carriers 3aenergy 3aibuprofen 3amodels 3aporosity 3aporous media 3ascreening 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics1 aFairen-Jimenez, David1 aPasinetti, Marcelo1 aRamirez-Pastor, Antonio J.1 aSnurr, Randall Q.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 2, no. 7 p.766-774dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21328e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245012600189300001600315520076400331592002801095650000801123650001201131650001101143650001001154650002101164650001001185650001501195650001901210650001301229650001401242650002401256650003101280650002901311650001101340650003801351650001101389650001901400650002201419651002701441700002101468700002001489700002001509700002101529700002501550700001901575773009801594856008401692990002301776852000901799655001201808IND60092062520221120083246.0141103e20110328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009206252DNAL7 a212365612pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2010.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolyom, Szilvia10aScreening for large genomic rearrangements in the FANCA gene reveals extensive deletion in a Finnish breast cancer family  ap. 113-118.  aA portion of familial breast cancer cases are caused by mutations in the same genes that are inactivated in the downstream part of Fanconi anemia (FA) signaling pathway. Here we have assessed the FANCA gene for breast cancer susceptibility by examining blood DNA for aberrations from 100 Northern Finnish breast cancer families using the MLPA method. We identified a novel heterozygous deletion, removing the promoter and 12 exons of the gene in one family. This allele was absent from 124 controls. We conclude that FANCA deletions might contribute to breast cancer susceptibility, potentially in combination with other germline mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a large deletion in an upstream FA gene in familial breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalleles 3aanemia 3ablood 3abreast neoplasms 3aexons 3agerm cells 3aheterozygosity 3amutation 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 2aBreast Neoplasmsxgenetics 2aFanconi Anemiaxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aMass Screening 2aSequence Deletion 0aFinlandxepidemiology.1 aWinqvist, Robert1 aNikkilä, Jenni1 aRapakko, Katrin1 aHirvikoski, Pasi1 aKokkonen, Hannaleena1 aPylkäs, Katri0 tCancer letters.g2011 Mar. 28, v. 302, no. 2 p.113-118dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2010.12.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012400171300001600295520128000311592002801591650002801619650001101647650001501658650001201673650002001685650001601705650002501721650002501746653003401771653002301805653003801828653001101866653001201877700001201889700001501901700001401916700002101930773009701951856008702048852000902135655001202144IND60566051020221120045949.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056605102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xiaofeng10aComprehensive comparison between silicon carbide MOSFETs and silicon IGBTs based traction systems for electric vehicles  ap. 626-634.  aIn this paper, the performance of both silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs and silicon (Si) IGBTs based electric vehicle (EV) traction systems are investigated and compared comprehensively, particularly from the efficiency point of view. Both conduction loss and switching loss of SiC-MOSFETs are analyzed and modeled taking temperature effect into account. Such approach yields a more accurate prediction of SiC losses. The temperature distribution of SiC-Inverter is described by ANSYS finite element analysis (FEA), and compared with Si counterparts. According to the lower losses and higher thermal conductivity, SiC exhibits much lower temperature than Si under the same power rating and cooling condition. Subsequently, this paper goes further by conducting an investigation of the effect of SiC-Inverter on the motor efficiency. Experimental results show that the SiC-based inverter-motor traction system has observably higher efficiency of overall system compared to the Si-based traction system, and first explore that the motor has extremely high efficiency under low speed and light load when it is driven by a SiC-MOSFETs based inverter due to the higher switching speed of SiC MOSFETs. Meanwhile, the experimental results also confirm the losses models of SiC MOSFETs.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3aprediction 3asilicon 3asilicon carbide 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3avehicles (equipment) 0aSilicon carbide (SiC)-MOSFETs 0aSilicon (Si)-IGBTs 0aElectric vehicle traction systems 0aLosses 0aThermal1 aDu, Min1 aZhou, Tong1 aGuo, Hong1 aZhang, Chengming0 tApplied energy.g2017 May 15, v. 194 p.626-634dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008400168300001400252520194900266592002802215650001902243650001002262650002702272650001502299650001502314650001802329650002002347650002502367650002302392650001402415650002002429650002402449650001702473650001802490651001202508653003102520653002402551653001002575653001502585653002102600653001502621700006602636700005502702773009302757856008702850852000902937655001202946IND60612095820221118132436.0200509e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061209582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTörmä, K.10aCompliance in own-check systems poses challenges in small-scale slaughterhouses  ap. 27-33.  aSmall-scale slaughterhouses (SHs) face many challenges, not least due to the requirements of food safety legislation. Food business operators' (FBOs') own-check system is very important for food safety, but its proper implementation can be quite difficult and laborious for small-scale SHs. In the European Union, the importance not only of food safety but also facilitation of local food production, including small-scale slaughtering, is highlighted. The aim of our study was to assess compliance with legislation of own-check systems, including six own-check programmes and HACCP, in small-scale SHs. The FBOs' opinions of the implementation of own-check systems were also sought to elucidate possible obstacles in implementation. Our results showed that the best compliance in own-check programmes was achieved in temperature of storage rooms and traceability. FBOs also evaluated these programmes as necessary. However, FBOs' perceived necessity of own-check programmes did not always lead to compliance, as was the case with labelling and HACCP. Instead, in HACCP laboriousness and compliance showed a negative correlation (p < 0.05). In addition to laboriousness, costs of own-check programmes, specifically concerning microbiological sampling requirements, appeared to influence compliance, with many of the small-scale SHs poorly following sampling requirements. FBOs also noted the high costs of the non-edible by-product programme. Moreover, the results show that official veterinarians’ assessment of compliance was significantly higher than that of the researcher, which warrants further investigation. This study reveals that many small-scale SHs in Finland struggle with food safety requirements. Amendments of some of the requirements to ease the burden of FBOs are proposed. HACCP in particular is suggested to be simplified. In addition, ways to improve food safety and official control in small-scale SHs are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aHACCP 3aattitudes and opinions 3abyproducts 3acompliance 3afood industry 3afood production 3alaws and regulations 3alocal food systems 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3astorage temperature 3atraceability 3aveterinarians 3aFinland 0aSmall-scale slaughterhouse 0aOwn-check programme 0aHACCP 0aCompliance 0aOfficial control 0aInspection1 aFredriksson-Ahomaa, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6129-88541 aLundén, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-231X0 tFood control.g2019 Jan., v. 95 p.27-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245016800161520201800329592002802347650001902375650001202394650001702406650001702423650002002440650001802460650002302478650001502501650001602516650001302532650001102545650001702556650000902573650001702582650001202599650002502611651001102636651002502647700002002672700002202692700002202714700002702736773012902763856007502892852000902967655001202976IND60784187820221120030910.0220726e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078418782DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSparks, Aaron M.10aMapping Arable Land and Permanent Agriculture Extent and Change in Southern Greece Using the European Union LUCAS Survey and a 35-Year Landsat Time Series Analysis  aAgricultural land extent and change information is needed to assess food security, the effectiveness of land use policy, and both environmental and societal impacts. This information is especially valuable in biodiversity hotspots such as the Mediterranean region, where agricultural land expansion can result in detrimental effects such as soil erosion and the loss of native species. There has also been a growing concern that changing agricultural extent in fire-prone regions of the Mediterranean may increase fire risk due to accumulation of fuel in abandoned areas. In this study, we assessed the extent and change of agricultural land in Southern Greece from 1986 to 2020 using a combined European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) and Landsat time series approach. The LUCAS data and Landsat spectral-temporal metrics were used to train a random forest classifier, which was used to classify arable land and permanent agriculture (e.g., olive orchards, vineyards) at annual time steps. A post-processing step was taken to reduce spurious landcover class transitions using transition likelihoods and annual class membership likelihoods. A validation dataset consisting of 2666 samples, identified via a stratified random sampling approach and high-resolution imagery and time series analysis, were used to evaluate stable and change strata accuracies. Overall accuracies were greater than 70% and strata-specific accuracies were highly variable between stable and change strata. The results show that southern Greece has experienced a recent gain in arable land (~12,000 ha from ~2009–2020) and a much larger gain in permanent agriculture (>115,000 ha from ~1993–2020). Arable land loss mainly occurred from 1987 to ~2002 when extent decreased by 15,000 ha, of which 66% was abandoned. The semi-automated approach described in this paper provides a promising approach for monitoring agricultural land change and enabling assessments of agriculture policy effectiveness and environmental impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aLandsat 3aarable soils 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3afood security 3aindigenous species 3aland cover 3aland policy 3aland use 3aolives 3apermaculture 3arisk 3asoil erosion 3asurveys 3atime series analysis 3aGreece 3aMediterranean region1 aBouhamed, Imen 1 aBoschetti, Luigi 1 aGitas, Ioannis Z.1 aKalaitzidis, Chariton 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 13, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245014000162300001800302520171600320592002802036596004402064596005202108650001902160650001702179650002502196650002502221650001102246650001302257650001402270650001302284650002802297650001202325650001502337650001302352650001302365650001602378650001902394650002102413650002002434650001402454650002102468650001202489700001402501700001802515700005602533773012502589856008302714852000902797655001202806IND60777779120221119022725.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077777912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-021-10426-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jia10aEffects of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid on Seed Germination, Ion Balance, and Metabolic Activity in Perennial Ryegrass Under Salinity Stress  ap. 1835-1844.  aGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can mediate plant stress tolerance. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of GABA on seed germination, seedling growth, ion elements, and carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolism in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) cultivar ‘Inspire’ exposed to salinity stress. Seed germination percentage was significantly reduced by 175 mM NaCl, but 1 mM GABA added to the salinity treatment (GABA + NaCl) substantially improved germination (78%) compared to the NaCl treatment alone (46%). Compared to the non-stressed control, seedling length, shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, shoot carbon, and shoot nitrogen concentrations decreased under 175 mM NaCl, but such reductions were significantly lower in seedlings treated with GABA + NaCl. Salinity stress increased Na⁺ and did not alter K⁺ concentrations in the shoots, but GABA had no effect on both ions under the stress condition. The increased shoot glucose and fructose and unchanged sucrose concentrations were shown in the seedlings under the NaCl stress, and NaCl + GABA treatment had significantly higher glucose and lower sucrose but the same fructose concentrations, compared to the NaCl treatment alone. Salinity stress increased the activity of shoot superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, but higher CAT activity and unchanged SOD and APX activities were observed in the NaCl + GABA treatment, compared to the NaCl treatment alone. The results indicated that GABA ameliorated salinity tolerance by improving seed germination, seedling growth, and C and N status and altering carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data  a201806350083cChina Scholarship Council  a2017cThe Midwest Regional Turfgrass Foundation 3aLolium perenne 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3acatalase 3acultivars 3afructose 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3astress tolerance 3asucrose1 aLi, Manli1 aMao, Peisheng1 aJiang, Yiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0672-37470 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 June, v. 41, no. 4 p.1835-1844dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10426-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012700168300001600295520168500311592002801996650002502024650002402049650002502073650001102098650001102109650001902120650002602139650001902165650001302184653003202197653002602229653003402255653003302289653002302322653001902345700001702364700001402381700001402395700002002409700001402429773009702443856008702540852000902627655001202636IND60566051120221120045802.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056605112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huajiao10aGlobal energy investment structure from the energy stock market perspective based on a Heterogeneous Complex Network Model  ap. 648-657.  aEnergy is not only an important international commodity but is also an important financial product. Many studies address the global energy structure by considering energy as commodity, but few study it based on energy’s financial attributes. In this paper, we analyzed the global energy investment structure based on the shareholding relationships between listed energy companies and their shareholders by taking the frontier approach to complex network theory and treating these relationships as a heterogeneous complex network from a global angle. We constructed a primitive investment network of listed energy companies and their shareholders (two sets of actors). Then, based on the two-mode affiliation relationships between two sets of actors and countries, we constructed a derivative investment network of 112 countries (and regions). By calculating different topological features, we quantitatively analyzed the national diversity of outward and inward energy investment, the energy investment preference, the strength of the bilateral energy investment relationship between countries (and regions) and the most powerful group of energy investing countries based on the shareholding relationships of global listed energy companies. It is found that the vast majority of outward and inward investment relationships are still in the hands of a few countries: traditional developed countries, emerging countries, and a few particular island countries (and regions) that are tax havens. This study is helpful for analyzing the roles and investment relationships of nations as well as the global energy investment structure taking the perspective of the energy stock market.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3amodels 3anetwork theory 3aquantitative analysis 3astock exchange 3atopology 0aEnergy investment structure 0aListed energy company 0aInward and outward investment 0aEnergy investment preference 0aBilateral relation 0aPowerful group1 aAn, Haizhong1 aFang, Wei1 aWang, Yue1 aZhong, Weiqiong1 aYan, Lili0 tApplied energy.g2017 May 15, v. 194 p.648-657dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245003300165300001600198500001500214520103200229592002801261650001301289650002301302653002501325653002601350653002301376653002701399653001701426700001901443700002201462700002101484700001801505773010101523856008201624852000901706655001201715IND60125320720221116143344.0151103e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012532072DNAL7 a10.1525/bio.2012.62.10.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoble, Dale D.10aConservation-Reliant Species  ap. 869-873.  a2019-12-04  aA species is conservation reliant when the threats that it faces cannot be eliminated, but only managed. There are two forms of conservation reliance: population- and threat-management reliance. We provide an overview of the concept and introduce a series of articles that examine it in the context of a range of taxa, threats, and habitats. If sufficient assurances can be provided that successful population and threat management will continue, conservation-reliant species may be either delisted or kept off the endangered species list. This may be advantageous because unlisted species provide more opportunities for a broader spectrum of federal, state, tribal, and private interests to participate in conservation. Even for currently listed species, the number of conservation-reliant species—84% of endangered and threatened species with recovery plans— and the magnitude of management actions needed to sustain the species at recovered levels raise questions about society's willingness to support necessary action.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitats 3aendangered species 0aconservation reliant 0afragmented ecosystems 0athreatened species 0aconservation dependent 0aconservation1 aWiens, John A.1 aScott, J.

Neonate and 3ʳᵈ instar larvae survival was evaluated on leaf tissue treated with microbial and chemical insecticides including a commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis (Dipel), a Heliothis (Helicoverpa) nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV; Gemstar), λ-cyhalothrin (Karate Z), and chlorantraniliprole (Prevathon). Residual activity of insecticides was measured in a small plot field experiment. The performance of microbial insecticides, with the exception of a mid-rate of Dipel with neonate larvae, was comparable with that of chemical treatments on non-Bt cotton leaves with regard to 1ˢᵗ and 3ʳᵈ instar bollworm mortality at 10 d and pupal eclosion at 20-d post treatment. Production-level field evaluations of supplemental bollworm control in non-Bt and Bt cottons with NPV, λ-cyhalothrin, and chlorantraniliprole were also conducted. During both years of the field study, all chemical and microbial treatments were successful in suppressing bollworm larval densities in non-Bt cotton below economic threshold levels. Overall, net returns above bollworm control, regardless of treatment, were negatively correlated with larval abundance and plant damage. In addition, there was no economic benefit for supplemental control of bollworms in Bt cotton at the larval densities observed during this study. These data provide benchmark comparisons for insect resistance management with microbial and chemical insecticides in Bt and non-Bt cottons and strategic optimization of the need to spray non-Bt and Bt cotton in IRM programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aBaculoviridae 3aGossypium 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aHeliothis 3achemical treatment 3acosts and returns 3acotton 3aeclosion 3aeconomic threshold 3afield experimentation 3afinancial economics 3ainsect resistance 3ainstars 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amicrobial insecticides 3amortality 3aneonates 3aplant damage 3apupae 3aresistance management 3atransgenic plants 0anuclear polyhedrosis virus1 aLuttrell, R.

The threat to global food security posed by challenges of climate change has stressed the use of functional genomics in current plant breeding approaches. Plant steroid hormones called brassinosteroids (BRs) are at the nexus of regulating plant growth and development, and plant stress responses. Enhanced BR levels or signalling have increased crop yields by up to 40% while also conferring broad range stress tolerance. Currently there is no information on the BR biosynthesis and signalling pathways in safflower. A de novo transcriptomic analysis of untreated and 24-epibrassinolide (EBR)-treated safflower leaves was conducted using the Illumina sequencing platform. Approximately 5 GB clean data were generated from untreated and EBR-treated samples that assembled into 34,456 and 36,997 transcripts (combined 50,630), and 30,180 and 32,333 CoDing sequences (CDS) (combined 43,637), respectively. More than 71% of the CDS were annotated with majority of hits against Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus, a thistle in the safflower family. A total of 74 KEGG pathways were identified in safflower. Six genes, including DWF4 that codes for a rate-limiting enzyme in BR biosynthesis, were mapped to the BR biosynthesis pathway using the KEGG mapper.  aPublisher supplied data  aSB/FT/LS-412/2012cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aCynara cardunculus subsp. cardunculus 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aenzymes 3afood security 3agenomics 3agrowth and development 3aoils 3aplant growth 3aplant stress 3astress tolerance 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aSahni, Sangita1 aKrishna, Priti1 aKumari, Diksha1 aMahato, Ajay Kumar1 aJambhulkar, Sanjay J.1 aKumar, Pankaj1 aRanjan, Tushar1 aPal, Awadhesh Kumar0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2022 June, v. 41, no. 4 p.1854-1870dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10429-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245010300207500001900310520160600329592002801935650001001963650002801973650002302001650001902024650001202043650001802055650001002073650001402083650001502097650002002112650001102132653001902143653002502162700002102187700002402208700001802232700001802250700002002268773009302288856008202381852000902463655001202472IND60713947020221123023642.0210201e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071394702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1110282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishioka, Shinta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6726-860510aValidity of calf circumference for estimating skeletal muscle mass for Asian patients after stroke  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aims of this study was to determine the optimal cutoff values of non-paretic calf circumference (CC) that are indicative of low skeletal muscle mass and examine the association between a low CC and rehabilitation outcomes.This was a retrospective cohort study that included 628 patients in convalescent rehabilitation wards in Japan. Patients in post-stroke rehabilitation who were ≥20 y of age were included. We examined the agreement between CC on the non-paretic side and a low skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. We also confirmed the correlation between sarcopenia defined by CC and handgrip strength, and sarcopenia according to Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 criteria. Functional Independent Measure (FIM) at discharge and discharge to home outcomes were compared between patients with a high CC and those with a low CC.Of the 628 patients included in the study, 408 (170 women; mean age, 72 y) were analyzed. The optimal cutoff values of CC were 33 cm for men (sensitivity and specificity, 0.798 and 0.840, respectively) and 32 cm for women (0.847 and 0.818, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of CC-based sarcopenia against the AWGS criteria were 0.752 and 1.000 for men and 0.800 and 1.000 for women, respectively. Patients with a low CC had a significantly lower FIM and proportion of home discharge than those with a high CC.The optimal cutoff values of non-paretic CC for a low SMI were 33 cm for male and 32 cm for female Asian stroke rehabilitation patients. Sarcopenia can be defined using CC instead of SMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3abioelectrical impedance 3acalf circumference 3acohort studies 3afemales 3ahand strength 3amales 3anutrition 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 3astroke 0aRehabilitation 0aSkeletal muscle mass1 aYamanouchi, Anna1 aMatsushita, Tatsuya1 aNishioka, Emi1 aMori, Natsumi1 aTaguchi, Shiori0 tNutrition.g2021 Feb., v. 82 p.111028-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1110283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009200168300001600260520111000276592002801386650002001414650001401434650001701448650001101465650003101476650001101507650001501518650002501533653003001558653002001588653001901608653003201627700005701659700001901716773009701735856008701832852000901919655001201928IND60566051420221120045750.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056605142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yujie10aOn-line remaining energy prediction: A case study in embedded battery management system  ap. 688-695.  aModern electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) require a reliable battery management system (BMS). The remaining energy and the state-of-energy (SoE) are very important indexes for the embedded BMS used in both EV and HEV applications. As a case study in the embedded BMS, this paper presents the implementation of remaining energy prediction based on the μC/OS-II real time operating system (RTOS). In considering that there are accumulated errors caused by inevitable drift noise of the current or voltage sensors, a model based SoE estimator is developed based on a first-order RC equivalent circuit model. Moreover, the Bayesian learning technique is used for SoE estimation to get accurate and robustness estimation results. Lastly, two different kinds of batteries are carried out under laboratory experiments and real road test to verify the robustness of the proposed SoE estimation approach. The results indicate that the maximum absolute estimation error (MAEE) and the root-mean square error (RMSE) are within 2% and 1% for both LiFePO4 and Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abatteries 3acase studies 3aenergy 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3aprediction 3avehicles (equipment) 0aBattery management system 0aEmbedded system 0aμC/OS-II RTOS 0aRemaining energy prediction1 aChen, Zonghai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9312-90891 aZhang, Chenbin0 tApplied energy.g2017 May 15, v. 194 p.688-695dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245004300202300002000245500001900265520114300284592002801427650002201455650002101477650001701498650001401515653001201529653000901541653001301550653000801563653001401571653001501585653001601600653002001616700001901636700001701655700005801672700001501730700005801745700006001803700002701863700006501890700005501955700002202010700002302032700005402055700001402109700001802123700005602141700001702197700002102214700001902235700001302254700002302267700002202290700005902312700001802371773010002389856008302489852000902572655001202581IND60724166920221120105309.0210212e20210121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072416692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3327-417712aA basophil-neuronal axis promotes itch  ap. 422-440.e17.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aItch is an evolutionarily conserved sensation that facilitates expulsion of pathogens and noxious stimuli from the skin. However, in organ failure, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD), itch becomes chronic, intractable, and debilitating. In addition to chronic itch, patients often experience intense acute itch exacerbations. Recent discoveries have unearthed the neuroimmune circuitry of itch, leading to the development of anti-itch treatments. However, mechanisms underlying acute itch exacerbations remain overlooked. Herein, we identify that a large proportion of patients with AD harbor allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and exhibit a propensity for acute itch flares. In mice, while allergen-provoked acute itch is mediated by the mast cell-histamine axis in steady state, AD-associated inflammation renders this pathway dispensable. Instead, a previously unrecognized basophil-leukotriene (LT) axis emerges as critical for acute itch flares. By probing fundamental itch mechanisms, our study highlights a basophil-neuronal circuit that may underlie a variety of neuroimmune processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatopic dermatitis 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainflammation 3asensation 0aallergy 0aitch 0apruritus 0aIgE 0abasophils 0amast cells 0aleukotriene 0asensory neurons1 aTrier, Anna M.1 aLi, Fengxian1 aKim, Seonyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8854-287X1 aChen, Zhen1 aChai, Jiani N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2560-82181 aMack, Madison R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2812-03491 aMorrison, Stephanie A.1 aHamilton, Jennifer D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1236-52451 aBaek, Jinok1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7634-13601 aYang, Ting-Lin B.1 aVer Heul, Aaron M.1 aXu, Amy Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8294-38861 aXie, Zili1 aDong, Xintong1 aKubo, Masato1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7867-30861 aHu, Hongzhen1 aHsieh, Chyi-Song1 aDong, Xinzhong1 aLiu, Qin1 aMargolis, David J.1 aArdeleanu, Marius1 aMiller, Mark J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5676-389X1 aKim, Brian S.0 tCell.g2021 Jan. 21, v. 184, no. 2 p.422-440.e17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013300155300001800288500002000306520185000326592002802176650001202204650001302216650001902229650002102248650002502269650002202294650001302316650003002329650001302359650002302372650002002395650001802415650002502433650001602458650001402474650001102488651002202499700002202521700002202543700002002565700002502585700002502610700002602635700002302661700001802684700002002702700002002722773010202742856007302844852000902917655001202926IND60572216020221120213738.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221602DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.139132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazzi, Gaia10aClock gene polymorphism, migratory behaviour and geographic distribution: a comparative study of trans‐Saharan migratory birds  ap. 6077-6091.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMigratory behaviour is controlled by endogenous circannual rhythms that are synchronized by external cues, such as photoperiod. Investigations on the genetic basis of circannual rhythmicity in vertebrates have highlighted that variation at candidate ‘circadian clock’ genes may play a major role in regulating photoperiodic responses and timing of life cycle events, such as reproduction and migration. In this comparative study of 23 trans‐Saharan migratory bird species, we investigated the relationships between species‐level genetic variation at two candidate genes, Clock and Adcyap1, and species’ traits related to migration and geographic distribution, including timing of spring migration across the Mediterranean Sea, migration distance and breeding latitude. Consistently with previous evidence showing latitudinal clines in ‘circadian clock’ genotype frequencies, Clock allele size increased with breeding latitude across species. However, early‐ and late‐migrating species had similar Clock allele size. Species migrating over longer distances, showing delayed spring migration and smaller phenotypic variance in spring migration timing, had significantly reduced Clock (but not Adcyap1) gene diversity. Phylogenetic confirmatory path analysis suggested that migration date and distance were the most important variables directly affecting Clock gene diversity. Hence, our study supports the hypothesis that Clock allele size increases poleward as a consequence of adaptation to the photoperiodic regime of the breeding areas. Moreover, we show that long‐distance migration is associated with lower Clock diversity, coherently with strong stabilizing selection acting on timing of life cycle events in long‐distance migratory species, likely resulting from the time constraints imposed by late spring migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3acircadian rhythm 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ageographical distribution 3alatitude 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory birds 3apath analysis 3aphenotypic variation 3aphotoperiod 3aphylogeny 3aspring 3aMediterranean Sea1 aCecere, Jacopo G.1 aCaprioli, Manuela1 aGatti, Emanuele1 aGianfranceschi, Luca1 aPodofillini, Stefano1 aPossenti, Cristina D.1 aAmbrosini, Roberto1 aSaino, Nicola1 aSpina, Fernando1 aRubolini, Diego0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 24 p.6077-6091dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.139133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007500154300002000229520066700249592002800916650001100944650002300955650002100978650001300999650001201012650002601024650001301050650001701063650001101080650001301091650001301104650001201117700001501129700002601144700001301170773012401183856007401307852000901381655001201390IND60664584720221122234932.0190912e20130812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458472DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42773k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aSBR–PVDF based binder for the application of SLMP in graphite anodes  ap. 15022-15027.  aA styrene butadiene rubber (SBR)–polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) based binder system has been developed for an electrochemical system that is not compatible with the conventional N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent used to cast most Li-ion electrode slurries.

Subsequently, the as-prepared SNFs were modified with (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTS) for applications in neural tissue engineering. The structure and properties of the as-prepared SNFs and the modified SNFs (SNF–APxM, x = 1–3) were evaluated with FTIR, TGA, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, and SEM. It was found that the surface hydrophilicity of SNF–APxM was lowered upon increasing the amino alkyl group content. The SEM and confocal images revealed that neural stem cells (NSCs) cultured on the electrospun SNFs and SNF–APxM substrates were elongated along the fibers in comparison to poly-d-lysine-coated (PDL-coated) substrate. In addition, a higher degree of proliferation and more responsive cells were observed for the NSCs cultured on the SNF–AP3M substrate than those on the SNFs and the PDL-coated substrates. The results indicated that the APTS-modified silica nanofibers can be potential substrates for regulating growth and differentiation of NSCs in culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aconfocal microscopy 3adesorption 3ahydrophilicity 3amoieties 3ananofibers 3aneural stem cells 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3athermogravimetry 3atissue engineering1 aHsieh, Pei Hsin1 aYang, Wei Ning1 aFan-Jen, Po Zen1 aYang, Mong-Lin1 aYeh, Jui Ming1 aWei, Yan,1 aChin, Ting Yu1 aChen-Yang, Yui Whei0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Feb. 5, v. 2, no. 9 p.1205-1215dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21336f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012500163500001900288520217700307592002802484650001602512650002402528650002402552650001502576650002802591650003102619650001802650650001702668650001402685650001502699650001702714650001502731650002002746653001102766653002502777653001502802700001502817700001202832700001602844700001702860700001802877700001702895700001102912700005502923773009302978856008203071852000903153655001203162IND60713947220221123023635.0210201e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071394722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1110322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Xiaofen12aA new index based on serum creatinine and cystatin C is useful for assessing sarcopenia in patients with advanced cancer  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSarcopenia is a well-known risk factor for inferior cancer outcomes, but the identification of patients at risk remains challenging. A new sarcopenia index (SI), defined as serum creatinine (Cr) × cystatin C (CysC)-based glomerular filtration rate (eGFRCyₛC), has been reported to be an objective surrogate marker for sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to assess whether the SI is associated with sarcopenia and cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with advanced cancer.This cross-sectional study included 182 patients with different types of cancer (cancer stages III/IV; mean age 55.1 ± 11.1 y). Sarcopenia was defined as the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle strength. The cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle mass (SMA) at the third lumbar spine was estimated by computed tomography (CT). Low muscle mass was defined as a skeletal muscle index (SMA/height²) <34.9 cm²/m² for women and 40.8 cm²/m² for men. Low muscle strength was determined by handgrip strength (HGS) according to the cutoffs of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (<18 kg for women and <26 kg for men). CRF was measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The associations between SI with both sarcopenia and CRF were investigated.The prevalence of sarcopenia was 27.5%. The SI was significantly lower in both the sarcopenia and severe fatigue groups. The associations between SI and SMA (r = 0.365; P < 0.001), skeletal muscle index (SMI) (r = 0.340; P < 0.001), and HGS (r = 0.414; P <0 .001) were stronger than the associations between the serum creatinine/cystatin C (Cr/CysC) ratio and SMA (r = 0.299; P < 0.001), SMI (r = 0.269; P <0 .001), and HGS (r = 0.364; P <0 .001). Additionally, a decrease in the SI was associated with a higher likelihood of sarcopenia (odds ratio per 10-unit, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.16) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. However, there was only a weak correlation between the SI and BFI score (r = –0.161, P = 0.045).The SI might be a useful objective tool for assessing sarcopenia in patients with advanced cancer. Further studies are warranted to extend the present findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acomputed tomography 3aconfidence interval 3acreatinine 3across-sectional studies 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahand strength 3alumbar spine 3anutrition 3aodds ratio 3arisk factors 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 0aCancer 0aSkeletal muscle mass 0aCystatin C1 aTian, Zhen1 aWen, Su1 aSun, Huihui1 aThapa, Sudip1 aXiong, Huihua1 aLiu, Huiquan1 aLi, Lu1 aYu, Shiying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3507-34640 tNutrition.g2021 Feb., v. 82 p.111032-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1110323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245006000202500002000262520116200282592002801444650001701472650003001489650002301519650002401542650002501566650002201591650001501613650001901628650001701647700002101664700001701685700005901702700002301761700001801784700001801802700002701820700001901847700002101866773012101887856007402008852000902082655001202091IND60598562520221118153415.0180629e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059856252DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.124352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulze, Katharina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2070-504613aAn assessment of threats to terrestrial protected areas  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProtected areas (PAs) represent a cornerstone of efforts to safeguard biodiversity, and if effective should reduce threats to biodiversity. We present the most comprehensive assessment of threats to terrestrial PAs, based on in situ data from 1,961 PAs across 149 countries, assessed by PA managers and local stakeholders. Unsustainable hunting was the most commonly reported threat and occurred in 61% of all PAs, followed by disturbance from recreational activities occurring in 55%, and natural system modifications from fire or its suppression in 49%. The number of reported threats was lower in PAs with greater remoteness, higher control of corruption, and lower human development scores. The main reported threats in developing countries were linked to overexploitation for resource extraction, while negative impacts from recreational activities dominated in developed countries. Our results show that many of the most serious threats to PAs are difficult to monitor with remote sensing, and highlight the importance of in situ threat data to inform the implementation of more effective biodiversity conservation in the global protected area estate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aconservation areas 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3ahuman development 3arecreation 3aremote sensing 3astakeholders1 aKnights, Kathryn1 aCoad, Lauren1 aGeldmann, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1191-76101 aLeverington, Fiona1 aEassom, April1 aMarr, Melitta1 aButchart, Stuart H.

However, high water permeability as well as high rejection against contaminants is still demanded yet challenging for graphene-based membranes fabrication. In this work, we synthesized an oxygen-containing group-modified reduced graphene oxide membrane (O-rGOM), which was designed by substituting the surface layers of rGO membranes with GO flakes. The number of oxygen-containing groups on membrane surface was modulated by the [GO]/[rGO] ratio during the construction of O-rGOM. Results demonstrated that a [GO]/[rGO] ratio of 1:4 was optimal, with oxygen-containing groups modifying the pore surface of rGO laminates effectively. Furthermore, the O-rGOM showed improved hydrophilicity and water permeability. In addition, modification of the oxygen-containing groups promoted the zeta potential around the membrane pore, resulting in enhanced electrostatic interaction between the membrane and charged contaminants. The O-rGOM structure exhibited 18.2% and 5.2% improvement in acid orange 7 and methylene blue rejection, respectively, as well as ∼2.6 times enhancement in water permeability compared with the rGOM. This work provides a feasible approach for the design of graphene-based membranes to improve filtration performance with enhanced water permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afiltration 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3amethylene blue 3apermeability 3azeta potential1 aHu, Chengzhi1 aLiu, Zhongtao1 aLiu, Huijuan1 aQu, Jiuhui0 tCarbon.g2019 Apr., v. 145 p.140-148dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011200159300001600271520158200287592002801869650001901897650001801916650002301934650001801957650001201975650001301987650002002000650001002020650001202030650001502042650001402057650001402071650001402085650001002099650001402109650001502123650001702138651001502155653001102170653001402181653003102195653001802226700001802244700002002262700001602282700003902298773014402337856007402481961001302555852000902568655001202577IND60679854620221120080856.0200102e20170321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067985462DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tox0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, Adrian14aThe Synergistic Effects of Almond Protection Fungicides on Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Forager Survival  ap. 802-808.  aThe honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) contributes ∼$17 billion annually to the United States economy, primarily by pollinating major agricultural crops including almond, which is completely dependent on honey bee pollination for nut set. Almond growers face constant challenges to crop productivity owing to pests and pathogens, which are often controlled with a multitude of agrochemicals. For example, fungicides are often applied in combination with other products to control fungal pathogens during almond bloom. However, the effects of fungicides on honey bee health have been so far understudied. To assess the effects of some of the top fungicides used during the 2012 California almond bloom on honey bee forager mortality, we collected foragers from a local apiary and exposed them to fungicides (alone and in various combinations) at the label dose, or at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2 times the label dose rate. These fungicides were Iprodione 2SE Select, Pristine, and Quadris. We utilized a wind tunnel and atomizer set up with a wind speed of 2.9 m/s to simulate field-relevant exposure of honey bees to these agrochemicals during aerial application in almond fields. Groups of 40–50 foragers exposed to either untreated controls or fungicide-laden treatments were monitored daily over a 10-d period. Our results showed a significant decrease in forager survival resulting from exposure to simulated tank mixes of Iprodione 2SE Select, as well as synergistic detrimental effects of Iprodione 2SE Select in combination with Pristine and Quadris on forager survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aPrunus dulcis 3aaerial application 3aagrochemicals 3aalmonds 3aapiaries 3abee pollination 3afungi 3agrowers 3ahoney bees 3aiprodione 3amortality 3apathogens 3apests 3asynergism 3awind speed 3awind tunnels 3aCalifornia 0aAlmond 0afungicide 0ahoney bee forager survival 0aIprodione 2SE1 aColeman, Chet1 aHoffmann, Clint1 aFritz, Brad1 aRangel de Alvarenga Paes, Juliana,0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2017 Mar. 21, v. 110, no. 3 p.802-808dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tox0313Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245007900166300001600245520135600261592002801617650000801645650002101653650001501674650002401689650000901713650001801722650001101740650001601751653003501767653001401802653002701816700001301843700001901856700001801875773009701893856008701990852000902077655001202086IND60566051720221120045912.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056605172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Yimo10aStudy on an internally-cooled liquid desiccant dehumidifier with CFD model  ap. 399-409.  aThe liquid desiccant air conditioning system is considered as a possible substitute of the traditional air conditioner mainly due to its characteristics of energy saving. The dehumidifier is a key component of the system therefore was chosen as the research object. It was found the present models conducted the simulation with lots of assumptions, especially ignoring the effect of flow behavior. Besides, most studies focused on the inlet and outlet parameter changes rather than the interior condition of the dehumidifier. To fill the research gap, a model for an adiabatic dehumidifier was established with CFD technology in authors’ previous study. On the basis of it, a model was further developed in present work for internally-cooled liquid desiccant dehumidifier. The interior heat and mass transfer processes were then simulated with the model, followed by the detailed performance investigation. Analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of some factors, including inlet desiccant temperature, desiccant flow rate and two types of internally cooling, and variable physical properties. The advantage of present study lied in its more in-depth analysis of interior condition of the dehumidifier. Besides, the study also demonstrated the necessity of considering the variable properties of desiccant solution during the simulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3adesiccants 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amodels 3atemperature 0aInternally-cooled dehumidifier 0aCFD model 0aHeat and mass transfer1 aChen, Yi1 aYang, Hongxing1 aWang, Yuanhao0 tApplied energy.g2017 May 15, v. 194 p.399-409dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245016400208300001400372520110000386592002801486650002501514650002701539650002801566650003001594650002201624650002601646650001601672650002601688650002001714650001801734650001001752650002501762650001801787700002201805700002401827700002101851700002001872700002201892700002401914700006101938700002001999700002202019773010802041856008602149852000902235655001202244IND60612096420221117164516.0190705e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061209642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoton, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0148-680210aBiogenic amine and antibiotic resistance profiles determined for lactic acid bacteria and a propionibacterium prior to use as antifungal bioprotective cultures  ap. 21-26.  aLactic acid bacteria (LAB) and propionibacteria are two microbial groups studied as alternatives to chemical preservatives in foods. As potential bioprotective cultures in the food industry, not only does antimicrobial efficiency need to be ensured, but safety criteria should be evaluated. Here, 21 LAB and 1 propionibacterium with previously determined antifungal properties were screened for two relevant criteria: biogenic amine production and antibiotic resistance patterns. Low risk profiles were observed for 15 strains, highlighting their potential industrial use as bioprotective cultures. Some exceptions were identified: both Lactobacillus buchneri strains tested were histamine-producers, while 1 Lactobacillus brevis, 2 Lactobacillus rhamnosus and 1 Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains were tyramine-producers. These same strains were resistant to up to 5 antibiotics, thus excluding them as candidates for industrial use. These results confirm the importance of ensuring safety criteria are met before considering a candidate strain for use as a bioprotective agent in food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aLactobacillus buchneri 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3aPropionibacterium 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantifungal properties 3abiogenic amines 3afood industry 3afoods 3alactic acid bacteria 3apreservatives1 aLebreton, Mégane1 aLeyva Salas, Marcia1 aGarnier, Lucille1 aNavarri, Marion1 aPawtowski, Audrey1 aLe Blay, Gwenaëlle1 aValence, Florence1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4834-086X1 aCoton, Emmanuel1 aMounier, Jérôme0 tInternational dairy journal.g2018 Oct., v. 85 p.21-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013500170300001600305520139700321592002801718650001401746650000901760650001301769650002801782650001301810650001701823650001701840650002101857650001501878650001201893650001601905650001801921650001101939650000901950650001901959650001301978650001801991650001802009700001802027700001702045700001702062700001502079700001702094700001702111700001802128700001902146773008702165856008502252852000902337655001202346IND60628088420221120195706.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Changhoon10aHigh performance wire-type supercapacitor with Ppy/CNT-ionic liquid/AuNP/carbon fiber electrode and ionic liquid based electrolyte  ap. 639-648.  aWe report a fabrication of a high-performance wire-type supercapacitor through surface modification of carbon fiber with ionic liquid, nanomaterials, and gel electrolyte containing ionic liquid. Coating of Au nanoparticles onto carbon fiber increases both surface area and electrical conductivity. Dip-coating of mixture of ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][TFSI]), carbon nanotubes, and electropolymerization of polypyrrole (Ppy) onto Au coated fiber for pseudocapacitance results in high capacitance. The use of propylene carbonate-poly(methyl methacrylate)-[EMIM][TFSI] gel electrolyte gives high operation voltage. Such wire-type supercapacitor exhibits a high voltage of 2.5 V, an areal capacitance of 38.49 mF cm⁻², and a maximum energy and power density of 24.7 μWh cm⁻² and 3.52 mW cm⁻², respectively. In addition, the cyclic stability of the supercapacitor is dramatically enhanced by using 2-naphthalene sulfonic acid as a dopant in electropolymerization of Ppy. Encapsulation with a thermally shrinkable tube endows the supercapacitor with mechanical stability and waterproof features when it is bent, folded, twisted, even in water. This work demonstrates high potential of such wire-type supercapacitor as a flexible energy-storage device for various applications, especially those that require high voltage.  aPublisher supplied data 3apropylene 3agold 3ananogold 3aelectrical conductivity 3acoatings 3aelectrolytes 3asurface area 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrodes 3aliquids 3acapacitance 3aencapsulation 3acarbon 3agels 3asulfonic acids 3apyrroles 3acarbon fibers 3aionic liquids1 aYun, Junyeong1 aKeum, Kayeon1 aJeong, Yu Ra1 aPark, Heun1 aLee, Hanchan1 aLee, Geumbee1 aOh, Seung Yun1 aHa, Jeong Sook0 tCarbon.g2019 Apr., v. 144 p.639-648dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245021500168300001600383520118700399592002801586650001301614650000901627650002301636650001801659650000901677650001801686650002201704650001401726650001101740650001001751650000901761650002001770650001701790650001001807653001601817653002701833653001001860653001701870653001401887700002201901700003901923773014001962856007902102852000902181655001202190IND60779533720221118054135.0220609e20210913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077953372DNAL7 a10.1139/CJAS-2021-00602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChassé, Élisabeth10aEffect of pelleting on nutrients and energy digestibility in growing pigs fed corn-soybean meal-based diet or diet containing corn distillers dried grains with solubles (cDDGS), wheat middlings, and bakery meal  ap. 108-116.  aThis study was conducted to determine the effect of pelleting and diet type on the apparent ileal (AID) and total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and energy in growing pigs. Six pigs were cannulated at the ileum and were assigned to treatments following a crossover design. One diet was a control diet based on corn and soybean meal (CT). Part of it was replaced by corn distillers dried grains with solubles (cDDGS), wheat middlings, and bakery meal in the second diet (ByP). Diets were in mash (CT-MH and ByP-MH) or pelleted (CT-PT and ByP-PT) form. Results showed that pelleting increased digestibility in all diets with a distinct effect on the CT diet (interaction diet × pelleting, P < 0.05). Pelleting improved the AID of dry matter, crude protein, and energy by 17%, 27%, and 17% in the CT diet and by 10%, 9%, and 17% in the ByP diet (P < 0.01).

Driven by a growing population and economy, the energy sector will continue to expand, increasing more pressure on the fresh water demand of countries. This paper analyzes the energy–water nexus embodied in international energy trade via a combination of input–output analysis (IOA) and ecological network analysis (ENA). The energy–water element nexus is depicted based on a mixed-unit IOA to investigate the parallel relationship between energy and water. ENA is used to uncover energy–water pathways intertwined in global energy trade and identify the pair-wise relationship between countries according to the energy–water pathway nexus. Then, a case study of the international energy–water nexus of China is conducted. The results of energy–water nexus element analysis show that water use per unit of energy products in the country is much greater than those of other countries. Moreover, indirect water use during energy production deserves more attention, which is often neglected in water resource management. The results of energy–water nexus pathway analysis demonstrate that international energy trade has a positive effect on China’s water condition, mitigating serious water shortage problems but increasing dependency on other countries and regions. Mutual relationships among trading countries are described using utility and control analyses. The results show that system integrality is arguably more critical in determining system behavior than direct effects alone. Europe changes from a beneficiary in direct mutual relationships to a contributor in integral utility mutual relationships, whereas Australia has an opposite change. Although China has a dominant position in direct relationships, it becomes an equal competitor with the USA in utility mutual relationships. China depends heavily on most countries, especially those in South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia. The network mutualism index (=0.56) and synergism index (=9.187) indicate that the current global energy trade network has negative relationships within a competitive environment. Finally, policy and economic suggestions are put forward to alleviate the potential impacts of international energy trade on water scarcity in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3aissues and policy 3atrade 3atrophic relationships 3awater management 3awater shortages 3aAustralia 3aCentral America 3aChina 3aEurope 3aMiddle East 3aUnited States 0aEnergy trade 0aEcological network analysis 0aElement nexus 0aPathway nexus1 aChen, Bin0 tApplied energy.g2017 May 15, v. 194 p.725-734dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01462naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007400157300002000231520039500251592002800646650001100674650001700685650002000702650001500722700001500737700001700752700001400769700001600783700001700799700001300816700002000829700001700849700001500866773012400881856007401005852000901079655001201088IND60664585020221122234833.0190912e20130909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458502DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42778a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zengze12aA self-powered strain senor based on a ZnO/PEDOT:PSS hybrid structure  ap. 17011-17015.  aWe report a self-powered strain sensor based on ZnO/PEDOT:PSS hybrid structure on a flexible polystyrene substrate.

The aim was to determine genetic diversity and divergence within and between populations. The within population heterozygosity values (H = 0.5–3.0 %) were generally higher than the value of 0.7 % previously estimated for this species from a single population. The mean Fₛₜ value of 0.69 indicated marked structuring among the populations studied. Genetic distances (Nei 1972) between populations ranged from 0–0.09 and the clustering of populations closely reflected their geographical distribution and linkage to specific river systems. One locus of malate dehydrogenase, E.C.1.1.1.37 (MDH-2), provided a fixed allelic difference between populations from two river systems (the Limpopo and Olifants river systems). We discuss patterns of geographical genetic diversity in N. intermedialis, with reference to the constraints of habitat and host specificity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallozymes 3aelectrophoresis 3agenetic distance 3agenetic heterogeneity 3ahabitats 3aheterozygosity 3ahost specificity 3aloci 3amalate dehydrogenase 3arivers 3azoogeography 3aSouth Africa 0aPlatyhelminthes 0aparasite 0aallozyme electrophoresis 0ageographical genetic variability1 aMokgalong, N.M.0 tAfrican zoology.g2002 Apr. 1, v. 37, no. 1 p.55-60dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2002.116571553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012800164300001800292500002000310520186200330592002802192650002702220650001602247650002102263650001202284650001802296650001402314650001102328650001602339650001402355651001402369651002302383700002202406700002102428700002402449700001802473700001902491700002402510700002202534700002202556700002702578700002302605773010202628856007302730852000902803655001202812IND60572216420221120234849.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057221642DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.139082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliamson, David H.10aLarge‐scale, multidirectional larval connectivity among coral reef fish populations in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park  ap. 6039-6054.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLarval dispersal is the key process by which populations of most marine fishes and invertebrates are connected and replenished. Advances in larval tagging and genetics have enhanced our capacity to track larval dispersal, assess scales of population connectivity, and quantify larval exchange among no‐take marine reserves and fished areas. Recent studies have found that reserves can be a significant source of recruits for populations up to 40 km away, but the scale and direction of larval connectivity across larger seascapes remain unknown. Here, we apply genetic parentage analysis to investigate larval dispersal patterns for two exploited coral reef groupers (Plectropomus maculatus and Plectropomus leopardus) within and among three clusters of reefs separated by 60–220 km within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. A total of 69 juvenile P. maculatus and 17 juvenile P. leopardus (representing 6% and 9% of the total juveniles sampled, respectively) were genetically assigned to parent individuals on reefs within the study area. We identified both short‐distance larval dispersal within regions (200 m to 50 km) and long‐distance, multidirectional dispersal of up to ~250 km among regions. Dispersal strength declined significantly with distance, with best‐fit dispersal kernels estimating median dispersal distances of ~110 km for P. maculatus and ~190 km for P. leopardus. Larval exchange among reefs demonstrates that established reserves form a highly connected network and contribute larvae for the replenishment of fished reefs at multiple spatial scales. Our findings highlight the potential for long‐distance dispersal in an important group of reef fishes, and provide further evidence that effectively protected reserves can yield recruitment and sustainability benefits for exploited fish populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlectropomus leopardus 3acoral reefs 3afish communities 3agrouper 3ainvertebrates 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amarine fish 3aparentage 3aAustralia 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aHarrison, Hugo B.1 aAlmany, Glenn R.1 aBerumen, Michael L.1 aBode, Michael1 aBonin, Mary C.1 aChoukroun, Severine1 aDoherty, Peter J.1 aFrisch, Ashley J.1 aSaenz‐Agudelo, Pablo1 aJones, Geoffrey P.0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 24 p.6039-6054dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.139083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245010700179300001600286520114400302592002801446650001501474650001101489650001601500650001601516650001301532650002501545651001201570653003001582653002001612653001901632653001501651653003801666653002001704700001501724700001801739700001801757773009801775856008701873852000901960655001201969IND60581124320221120040918.0180830e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058112432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Villalobos, J.10aMulti-objective optimization control of plug-in electric vehicles in low voltage distribution networks  ap. 155-168.  aThe massive introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into low voltage (LV) distribution networks will lead to several problems, such as: increase of energy losses, decrease of distribution transformer lifetime, lines and transformer overload issues, voltage drops and unbalances. In this context, this paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization algorithm in order to reduce the mentioned problems. At the same time, users’ interests in terms of charging cost and privacy have been taken into account. The proposed multi-objective optimization is based on minimizing the load variance and charging costs by using the weighted sum method and fuzzy control. The use of vehicle to grid (V2G) concept and load forecast uncertainties have been also considered. Furthermore, an innovative method for mitigating voltage unbalances has been developed. The effectiveness of this methodology has been tested using real data of a LV distribution network, located in Borup (Denmark). Simulation results show that this approach can reduce both energy losses and charging costs as well as it allows a high PEV penetration rates (PEV-PR).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3amethodology 3auncertainty 3avariance 3avehicles (equipment) 3aDenmark 0aPlug-in electric vehicles 0aOptimal control 0aSmart charging 0aSmart grid 0aLow voltage distribution networks 0aVehicle to grid1 aZamora, I.1 aKnezović, K.1 aMarinelli, M.0 tApplied energy.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 180 p.155-168dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245012300204300001600327500002000343520094000363592002801303650002301331650001401354650002501368650002101393650002401414650001101438650001601449650002801465650001301493650001401506650001401520650001401534700001601548700001401564700001401578700002001592773013001612856007901742852000901821655001201830IND60598562820221118153510.0180629e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059856282DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.126382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Jianqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4683-693310aOxysterol‐binding protein‐related protein 2 is not essential for Phytophthora sojae based on CRISPR/Cas9 deletions  ap. 293-298.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOxysterol‐binding protein (OSBP)‐related proteins (ORPs) are a large conserved family of lipid transfer proteins in eukaryotes. In oomycetes, some ORPs are the target of the novel oomycide oxathiapiprolin. By searching the Phytophthora sojae genome database, two ORP proteins, PsORP1 (Protein ID: 558498) and PsORP2 (Protein ID: 470921), were found. Here, we investigated the biological function of PsORP2. The expression level of PsORP2 was higher in germinated cysts and late infection than in other developmental stages. However, deletion of PsORP2 using CRISPR/Cas9 had no significant effect on sporangia production, zoospore production, cyst germination, oospore production, virulence or oxathiapiprolin sensitivity. PsORP1 also was not upregulated in ΔPsORP2 transformants. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that PsORP2 is not an essential protein for development or virulence in P. sojae under the conditions we tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora sojae 3adatabases 3adevelopmental stages 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenetic engineering 3agenome 3agermination 3alipid transfer proteins 3aoospores 3asporangia 3avirulence 3azoospores1 aLi, Xiuhuan1 aLin, Dong1 aLiu, Xili1 aTyler, Brett M.0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2018 June, v. 10, no. 3 p.293-298dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.126383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013200157300002000289520123500309592002801544650001101572650002101583650002101604650001101625650001701636650001901653650002201672650001401694700001801708700001501726700001801741700001701759700001701776700001801793700001801811700001601829773012401845856007401969852000902043655001202052IND60664585120221122234834.0190912e20130812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066458512DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra42780c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinlong10aFacile assembly of a 3D rGO/MWCNTs/Fe₂O₃ ternary composite as the anode material for high-performance lithium ion batteries  ap. 15457-15466.  aA three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/Fe₂O₃ ternary composite was fabricated by a facile, green and economical one-step urea-assisted hydrothermal approach as a promising anode material for high-performance lithium ion batteries. Designing and tailoring the 3D porous hierarchical nanostructure of rGO/MWCNTs/Fe₂O₃ contributes to a robust hybrid material with overwhelmingly superior electrochemical performances compared with bare Fe₂O₃, MWCNTs/Fe₂O₃, rGO/Fe₂O₃ and a physical mixture of rGO/Fe₂O₃ and MWCNTs, due to the strong synergistic effects among the individual component. The 3D rGO/MWCNTs/Fe₂O₃ composite exhibits highly enhanced specific capacity, cycling performance and rate capability: initial discharge and charge capacities of 1692 and 1322 mAh g⁻¹ at 100 mA g⁻¹, respectively, 1118 mAh g⁻¹ after 50 cycles at 100 mA g⁻¹ and 785 mAh g⁻¹ at 1000 mA g⁻¹. The assembling mechanism well illustrates the simple strategy, and the comprehensive electrochemical investigations further demonstrate its supernormal effectiveness, which could be extended to various transition metal oxides for energy storage and conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aferric oxide 3agraphene oxide 3alithium batteries 3asynergism1 aJiang, Jianbo1 aQian, Dong1 aTan, Gongrong1 aPeng, Sanjun1 aYuan, Huimin1 aLuo, Dongming1 aWang, Qunfeng1 aLiu, Youcai0 tRSC advances.g2013 Aug. 12, v. 3, no. 35 p.15457-15466dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra42780c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245005000172300001600222520082800238592002801066650003701094650001301131650002401144650001901168650003101187650001701218650003901235650002401274650001901298650001301317650003101330650001101361650001401372700005901386700002501445700002201470700003101492700007401523700002601597700002301623700006201646773008701708856008501795852000901880655001201889IND60628088620221120195717.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062808862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilenkovic, Ivana10aFingerprint imaging using N-doped carbon dots  ap. 791-797.  aCarbon Dots (CDs) were obtained using a hydrothermal method and used for the detection of fingerprints through fluorescent imaging.

In this study, the tourism water footprint (TWF) and the tourism energy footprint (TEF) of 138 sectors were investigated to examine the water-energy-food (W-E-F) nexus in the Chinese tourism industry from 2012 to 2017 by developing the water- and energy-based environmentally extended input-output analysis with the tourism satellite account. This study revealed that the W-E-F supply groups consumed total 15,556 million m³ of water and 4,964 million tce of energy to support the Chinese tourism industry. The largest contributor to the total TWF is the indirect water use from the food supply group (65%), while the largest proportion of total TEF is contributed by the direct energy use from 11 tourism direct sectors (63%), most especially the air transport sector. A much larger growth of the tourism industry was observed in 2017 compared to that of 2012. The structure decomposition analysis revealed that the growth of the overall water and energy consumption of China tourism is mainly driven by the growth of the total tourism expenditure, i.e. the scale effect. It is the same case for the food supply group associated with the Chinese tourism industry. In contrast, the contribution of the changes to the tourism expenditure composition is relatively low. Furthermore, the growth in water and energy consumption can be offset effectively by reducing the water and energy use coefficient and adjusting the economic production structure of tourism and its associated food supply group. In sum, the food supply and air transport sectors play a crucial role in the water-energy-food nexus of the tourism industry. Therefore, in the future, focus should be placed on improving the water and energy use efficiency of these sectors as well as enhancing their production structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEragrostis tef 3aair transportation 3acarbon footprint 3adegradation 3aenergy 3afood availability 3ainput output analysis 3arecycling 3asatellites 3asupply 3atourism 3awater 3awater footprint 3aChina 0aChina 0aEnvironmentally extended input-output 0aStructural decomposition analysis 0aTourism 0aWater-energy-food nexus1 aWang, Yuan1 aZuo, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8279-96660 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 Jan., v. 164 p.105157-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1051573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006400145245010500209300001600314500002000330520156500350592002801915650002201943650001501965650001301980650002401993650002902017650002502046650001402071650001502085650001502100650001402115650001502129650001602144700008202160700006702242700006702309700006502376700005402441773013002495856007902625852000902704655001202713IND60598562920221118153459.0180629e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059856292DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.126492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonnenschein, Eva C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6959-510010aPhylogenetic distribution of roseobacticides in the Roseobacter group and their effect on microalgae  ap. 383-393.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Roseobacter‐group species Phaeobacter inhibens produces the antibacterial tropodithietic acid (TDA) and the algaecidal roseobacticides with both compound classes sharing part of the same biosynthetic pathway. The purpose of this study was to investigate the production of roseobacticides more broadly in TDA‐producing roseobacters and to compare the effect of producers and non‐producers on microalgae. Of 33 roseobacters analyzed, roseobacticide production was a unique feature of TDA‐producing P. inhibens, P. gallaeciensis and P. piscinae strains. One TDA‐producing Phaeobacter, 27‐4, did not produce roseobacticides, possibly due to a transposable element. TDA‐producing Ruegeria and Pseudovibrio did not produce roseobacticides. Addition of roseobacticide‐containing bacterial extracts affected the growth of the microalgae Rhodomonas salina, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Emiliania huxleyi, while growth of Tetraselmis suecica was unaffected. During co‐cultivation, growth of E. huxleyi was initially stimulated by the roseobacticide producer DSM 17395, while the subsequent decline in algal cell numbers during senescence was enhanced. Strain 27‐4 that does not produce roseobacticides had no effect on algal growth. Both bacterial strains, DSM 17395 and 27‐4, grew during co‐cultivation presumably utilizing algal exudates. Furthermore, TDA‐producing roseobacters have potential as probiotics in marine larviculture and it is promising that the live feed Tetraselmis was unaffected by roseobacticides‐containing extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmiliania huxleyi 3aRhodomonas 3aRuegeria 3aTetraselmis suecica 3aThalassiosira pseudonana 3abiochemical pathways 3acoculture 3alive feeds 3amicroalgae 3aphylogeny 3aprobiotics 3atransposons1 aPhippen, Christopher Broughton William1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9536-73871 aBentzon‐Tilia, Mikkel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7888-98451 aRasmussen, Silas Anselm1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7633-87431 aNielsen, Kristian Fog1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5848-09111 aGram, Lone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1076-57230 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2018 June, v. 10, no. 3 p.383-393dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.126493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017700159300002000336520195600356592002802312650004402340650002802384650000902412650003702421650001302458650002102471650001902492650001802511650001302529650003302542650001302575650002102588700001502609700002502624773012402649856007402773852000902847655001202856IND60667133620221119212844.0190919e20150126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066713362DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14284e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSani, N.

Cu-BTC nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed in PPSU dope solution prior to the casting process, and their subsequent presence in the PPSU membrane was inferred by a combination of FTIR spectroscopy, TGA, SEM, EDX and AFM analyses. These analyses confirmed the existence of Cu-BTC particles and their distribution pattern in the membrane matrix. Membrane performance in organic solvent nanofiltration was evaluated on the basis of methanol permeance and dye–methanol separation. Results showed that membrane pure methanol flux was significantly improved from 102 L m⁻² h⁻¹ in the pristine PPSU membrane to >135 L m⁻² h⁻¹ in the 3 wt% Cu-BTC incorporated into PPSU membrane when both membranes were tested at 14 bar. Apart from preferential channels created by Cu-BTC, the existence of interfacial voids in MMMs also contributes to the flux improvement owing to the formation of alternative paths for solvent transportation. Results also showed that the membranes incorporated with low loadings of Cu-BTC (ranging between 0.5 and 1.0 wt%) tended to have smaller molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) than that of pristine PPSU and PPSU incorporated with 3 wt% nanoparticles, leading to smaller surface pore size but better separation efficiency. The improvement in membrane flux and dye rejection at low Cu-BTC loadings could be attributed to the good dispersion of the nanoparticles in the membrane matrix coupled with their improved interfacial contact with the membrane. The newly developed membrane also showed a great improvement in terms of resistance to compaction, suggesting Cu-BTC particles are of importance in increasing membrane rigidity and strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3adyes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3ananofiltration 3ananoparticles 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3athermogravimetry1 aLau, W.

In addition, the effects of sex and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on these relationships remain unclear and controversial.This study aimed to explore the associations between prenatal low-level mercury exposure and child neurobehavioral development during the neonatal and toddler periods and to examine the potential confounding or interactive effects of sex and DHA status on these relationships.This longitudinal study included 286 mother-child pairs in Shanghai, China, whose cord blood samples were analyzed for total mercury, DHA, other nutrients and coexposure contaminants possibly due to maternal consumption of seafood. Children's neurobehavioral development was assessed with the Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment (NBNA) three days after birth and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) at 18 months of age.Cord blood mercury concentration, with geometric mean of 2.00 μg/l, was related to poorer NBNA performance but unrelated to BSID-III scores with adjustment for DHA and other covariates. Cord serum DHA was positively associated with motor development assessed by the BSID-III. The interaction was found between mercury and DHA on the NBNA score, and the inverse relation of cord blood mercury with NBNA was significant only among the children with lower DHA levels (<45.54 μg/ml). Additional adjustment for DHA didn't change the associations between cord blood mercury and neurodevelopmental outcomes substantially. The mercury by sex interaction for language of BSID-III was borderline significant.Our research provides initial evidence for the negative effects of prenatal low-level mercury exposure on neonates' neurobehavioral development. Prenatal DHA status may modify the relationship between cord blood mercury level and neonatal neurobehavioral development, but the confounding effects of DHA were not observed. Further studies are warranted before the causality of the observed associations can be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3achildhood 3achildren 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3ageometry 3alongitudinal studies 3amercury 3amotor development 3aneonates 3anutrients 3aseafoods 3aChina 0aLow-level mercury 0aChild neurobehavioral development 0aNeurodevelopment 0aSex 0aDHA1 aWu, Wei1 aLi, Hui1 aCao, Lulu1 aNg, Mee Kam,1 aLiu, Junxia1 aGao, Zhenyan1 aZhou, Cancan1 aLiu, Jianghong1 aYan, Chonghuai0 tEnvironment international.g2019 May, v. 126 p.14-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245027800159300001600437520080300453592002801256650001201284650001201296650001101308650002201319650001101341653002001352653001401372653002301386653002201409700003401431773015001465856007701615852000901692655001201701IND60521725320221120223630.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052172532DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1984-02062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartl, Hans10aSynthese und Strukturuntersuchungen von Iodocupraten(I), III.

In this study, exogenous melatonin significantly alleviated the dwarf phenotype and inhibited the decrease of plant fresh weight induced by excess copper (Cu²⁺). Our results indicated that melatonin alleviated Cu²⁺ toxicity by improving Cu²⁺ sequestration, carbon metabolism and ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavenging, rather than by influencing the Cu²⁺ uptake under excess Cu²⁺ conditions. Transcriptome analysis showed that melatonin broadly altered gene expression under Cu²⁺ stress. Melatonin increased the levels of glutathione and phytochelatin to chelate excess Cu²⁺ and promoted cell wall trapping, thus keeping more Cu²⁺ in the cell wall and vacuole. Melatonin inhibited ROS production and enhanced antioxidant systems at the transcriptional level and enzyme activities, thus building a line of defense in response to excess Cu²⁺. The distribution of nutrient elements was recovered by melatonin which was disturbed by Cu²⁺. In addition, melatonin activated carbon metabolism, especially glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, to generate more ATP, an intermediate for biosynthesis. Taken together, melatonin alleviated Cu²⁺ toxicity in cucumber via multiple mechanisms. These results will help to resolve the toxic effects of Cu²⁺ stress on plant growth and development. These results can be used for new strategies to solve problems associated with Cu²⁺ stress.  aPublisher supplied data  atszy20140808a2018YFD0201203cMinistry of Science and Technology of China  aBLVT-03cTaishan Industrial Leading Talents Project 3aCucumis sativus 3aactivated carbon 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon metabolism 3acell walls 3acopper 3acucumbers 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3aglycolysis 3agrowth and development 3amelatonin 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aphenotype 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3areactive oxygen species 3astress tolerance 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3avacuoles 0aCopper stress 0aCucumber 0aTranscriptome1 aQi, Chuan-Dong1 aLi, Shuangtao1 aWang, Zhirong1 aWang, Xiaoyun1 aWang, Jinfang1 aRen, Shuxin1 aLi, Xingsheng1 aZhang, Na1 aGuo, Yang-Dong0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 60, no. 3 p.562-574dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy2263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245009400200300001700294506007600311520114500387592002801532506003701560650001701597650001801614650001601632650000801648650001601656650001401672650001801686650001401704650001001718650004201728650002901770650001001799650002701809650001701836650002501853650001401878650002401892650001201916653001801928653002001946653002201966653002601988653001702014700001402031700001602045700001702061700002202078700002302100700002302123700001502146700001902161773010002180856007402280852000902354655001202363IND60132647420221207095256.0150511e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013264742DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evv0342doi7 aPMC44197872pmcid7 a258404142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrupovic, Mart10aMultiple Layers of Chimerism in a Single-Stranded DNA Virus Discovered by Deep Sequencing  ap. 993-1001.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aViruses with single-stranded (ss) DNA genomes infect hosts in all three domains of life and include many medically, ecologically, and economically important pathogens. Recently, a new group of ssDNA viruses with chimeric genomes has been discovered through viral metagenomics. These chimeric viruses combine capsid protein genes and replicative protein genes that, respectively, appear to have been inherited from viruses with positive-strand RNA genomes, such as tombusviruses, and ssDNA genomes, such as circoviruses, nanoviruses or geminiviruses. Here, we describe the genome sequence of a new representative of this virus group and reveal an additional layer of chimerism among ssDNA viruses. We show that not only do these viruses encompass genes for capsid proteins and replicative proteins that have distinct evolutionary histories, but also the replicative genes themselves are chimeras of functional domains inherited from viruses of different families. Our results underscore the importance of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of ssDNA viruses and the role of genetic recombination in the emergence of novel virus groups.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCircoviridae 3aGeminiviridae 3aNanoviridae 3aRNA 3aTombusvirus 3achimerism 3acoat proteins 3aevolution 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ahosts 3ainheritance (genetics) 3ametagenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3asingle-stranded DNA 3aviruses 0assDNA viruses 0avirus evolution 0aorigin of viruses 0agenetic recombination 0ametagenomics1 aZhi, Ning1 aLi, Jungang1 aHu, Gangqing1 aKoonin, Eugene V.1 aWong, S.q(Susan),1 aShevchenko, Sofiya1 aZhao, Keji1 aYoung, Neal S.0 tGenome Biology and Evolution.g2015 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.993-1001dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005200152245007500204300001500279520167000294592002801964650002601992650001002018650001102028650001302039650001002052650001502062650002202077650001602099650004302115700001902158700002402177773010602201856008702307852000902394655001202403IND60623045120221117011320.0190131e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062304512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1972-747210aComparing turbulent mixing of atmospheric oxidants across model scales  ap. 88-101.  aVertical mixing processes as simulated by atmospheric models affect the prediction of vertical profiles of reactive trace gases and oxidants and our understanding of atmospheric chemistry throughout the boundary layer. Specifically, the vertical transport of these oxidants is important for understanding where in situ chemistry occurs. Simulations of the vertical transport are influenced by many factors, including the horizontal and vertical grid resolution, planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes, and the use of cumulus parameterization to represent sub-grid scale cloud processes. Here, we compare simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) with the NCAR Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and the NASA P-3B measurements over the Baltimore-Washington region to evaluate the performance of WRF-Chem in simulating vertical mixing of chemical oxidants in the PBL. For two different PBL schemes, WRF-Chem simulates a weaker convective environment and lower PBL height than LES. Comparing WRF simulations, the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL scheme simulates higher and drier PBL than the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) PBL scheme. The stronger vertical mixing in the LES model simulates higher concentrations of chemical oxidants aloft than WRF-Chem, leading to a constant O3 vertical profile up to the top of the LES domain (4.8 km). Weaker vertical mixing in WRF-Chem prohibits upward transport of the key chemical precursors, therefore resulting in low in situ chemical production of O3 and OH aloft in the WRF-Chem simulations with both PBL schemes and reducing the oxidative capacity in the buffer or cloud layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3agases 3amixing 3aoxidants 3aozone 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3atroposphere 3aweather research and forecasting model1 aBarth, Mary C.1 aSteiner, Allison L.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 199 p.88-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01838naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245009500212500002900307520071000336592002801046650001401074650002101088650002001109653005601129653001601185653002001201653002301221653004301244653001401287653001401301773009401315856008201409852000901491655001201500IND60736334720221121181656.0210610e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073633472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1321612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeslongchamps, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8778-201110aBent bond / antiperiplanar hypothesis and antiaromatic, aromatic and nonaromatic molecules  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe stereochemical reactivities of monocyclic unsaturated compounds having 3–5 and 7–8 membered rings and of bicyclic pentalenes and heptalene can be rationalized through the bent bond/antiperiplanar hypothesis (BBAH) orbital model at the molecular level.

Water management has become the most challenging issue of HF, as it demands vast amounts of freshwater and generates high volumes of complex liquid wastes contaminated by diverse potentially toxic elements at variable rates. This critical review focuses on characterizing HF wastewater and establishing strategies to mitigate environmental impacts. High prioritization was given to the constituents with mean concentrations over 10 times greater than the maximum contamination level (MCL) guidelines for drinking water. A number of potentially harmful organic compounds in HF wastewaters were identified via the risk quotient approach to predict the associated toxicity for freshwater organisms in recipient surface waters. Currently, two options for HF wastewater treatment are preferred, i.e., disposal by deep well injection or on-site re-use as a fracturing fluid. Supplementary treatment will be enforced by increasingly rigorous regulations. Partial treatment and reuse remain the preferred method for managing HF wastewater where feasible. Otherwise, advanced technologies such as membrane separation/distillation, forward osmosis, mechanical vapor compression, electrocoagulation, advanced oxidation, and adsorption-biological treatment will be required to satisfy the sustainable requirements for reuse or surface discharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3adistillation 3aelectrocoagulation 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afreshwater 3aguidelines 3ahydraulic fracturing 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3aoils 3aorganic compounds 3aosmosis 3aoxidation 3aprices 3aprioritization 3arisk 3ashale gas 3asurface water 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3avapors 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater management 0aUnconventional energy 0aHydraulic fracturing 0aEnvironmental pollution 0aMetals/metalloids 0aWastewater treatment 0aSustainable remediation1 aWang, Di1 aTsang, Daniel C.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6850-733X1 aWang, Linling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7468-90641 aOk, Yong Sik1 aFeng, Yujie0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Apr., v. 125 p.452-469dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015700167300001800324520210600342592002802448650001202476650001002488650001602498650004302514650002102557650001102578650002302589650001302612650001102625650001302636700002402649700005702673773011302730856008402843852000902927655001202936IND60683812920221122003423.0200211e20200120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068381292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b032482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoyu10aModeling Enantiomeric Separations as an Interfacial Process Using Amylose Tris(3,5-dimethylphenyl carbamate) (ADMPC) Polymers Coated on Amorphous Silica  ap. 1113-1124.  aChiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is commonly performed to isolate the biologically active enantiomer of a drug from the ineffective or even harmful ones. Understanding the molecular-level recognition that underlies this process is necessary for trimming down the very large number of possible combinations of chiral stationary phases, solvent systems, and other experimental HPLC conditions, a particularly important consideration when only small quantities of the racemate are available. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a useful tool to provide this molecular-level understanding and predict experimental separation factors under a given set of conditions. To predict the chiral separation results for drug enantiomers by amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenyl carbamate) (ADMPC) chiral stationary phase, we design a model of multiple ADMPC polymer strands coated on an amorphous silica slab. Using various MD techniques, we successfully coat ADMPCs onto the surface without losing the structural character of the backbone in the presence of the solvent system. Not only is this model more representative of the polymer surface on a solid support that is encountered by the enantiomers, but it also provides more opportunities for chiral molecules interacting with ADMPC, provides the possibility for large drug molecules to interact with two polymer strands at the same instant, and provides better agreement with experiment when we use the overall average quantities as the predictive metric. For a better understanding of why some metrics are better predictors than others, we use charts of the distribution of hydrogen-bonding lifetimes for various donor–acceptor pairs that contribute to the interaction events determining the relative retention times for the enantiomers. We also examine the contribution of ring–ring interactions to the molecular recognition process and ultimately to the differential retention of enantiomers. The results are more consistent than previous models and resolve the problematic case of two drugs, thalidomide and valsartan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3adrugs 3aenantiomers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3asilica 3asolvents1 aJameson, Cynthia J.1 aMurad, Sohail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1486-06800 tLangmuir.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 36, no. 5 p.1113-1124dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b032483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008400156300001600240520100900256592002801265650001501293650000901308650001601317650001001333650001301343650001801356650001501374650002301389650001901412650001901431650003701450650001201487700001701499700001701516700001801533700001701551773011901568856007401687852000901761655001201770IND60667133920221119211525.0190919e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066713392DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14291h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVignesh, K.10aDesigning of YVO₄ supported β-AgI nano-photocatalyst with improved stability  ap. 576-585.  aYttrium ortho vanadate supported β-silver iodide nanoparticles (AgI–YVO₄) were designed by a sono-chemical deposition method. The structural, morphological and optical properties of the as-prepared nanoparticles were investigated in detail. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that AgI nano-sheets were attached to YVO₄ nano-grains. UV-vis-DRS results indicated that the visible light absorption ability of YVO₄ was promoted by AgI modification. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated for the degradation of rhodamine-B (Rh-B) dye under simulated solar light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of YVO₄ was strongly influenced by the concentration of AgI. The photocatalyst of 10% AgI–YVO₄ exhibited the best performance (98%) for the degradation of Rh-B. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity was well maintained even after four cycles. The results of this research work would be very useful for the degradation of harmful organic dyes in aqueous environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adyes 3airradiation 3alight 3alighting 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3aoptical properties 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atransmission electron microscopy 3ayttrium1 aSuganthi, A.1 aMin, Bong-Ki1 aRajarajan, M.1 aKang, Misook0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 5, no. 1 p.576-585dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra14291h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245005400205300001600259500001500275506007600290520185200366592002802218506003702246650002002283650001102303650001402314650001502328650001402343650002202357650002502379650002102404650001602425650001002441650001702451650001702468650001302485653001102498653002802509653003402537653001302571653002502584700001702609700002202626773009902648856007402747852000902821655001202830IND60132647620221207095904.0150511e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013264762DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evv0422doi7 aPMC44197892pmcid7 a257408212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Marcos T.10aEvolution of the Metazoan Mitochondrial Replicase  ap. 943-959.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe large number of complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences available for metazoan species makes it a good system for studying genome diversity, although little is known about the mechanisms that promote and/or are correlated with the evolution of this organellar genome. By investigating the molecular evolutionary history of the catalytic and accessory subunits of the mtDNA polymerase, pol γ, we sought to develop mechanistic insight into its function that might impact genome structure by exploring the relationships between DNA replication and animal mitochondrial genome diversity. We identified three evolutionary patterns among metazoan pol γs. First, a trend toward stabilization of both sequence and structure occurred in vertebrates, with both subunits evolving distinctly from those of other animal groups, and acquiring at least four novel structural elements, the most important of which is the HLH-3β (helix-loop-helix, 3 β-sheets) domain that allows the accessory subunit to homodimerize. Second, both subunits of arthropods and tunicates have become shorter and evolved approximately twice as rapidly as their vertebrate homologs. And third, nematodes have lost the gene for the accessory subunit, which was accompanied by the loss of its interacting domain in the catalytic subunit of pol γ, and they show the highest rate of molecular evolution among all animal taxa. These findings correlate well with the mtDNA genomic features of each group described above, and with their modes of DNA replication, although a substantive amount of biochemical work is needed to draw conclusive links regarding the latter. Describing the parallels between evolution of pol γ and metazoan mtDNA architecture may also help in understanding the processes that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and to human disease-related phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA replication 3ahumans 3aphenotype 3aarthropods 3aevolution 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3aprotein subunits 3aUrochordata 3agenes 3aactive sites 3amitochondria 3aNematoda 0apol γ 0amitochondrial replicase 0amitochondrial DNA replication 0aTunicata 0astructural evolution1 aHaukka, Jani1 aKaguni, Laurie S.0 tGenome Biology and Evolution.g2015 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.943-959dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245016300175520091700338592002801255650005201283650001301335650001501348650001401363651000901377653001501386653000801401653002301409653002201432653001901454653001901473653001901492653001901511653001901530700001901549700001801568700002001586700002101606700002601627700001401653700002101667773011201688856008701800852000901887655001201896IND60770055720221120033101.0220426e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077005572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1145142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoradzad, Mohammad12aA screening strategy for identifying the dominant variant of SARS-COV-2 in the fifth peak of Kurdistan- Iran population using HRM and Probe-based RT-PCR assay  aBy the emergence of SARS CoV-2 variants, many studies were developed to deal with it. The high transmissibility and mortality rate of some variants, in particular developing countries have caused the operation of simple diagnostic tests for genomic surveillance. In this study, we developed two assays of High Resolution Melting (HRM) and Probe-based RT-PCR as simple and inexpensive methods to identify the variants. We screened the mutations of del69–70, E484K, E484Q, D614G, L452R, and T478K in 100 cases from SARS-COV-2 positive patients in Kurdistan- Iran population. In general, the result of the two methods overlapped each other, nevertheless, we suggested HRM results be confirmed with a standard assay (Whole-Genome Sequencing). This work indicated that HRM as the rapid and inexpensive method could identify and categorize the variants of SARS CoV-2 and reduce the costs for carrying out sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3agenomics 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aIran 0aSARS CoV-2 0aHRM 0aProbe-based RT-PCR 0aDel69-70 mutation 0aE484K mutation 0aE484Q mutation 0aD614G mutation 0aL452R mutation 0aT478K mutation1 aSoltani, Hasan1 aSalehi, Hamid1 aRahmani, Khaled1 aKhateri, Dariush1 aRahimi, Mohammad Zaid1 aAz, Diman1 aFakhari, Shohreh0 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 June, v. 304 p.114514-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1145143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245037600164300001600540520113600556592002801692650001601720650001101736650001101747650001101758650001801769650001801787650001301805650001401818650001501832650004401847650002101891650002201912650001301934653003101947653004001978653001102018653001502029653001302044700001902057700002002076700002602096700001902122773015002141856007702291852000902368655001202377IND60521725620221120223801.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052172562DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1984-02092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanzer, Wolfgang10aReaktionen von Metallkomplexen mit kleinen Ringen, XI [1] Ringöffnung von Aziridinen mit Metallcarbonylhydriden; β-Aminoacylchelat-Komplexe von Mangan, Molybdän, Wolfram und Cobalt / Reactions of Metal Complexes with Small Rings, XI [1] Ring Opening of Aziridines by Metal Carbonyl Hydrides; β-Aminoacyl Chelate Complexes of Manganese, Molybdenum, Tungsten and Cobalt  ap. 167-179.  aThe metal carbonyl hydrides HM(CO)₃(π-C₅H₅) (M = Mo, W), HMn(CO)₄L, HCo(CO)₃L (L - CO, PPh₃) react with aziridines by protonation of aziridine, nucleophilic attack of the corresponding carbonyl metallate and CO insertion to give the β-aminoacyl complexes 2-7. The ring opening of C-substituted aziridines is regiospecific. With alkyl substituted aziridines the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl metallate occurs at the sterically less hindered carbon atom, with phenyl substituted aziridines at the phenyl substituted carbon atoms. From the reactions of HM(CO)₃(π-C₅H₅) with optically active aziridines, which afford complexes with an asymmetric metal atom, only one diastereomer could be observed.

Unripe, semiripe and ripe plantain pulp were subjected to sun‐drying (50C, 72 h), boiled (100C, 15 min), roasted (120C, 10 min) and oven‐dried (60C, 20 min). The flour obtained was evaluated for their proximate composition, functional, pasting properties and sensory qualities. The result of proximate analysis showed that there were slight increase in moisture content, crude fiber, ash and fat content as ripening progressed. The result of proximate composition recorded a significant change (P < 0.05). The moisture content of all the samples ranged from 4.88 to 10.78%. Amylose content ranged from 15.99 to 27.20%. The level of carotenoid ranged from 1.57 to 15.10 µg/g, with the highest value recorded for unripe boiled plantain flour.

To explore the behavior of nonionic surfactants across Tcₗₒᵤd and when mixed with colloidal silica at a very dilute concentration around 0.1 wt%, a series of 1,2-epoxybutane-capped alcohol ethoxylates (BAEs) with various cloud points is used as a model system.BAEs with cloud points from 15 to 64 °C were successfully prepared by varying the lengths of 1,2-epoxybutane (BO) and ethylene oxide (EO) blocks and their phase behavior across Tcₗₒᵤd was studied using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).In the absence of silica, the NMR signals are not greatly affected by the cloud point transition, but both the water and surfactant exhibit a decrease in spin-spin relaxation time once the temperature reaches the Tcₗₒᵤd. In the presence of silica, the NMR spectra indicate significantly reduced mobility of the EO portion relative to the alkyl and BO segments. Furthermore, our results suggest that the BAE surfactants are not fractionally clouding out or precipitating with a portion of the compositional distribution during the cloud point transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethylene 3aethylene oxide 3alight scattering 3amodels 3anonionic surfactants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproducts and commodities 3asilica 3atemperature 0aNonionic surfactant 0aCapped surfactant 0aNMR 0aCloud point 0aColloidal silica1 aCampbell, Robert1 aDan, Florin1 aDaugs, Edward1 aDeFelippis, James1 aGu, Junsi1 aWasserman, Eric1 aYoung, Wenshiue Owen0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 581 p.102-111dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.07.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245008500205300001800290506007600308520149200384592002801876506003701904650002001941650001801961650002601979650002102005650001102026650001102037650001102048650002102059650001702080650001402097650001102111653001202122653002202134653001802156653001002174653001002184653001602194700001902210773010102229856007402330852000902404655001202413IND60132647920221207095852.0150511e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013264792DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evv0452doi7 aPMC44197922pmcid7 a257472512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlacht, Alexander10aUnexpected Ancient Paralogs and an Evolutionary Model for the COPII Coat Complex  ap. 1098-1109.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe coat protein complex II (COPII) is responsible for the transport of protein cargoes from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. COPII has been functionally characterized extensively in vivo in humans and yeast. This complex shares components with the nuclear pore complex and the Seh1-Associated (SEA) complex, inextricably linking its evolution with that of the nuclear pore and other protocoatomer domain-containing complexes. Importantly, this is one of the last coat complexes to be examined from a comparative genomic and phylogenetic perspective. We use homology searching of eight components across 74 eukaryotic genomes, followed by phylogenetic analyses, to assess both the distribution of the COPII components across eukaryote diversity and to assess its evolutionary history. We report that Sec12, but not Sed4 was present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor along with Sec16, Sar1, Sec13, Sec31, Sec23, and Sec24. We identify a previously undetected paralog of Sec23 that, at least, predates the archaeplastid clade. We also describe three Sec24 paralogs likely present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, including one newly detected that was anciently present but lost from both opisthokonts and excavates. Altogether, we report previously undescribed complexity of the COPII coat in the ancient eukaryotic ancestor and speculate on models for the evolution, not only of the complex, but its relationship to other protocoatomer-derived complexes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGolgi apparatus 3acoat proteins 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenome 3ahumans 3amodels 3anuclear membrane 3anucleoporins 3aphylogeny 3ayeasts 0aprotist 0avesicle transport 0aprotocoatomer 0aSec13 0aSec24 0aArabidopsis1 aDacks, Joel B.0 tGenome Biology and Evolution.g2015 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.1098-1109dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01804naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165500001900265520063700284592002800921650001400949650001500963650002600978650003001004650002401034650001401058653001801072653003101090653003101121653001701152700001801169700001301187700001801200700001501218773009401233856008201327852000901409655001201418IND60736335120221121062730.0210610e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073633512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1321702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Weiqiang10aEfficient one-pot synthesis of oxaperylenone derivatives promoted by propylphosphonic anhydride  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPropylphosphonic anhydride (T3P)-mediated condensation and intramolecular cyclization of 1-hydroxyanthraquinone with various active methylene acetates in the presence of Et3N was efficiently accomplished, affording oxaperylenone derivatives.

Although the protein contains two tryptophan (Trp) residues, AD interacts with only one (Trp-19), which is authenticated by the appearance of a single isoemissive point in TRANES. Alteration in the secondary structure of the protein while AD pierces through βLG is evident from the circular dichroism spectroscopic study. The ground-state interaction between AD and βLG is proven from the UV–vis spectroscopic study and the static nature of quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of the protein by the ligand. The steady-state fluorescence study in varied temperatures indicates the involvement of hydrogen bonding in the ligand–protein interaction. Further, the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy study gives a hint of the presence of a hydrogen bond in AD−βLG interaction, which possibly involves the rotamers of Trp-19. In fact, the idea of involvement of rotamers of Trp-19 is obtained from the increase in fluorescence lifetime of βLG in the presence of AD. The docking study agrees to the involvement of hydrogen bonding in AD−βLG interaction. The direct evidence of hydrogen bonding between Trp and AD is obtained from the laser flash photolysis studies where the signature of formation of ADH• and Trp• through hydrogen abstraction between Trp and AD, loosely bound through hydrogen bonding, gets prominence. Thus, binding of AD to βLG involves hydrogen bonding in a hydrophobic pocket of the protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3aphotolysis 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3atryptophan 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aSengupta, Chaitrali1 aPal, Uttam1 aBasu, Samita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1629-29790 tLangmuir.g2020 Jan. 17, v. 36, no. 5 p.1241-1251dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b035063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01776naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245015200161300001600313520064500329592002800974650002201002650001601024650001301040653001701053653003001070653001701100700002101117700002101138700002201159700002101181773015001202856007701352852000901429655001201438IND60521726020221120223604.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052172602DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1984-02132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCannas, Mario10aStructure of the Linear-Chain Mixed Valence Compound Bis(l,3-diaminopropane)platinum(II)bis(l,3-diaminopropane)- diiodoplatinum(IV)tetraperchlorate  ap. 197-200.  aThe title compound C₁₂H₄₉Cl₄I₂N₈O ₁₆Pt₂, Mr 1314.1, is monoclinic P 2₁ (from structural analysis), a = 8.74(1), b = 11.36(1), c = 8.63(1), β = 107.6(5), V = 817 Å³, Z = 1, Dₘ (flotation) = 2.65 g cm⁻³, Dc = 2.66 g cm⁻³, MoKɑ λ = 0.71069, μ = 110.7 cm⁻¹, R = 0.063 for 1068 observed reflections.

It is synthesized during assimilation of ammonium by cytosolic and plastidial glutamine synthetases (GS; EC 6.1.1.3). Arabidopsis thaliana has five cytosolic GS (GS1) encoding genes designated as GLN1;1–GLN1;5 and one plastidial GS (GS2) gene. In this report that concerns cytosolic GS, we show by analyzing single, double and triple mutants that single genes were dispensable for growth under laboratory conditions. However, loss of two or three GS1 isoforms impacted plant form, function and the capacity to tolerate abiotic stresses. The loss of GLN1;1, GLN1;2 and GLN1;3 resulted in a significant reduction of vegetative growth and seed size. In addition, we infer that GLN1;4 is essential for pollen viability but only in the absence of GLN1;1 and GLN1;3. Transcript profiling revealed that expression of GLN1;1, GLN1;2, GLN1;3 and GLN1;4 was repressed by salinity and cold stresses. Among all single gln1 mutants, growth of gln1;1 seedlings showed an enhanced sensitivity to the GS inhibitor phosphinothricin (PPT), as well as to cold and salinity treatments, suggesting a non-redundant role for GLN1;1. Furthermore, the increased sensitivity of gln1;1 mutants to methyl viologen was associated with an accelerated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the thylakoid of chloroplasts. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, an involvement of the cytosolic GS1 in modulating ROS homeostasis in chloroplasts. Collectively, the current study establishes a link between cytosolic Gln production and plant development, ROS production and stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  cCanadian Foundation for Innovation 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aammonium 3acarbon 3acold 3acold stress 3agenes 3aglufosinate 3aglutamine 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolism 3amutants 3anitrogen 3aparaquat 3aplant architecture 3apollen 3areactive oxygen species 3asalinity 3aseed size 3aseedlings 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3athreonine-tRNA ligase 3athylakoids 3atranscriptomics 3avegetative growth 3aviability 0aAbiotic stress 0aPollen sterile1 aLi, Qiang1 aLiu, Guosheng1 aSelvaraj, Gopalan1 aZheng, Zhifu1 aZou, Jitao1 aWei, Yangdou0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 60, no. 3 p.657-671dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy2353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100000700141245014800148300001600296520091800312592002801230650001501258650002501273650002201298650000901320650001401329650003101343650001001374650001301384650001601397653001101413653002901424653001501453653002301468700000701491700000701498700000701505700000701512700000701519700000701526700000701533700000701540773013701547856007701684852000901761655001201770IND60516535820221117205103.0160326e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051653582DNAL7 a10.1638/2014-0149.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aProgressive syringohydromyelia and degenerative axonopathy in a bobcat (lynx rufus) following surgical correction of a chiari-like malformation  ap. 329-332.  aA 3-yr-old male captive bobcat (Lynx rufus) presented with chronic ataxia and right-sided head tilt.

The clinical signs did not improve after surgical occipital craniectomy, and 2 mo postoperatively a second MRI showed hydromyelia and continued cerebellar compression. The bobcat was euthanized, and necropsy showed chronic focal cerebellar herniation and chronic multifocal atlanto-occipital joint osteophyte proliferation. Histology confirmed the presence of a thick fibrous membrane along the caudal aspect of the cerebellar vermis, suggestive of postoperative adhesions, and axonal degeneration of the cervical spinal cord, even in sections without a central canal lesion.

Being able to detect and quantify heterotrophic bacteria would be of high value for monitoring culture health and reducing deleterious effects. Here, we developed and applied a new method that combines flow cytometry (FC) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for the quantification of heterotrophic bacteria in cultures of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Particles not containing chlorophyll – heterotrophic bacteria and cell debris – were separated from mixed cultures using FACS based on autofluorescence of Synechocystis. Heterotrophic bacteria were differentiated from cell debris using FC with SYTOX green fluorescence. Using microscopy, we verified that FACS was able to quantify heterotrophic bacteria in Synechocystis cultures effectively. Applying these methods to batch cultures of Synechocystis showed that the count proportions of heterotrophic bacteria were significant (3–13%) and that depletion of inorganic P in the culture favored Synechocystis over heterotrophic bacteria, but led to more cell lysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechocystis sp.

It is used for genetically modified crops, and particularly in Florida, it is used as a sugar cane ripener. An aquatic formulation (Rodeo®) is used to treat aquatic weeds in waterbodies and drainage canals. Because of its extended use, glyphosate can run off or be sprayed directly into waterbodies, and chronically expose aquatic wildlife. Exposure in animal models has been associated with kidney and liver damage and glyphosate has been suggested as an endocrine disruptor. We exposed adult male largemouth bass for 21 days to two doses of glyphosate and Rodeo® (chemically equivalent concentration of glyphosate) at 0.5 mg L⁻¹ and 10 mg L⁻¹ and to a clean water control (n=4 fish/tank in quadruplicate). Concentrations during the experiment were corroborated with UHPLC-MS/MS. Total RNA was isolated from the trunk kidney and head kidney. RNA-seq was performed for the high doses compared to controls. Transcripts were analyzed with fish and mammalian pathway analyses software. Transcripts mapped to Zebrafish metabolic pathways using PaintOmics showed steroid hormone biosynthesis in the trunk kidney as the most significantly enriched pathway. Steroid hormones were measured in plasma by UHPLC-MS/MS. Total androgens were significantly reduced at 0.5 mg L⁻¹ of glyphosate and at equivalent concentrations in Rodeo® compared to controls. 11-ketotestosterone and estrone concentrations were significantly reduced in all doses. A gene involved in the conversion of testosterone to 11-ketotestosterone was down-regulated by glyphosate. Using the mammalian pathway analysis algorithm, cellular processes associated with T-cell activation/development and intracellular pH were significantly enriched in the trunk kidney by glyphosate and Rodeo® exposure. Endocrine disruption was corroborated at the hormone and gene expression levels. Rodeo® and glyphosate share gene expression pathways, however, Rodeo® had more pronounced effects in largemouth bass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadults 3aalgorithms 3abiosynthesis 3achronic exposure 3acomputer software 3adrainage 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestrone 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglyphosate 3akidneys 3aliver 3amales 3amammals 3anephrotoxicity 3apH 3asequence analysis 3asteroid hormones 3asugarcane 3asurface water 3atestosterone 3atoxicology 3awildlife 3aFlorida 0aFish 0aUHPLC-MS/MS 0aTranscriptomics 0aSteroid hormones 0aPathway analysis1 aKroll, Kevin J.1 aYu, Fahong1 aNouri, Mohammad-Zaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4506-15311 aSilva Sánchez, Cecilia,1 aPerez, Juan Guillermo1 aMoraga Amador., David A.1 aZhang, Yanping1 aWalsh, Mike T.1 aDenslow, Nancy D.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 May, v. 246 p.106142-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1061423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158300001600270520138500286592002801671596006001699596010801759650002301867650003101890650002501921650001901946650001701965650001701982650001401999650001702013650001802030650001702048650001202065650001702077650002002094650003002114650002102144650001202165650001302177650002902190650002602219650001802245653001602263653001602279653002002295653001002315653003802325700001802363700001702381700001602398700001702414700002202431700001702453700001302470700001502483773012702498856007402625852000902699655001202708IND60673752620221122055303.0191019e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067375262DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcy2362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Zhengkun10aIdentification of Candidate HY5-Dependent and -Independent Regulators of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Tomato  ap. 643-656.  aHigh quantities of anthocyanins in plants confer potential protective benefits against biotic and abiotic stressors. Studies have shown that the bZIP transcription factor HY5 plays a key role in controlling anthocyanin accumulation in response to light. However, in hy5 mutants, residual anthocyanins have been detected, indicating that other regulators exist to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in an HY5-independent manner. Here, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) system specifically to induce targeted mutagenesis of SlHY5 in the purple tomato cultivar ‘Indigo Rose’. The T₂ generation of tomato plants homozygous for the null allele of the SlHY5 frameshift mutated by a 1 bp insertion contained a lower anthocyanin content. Transcriptional analysis showed that most of the anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes and several regulatory genes were down-regulated in the hy5 mutant lines. With transcriptome analyses of the various tissues from hy5 mutant lines, eight candidate transcription factors were identified that may regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in an HY5-independent manner. These findings deepen our understanding of how light controls anthocyanin accumulation and facilitate the identification of the regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in an HY5-independent manner.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801863a31672156cNational Natural Science Foundation  a2018A030310211cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003453 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCRISPR-associated proteins 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabiotic stress 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3agene editing 3agenetic lines 3ahomozygosity 3amutants 3anull alleles 3aregulator genes 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3astructural genes 3atissues 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 0aAnthocyanin 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aHY5 independent 0aSlHY5 0aTomato cultivar ‘Indigo Rose’1 aWang, Haijing1 aLi, Dongjing1 aYu, Bingwei1 aHui, Qiuling1 aYan, Shuangshuang1 aHuang, Zejun1 aCui, Xia1 aCao, Bihao0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 60, no. 3 p.643-656dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl50549x1471-90537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcy2363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100000700141245012700148300001400275520206300289592002802352650002002380650002302400650001302423650001102436650001302447650001202460650002002472650001102492650000902503653001302512653001302525653001102538653001202549653001402561653000902575700000702584700000702591773013502598856007702733852000902810655001202819IND60516535920221117205054.0160326e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051653592DNAL7 a10.1638/2014-0157.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aCharacterization of anterior segment ophthalmologic lesions identified in free-ranging dolphins and those under human care  ap. 56-75.  aCetaceans in the wild and under human care develop a variety of ocular lesions. Although they have echolocation, cetacean species have good sight, making ocular health an important part of overall health care. The cornea is the primary site of abnormalities in both populations. Typical lesions of cetaceans under human care are characterized in this retrospective review of cases. One hundred eighty animals (n = 360 eyes) were chosen from the author's ophthalmologic examination reports from different geographic areas; they included Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), Pacific bottle nose dolphins (Tursiopstruncatus gilli), Indopacific bottlenose dolphins (Steno bredanensis), Indopacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), and roughtooth dolphins (Steno bredanensis). These animals were examined at least once, although most were examined numerous times over many years; lesions were categorized and are described. Seventy-seven eyes from 47 animals were normal. Medial keratopathy was the most common lesion and identified in 180 eyes from 97 animals, with 83 affected bilaterally. Horizontal keratopathy was identified in 69 eyes from 41 animals, with 28 affected bilaterally. Axial keratopathy and nonspecific axial opacities were identified in 67 eyes from 44 animals, with 21 affected bilaterally. Seventy-eight eyes from 50 animals, with 28 affected bilaterally, had more than one type of corneal lesion. Cataracts were identified in 32 eyes from 19 animals, with 13 affected bilaterally. Traumatic injuries were also common and involved eyelids and cornea. Sixteen eyes from 11 animals were blind; five dolphins were blind bilaterally due to phthisis bulbi secondary to corneal perforation or severe trauma. None of the diseases had a sex predisposition; however, medial keratopathy was significantly more common as a bilateral presentation than as a unilateral presentation. Cetaceans under human care with impaired sight can use echolocation; however, ocular health should definitely be a priority in their overall health plan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSousa chinensis 3aTursiops truncatus 3acataract 3acornea 3adolphins 3aeyelids 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3anose 0aCataract 0acetacean 0acornea 0adolphin 0akeratitis 0alens1 a, 1 a, 0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 47, no. 1 p.56-75dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2014-0157.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011500158300001800273520068900291592002800980650002201008650001501030650001401045650002301059650001701082650001301099650001901112650002201131650002201153650001901175650001401194650001301208650001401221650001701235650001901252700001601271700001501287700001501302700001301317700001401330700001701344700001801361700001701379700001901396700001701415700001801432773014201450856007401592852000901666655001201675IND60671284320221118184310.0191002e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067128432DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb01093d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chong,12aA new mild, clean and highly efficient method for the preparation of graphene quantum dots without by-products  ap. 6871-6876.  aWe demonstrated that graphene oxide (GO) can be oxidized and cut into graphene quantum dots (GQDs) by hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), which is obtained by the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) with a tungsten oxide nanowire (W₁₈O₄₉) catalyst.

Real-world water samples typically contain a multitude of ions that must be considered apart from sodium–chloride salt. In this work, we have developed a method to quantify the competitive adsorption of different ionic species during CDI processes. The method is straightforward, requiring a single calibrating experiment to extract a ‘periodic table’ of competitiveness scores for all ions present in the experiment. Using a dynamic Langmuir model that was developed by our group, it is shown that these scores could subsequently be used to predict the adsorption of any ion species in a multi-ion solution. Excellent agreement with data from the literature could be achieved with this model, and the method is especially well-suited for trace ions as these can be predicted directly. The derived method is simple and accurate for quantifying and predicting adsorption in multi-ion solutions and could be valuable for predicting the effect when applying CDI to real-world water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abrackish water 3acost effectiveness 3adeionization 3adesalination 3aions 3amodels 3aprediction 3asorption isotherms1 aDutta, Joydeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0074-35040 tLangmuir.g2020 Jan. 16, v. 36, no. 5 p.1338-1344dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b035713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245009000198300001600288500001100304520177700315592002802092650002302120650001202143650001202155650005202167650002002219650001102239650001502250650001302265650001102278650000902289650002002298650001202318650001702330650001302347651001202360700005602372700005802428700001902486700002102505700001802526700002302544700002602567773013402593856007502727852000902802655001202811IND60776377920221117102451.0220505e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077637792DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.141312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLogeot, Myriam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5904-349X10aRisk assessment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in free‐ranging wild animals in Belgium  ap. 986-996.  aREVIEW  aThe aim of this review paper is to evaluate the putative susceptibilities of different free‐ranging wild animal species in Belgium to SARS‐CoV‐2 and provide a risk assessment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in those animals. Since the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, natural SARS‐CoV‐2 infections have mainly been confirmed in domestic and production animals, and in wild animals kept in captivity, although the numbers remain limited when compared to human cases. Recently, the first SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in presumably escaped minks found in the wild have been detected, further addressing the much‐feared scenario of transmission of the virus to animals living in the wild and its consequences. Considering the most likely origin of the virus being a wild animal and the putative susceptibilities of free‐ranging wild animal species to SARS‐CoV‐2, the risk of infection with possible establishment of the virus in these populations has to be investigated closely. The authors conclude that most attention should be given to surveillance and awareness‐raising activities for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in wild mustelids, bats, wild canids and felids, particularly these collected in wildlife rescue centres. People involved in frequent and close contact with wild animals should take all necessary precautionary measures to protect wild animals against exposure to the virus. More than one year after the first detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 in humans, the time has come to increase investments in research and surveillance activities in animals, including in free‐ranging wild animals, as part of a One Health control of this pandemic. This study focussing on Belgium could be helpful for other countries with similar animal densities and ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aCanidae 3aFelidae 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acaptive animals 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apandemic 3apeople 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aviruses 3awild animals 3awildlife 3aBelgium1 aMauroy, Axel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5101-810X1 aThiry, Etienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9585-79331 aDe Regge, Nick1 aVervaeke, Muriel1 aBeck, Olivier1 aDe Waele, Valérie1 aVan den Berg, Thierry0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.986-996dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.141313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001500140245007700155300001400232500000900246520158800255592002801843650001801871650001601889650001301905650001901918650001501937650002401952650000901976650001901985650002902004651001102033700001802044700001602062700001602078700001702094700001702111700001202128773011602140852000902256856007702265655001202342IND4433462020221118210713.0191126e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443346202DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2008.01522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenine, H.10aEffect of Pipe Pressurization on the Discharge of a Tile Drainage System  ap. 36-42.  aepub  aPredicting the drainage impacts on downstream peak events is complex because it involves studying many physical processes at different interdependent scales: the individual field, the drainage network, and the catchment. This study focused on an experiment performed in a small subsurface-drained catchment (130 ha), east of Paris, France. The main objective was to study the influence of the temporary pipe pressurization of the drainage network on the field drainage discharge during intense rainfall events. The flow rates at one buried pipe collector within the drainage network and at the catchment outlet were monitored concurrently with the pressure head in the pipe. Water levels were recorded in rows of piezometers aligned between drains connected to the studied collector so that water storage in the water table could be investigated during pipe pressurization. Two years of observations showed that when a pipe pressurization condition existed, the collector discharge was limited or reversed and the infiltrated water was temporarily stored within the field soil as the water table rose. Between the usual stages of normal subsurface drainage (peak flow and recession), two additional behaviors appeared to occur, similar to those resulting from implementing controlled drainage and subirrigation practices, and with noticeable consequences on the discharge hydrograph. No strong relationship could be established between the collector discharge limitation and the catchment hydrology, probably because pressurization affected only a small part of the drainage network.  aPublisher supplied data 3atile drainage 3adrain pipes 3apressure 3adrainage water 3awater flow 3asubsurface drainage 3arain 3arain intensity 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aFrance1 aNédélec, Y.1 aAugeard, B.1 aBirgand, F.1 aChaumont, C.1 aRibstein, P.1 aKao, C.0 tVadose zone journal.g2010 Feb., v. 9, no. 1 p.36-42dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2008.01523Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02860naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024001100132040001800143100002100161245007300182300001400255506017300269520129000442650001101732650002301743650002101766650001401787650001801801650002001819650001301839650002501852650001901877650001001896650001101906650002201917650001101939650001201950650001301962651001601975700002801991773012802019856011202147956011302259961000902372852000902381655001202390IND60006006720221214225849.0141217e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000600672DNAL7 a3093162aris7 a10113/600672hdl8 ans6188  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, Scott S.10aFish communities associated with a complex Mississippi stream system  ap. 73-79.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aComplex habitats such as sloughs, oxbows, and wetlands provide important ecosystem services for fish communities. While human manipulation of rivers and streams for flood control often reduce this complexity, some construction practices may provide an unexpected benefit. Structures such as borrow pits excavated for levee construction may mimic the functions of other back water features like oxbows or sloughs. Fish were collected in both Abiaca Creek channel and borrow pits created during the construction of a 360 ha floodway to examine the value of borrow pits as a backwater resource. Taxa richness, true diversity and other diversity indices were calculated to compare the communities of fish at the various sample locations. Lentic habitats created by borrow pit excavation contributed to the overall diversity. Greatest fish diversity was in the unaltered upper channel site while lowest was in the lower channelized sample reach. One of the borrow pits with relatively low diversity was found to support a strong sports fishery and exhibited characteristics of a managed resource. Catch per unit effort was higher in the pits which contained a higher proportion of species that reached larger adult sizes while number per unit of effort was higher in the upper channel site. 3aadults 3aecosystem services 3afish communities 3afisheries 3aflood control 3afreshwater fish 3ahabitats 3ahydraulic structures 3alentic systems 3aponds 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3asports 3astreams 3awetlands 3aMississippi1 aShields Jr., F.

METHODS: Cluster randomized-controlled trial in the setting of pre-existing first-time parents groups organised by Maternal and Child Health Nurses in Victoria, Australia. Participants were 460 first-time fathers mean age = 34.2 (s.d.4.90) years. Dietary pattern scores of fathers were derived using principal component analysis, total physical activity and total television viewing time were assessed at baseline (infant aged three to four months) and after 15 months. RESULTS: No significant beneficial intervention effect was observed on fathers’ dietary pattern scores, total physical activity or total television viewing time. CONCLUSION: Despite a strong focus on parent modelling (targeting parents own diet, physical activity and television viewing behaviours), and beneficial impact on mothers’ obesity risk behaviours, this intervention, with mothers as the point of contact, had no effect on fathers’ obesity risk-related behaviours. Based on the established links between children’s obesity risk-related behaviors and that of their fathers, a need exists for research testing the effectiveness of interventions with a stronger engagement of fathers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3adiet 3aeating habits 3afathers 3amodels 3amothers 3anurses 3aphysical activity 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3atelevision 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCluster Analysis 2aDiet 2aFathers 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aIntervention Studies 2aMothers 2aMotor Activity 2aObesityxprevention & control 2aPediatric Obesityxprevention & control 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSedentary Behavior. 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aAustralia 0aAustralia1 aLioret, Sandrine1 aCameron, Adrian J1 aHesketh, Kylie D1 aMcNaughton, Sarah A1 aCrawford, David1 aCampbell, Karen J.,0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.18-18dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-11-183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01167naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245006100169300001600230520036600246592002800612650001200640650001900652650002100671650001900692700002800711773009300739856004800832852000900880655001200889IND4466779320221122063624.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446677932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-011-0268-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuivarch, CÃ©line10aExisting infrastructure and the 2Â°C target : A Letter  ap. 801-805.  aTo clarify the link between existing infrastructure legacy and the 2Â°C target, we extend the work of Davis et al.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are of particular concern as they have been associated with well-established risk factors of HF, but current data are limited.We aimed to assess the association between dietary PCB exposure and risk of HF, accounting for dietary intake of long-chain omega-3 fish fatty acids.We used the prospective population-based research structure SIMPLER (previously the Swedish Mammography Cohort and Cohort of Swedish Men) comprising 32,952 women and 36,546 men, free from cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes at baseline in 1997. Validated estimates of dietary PCBs and long-chain omega-3 fish fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] were obtained via a food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Incident cases of HF were ascertained through register linkage.During an average of 12 years of follow-up, we ascertained 2736 and 3128 incident cases of HF in women and men, respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models, mutually adjusted for PCBs and EPA-DHA, the relative risk (RR) for dietary PCB exposure was 1.48 (95% CI 1.12–1.96) in women and 1.42 (95% CI 1.08–1.86) in men, comparing extreme quintiles. Corresponding RRs for EPA-DHA intake were 0.71 (95% CI 0.54–0.93) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.63–1.07), respectively.Dietary exposure to PCBs was associated with an increased risk of HF in both women and men. EPA-DHA intake was associated with a lower risk of HF in women, with a similar tendency in men.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3adiabetes 3adietary exposure 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afish 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3aheart failure 3amen 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arelative risk 3arisk factors 3awomen 0aCI 0aCOSM 0aDHA 0aEPA 0aFFQ 0aHF 0aPCB 0aRR 0aSMC 0aHeart failure 0aFish 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls 0aLong-chain omega-3 fish fatty acids1 aDonat-Vargas, Carolina1 aBerglund, Marika1 aGlynn, Anders1 aWolk, Alicja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7387-68451 aKippler, Maria0 tEnvironment international.g2019 May, v. 126 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007000160300002000230520121900250592002801469650002201497650001101519650002201530650001901552650001201571650001401583650002801597650002101625650001901646650001901665650003301684650001901717650002301736650002001759650001901779650001001798700001701808700001401825700001201839700001501851773012401866856007401990852000902064655001202073IND60667134920221119212507.0190919e20150223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066713492DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra14313b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Chengqiang10aPhysicochemical performance of FeCO₃ films influenced by anions  ap. 20302-20308.  aThe corrosion film plays an important role in the further electrochemical processes of steel in CO₂ corrosion. Thus, the physicochemical performance of an FeCO₃ film was investigated using the Mott–Schottky electrochemical technique, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The performance of the FeCO₃ film was dependent on the aqueous solution. In 0.5 mol L⁻¹ NaHCO₃ solution, an n-type semiconducting behavior was found for the FeCO₃ film. The dense microstructure and lower interstitial cation or anion vacancy doping was in favor of strong corrosion resistance of the film. On the contrary, a p-type semiconducting behavior of the FeCO₃ film was exhibited in both 0.5 mol L⁻¹ NaCl solution and 0.5 mol L⁻¹ Na₂SO₄ solution. Higher cation vacancy doping was found, and the integrity of the microstructure was damaged, which decreased the transfer resistance of electron and mass. As a result, the protective ability of the FeCO₃ film was decreased. The physicochemical mechanism for the semiconducting properties of the FeCO₃ film was explained using the Point Defect Model (PDM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3airon carbonate 3amicrostructure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiconductors 3asodium bicarbonate 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3asteel1 aWang, Wanguo1 aJin, Xing1 aLiu, Li1 aShi, Taihe0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 23, v. 5, no. 26 p.20302-20308dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra14313b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005000164300001800214520144000232592002801672650002301700650002201723650005001745650005201795650002801847650001801875650001101893650001801904650002701922650002501949650002301974650003501997653001302032653002202045653001802067653001302085653003202098653001302130653001502143653000902158653000802167653000802175653000802183653000802191700001402199700001802213700001702231773012302248856008202371852000902453655001202462IND60704706820221122053222.0201104e20200904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070470682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiahui10aMutations Strengthened SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity  ap. 5212-5226.  aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is a major concern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and economic reopening. However, rigorous determination of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is very difficult owing to its continuous evolution with over 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in many subtypes. We employ an algebraic topology-based machine learning model to quantitatively evaluate the binding free energy changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor following mutations. We reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus becomes more infectious. Three out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become slightly more infectious, while the other three subtypes have significantly strengthened their infectivity. We also find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding free energy changes. Based on a systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain, we show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability analysis, and binding free energy calculation, we predict that a few residues on the receptor-binding motif, i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aGibbs free energy 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aartificial intelligence 3aglycoproteins 3amodels 3apathogenicity 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aprobability analysis 3asequence alignment 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aCOVID-19 0aviral infectivity 0aspike protein 0amutation 0aprotein-protein interaction 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aACE2 0aRBD 0aPPI 0aBFE 0aRBM1 aWang, Rui1 aWang, Menglun1 aWei, Guo-Wei0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 432, no. 19 p.5212-5226dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100004000150245015700190300001600347520165600363650001902019650002402038650002102062650002702083650002702110650002602137650001602163650001902179650001002198650000702208650002002215650001502235650002202250650002502272650001402297700003002311700003602341700003002377700003802407700002802445773017102473856005102644852000902695655001202704IND60523501420221120172725.0160621e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052350142DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-2452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeite, Caroline Junqueira Barcellos10aInactivation of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella Enteritidis by Cymbopogon citratus D.C.

Merril) juice (4°C) was assessed. Moreover, the effects of CCEO on the physicochemical and sensory quality parameters of pineapple juice were evaluated. The MIC of CCEO was 5 μl/ml against the composite mix examined. For L. monocytogenes and E. coli inoculated in juice containing CCEO (5, 2.5, and 1.25 μl/ml), a ≥5-log reduction was detected after 15 min of exposure. This same result was obtained for Salmonella Enteritidis incubated alone in pineapple juice containing CCEO at 5 and 2.5 μl/ml. Overall, Salmonella Enteritidis was the most tolerant and L. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to CCEO. The physicochemical properties (pH, titratable acidic [citric acid per 100 g], and soluble solids) of pineapple juice containing CCEO (2.5 and 1.25 μl/ml) were maintained. Juice containing CCEO (2.5 and 1.25 μl/ml) exhibited similar scores for odor, appearance, and viscosity compared with juice without CCEO. However, unsatisfactory changes in taste and aftertaste were observed in juices containing CCEO. These results suggest that CCEO could be used as an alternative antimicrobial compound to ensure the safety of pineapple juice, although CCEO at the tested concentrations negatively impacted its taste. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the balance between microbial safety and taste acceptability of pineapple juice containing CCEO. 3aAnanas comosus 3aCymbopogon citratus 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aanti-infective agents 3acitric acid 3aessential oils 3aodors 3apH 3apineapple juice 3apineapples 3ataste sensitivity 3atotal soluble solids 3aviscosity1 aSousa, Jossana Pereira de1 aCosta Medeiros, Jose Alberto da1 aConceicao, Maria Lucia da1 aSantos Falcao-Silva, Vivyanne dos1 aSouza, Evandro Leite de0 tJournal of food protection.g2016 Feb., v. 79, no. 2 p.213-219dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-245  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245016300200300001800363506007600381520134900457506003701806650002201843650002501865650002401890650001801914650002401932650002001956700002901976700002302005700002502028773008202053852000902135856007902144939003302223946001102256990002302267655001202290IND4450954220221207115845.0110319e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445095422DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq10482doi7 aPMC30610582pmcid7 a210513542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanguly, Agneyo14aThe latch modulates nucleotide and DNA binding to the helicase-like domain of Thermotoga maritima reverse gyrase and is required for positive DNA supercoiling  ap. 1789-1800.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReverse gyrase is the only topoisomerase that can introduce positive supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent process. It has a modular structure and harnesses a helicase-like domain to support a topoisomerase activity, thereby creating the unique function of positive DNA supercoiling. The isolated topoisomerase domain can relax negatively supercoiled DNA, an activity that is suppressed in reverse gyrase. The isolated helicase-like domain is a nucleotide-dependent switch that is attenuated by the topoisomerase domain. Inter-domain communication thus appears central for the functional cooperation of the two domains. The latch, an insertion into the helicase-like domain, has been suggested as an important element in coordinating their activities. Here, we have dissected the influence of the latch on nucleotide and DNA binding to the helicase-like domain, and on DNA supercoiling by reverse gyrase. We find that the latch is required for positive DNA supercoiling. It is crucial for the cooperativity of DNA and nucleotide binding to the helicase-like domain. The latch contributes to DNA binding, and affects the preference of reverse gyrase for ssDNA. Thus, the latch coordinates the individual domain activities by modulating the helicase-like domain, and by communicating changes in the nucleotide state to the topoisomerase domain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aThermotoga maritima 3abinding sites 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asupercoiled DNA1 adel Toro Duany, Yoandris1 aRudolph, Markus G.1 aKlostermeier, Dagmar0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 5 p.1789-1800x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq10483Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110321  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03346naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010800183300001600291500002400307520144900331650002001780650001601800650001901816650002301835650002201858650001101880650001701891650001201908650001401920650001301934650002401947650002101971650001501992650001102007650001702018650001402035650002502049650008402074650006502158650002902223650001702252650001802269650002402287650002402311650003802335650008602373650002502459700002202484700002402506700001902530773011302549852000902662856008502671655001202756IND4433031120221120172736.0100220s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443303112DNAL7 a199211822pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-009-2294-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalloo, Rajesh12aA downstream process for production of a viable and stable Bacillus cereus aquaculture biological agent  ap. 499-508.  aIncludes references  aBiological products offer advantages over chemotherapeutics in aquaculture. Adoption in commercial application is lacking due to limitations in process and product development that address key end user product requirements such as cost, efficacy, shelf life and convenience. In previous studies, we have reported on the efficacy, physiological robustness and low-cost spore production of a Bacillus cereus isolate (NRRL 100132). This study examines the development of suitable spore recovery, drying, formulation and tablet production from the fermentation product. Key criteria used for such downstream process unit evaluation included spore viability, recovery, spore balance, spore re-germination, product intermediate stability, end product stability and efficacy. A process flow sheet comprising vertical tube centrifugation, fluidised bed agglomeration and tablet pressing yielded a suitable product. The formulation included corn steep liquor and glucose to enhance subsequent spore re-germination. Viable spore recovery and spore balance closure across each of the process units was high (>70% and >99% respectively), with improvement in recovery possible by adoption of continuous processing at large scale. Spore re-germination was 97%, whilst a product half-life in excess of 5 years was estimated based on thermal resistance curves. The process resulted in a commercially attractive product and suitable variable cost of production. 3aBacillus cereus 3aaquaculture 3acentrifugation 3acontinuous systems 3acorn steep liquor 3adrying 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahalf life 3apressing 3aproduct development 3aproduction costs 3ashelf life 3aspores 3aunit process 3aviability 2aAquaculturexmethods 2aBacillus cereusxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aBiological Productsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFermentation 2aFreeze Drying 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aMicrobial Viability 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aSpores, Bacterialxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aZea maysxmetabolism1 aMaharajh, Dheepak1 aGörgens, Johann F.1 aGardiner, Neil0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Mar., v. 86, no. 2 p.499-508dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2294-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02502naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008000183300001600263500002400279520108700303650001901390650001001409650001801419650000701437650001501444650002801459650001701487650001101504650003101515650001301546650006701559650006601626650002401692650002301716650001501739700001901754700002201773700002401795700001801819773011301837852000901950856008501959655001202044IND4433029520221120172604.0100220s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443302952DNAL7 a200334022pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-009-2384-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Eng-Seng12aA standard quantitative method to measure acid tolerance of probiotic cells  ap. 385-391.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this work was to develop a standard quantitative method to measure the acid tolerance of probiotic cells when exposed to a simulated gastric fluid. Three model strains of different cell concentrations were exposed to a standard simulated gastric fluid of fixed volume. The fluid pH ranged from pH 1.5 to 2.5. In general, the death kinetics followed an exponential trend. The overall death constant, k d, for all strains was found to be in a power relationship with the pH value and the initial cell concentration, and it can be expressed as where k AII is defined as the acid intolerance indicator and N ₀ is the initial cell concentration (CFU/ml). This equation was validated with the experimental data with an average R ² of 0.98. The acid intolerance of cells can be quantitatively expressed by the k AII values, where higher value indicates higher intolerance. In conclusion, a standard quantitative method has been developed to measure the acid tolerance of probiotic cells. This could facilitate the selection of probiotic strains and processing technologies. 3aacid tolerance 3adeath 3agastric juice 3apH 3aprobiotics 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aGastric Acid 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLactobacillus acidophilusxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aLacticaseibacillus caseixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMicrobial Viability 2aModels, Biological 2aProbiotics1 aLee, Peh-Phong1 aPogaku, Ravindra.1 aKrishnaiah, Kamatan1 aVoo, Wan-Ping0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Mar., v. 86, no. 1 p.385-391dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2384-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03216naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015100170300001600321520203600337650002702373650001402400650001202414650001802426650002602444650001602470650001902486650002302505650001802528650001802546650001702564650001602581700002602597773017102623856005102794852000902845655001202854IND60523502020221120172559.0160621e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052350202DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-3122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Ellen W.10aOlder Adult Consumer Knowledge, Attitudes, and Self-Reported Storage Practices of Ready-to-Eat Food Products and Risks Associated with Listeriosis  ap. 263-272.  aConsumer implementation of recommended food safety practices, specifically relating to time and temperature control of ready-to-eat (RTE) food products associated with listeriosis are crucial. This is particularly the case for at-risk consumers such as older adults, given the increased listeriosis incidence reported internationally among adults aged ≥60 years. However, data detailing older adults' cognitive risk factors associated with listeriosis are lacking. Combining data about knowledge, self-reported practices, and attitudes can achieve a cumulative multilayered in-depth understanding of consumer food safety behavior and cognition. This study aims to ascertain older adults' cognition and behavior in relation to domestic food handling and storage practices that may increase the risks associated with L. monocytogenes. Older adults (≥60 years) (n = 100) participated in an interview and questionnaire to determine knowledge, self-reported practices, and attitudes toward recommended practices. Although the majority (79%) had positive attitudes toward refrigeration, 84% were unaware of recommended temperatures (5°C) and 65% self-reported “never” checking their refrigerator temperature. Although most (72%) knew that “use-by” dates indicate food safety and 62% reported “always” taking note, neutral attitudes were held, with 67% believing it was safe to eat food beyond use-by dates and 57% reporting doing so. Attitudes toward consuming foods within the recommended 2 days of opening were neutral, with 55% aware of recommendations and , 84% reporting that they consume RTE foods beyond recommendations. Although knowledgeable of some key practices, older adults self-reported potentially unsafe practices when storing RTE foods at home, which may increase risks associated with L. monocytogenes. This study has determined that older adults' food safety cognition may affect their behaviors; understanding consumer food safety cognition is essential for developing targeted food safety education. 3aattitudes and opinions 3acognition 3aelderly 3afood handling 3afood safety education 3alisteriosis 3aquestionnaires 3aready-to-eat foods 3arefrigeration 3arefrigerators 3arisk factors 3atemperature1 aRedmond, Elizabeth C.0 tJournal of food protection.g2016 Feb., v. 79, no. 2 p.263-272dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-312  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016600170300001600336520103300352650001901385650001601404650001201420650001401432650002001446650001801466650000901484650002001493700002201513700001601535700002601551773017101577856005101748852000901799655001201808IND60523502820221120172600.0160621e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052350282DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-3862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranssen, Frits10aQuality Control of Trichinella Testing at the Slaughterhouse Laboratory: Evaluation of the Use of a 400-Micrometer-Mesh-Size Sieve in the Magnetic Stirrer Method  ap. 316-320.  aThe performance of a 400-μm-mesh-size sieve (sieve400) has not previously been compared with that of a 180-μm-mesh-size sieve (sieve180). Using pork samples spiked with 0 to 10 Trichinella muscle larvae and an artificial digestion method, sieve performance was evaluated for control of Trichinella in meat-producing animals. The use of a sieve400 resulted in 12% lower larval counts, 147% more debris, and 28% longer counting times compared with the use of a sieve180. Although no false-negative results were obtained, prolonged counting times with the sieve400 may have an impact on performance in a high-throughput environment such as a slaughterhouse laboratory. Based on our results, the sieve180 remains the sieve of choice for Trichinella control in meat in slaughterhouse laboratories, according to the European Union reference method (European Commission regulation 2075/2005). Furthermore, the results of the present study contribute to the discussion of harmonization of meat inspection requirements among countries. 3aEuropean Union 3aTrichinella 3aanimals 3adigestion 3ameat inspection 3amuscle larvae 3apork 3aslaughterhouses1 aAndel, Esther van1 aSwart, Arno1 aGiessen, Joke van der0 tJournal of food protection.g2016 Feb., v. 79, no. 2 p.316-320dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-386  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245008800198300001800286506007600304520141800380506003701798650000801835650002201843650003601865650000901901650001301910650001101923650002501934650003901959650001401998650001102012650003702023700001502060700002002075700002102095773008202116852000902198856007802207939003302285946001102318655001202329IND4450955420221207115852.0110319e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445095542DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq8672doi7 aPMC30610762pmcid7 a211130232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrislan, Iztok10aKinetically governed polymorphism of d(G₄T₄G₃) quadruplexes in K⁺ solutions  ap. 1933-1942.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt has been generally recognized that understanding the molecular basis of some important cellular processes is hampered by the lack of knowledge of forces that drive spontaneous formation/disruption of G-quadruplex structures in guanine-rich DNA sequences. According to numerous biophysical and structural studies G-quadruplexes may occur in the presence of K⁺ and Na⁺ ions as polymorphic structures formed in kinetically governed processes. The reported kinetic models suggested to describe this polymorphism should be considered inappropriate since, as a rule, they include bimolecular single-step associations characterized by negative activation energies. In contrast, our approach in studying polymorphic behavior of G-quadruplexes is based on model mechanisms that involve only elementary folding/unfolding transitions and structural conversion steps that are characterized by positive activation energies. Here, we are investigating a complex polymorphism of d(G₄T₄G₃) quadruplexes in K⁺ solutions. On the basis of DSC, circular dichroism and UV spectroscopy and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments we propose a kinetic model that successfully describes the observed thermally induced conformational transitions of d(G₄T₄G₃) quadruplexes in terms of single-step reactions that involve besides single strands also one tetramolecular and three bimolecular quadruplex structures.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aactivation energy 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aions 3akinetics 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apotassium 3asodium 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aLah, Jurij1 aMilanic, Matija1 aVesnaver, Gorazd0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 5 p.1933-1942x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq8673Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110321  aNon-US 7aarticle02818naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002700179245011600206300001800322506007600340520132700416506003701743650000801780650000801788650001501796650002201811650001701833650001801850650001101868650002101879650002001900650002501920700002501945700001801970700001701988700001802005700001902023700002302042700002102065700002502086773008202111852000902193856007802202939003302280946001102313655001202324IND4450955120221207130410.0110319e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445095512DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq9052doi7 aPMC30610782pmcid7 a210713982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatkins, Norman E.

Thermodynamic parameters were obtained by fitting absorbance versus temperature profiles using the curve-fitting program MELTWIN: The weighted average thermodynamic data were fit using singular value decomposition to determine the eight non-unique nearest-neighbor parameters for each internal mismatch. The new parameters predict the ΔG°₃₇, ΔH° and melting temperature (Tm) of duplexes containing these single mismatches within an average of 0.33 kcal/mol, 4.5 kcal/mol and 1.4°C, respectively. The general trend in decreasing stability for the single internal mismatches is rG·dG > rU·dT > rA·dA > rC·dC.

Little is known about this phenomenon when using UV light treatments. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of strain (E. coli O157:H7 strains C7927, ATCC 35150, ATCC 43895, and ATCC 43889 and E. coli ATCC 25922) and physiological state (control-unadapted, acid adapted, and acid shocked) on the UV tolerance of E. coli in apple juice treated under conditions stipulated in current U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations. A greater than 5-log reduction of E. coli was obtained under all tested conditions. A significant effect of strain (P < 0.05) was observed, but the physiological state did not influence pathogen inactivation (P ≥ 0.05). The UV sensitivity of three spoilage microorganisms (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium commune, and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris) was also determined at UV doses of 0 to 98 mJ/cm2. Alicyclobacillus was the most UV sensitive, followed by Penicillium and Aspergillus. Because of the nonsignificant differences in UV sensitivity of E. coli in different physiological states, the use of an unadapted inoculum would be adequate to conduct challenge studies with the commercial UV unit used in this study at a UV dose of 14 mJ/cm2. The high UV tolerance of spoilage microorganisms supports the need to use a hurdle approach (e.g., coupling of refrigeration, preservatives, and/or other technologies) to extend the shelf life of UV-treated beverages. 3aAlicyclobacillus acidoterrestris 3aAspergillus niger 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aPenicillium commune 3aacid tolerance 3aapple juice 3abeverages 3aheat tolerance 3ainoculum 3apathogens 3aphysiological state 3apreservatives 3arefrigeration 3ashelf life 3aspoilage microorganisms 3aultraviolet radiation 3aUnited States1 aPadilla-Zakour, Olga I.1 aWorobo, Randy W.0 tJournal of food protection.g2016 Feb., v. 79, no. 2 p.294-298dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-080  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006300170300001600233520202800249650003302277650001102310650001302321650002202334650001102356650002202367650002702389650001302416650000902429650000802438650002102446650001502467650001002482650001602492651001802508700001902526700001702545773017102562856005102733852000902784655001202793IND60523502220221120141837.0160621e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052350222DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Kathryn10aCatering Gluten-Free When Simultaneously Using Wheat Flour  ap. 282-287.  aA European law on gluten-free (GF) labeling came into force in 2012, covering foods sold prepacked and in food service establishments, and a similar U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation covers GF labeling from August 2014. Gluten is found in the grains wheat, rye, and barley. A common source of gluten in the kitchen is wheat flour. This research aimed to determine variables that have a significant effect on gluten contamination in commercial kitchens when wheat flour is in use and to establish controls necessary to assure GF production. A pilot study was used to test the following hypotheses: (i) increasing duration of exposure to wheat flour would increase gluten contamination, (ii) increasing distance between the site of preparation and the site of wheat flour would reduce gluten contamination, (iii) the use of a ventilation hood would decrease gluten contamination, and (iv) the use of a barrier segregating the site of preparation of a GF meal and the use of wheat flour would decrease gluten contamination. Petri dishes containing GF rice pudding were placed in three directions at increasing distances (0.5 to 2 m) from a site of wheat flour use. A barrier was in place between a third of samples and the site of wheat flour. After wheat flour was handled for 0.5 and 4.0 h, petri dishes were sealed and the contents were analyzed for gluten. The experiment was duplicated with the ventilation hood on and off. The pilot study revealed that a distance of 2 m from the use of wheat flour was required to control gluten contamination at ≤20 ppm if wheat flour had been in use for 4.0 h. The identified control of distance was tested in five different study sites. In each of the study sites, a test meal was prepared a minimum of 2 m away from the site of wheat flour use. Although kitchens vary and must be considered individually, the established control of a minimum 2 m distance, along with good hygiene practices, was found to be effective in preparing GF meals at all five study sites. 3aFood and Drug Administration 3abarley 3acatering 3aexposure duration 3agluten 3agluten-free foods 3agood hygiene practices 3akitchens 3arice 3arye 3asite preparation 3atest meals 3awheat 3awheat flour 3aUnited States1 aMcGough, Norma1 aUrwin, Heidi0 tJournal of food protection.g2016 Feb., v. 79, no. 2 p.282-287dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-213  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009000184300001600274500002400290520151400314650002101828650001301849650002301862650001501885650001101900650001201911650002301923650001701946650001501963650002401978650001202002650001302014650001202027650002602039650001302065650001002078650001802088650001302106650003002119650003302149650002402182650001702206650003302223650002402256650002502280650002402305650002602329650002902355700001902384700001802403773010102421852000902522856008502531655001202616IND4433013820221120141839.0100220s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443301382DNAL7 a198987512pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-009-0159-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez, Ramon10aProduction of ethanol from thin stillage by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli  ap. 405-411.  aIncludes references  aThin stillage is a by-product generated in large amounts during the production of ethanol that is rich in carbon sources like glycerol, glucose and maltose. Unfortunately, the fermentation of thin stillage results in a mixture of organic acids and ethanol and minimum utilization of glycerol, the latter a compound that can represent up to 80% of the available substrates in this stream. We report here the efficient production of ethanol from thin stillage by a metabolically engineered strain of Escherichia coli. Simultaneous utilization of glycerol and sugars was achieved by overexpressing either the fermentative or the respiratory glycerol-utilization pathway. However, amplification of the fermentative pathway (encoded by gldA and dhaKLM) led to more efficient consumption of glycerol and promoted the synthesis of reduced products, including ethanol. A previously constructed strain, EH05, containing mutations that prevented the accumulation of competing by-products (i.e. lactate, acetate, and succinate) and overexpressing the fermentative pathway for glycerol utilization [i.e. strain EH05 (pZSKLMgldA)], efficiently converted thin stillage supplemented with only mineral salts to ethanol at yields close to 85% of the theoretical maximum. Ethanol accounted for about 90% (w/w) of the product mixture. These results, along with the comparable performance of strain EH05 (pZSKLMgldA) in 0.5 and 5 l fermenters, indicate a great potential for the adoption of this process by the biofuels industry. 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetates 3abioenergy industry 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afermenters 3agene overexpression 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3amaltose 3ametabolic engineering 3amutation 3asalts 3asuccinic acid 2aBiofuels 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aMaltosexmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aWaste Productsxanalysis1 aCampbell, Paul1 aWong, Matthew0 tBiotechnology letters.g2010 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.405-411dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-009-0159-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02351naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006500171300001600236520129500252650002301547650001301570650002201583650002301605650002201628650001101650650001501661650001501676651001001691700002401701700002301725773009401748852000901842856009201851939003301943946001301976655001201989IND4450959420221120141905.0110320e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445095942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01412.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTango, Toshiro12aA Space-Time Scan Statistic for Detecting Emerging Outbreaks  ap. 106-115.  aSummary As a major analytical method for outbreak detection, Kulldorff's space-time scan statistic (2001, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A 164, 61-72) has been implemented in many syndromic surveillance systems. Since, however, it is based on circular windows in space, it has difficulty correctly detecting actual noncircular clusters. Takahashi et al. (2008, International Journal of Health Geographics 7, 14) proposed a flexible space-time scan statistic with the capability of detecting noncircular areas. It seems to us, however, that the detection of the most likely cluster defined in these space-time scan statistics is not the same as the detection of localized emerging disease outbreaks because the former compares the observed number of cases with the conditional expected number of cases. In this article, we propose a new space-time scan statistic which compares the observed number of cases with the unconditional expected number of cases, takes a time-to-time variation of Poisson mean into account, and implements an outbreak model to capture localized emerging disease outbreaks more timely and correctly. The proposed models are illustrated with data from weekly surveillance of the number of absentees in primary schools in Kitakyushu-shi, Japan, 2006. 3aanalytical methods 3abiometry 3adisease outbreaks 3aelementary schools 3aemerging diseases 3amodels 3amonitoring 3astatistics 3aJapan1 aTakahashi, Kunihiko1 aKohriyama, Kazuaki0 tBiometrics.g2011 Mar., v. 67, no. 1 p.106-115dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01412.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110321  aOther US 7aarticle03123naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001800170245008100188300001800269500002400287520154100311650001601852650001601868650001601884650001601900650002001916650002101936650001901957650001001976650001701986650001302003650002302016650001902039650001102058650002002069650002002089650001302109650001202122650003802134650001602172650002802188650003202216650002002248650003202268650003802300651001302338700001702351773011302368852000902481856009102490655001202581IND4432911220221120152038.0100220s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443291122DNAL7 a200610032pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoonsaner, M.10aAccumulation of oxytetracycline and norfloxacin from saline soil by soybeans  ap. 1731-1737.  aIncludes references  aSoil of former shrimp aquaculture facilities in Thailand may be contaminated by antibiotics (e.g. oxytetracycline and norfloxacin) and have elevated salinity. Therefore, reuse of this land can be problematic. The utility of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) for phytoremediation was investigated. The rate of germination and seedling emergence in prepared contaminated soil (conductivity 17.7dSm⁻¹ from adding 70mg sodium chlorideg⁻¹ dry weight, 105mgkg⁻¹ dry weight oxytetracycline and 55mgkg⁻¹ dry weight norfloxacin) in sunlight was approximately 80% that of uncontaminated soil. This reduction was largely due to the high salinity. The antibiotics of interest degraded relatively rapidly in soil (half-life <10h for both) but loss was slower in deionised water. Accumulation of the antibiotics from deionised water by soybean resulted in little effect on growth rate and maximum levels in plants were observed after two days exposure, followed by declining concentrations. For soybean plants grown in saline soil, 90% removal of NaCl from soil adjacent to plant roots was observed, most within two days. Wilting and defoliation occurred, but plants recovered after 10days and maximum salt levels in plants exceeded 20,000mgg⁻¹ dry weight with translocation from root to shoot tissue noted. Soybean plants also accumulated the antibiotics from prepared contaminated saline soil, but translocation from the roots was not observed. The results showed that soybean can be valuable for phytoremediation in these situations. 3aGlycine max 3adefoliation 3agermination 3anorfloxacin 3aoxytetracycline 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3aroots 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3aseedling emergence 3ashrimp culture 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asolar radiation 3asoybeans 3awilting 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxmetabolism 2aGermination 2aNorfloxacinxmetabolism 2aOxytetracyclinexmetabolism 2aSodium Chloride 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aSoybeansxmetabolismxphysiology. 3aThailand1 aHawker, D.W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Mar. 1, v. 408, no. 7 p.1731-1737dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.12.0323Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01931naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009800170300001600268520097200284650002501256650002401281650001301305650000901318650001101327700001901338700001901357773009401376852000901470856009201479939003301571946001301604655001201617IND4450960620221120151938.0110320e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445096062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01407.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Chunpeng10aOn Sample Size of the Kruskal-Wallis Test with Application to a Mouse Peritoneal Cavity Study  ap. 213-224.  aSummary As the nonparametric generalization of the one-way analysis of variance model, the Kruskal-Wallis test applies when the goal is to test the difference between multiple samples and the underlying population distributions are nonnormal or unknown. Although the Kruskal-Wallis test has been widely used for data analysis, power and sample size methods for this test have been investigated to a much lesser extent. This article proposes new power and sample size calculation methods for the Kruskal-Wallis test based on the pilot study in either a completely nonparametric model or a semiparametric location model. No assumption is made on the shape of the underlying population distributions. Simulation results show that, in terms of sample size calculation for the Kruskal-Wallis test, the proposed methods are more reliable and preferable to some more traditional methods. A mouse peritoneal cavity study is used to demonstrate the application of the methods. 3aanalysis of variance 3aapplication methods 3abiometry 3amice 3amodels1 aZhang, Donghui1 aZhang, Cun-Hui0 tBiometrics.g2011 Mar., v. 67, no. 1 p.213-224dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01407.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110321  aOther US 7aarticle02522naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001500193245010500208300001400313506007600327520121600403506003701619650001301656650002201669650001501691650001301706650001401719650001101733650001401744650001301758650001801771650002401789700002501813700002301838773009201861852000901953856009201962939003302054946001302087655001202100IND4450960220221207102542.0110320e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445096022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01445.x2doi7 aPMC44584672pmcid7 a205609392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hui10aProportional Hazards Regression for the Analysis of Clustered Survival Data from Case-Cohort Studies  ap. 18-28.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSummary Case-cohort sampling is a commonly used and efficient method for studying large cohorts. Most existing methods of analysis for case-cohort data have concerned the analysis of univariate failure time data. However, clustered failure time data are commonly encountered in public health studies. For example, patients treated at the same center are unlikely to be independent. In this article, we consider methods based on estimating equations for case-cohort designs for clustered failure time data. We assume a marginal hazards model, with a common baseline hazard and common regression coefficient across clusters. The proposed estimators of the regression parameter and cumulative baseline hazard are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, and consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariance matrices are derived. The regression parameter estimator is easily computed using any standard Cox regression software that allows for offset terms. The proposed estimators are investigated in simulation studies, and demonstrated empirically to have increased efficiency relative to some existing methods. The proposed methods are applied to a study of mortality among Canadian dialysis patients.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiometry 3acomputer software 3acovariance 3adialysis 3aequations 3amodels 3amortality 3apatients 3apublic health 3aregression analysis1 aSchaubel, Douglas E.1 aKalbfleisch, J.

The best way for successful marketing is to offer products of superior quality and consistency. Quality is defined as conformance to a customer's price limited anticipated needs. The needs of customers are dynamic, so strategies must involve continuous improvement and decreasing variability. Agricultural production and marketing can be considered an industry, so appropriate industrial engineering (IE) techniques can be practiced for improving quality. It is necessary to control principal stages by following a systematic approach which includes: clearly defining specifications, providing measurement methods, and recording and analyzing data for decreasing variability through Statistical Process Control (SPC) technique. The prime method for controlling the quality of agricultural products as they flow through the marketing system is with statistically valid sampling at change-over points to determine if processes are in control and for identifying corrective actions. Flow chart techniques are very useful for selecting the best sampling points in the flow of fresh fruits and vegetables to market. Use of other SPC techniques may be considered such as: sampling plans, frequency distributions and histograms, graphs, Pareto analysis, cause and effect analysis, scatter diagrams, and charts. Results may be used for improving processes, corrective actions, or pricing decisions according to quality evaluation. 3afood production 3afood handling 3amethodology 0aquality standards 0aquality controls 0astatistical process control1 aPrussia, S.E.0 tJournal of food quality.g1990 June, v. 13, no. 3 p.171-184wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02928naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245014700186300001600333500002400349520126700373650001101640650001901651650001301670650002001683650002201703650001501725650001601740650001201756650002701768650004301795650003701838650001401875650004401889650005901933650003401992650005302026650001202079650002102091650001702112650002102129700002002150700002302170700002002193700001902213773008402232852000902316856008502325655001202410IND4432136520221120055850.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443213652DNAL7 a197638222pmid7 a10.1007/s10646-009-0409-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobos, Víctor M.10aVariation in plasma cholinesterase activity in the clay-colored robin (Turdus grayi) in relation to time of day, season, and diazinon exposure  ap. 267-272.  aIncludes references  aCholinesterase (ChE) activity in birds is subject to interspecific and intraspecific species variations. Factors that influence enzyme activity have to be taken into account in order to obtain an accurate estimation of cholinesterase inhibition due to pesticide exposure in wild birds. This study evaluates variation of plasma cholinesterase activity in clay-colored robin (Turdus grayi) in relation to time of day, season, and exposure to diazinon. Other variables that can affect cholinesterase activity such as weight are also taken into account. The birds were marked, weighed and sexed using the cloacal technique. One dose of commercial diazinon mixed with papaya was fed to each bird at concentrations of 0.0, 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg ai. The results showed differences in ChE activity between seasons (t = −3.07, P < 0.05). Also, diurnal plasma cholinesterase variations were observed (20% in 2 h). The highest inhibition values were 73% for birds dosed with 1.5 mg/kg ai. Our study provides field and laboratory data on variation of ChE activity in a tropical bird species. Knowledge of the variation of ChE in the clay-colored robin will enable us to use this species as an indicator of exposure to ChE inhibiting pesticides in tropical agroecosystems. 3aTurdus 3acholinesterase 3adiazinon 3aenzyme activity 3aindicator species 3awild birds 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aCholinesterasesxblood 2aDiazinonxbloodxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effects 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxbloodxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aEsterasesxbloodxmetabolism. 2aPesticide Residuesxbloodxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aSeasons 2aSongbirdsxblood 2aTime Factors 2aTropical Climate1 aMora, Miguel A.1 aEscalona, Griselda1 aCalmé, Sophie.1 aJiménez, Juan0 tEcotoxicology.g2010 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.267-272dSpringer USx0963-92927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-009-0409-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02975naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002300186245009000209300001600299500002400315506007600339520144300415506003701858650001401895650001501909650002501924650002101949650002401970650001501994650001802009650002202027650001002049650000902059650001202068650002002080650002802100650001102128650002102139650003902160650002902199700002302228700002602251773011002277852000902387856008502396655001202481IND4432131720221207102121.0100129s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443213172DNAL7 a200245812pmid7 aPMC28112462pmcid7 a10.1007/s00427-009-0310-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossmann, Daniela10aSeparable functions of wingless in distal and ventral patterning of the Tribolium leg  ap. 469-479.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe gene wingless (wg) in Drosophila is an important factor in leg development. During embryonic development wg is involved in the allocation of the limb primordia. During imaginal disk development wg is involved in distal development and it has a separate role in ventral development. The expression pattern of wg is highly conserved in all arthropods (comprising data from insects, myriapods, crustaceans, and chelicerates), suggesting that its function in leg development is also conserved. However, recent work in other insects (e.g. the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus) argued against a role of wg in leg development. We have studied the role of wg in leg development of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. Using stage-specific staggered embryonic RNAi in wild-type and transgenic EGFP expressing enhancer trap lines we are able to demonstrate separable functions of Tribolium wg in distal and in ventral leg development. The distal role affects all podomeres distal to the coxa, whereas the ventral role is restricted to cells along the ventral midline of the legs. In addition, severe leg defects after injection into early embryonic stages are evidence that wg is also involved in proximal development and limb allocation in Tribolium. Our data suggest that the roles of wg in leg development are highly conserved in the holometabolous insects. Further studies will reveal the degree of conservation in other arthropod groups.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrustacea 3aDrosophila 3aOncopeltus fasciatus 3aRNA interference 3aTribolium castaneum 3aarthropods 3aembryogenesis 3aenhancer elements 3agenes 3alegs 2aAnimals 2aBody Patterning 2aExtremitiesxembryology 2aFemale 2aRNA Interference 2aTriboliumxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aWnt1 Proteinxmetabolism1 aScholten, Johannes1 aPrpic, Nikola-Michael0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2009 Oct., v. 219, no. 9-10 p.469-479dSpringer-Verlagx0949-944X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-009-0310-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02808naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014500182300001600327500002400343520130100367650001301668650001301681650001401694650001101708650001801719650002601737650001201763650001801775650002401793650001201817650002501829650002801854650003801882650003201920650004001952650002301992700002002015700001902035700002602054700001902080700002302099773011002122852000902232856008502241655001202326IND4432132020221120055714.0100129s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443213202DNAL7 a200432302pmid7 a10.1007/s00427-009-0313-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoehler, Anne10aMolecular evolution of SPARC: absence of the acidic module and expression in the endoderm of the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis  ap. 509-521.  aIncludes references  aThe matricellular glycoprotein SPARC is composed of three functional domains that are evolutionarily conserved in organisms ranging from nematodes to mammals: a Ca²⁺-binding glutamic acid-rich acidic domain at the N-terminus (domain I), a follistatin-like module (domain II), and an extracellular Ca²⁺-binding (EC) module that contains two EF-hands and two collagen-binding epitopes (domain III). We report that four SPARC orthologs (designated nvSPARC1-4) are expressed by the genome of the starlet anemone Nematostella vectensis, a diploblastic basal cnidarian composed of an ectoderm and endoderm separated by collagen-based mesoglea. We also report that domain I is absent from all N. vectensis SPARC orthologs. In situ hybridization data indicate that N. vectensis SPARC mRNAs are restricted to the endoderm during post-gastrula development. The absence of the Ca²⁺-binding N-terminal domain in cnidarians and conservation of collagen-binding epitopes suggests that SPARC first evolved as a collagen-binding matricellular glycoprotein, an interaction likely to be dependent on the binding of Ca²⁺-ions to the two EF-hands in the EC domain. We propose that further Ca²⁺-dependent activities emerged with the acquisition of an acidic N-terminal module in triplobastic organisms. 3aCnidaria 3aepitopes 3aevolution 3agenome 3aglycoproteins 3ain situ hybridization 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOsteonectinxchemistryxgenetics. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSea Anemonesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment1 aDesser, Sherwin1 aChang, Belinda1 aMacDonald, Jacqueline1 aTepass, Ulrich1 aRinguette, Maurice0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2009 Oct., v. 219, no. 9-10 p.509-521dSpringer-Verlagx0949-944X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-009-0313-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02157naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007000167300001600237500002400253520131800277650001201595650001501607650001201622700002201634700001901656773011001675852000901785856008501794655001201879IND4432114920221120050452.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443211492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-009-0865-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranks, Daniel W.10aSampling animal association networks with the gambit of the group  ap. 493-503.  aIncludes references  aEcologists increasingly use network theory to examine animal association patterns. The gambit of the group (GoG) is a simple and useful assumption for accumulating the data necessary for a network analysis. The gambit of the group implies that each animal in a group is associating with every other individual in that group. Sampling is an important issue for networks in wild populations collected assuming GoG. Due to time, effort, and resource constraints and the difficulty of tracking animals, sampled data are usually a subset of the actual network. Ecologists often use association indexes to calculate the frequency of associations between individuals. These indexes are often transformed by applying a filter to produce a binary network. We explore GoG sampling using model networks. We examine assortment at the level of the group by a single dichotomous trait, along with many other network measures, to examine the effect of different sampling regimes, and choice of filter on the accuracy and precision with which measures are estimated. We find strong support for the use of weighted, rather than filtered, network measures and show that different filters have different effects depending on the nature of the sampling. We make several practical recommendations for ecologists planning GoG sampling. 3aanimals 3aecologists 3afilters1 aRuxton, Graeme D.1 aJames, Richard0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2010 Jan., v. 64, no. 3 p.493-503dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-009-0865-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02954naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002800186245014000214300001600354500002400370506007600394520171000470506003702180650002502217650001002242650001702252650001202269650001302281650001802294700001602312700002602328700002202354773011002376852000902486856008502495655001202580IND4432114120221207102131.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443211412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-009-0857-82doi7 aPMC28103682pmcid7 a201194882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRipmeester, Erwin A.

Habitat-related variation between populations in particular can reflect adaptations to the environment accumulated over generations, but this may not always be the case. In this study, we test whether variation between individuals matches local conditions with respect to noise level and territory density to examine whether short-term flexibility could contribute to song divergence at the population level. We conducted a case study on an urban and forest population of the European blackbird and show divergence at the population level (i.e. across habitats) in blackbird song, anthropogenic noise level and territory density. Unlike in several other species, we found a lack of any correlation at the individual level (i.e. across individuals) between song features and ambient noise. This suggests species-specific causal explanations for noise-dependent song differentiation which are likely associated with variation in song-copying behaviour or feedback constraints related to variable singing styles. On the other hand, we found that at the level of individual territories, temporal features, but not spectral ones, are correlated to territory density and seasonality. This suggests that short-term individual variation can indeed contribute to habitat-dependent divergence at the population level. As this may undermine the potential role for song as a population marker, we conclude that more investigations on individual song flexibility are required for a better understanding of the impact of population-level song divergence on hybridisation and speciation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal communication 3abirds 3acase studies 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahybridization1 aKok, Jet S.1 avan Rijssel, Jacco C.1 aSlabbekoorn, Hans0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2010 Jan., v. 64, no. 3 p.409-418dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-009-0857-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02375naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008400168300001600252500002400268520141000292650001901702650001101721650000901732650001501741650001501756650001201771650001401783700002301797700002501820773011001845852000901955856008501964655001202049IND4432114220221120050438.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443211422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-009-0858-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapman, Nadine C.10aWorker reproductive parasitism and drift in the western honeybee Apis mellifera  ap. 419-427.  aIncludes references  aWhen a honeybee (Apis spp.) colony loses its queen and is unable to rear a new one, some of the workers activate their ovaries and produce eggs. When a colony has a queen (i.e., it is queenright) almost all worker-laid eggs are eaten, but when hopelessly queenless, the workers become more tolerant of worker-laid eggs and rear some of them to adult drones. This increased tolerance renders a queenless colony vulnerable to worker reproductive parasitism, wherein unrelated workers enter the colony and lay eggs. Here, we show that the proportion of unrelated (non-natal) workers significantly decreases after an Apis mellifera colony becomes queenless. The remaining non-natal workers are as likely to have activated ovaries as natal workers, yet they produce more eggs than natal workers, resulting in significantly higher reproductive success for non-natal workers. In a second experiment, we provided queenless and queenright workers with a choice to remain in their own colony or to join a queenless or queenright colony nearby. The experiment was set up such that worker movement was unlikely to be due to simple orientation errors. Very few workers joined another colony, and there was no preference for workers to drift into or out of queenless or queenright colonies, in accordance with the proportion of non-natal workers declining significantly after becoming queenless in the first experiment. 3aApis mellifera 3aadults 3aeggs 3ahoney bees 3aparasitism 3arearing 3arendering1 aBeekman, Madeleine1 aOldroyd, Benjamin P.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2010 Jan., v. 64, no. 3 p.419-427dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-009-0858-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02180naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001200164245011800176300001800294500002400312520086800336650002201204650001701226650002001243650001101263650002201274650002701296650002501323650001101348650004801359650003801407650002301445650004201468700001701510700001301527700001901540773011701559852000901676856008501685655001201770IND4432462820221120050531.0100205s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443246282DNAL7 a193472662pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-009-8598-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xin10aDetermination of Cytochrome c in Human Serum and Pharmaceutical Injections Using Flow Injection Chemiluminescence  ap. 1065-1073.  aIncludes references  aIt was found that the complex of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and hydrogen peroxide could significantly catalyze the chemiluminescence (CL) reaction from luminol-hydrogen peroxide, and a sensitive, rapid, and simple CL procedure was proposed for the determination of Cyt c in a flow injection system for the first time. The increment of CL intensity was linear over the concentration of Cyt c ranging from 5 to 700 ng ml⁻¹, with a detection limit of 2 ng ml⁻¹ (3σ). At a flow rate of 2.0 ml min⁻¹, a complete analytical process could be performed in 30 s with a relative standard deviation of less than 4.0%. The proposed method was applied successfully for the assay of Cyt c in pharmaceutical injections and human serum, and the recoveries were from 98.0% to 108.8% and 92.5% to 109.0%.

The immobilized enzyme activity around 250 UApp was obtained with the ligand such as proline, tryptophan, casein acid hydrolysate, and brilliant green. Comparatively, proline showed less IMY% (percentage immobilization yield—58) but higher RTA% (percentage of activity retention—71) and specific activity (145 UApp g⁻¹). However, the crosslinked preparation of brilliant green obtained using glutaraldehyde showed 82 ± 2.7% immobilized enzyme activity after the completion of successive five cycles. In comparison with the free enzyme, the enzyme immobilized on the brilliant green coupled membrane showed around 2.4-fold increase in K m value (47.4 mM) as well as similar optimum pH (7.2) and temperature (40 °C). The immobilized enzyme retained almost 50% activity after 107 days and 50 cycles of operation. Almost 50% decrease in buffer flux after enzyme immobilization was observed. At the end of the 30 cycles, flux pattern shows around 38% decrease in buffer flux however, after 16 cycles of operation flux moves closer towards the steady state. 3aamidase 3abenzylpenicillin 3acasein 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme activity 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrolysates 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apH 3aproline 3atemperature 3atryptophan 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aEnzymes, Immobilizedxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixenzymology 2aMembranes, Artificial 2aPenicillin Amidasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPorosity 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxchemistry1 aThakar, D.

As expected by analogy to previously sequenced alphacryptoviruses, dsRNA1 (2008 bp) encodes a 72.5-kDa protein containing sequence motifs characteristic for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). In addition to the full-length dsRNA1, a truncated form was also detected in dsRNA extracts. dsRNA2 (1783 bp) codes for the viral coat protein (CP) as proven by the identity of the predicted CP sequence to peptide sequences of the purified virion protein. The amino acid sequence of BCV1 RdRp as well as the 5′- and 3′-UTRs show 81-85% identity to the corresponding regions of Vicia cryptic virus (VCV), White clover cryptic virus 1 (WCCV1) and Carrot cryptic virus (CaCV). The amino acid sequence identity of the CP is about 55-62%, moreover, a strong conservation of predicted α-helical regions was observed. The high degree of similarity of these seed- and pollen-transmitted viruses persisting in phylogenetically distant hosts, together with their high similarity to fungal partitiviruses strongly supports the hypothesis that horizontal transfer by a fungus played a role in the emergence of the present cryptovirus species. The change in the distribution of cryptic viruses may also be due to human influence: While earlier BCV1 occurred frequently in sugar beet cultivars, it is very rare in cultivars currently used in agricultural practice and was detected in only one of the 28 cultivars investigated in our experiments. 3aBeet cryptic virus 1 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aVicia cryptic virus 3aWhite clover cryptic virus 1 3aamino acid sequences 3acarrots 3acultivars 3adouble-stranded RNA 3afungi 3agenome 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3asugar beet 3avirion 3aviruses 2a3' Untranslated Regions 2a5' Untranslated Regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBeta vulgarisxvirology 2aCapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aCluster Analysis 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Virusesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexgenetics. 2aRNA Virusesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid1 aEnünlü, Natalya1 aDeshmukh, Sachin D.1 aVeliceasa, Dorina1 aHunyadi-Gulyás, Éva1 aKühne, Thomas.1 aIlyés, Pál1 aPotyondi, László1 aMedzihradszky, Katalin1 aLukács, Noémi0 tVirus genes.g2010 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.267-276dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-009-0432-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02837naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012700186300001600313520152200329650001301851650001201864650001601876650001401892650001001906650001301916650001201929650001201941650001301953650001701966653002201983653002302005653006102028700002802089700002402117773013502141852000902276856008602285930003302371946001102404655001202415IND4391170120221120024635.0070506e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439117012DNAL7 a168687302pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0578-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, Luís R. 10aDual nebulizer sample introduction system for simultaneous determination of volatile elemental hydrides and other elements  ap. 188-195.  aA dual sample introduction system was explored for volatile hydride generation in inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) performed in the radially viewed mode. The system consists of two pneumatic nebulizers connected to the conventional spray chamber of the instrument via a simple adaptor. This configuration permits hydride generation but still allows other elements to be determined by pneumatic nebulization. This work was focused on the optimization of the plasma operating conditions for the determination of As, Hg, Sb and Se and other elements. The excitation conditions of the ICP-OES instrument operated with the dual sample introduction system were also explored. Results showed that the analytical performance of the dual system for the determination of As, Hg, Sb and Se was superior to those of conventional nebulization systems. The dual system also enabled the determination of elements that do not form volatile hydrides, but with less sensitivity than conventional nebulization systems. An evaluation of the plasma robustness showed that the gases generated in the hydride reactions did not significantly affect the plasma discharge. Similar to conventional hydride generation techniques, the analysis was susceptible to nonspectroscopic interferences produced by transition metals. Finally, the applicability of the dual nebulization system to practical ICP-OES studies was demonstrated by determining the trace elements in an oyster tissue standard reference material. 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3aatomization 3aatomizers 3agases 3ahydrides 3amercury 3aoysters 3aselenium 3aspectroscopy 0aDual nebulization 0aHydride generation 0aInductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry1 aMárquez, Gracybell D. 1 aChirinos, José R. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 Sept., v. 386, no. 1 p.188-195dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0578-z3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03331naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003200164245007700196300001600273520178400289650002302073650001202096650001002108650002902118650001802147650002602165650001502191650001402206650005302220650005602273650005202329650003502381650004302416650002402459650003902483653001702522653001202539700001802551700001902569773013402588852000902722856008602731930003302817946001102850655001202861IND4391173420221120024549.0070506e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439117342DNAL7 a170726012pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0849-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Martínez, M. A. 10aOptical immunosensors for environmental monitoring: How far have we come  ap. 205-218.  aImmunosensing has proved to be a very interesting research area. This review discusses what has actually been achieved in the field of optical immunosensing for environmental screening, and what still needs to be done. The review is presented from a practical point of view. In terms of the basic design of the immunosensor, there is a trend towards decreasing assay time; indeed, this has been reduced from 15-20 minutes to less than 5 minutes. Another goal is to simplify the manifold, and label-free approaches combining indirect assay formats and the detection of antibody binding are popular. Rapid displacement assays have also been investigated thoroughly. In terms of some important features of immunosensing devices, the reusability of the sensing element has been studied in great depth, and working lifetimes of more than five hundred assays can now be found for all assay formats. Multianalyte assays are now being investigated, and current systems are able to monitor 2-3 target compounds, although this number is set to increase greatly (to >30) in the near future. In this sense, an increasing number of publications can be found on microarrays intended for multianalyte determinations. The application of immunosensing to real situations is the main challenge. Immunosensors are barely commercialized and are yet to be established as research or routine tools, due to a lack of validated protocols for a wide range of sample matrices. Regarding compounds considered as analytes, some significant pollutants such as dioxins or pharmaceuticals are rarely chosen as targets, although the current tendency is towards a broader spectrum of analytes. New immunoreagents should be raised for these compounds, for use in immunosensors that can be used as screening tools. 3aantibody detection 3adioxins 3adrugs 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aimmunosensors 3amicroarray technology 3apollutants 3ascreening 2aBiosensing Techniquesxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisximmunology. 2aHaptensxanalysisximmunology. 2aImmunoassayxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aPhotometryxmethods 2aSurface Plasmon Resonancexmethods 0aImmunosensor 0aOptical1 aPuchades, R. 1 aMaquieira, A. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Jan., v. 387, no. 1 p.205-218dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0849-83Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03702naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174072001700191100002200208245015700230300001800387500001500405520164000420650001702060650001702077650002302094650002202117650003202139650001602171650002302187650002802210650002002238650001402258650001302272650001402285650002202299650001002321650002002331650001702351650003002368650001202398650005002410650002202460650001302482650003202495650003202527650005002559650002702609650003802636650005402674653002602728700001802754700002002772773009202792852000902884856007802893930003302971945002503004946001103029655001203040IND4376293620141222000000.0051127e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437629362DNAL7 a162639022pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri3182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHöglund, Solveig10aBoth hypersensitive and non-hypersensitive responses are associated with resistance in Salix viminalis against the gall midge Dasineura marginemtorquens  ap. 3215-3222.  a2019-12-04  aHypersensitivity responses (HR) play a major role in plant resistance to pathogens. It is often claimed that HR is also important in plant resistance to insects, although there is little unambiguous documentation. Large genotypic variation in resistance against the gall midge Dasineura marginemtorquens is found in Salix viminalis. Variation in larval performance and induced responses within a full-sib S. viminalis family is reported here; 36 sibling plants were completely resistant (larvae died within 48 h after egg hatch, no gall induction), 11 plants were totally susceptible, 25 plants were variable (living and dead larvae present on the same plant). Resistance was associated with HR, but to different degrees; 21 totally resistant genotypes showed typical HR symptoms (many distinct necrotic spots) whereas the remaining 15 genotypes showed no, or very few, such symptoms. Hydrogen peroxide, used as a marker for HR, was induced in genotypes expressing HR symptoms but not in resistant genotypes without symptoms, or in susceptible genotypes. These data suggest that production of hydrogen peroxide, and accompanying cell death, cannot explain larval mortality in the symptomless reaction. Another, as yet unknown, mechanism of resistance may be present. If so, then it is possible that this unknown mechanism also contributes to resistance in plants displaying HR. The apparent complexity observed in this interaction, with both visible and invisible plant responses associated with resistance against an adapted insect species, may have implications for the study of resistance factors in other plant-insect interactions. 3ainsect pests 3aforest trees 3agenetic resistance 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aplant pests 3alarval development 3ahypersensitive response 3aSalix viminalis 3amortality 3agenotype 3aDasineura 3agenetic variation 3agalls 3apest resistance 3aforest pests 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aDipteraxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHydrogen Peroxidexanalysis 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxchemistry. 2aPlant Tumorsxetiology 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxanalysis 2aSalixxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsximmunology. 0aresistance mechanisms1 aLarsson, Stig1 aWingsle, Gunnar0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Dec., v. 56, no. 422 p.3215-3222x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri3183Available from publisher's Web site  a20060203b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03497naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157100001600174245010400190300001800294520145000312650002801762650001901790650001901809650001801828650002501846650001701871650001701888650002601905650002201931650002001953650002501973650001301998650002502011650003202036650002902068650002602097650002502123650003402148650003602182650004002218650004202258650002902300650004202329650003802371650005202409650003202461650002802493650003702521700001702558700001802575700001802593773009202611852000902703856007802712930003302790945002502823946001102848655001202859IND4376293720221120024427.0051127e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437629372DNAL7 a162639012pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri3192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhou, Biyan10aNitric oxide is involved in abscisic acid-induced antioxidant activities in Stylosanthes guianensis  ap. 3223-3228.  aPrevious studies suggest that abscisic acid (ABA) stimulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes under normal and chilling temperature and enhanced chilling resistance in Stylosanthes guianensis. The objective of this study was to test whether nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the ABA-induced activities of the antioxidant enzymes in Stylosanthes guianensis due to its nature as a second messenger in stress responses. Plants were treated with NO donors, ABA, ABA in combination with NO scavengers or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor and their effects on the activity of antioxidant enzymes and NO production were compared. The results showed that ABA increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). The effect of ABA on antioxidant enzyme activities was suppressed by the NOS inhibitor, N[superscript [omega]]-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), and the NO scavenger, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl3-oxide (PTIO). NO content increased after 5 h of ABA treatment. The NO-scavenger, PTIO, and the NOS-inhibitor, L-NNA, inhibited the accumulation of NO in ABA-treated Stylosanthes guianensis. NO donor treatment enhanced the activities of SOD, CAT, and APX. The results suggested that NO was involved in the ABA-induced activities of SOD, CAT, and APX in Stylosanthes guianensis. ABA triggered NO production that may lead to the stimulation of antioxidant enzyme activities. 3aStylosanthes guianensis 3aforage legumes 3apasture plants 3aabscisic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3anitric oxide 3aantioxidants 3anitric oxide synthase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzyme activity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aAscorbate Peroxidases 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aCyclic N-Oxidesxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFabaceaexdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aFree Radical Scavengersxpharmacology 2aImidazolesxpharmacology 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aNitric Oxide Donorsxpharmacology 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aNitroargininexpharmacology 2aPeroxidasesxmetabolism 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism1 aGuo, Zhenfei1 aXing, Jinpeng1 aHuang, Bingru0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Dec., v. 56, no. 422 p.3223-3228x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri3193Available from publisher's Web site  a20060202b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03118naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100002300193245010600216300001600322500002400338500001500362520158800377650002001965650001401985650002101999650002402020650001902044650002302063650002402086650002002110650002802130650002402158650002602182650002502208650001202233651001202245653001802257653002902275700002202304773009602326852000902422856008802431930003302519945002502552946001102577655001202588IND4411220020221122042750.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441122002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ700 0aJ100 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aB2001 aSimmons, Breana L.10aMicrobial community response to transition from conventional to conservation tillage in cotton fields  ap. 518-528.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the southeastern United States, conservation tillage techniques are used to conserve soil nutrients and structure, providing habitat and substrate for biota, which are largely responsible for the mineralization of nutrients in the soil. A deterrent for growers considering the transition to conservation tillage is the delay in soil response (e.g. increased soil carbon, efficient nutrient cycling, impacts on yield) associated with the equilibration of the soil food web. The objective of this study was to determine if the microbial community composition and biomass changed with transition to conservation tillage. Soils sampled from five sites, representing a chronosequence of conservation tillage (from conventionally tilled to 30 year no-till), were collected for fatty acid analysis. Microbial communities were significantly different among sites. Fungi, characterized by 18:2ω6, 18:1ω9, and 18:3ω6c fatty acids, were typically lowest in the conventionally tilled soil, probably due to repeated disruption of the fungal hyphae associated with tillage. In all soils, soil nutrient concentrations, moisture and microarthropod abundance were correlated with microbial structure. Plots in conservation tillage were significantly different from the conventionally tilled plots, but did not exhibit a clear linear pattern across the chronosequence. This evidence that belowground food webs can respond quickly to a cessation in tillage suggests that the delay in soil response may be due more to the time required to build organic matter than to a slow response by the biota. 3asoil arthropods 3afood webs 3anitrogen content 3acommunity structure 3asoil nutrients 3asoil water content 3asoil organic matter 3aair temperature 3adry matter accumulation 3asoil microorganisms 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aconservation tillage 3abiomass 3aGeorgia 0aprecipitation 0afatty acid methyl esters1 aColeman, David C.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2008 Nov., v. 40, no. 3 p.518-528dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.08.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090414b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/04/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02983naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100001800199245009100217300001600308500002400324520146200348650002201810650001701832650002201849650001101871650001601882650001301898650002001911650001901931650002401950650002601974650001602000650001102016650002802027650002602055650002102081651001202102653002902114700002202143773011302165852000902278856008502287930003302372945002502405946001102430655001202441IND4411221820221122042716.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441122182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2008.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF500 0aF120 0aJ500 0aX100 0aX6201 aMistele, Bodo10aEstimating the nitrogen nutrition index using spectral canopy reflectance measurements  ap. 184-190.  aIncludes references  aSpectral measurements are useful for estimating the nitrogen status of crops, thereby enabling site-specific fertilizing in precision farming systems. To date, however, spectral information was associated primarily to nitrogen (N) uptake or to chlorophyll content per unit area, but using it to determine the effective nitrogen (N) need of a crop requires additional information given that N uptake increases with canopy development. The nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) describes the nitrogen status of the entire crop directly, analogous to what the SPAD meter does on the leaf level. The index is the ratio between the actual nitrogen content of the crop and the critical content indicating the minimum N content required for the maximum biomass production of a canopy. As such, the index indicates whether the N content is higher or lower than the optimum level for a specific crop biomass and so matches the exact needs of the farmer. We examine the relationship between the NNI and the canopy reflectance intensity (CRI) as a prelude to their use in a site-specific farming framework. The NNI/CRI correlation was validated in a three-year field experiment with winter wheat with an overall average R ² of 0.95. The NNI was more closely correlated with the CRI than with any of total aerial N, N content or biomass dry weight. As such, it appears that the NNI can indeed be determined in a rapid, cost-effective fashion using spectra-based measurements. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3aspectral analysis 3acanopy 3areflectance 3anitrogen 3aplant nutrition 3aremote sensing 3amathematical models 3aprecision agriculture 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 3adry matter accumulation 3afield experimentation 3amodel validation 3aGermany 0anitrogen nutrition index1 aSchmidhalter, Urs0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2008 Nov., v. 29, no. 4 p.184-190dElsevier Science Pub.

The investigation of the Danish experiment concerned two crop rotations (continuous winter wheat cropping, 'FR 1'; winter oilseed rape-winter wheat-winter wheat-winter barley, 'FR 2'), three intensities of soil tillage (ploughing, 'P'; tine tillage 'H₈₋₁₀'; direct drilling, 'D') and three target control levels against Apera spica-venti (untreated, 'AU'; 70% control, 'A 70%'; and 90% control, 'A 90%'), whilst the German experiment comprised one arable crop rotation (winter oilseed rape-winter wheat-winter rye-peas-winter wheat-winter barley, 'DR 1') and one fodder crop rotation (winter oilseed rape-winter barley-alfalfa/clover/grass-mixture-winter rye-silage maize-winter wheat, 'DR 2') each crop with situation-related pesticide use (100% HF) or application rates reduced by 50% (50% HF). At both sites, rotations and treatments were located on the same plots in each year. The study comprises the harvest years 2003-2006. Humus requirement could be covered in all crop rotations, while humus replacement rate was highest in 'FR 1'. Total yield potential of the crop rotations was expressed by grain equivalent (GE) yields and energy output. The different crop rotations influenced yield potential to a larger extent than pesticide use intensity or tillage. The average GE yields and energy outputs of 'FR 1' (83.5GEha⁻¹; 121.7GJha⁻¹) were significantly higher compared with 'FR 2' (64.2GEha⁻¹; 93.2GJha⁻¹); 'DR 2' (72.9GEha⁻¹; 192.3GJha⁻¹) exceeded 'DR 1' (70.0GEha⁻¹; 100.3GJha⁻¹). Higher N surpluses were found for the Danish crop rotations than for the German experiment, probably due to the relatively low N use efficiency of pig slurry, which was applied to each crop in 'FR 1' and 'FR 2'. Averaged across all treatments, N surplus for 'FR 1', 'FR 2', 'DR 1', and 'DR 2' were 72.9, 94.4, 32.0, and 38.2kgNha⁻¹, respectively. Similar to yield, energy efficiency at both sites was noteworthy affected by crop rotation and minor by pesticide use intensity or tillage. The risk potential due to pesticide application was low in all treatments. 3ainput output analysis 3aweed control 3aforage crops 3anutrient use efficiency 3anitrogen 3atillage 3aenergy use and consumption 3asoil organic matter 3acrop yield 3agrass weeds 3aenvironmental impact 3acase studies 3acrop rotation 3aapplication rate 3apesticides 3apig manure 3aGermany 3aDenmark 0afield crops 0ayield potential1 aPallutt, B.1 aMelander, B.1 aStrassemeyer, J.1 aChristen, O.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2008 Nov., v. 29, no. 4 p.191-199dElsevier Science Pub.

Two-dimensional correlation analysis was applied to the identification and interpretation of specific spectral changes associated to the evolution of the system. The technique allows us to observe an extensive protein translocation, which we interpret as arising from the release of transducin from the disk membrane and its redistribution from the outer segment towards the inner segment of rod cells. These results are in full agreement with our current understanding of retinal physiology and validate the technique as a useful tool for the study of complex molecular processes in intact tissue.

In this paper we investigated the impact of long-term elevated CO₂ on soil nitrification and soil AOB community composition. Soil samples were taken from Hakanoa natural CO₂ springs, Kamo, Northland, New Zealand. This site has been exposed to elevated CO₂ for several decades. Soils were collected from different points near to CO₂-emitting vents where the CO₂ concentration at canopy height had been characterised. Nitrification activity was measured using a short-term nitrification assay, and AOB community composition was characterised using polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A principal component analysis of the DGGE banding pattern was carried out to identify the effect of CO₂ on AOB community composition. Soil nitrification activity was markedly decreased with increasing CO₂. The variation in DGGE banding patterns revealed differences in the composition of the soil AOB community that were related to CO₂ concentration. Principal component analysis showed that the changes in community composition and nitrifying activity were linked and that these changes were related to atmospheric CO₂ concentration. 3aammonia 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3along term effects 3anitrification 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3aoxidation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil sampling 3aNew Zealand 0aelevated CO₂ 0aammonia oxidising bacteria 0anatural CO₂ springs 0aDGGE1 aCarran, R.

Talebi10aEffect of treated zeolite, iron waste, and liming on phytoavailability of Zn, Cu, and Ni in long-term biosolids-amended soils  ap. 509-516.  aTwo metal-contaminated biosolids-amended soils (moderately and highly contaminated) from the Bromley Sewage Treatment Farm, Christchurch, New Zealand, were used to evaluate the effect of remedial treatments on Ni, Zn, and Cu phytoavailability to sunflower (Helianthus annus L.). Two different chemical treatments (iron waste and treated zeolite), at 2 rates of application (5% and 10% w/w), in combination with 3 rates of a liming material (Ca(OH)₂ at 0%, 0.33%, and 0.66% w/w) were evaluated for their metal remediation potential using pot experiments. Under the moderately acidic pH conditions of the original soils (pH 5.4-5.7), neither of the materials had substantial effects on plant metal concentrations, and the application of treated zeolite resulted in a large decrease in plant yield (>60% reduction). However, in the presence of Ca(OH)₂, both materials showed some potential for reducing Ni and Zn concentrations in sunflowers compared with Ca(OH)₂ alone. The best combinations of zeolite or iron waste with Ca(OH)₂ resulted in reductions in shoot Ni concentrations to below the detection limit. For Zn, the best combinations of materials resulted in reductions in sunflower shoot Zn concentrations of 91% for the moderately contaminated soil and 75% for the highly contaminated soil. Combinations of iron waste and Ca(OH)₂ in particular resulted in substantial decreases in soluble soil Zn concentrations (>90% reduction) and increases in plant yield (63% increase for highly contaminated soil), attributed to the remediation of Zn toxicity. There was little effect of any treatment on Cu concentration in the sunflower plants. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aapplication rate 3acalcium hydroxide 3achemical treatment 3acopper 3adetection limit 3afarms 3aliming 3aliming materials 3anickel 3apH 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3asewage treatment 3atoxicity 3awastes 3azeolites 3azinc 3aNew Zealand1 aMcLaren, R.G.1 aAdams, J.A.0 tSoil research.g2008, v. 46, no. 7 p.509-516dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-95737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR080923Available from publisher's Web site  a20081014b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02510naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245007500192300001600267520106100283650001901344650002001363650001501383650002201398650001801420650001801438653004901456653001901505653001701524653001901541653002101560653004901581653001901630653001701649653001901666653002101685700001701706700002701723700001801750773013401768852000901902856008501911930003301996946001102029655001202040IND4399665320221122003904.0080106e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439966532DNAL7 a179240972pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1644-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGünther-Leopold, Ines 10aCharacterization of nuclear fuels by ICP mass-spectrometric techniques  ap. 503-510.  aIsotopic analyses of radioactive materials such as irradiated nuclear fuel are of major importance for the optimization of the nuclear fuel cycle and for safeguard aspects. Among the mass-spectrometric techniques available, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry are the most frequently applied methods for nuclear applications. Because of the low detection limits, the ability to analyze the isotopic composition of the elements and the applicability of the techniques for measuring stable as well as radioactive nuclides with similar sensitivity, both mass-spectrometric techniques are an excellent amendment to classical radioactivity counting methods. The paper describes selected applications of multicollector ICP-MS in combination with chromatographic separation techniques and laser ablation for the isotopic analysis of irradiated nuclear fuels. The advantages and limitations of the selected analytical technique for the characterization of such a heterogeneous sample matrix are discussed. 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear fuels 3aradionuclides 0aInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aLaser ablation 0aNuclear fuel 0aIsotope ratios 0aFission products 0aInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aLaser ablation 0aNuclear fuel 0aIsotope ratios 0aFission products1 aKivel, Niko 1 aKobler Waldis, Judith 1 aWernli, Beat 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2008 Jan., v. 390, no. 2 p.503-510dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1644-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081101b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02779naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001400135245013800149300001600287520148000303650002401783650001201807650002101819650002901840650002001869650001801889650001201907650002101919650001001940650003201950650001401982653001501996653001902011700001402030700001702044700001702061700001702078773012202095852000902217856007502226930003302301946001102334655001202345IND4411469720221122004045.0081014s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441146972DNAL7 a10.1071/MF071432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, R.10aPotential of three aquatic predators to control mosquitoes in the presence of alternative prey: a comparative experimental assessment  ap. 817-835.  aPredator-induced control of pests depends on the predator's preference for the target pest over naturally co-occurring prey species. We compared the larvivorous efficiency of three common freshwater predators: mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis; Baird and Girard, 1854), dragonfly naiads (Zyxomma petiolatum; Rambur, 1842) and copepods (Mesocyclops aspericornis; Daday, 1906) on different instars and the relative abundances of the mosquito Anopheles stephensi (Liston, 1901) in the presence of alternative cladoceran prey, either Moina macrocopa (Straus, 1820) or Daphnia similoides (Hudec, 1991). Larval removal rate decreased with increasing larval size and instar stage. The maximum consumption rate was by mosquitofish, followed by dragonfly naiads and copepods. The presence of either of the alternative prey significantly reduced larval consumption by all three predators, except in the D. similoides-mosquito larvae combination for naiads. Mosquitofish and copepods preferred early instars of the mosquito. Prey selectivity indices for early mosquito instars against D. similoides did not differ between mosquitofish and copepods, whereas naiads had significantly lower index values than the other two predators. Considering the negative impacts of mosquitofish on native assemblages, that is, its invasiveness and its lower selectivity for mosquito larvae, our results suggest that the feasibility of using copepods in large-scale control programs needs to be evaluated. 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aDaphnia 3aGambusia affinis 3aMesocyclops aspericornis 3aMoina macrocopa 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3amosquito control 3apests 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 0apreference 0aprey selection1 aMuhid, P.1 aDahms, H.-U.1 aTseng, L.-C.1 aHwang, J.

The procedure involves a selective preconcentration achieved by applying laboratory-prepared MnO₂ resin followed by cation exchange chromatographic separation. In order to completely eliminate possible molecular interferences, medium mass resolution (R = 4,000) combined with chemical separation was found to be a good compromise that enhanced the reliability of the method. The detection limit of 0.084 fg g-¹ (3.1 mBq kg-¹) achieved is comparable to that of the emanation method or alpha spectrometry and is suitable for low-level environmental measurements. The chemical recovery of the sample preparation method ranged from 72 to 94%. The proposed method enables a rapid, accurate and less labor-intensive approach to routine environmental ²²⁶Ra determination than the radioanalytical techniques conventionally applied. 3acation exchange 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aisotope dilution technique 3amanganese dioxide 3amass spectrometry 3aradionuclides 3aradium 3aseawater 3aseparation 0aInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aLiquid samples0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2008 Jan., v. 390, no. 2 p.511-519dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1394-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080106b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03505naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002300191245009700214300001800311500001500329520172500344650001102069650001302080650001802093650001102111650001002122650001302132650002402145650001202169650002002181650001502201650001802216650002002234650004102254650004502295650004602340650003802386650004502424650004202469650002402511653002002535653002702555700002202582700002202604700002202626700001902648773009202667852000902759856007802768930003302846945002502879946001102904655001202915IND4375444620221122003956.0051023e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437544462DNAL7 a162037552pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Borck)  ap. 2995-3005.  a2019-12-04  aAbscission was studied in immature apple fruits (cv. Golden Delicious) during the physiological drop. Fruitlet populations, characterized by different abscission potential, were analysed. Non-abscising fruitlets (NAF) were obtained from central flowers borne in clusters where all the lateral flowers had been removed at bloom while abscising fruitlets (AF) were derived from lateral fruitlets of trees sprayed with benzylaminopurine (BAP) at 200 ppm, 17 d after petal fall (APF), when the fruit cross diameter was about 10-12 mm. Fruit shedding, monitored at the end of the June drop, was significantly different in the two populations, being less than 10%, and more than 90%, in NAF and AF, respectively. In AF, fruit drop peaked around 33 d after petal fall (APF) and was preceded by an increase in ethylene around 20 d APF. Transcript analysis was performed from 17-24 d APF, since preliminary experiments pointed out that major changes in expression of abscission related genes occurred within this period. Transcript accumulation of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis (MdACS5B and MdACO) and action (MdERS1, MdETR1, and MdCTR1) was studied in the seed, cortex, peduncle, and abscission zone (AZ) of the two fruit populations. MdACS5B and MdACO transcripts accumulated along the experimental period in AF population, even though at a different magnitude, while ethylene evolution declined after peaking at day three. MdETR1, MdERS1, and MdCTR1 expression patterns depended on tissue and/or population. The ERS/ETR ratio was higher in AF than in NAF populations. Overall results pointed out that apple fruitlet drop is preceded by a stimulation of ethylene biosynthesis and a gain in sensitivity to the hormone. 3acortex 3aethylene 3amessenger RNA 3aapples 3aseeds 3apeduncle 3aethylene production 3aflowers 3agene expression 3afruit drop 3abenzyladenine 3aMalus domestica 2aEthylenesxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aFruitxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMalusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 0aabscission zone 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aDanesin, Marcello1 aBoschetti, Andrea1 aDorigoni, Alberto1 aRamina, Angelo0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Nov., v. 56, no. 421 p.2995-3005x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2963Available from publisher's Web site  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03730naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002300191245013500214300001800349500001500367520175000382650001302132650001802145650002102163650002002184650001402204650002002218650001902238650002702257650002502284650002502309650002602334650003402360650002402394650006402418650005802482650002802540650002702568650002802595650002202623650002702645650002302672650004602695653001202741653001102753653002802764700002002792700002202812700002202834773009202856852000902948856007802957930003303035945002503068946001103093655001203104IND4376292620221121221345.0051127e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437629262DNAL7 a162468562pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri3082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPetersen, M. la C.10aCucurbit phloem serpins are graft-transmissible and appear to be resistant to turnover in the sieve element-companion cell complex  ap. 3111-3120.  a2019-12-04  aSerpins are unique inhibitors of serine proteases that are located in various plant tissues and organs. An orthologue of the pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) phloem serpin CmPS-1 was amplified from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) RNA by RT-PCR, cloned, and designated as CsPS-1 (GenBank accession no. AJ866989). Alternative amino acid sequences in the reactive centre loop suggest distinct inhibitory specificity between CmPS-1 and CsPS-1. A difference in the electrophoretic mobility of these serpins was used in heterografts to establish that serpins are phloem-mobile. Immuno light microscopy revealed that the phloem serpins are localized exclusively to sieve elements (SE), while the phloem filament protein CmPP1, used as a reference, is localized to both SEs and companion cells (CCs). Similar to CmPS-1, CsPS-1 accumulates over time in phloem exudates, indicating that serpins differ from other phloem-mobile proteins whose concentrations appear to be stable in phloem exudates. These differences could reflect alternative mechanisms regulating protein turnover and/or inaccessibility of protein degradation. The functionality of the pore/plasmodesma units connecting SEs and CCs was tested with graft-transmitted CmPP1 as a transport marker. The occurrence of CmPP1 in the CCs of the Cucumis graft partner shows that translocated 88 kDa phloem filament protein monomers can symplasmically exit the SE and accumulate in the CC. By contrast, serial sections probed with the serpin antibody demonstrate that the 43 kDa serpin does not enter CCs. Collectively, these data indicate that CCs play a decisive role in homeostasis of exudate proteins} proteins not accessing the CCs accumulate in SEs and display a time-dependent increase in concentration. 3apumpkins 3amessenger RNA 3aCucurbita maxima 3aCucumis sativus 3acucumbers 3avegetable crops 3asieve elements 3aphloem companion cells 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteinase inhibitors 3arootstock-scion relationships 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCucumis sativusxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aCucurbitaxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aPlant Shootsxchemistry 2aProtein Transport 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSerpinsxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aserpins 0aphloem 0amolecular sequence data1 aHejgaard, Jørn1 aThompson, Gary A.1 aSchulz, Alexander0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Dec., v. 56, no. 422 p.3111-3120x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri3083Available from publisher's Web site  a20060202b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02750naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100002300172245009600195300001800291520131300309650002601622650003401648650001101682650002201693650002301715650002201738650002401760650001001784650001401794650002001808650001401828650001901842650001801861651001101879653002501890700002901915700002101944700002201965700002101987773009202008852000902100856007802109930003302187945002502220946001102245655001202256IND4376292720221121221231.0051127e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437629272DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/eri3092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Morphological studies of isolated and moss-associated cyanobacteria were carried out by light microscopy. Molecular tools were used for cyanobacteria identification, and a reconstitution experiment of the association between non-associative mosses and cyanobacteria was conducted. The influence of temperature on N₂ fixation in the different cyanobacterial isolates and the influence of light and temperature on N₂-fixation rates in the moss were studied using the acetylene reduction assay. Two different cyanobacteria were effectively isolated from P. schreberi: Nostoc sp. and Calothrix sp. A third genus, Stigonema sp. was identified by microscopy, but could not be isolated. The Nostoc sp. was found to fix N₂ at lower temperatures than Calothrix sp. Nostoc sp. and Stigonema sp. were the predominant cyanobacteria colonizing the moss. The attempt to reconstitute the association between the moss and cyanobacteria was successful. The two isolated genera of cyanobacteria in feather moss samples collected in northern Sweden differ in their temperature optima, which may have important ecological implications. 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria 3aNostoc 3aspecies diversity 3amicrobial activity 3anitrogen fixation 3aambient temperature 3alight 3aacetylene 3aredox reactions 3aCalothrix 3aStigonematales 3aplant ecology 3aSweden 0aPleurozium schreberi1 aNilsson, Marie-Charlotte1 aZackrisson, Olle1 aDeLuca, Thomas H.1 aSellstedt, Anita0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Dec., v. 56, no. 422 p.3121-3127x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri3093Available from publisher's Web site  a20060203b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01903naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245013700185300001600322520060500338650003000943650001700973650002400990650002001014650001601034650003701050650001801087650004001105650001101145650002001156653001701176700001901193700002101212773013401233852000901367856008501376930003301461946001101494655001201505IND4399257520221121221402.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439925752DNAL7 a179097582pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1619-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanrahan, Grady 10aChemometric experimental design based optimization techniques in capillary electrophoresis: a critical review of modern applications  ap. 169-179.  aA critical review of recent developments in the use of chemometric experimental design based optimization techniques in capillary electrophoresis applications is presented.

The case for correcting for bias is discussed, and it is shown that instances in which bias is known or suspected, but in which a specific correction cannot be justified, are comparatively common. The ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement does not provide well for this situation. It is concluded that there is a need for guidance on handling cases of uncorrected bias. Several different published approaches to the treatment of uncorrected bias and its uncertainty are critically reviewed with regard to coverage probability and simplicity of execution. On the basis of current studies, and taking into account testing laboratory needs for a simple and consistent approach with a symmetric uncertainty interval, we conclude that for most cases with large degrees of freedom, linear addition of a bias term adjusted for exact coverage (“Ue”) as described by Synek is to be preferred. This approach does, however, become more complex if degrees of freedom are low. For modest bias and low degrees of freedom, summation of bias, bias uncertainty and observed value uncertainty in quadrature (“RSSu”) provides a similar interval and is simpler to adapt to reduced degrees of freedom, at the cost of a more restricted range of application if accurate coverage is desired. 3achemical analysis 3aorganic compounds 3auncertainty 0aRecovery 0aUncorrected bias 0aRecovery 0aUncorrected bias1 aEllison, S.

A high correlation between N₂ fixation decline and sucrose synthase (SS; EC 2.4.1.13) activity down-regulation has been reported, although it has still to be elucidated whether a causal relationship between SS activity down-regulation and N₂ fixation decline can be established. In order to study the likely C/N interactions within nodules and the effects on N₂ fixation, pea plants (Pisum sativum L. cv. Sugar snap) were subjected to progressive water stress by withholding irrigation. Under these conditions, nodule SS activity declined concomitantly with apparent nitrogenase activity. The levels of UDP-glucose, glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate decreased in water-stressed nodules compared with unstressed nodules. Drought also had a marked effect on nodule concentrations of malate, succinate, and [alpha]-ketoglutarate. Moreover, a general decline in nodule adenylate content was detected. NADP⁺-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH; EC 1.1.1.42) was the only enzyme whose activity increased as a result of water deficit, compensating for a possible C/N imbalance and/or supplying NADPH in circumstances that the pentose phosphate pathway was impaired, as suggested by the decline in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH; EC 1.1.1.49) activity. The overall results show the occurrence of strong C/N interactions in nodules subjected to water stress and support a likely limitation of carbon flux that might be involved in the decline of N₂ fixation under drought. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3anitrogen metabolism 3anitrogen fixation 3asugar phosphates 3apeas 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aorganic acids and salts 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aroot nodules 3adrought 3awater stress 3aPisum sativum 3aenzyme activity 3asucrose synthase 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aEnvironment 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgenetics 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aPeasxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aWaterxphysiology 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aGonzález, Esther M.1 aArrese-Igor, Cesar0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 , v. 56, no. 419 p.2551-2561x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2493Available from publisher's Web site  a20051115b20051202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02332naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245006500189300001600254520088800270650003001158650001701188650001501205650001501220650006601235650001401301650002701315650002501342650003201367650007701399650003601476653006601512653001601578700002101594700002301615773013401638852000901772856008501781930003301866946001101899655001201910IND4395293420221121221229.0070923e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439529342DNAL7 a176535342pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1476-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpentieri, Andrea 10aRapid fingerprinting of red wines by MALDI mass spectrometry  ap. 969-982.  aHere we report a simple and fast method for wine fingerprinting based on direct matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry analysis of different red wine samples, useful for batch-to-batch analysis and for the detection of key compounds even in trace amounts which may vary from vintage to vintage, and from one treatment to another one.

  1 aPruyn, Michele L.10aStorage versus substrate limitation to bole respiratory potential in two coniferous tree species of contrasting sapwood width  ap. 2637-2649.  a2019-12-04  aTwo coniferous tree species of contrasting sapwood width (Pinus ponderosa L., ponderosa pine and Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb., Douglas-fir) were compared to determine whether bole respiratory potential was correlated with available storage space in ray parenchyma cells and/or respiratory substrate concentration of tissues (total nitrogen content, N; and total non-structural carbohydrate content, TNC). An increment core-based, laboratory method under controlled temperature was used to measure tissue-level respiration (termed respiratory potential) from multiple positions in mature boles (>100-years-old). The most significant tissue-level differences that occurred were that N and TNC were two to six times higher for inner bark than sapwood, TNC was about two times higher in ponderosa pine than Douglas-fir and there was significant seasonal variation in TNC. Ray cell abundance was not correlated with sapwood respiratory potential, whereas N and TNC often were, implying that respiratory potential tended to be more limited by substrate than storage space. When scaled from cores to whole boles (excluding branches), potential net CO₂ efflux correlated positively with live bole volume (inner bark plus sapwood), live bole ray volume, N mass, and TNC mass (adjusted R² [>/=]0.4). This relationship did not differ between species for N mass, but did for live bole volume, live bole ray volume, and TNC mass. Therefore, N mass appeared to be a good predictor of bole respiratory potential. The differences in net CO₂ efflux between the species were largely explained by the species' relative amounts of whole-bole storage space or substrate mass. For example, ponderosa pine's inner bark was thinner than Douglas-fir's, which had the greater concentration of ray cells and TNC compared with the sapwood. This resulted in ponderosa pine boles having 30-60% less ray volume and 10-30% less TNC mass, and caused ponderosa pine net CO₂ efflux/ray volume and net CO₂ efflux/TNC mass to be 20-50% higher than Douglas-fir. In addition, because inner bark respiratory potential was 2-25 times higher than that of sapwood, ponderosa pine's thinner inner bark and deeper sapwood (relative to Douglas-fir) caused its bole net CO₂ efflux/live bole volume to be 20-25% lower than that of similarly-sized Douglas-fir trees. 3acarbon dioxide 3aforest trees 3anitrogen content 3avolume 3agas exchange 3acarbohydrate content 3aPinus ponderosa 3atree trunk 3acell respiration 3aseasonal variation 3abark 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3asapwood 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCell Respirationxphysiology 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPinus ponderosaxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stemsxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aPseudotsugaxanatomy & histologyxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity 3aOregon 0anonstructural carbohydrates 0aparenchyma1 aGartner, Barbara L.1 aHarmon, Mark E.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Oct., v. 56, no. 420 p.2637-2649x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2573Available from publisher's Web site  a20060118b20060202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03065naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100001700191245008500208300001800293500001500311520126600326650001601592650003201608650001201640650002001652650002301672650001901695650001901714650001201733650002001745650001101765650002201776650002601798650003001824650004401854650007101898650002301969650004601992650004402038650005102082653002302133653002102156653002202177700002202199700001802221773009202239852000902331856007802340930003302418945002502451946001102476655001202487IND4375443120221121185524.0051023e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437544312DNAL7 a162168482pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhu, Renkang10aCadmium-induced plant stress investigated by scanning electrochemical microscopy  ap. 2831-2838.  a2019-12-04  aIn vivo oxygen evolution above single stomata in Brassica juncea has been used to investigate, for the first time, the effect of Cd-induced stress as imaged by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). SECM images showed a clear stomatal structure--a pore, whose aperture is modulated by two guard cells, serving as the conduit for the oxygen produced. Lower stomatal density and larger stoma size were found in plants treated with 0.2 mM CdCl₂ compared with control plants. Either the introduction of Cd caused a slower cell replication in the plane of the epidermis, hence fewer stomata, and/or the number of open stomata was reduced when plants were under Cd-stress. Oxygen evolution above individual stomatal complexes in Cd-treated plants was lower than that from control plants, as determined from the electrochemical current above the middle of each stoma. All guard cells under illumination were swollen, indicating that the stomata were open in both control and treated plants. Thus, decreased oxygen evolution in response to Cd cannot be attributed to simple closing of the stomata, but to a lower photosynthetic yield. SECM provides an excellent tool for monitoring the effects of Cd on photosynthetic activity at the scale of individual stomata. 3aguard cells 3agas production (biological) 3acadmium 3aBrassica juncea 3acell proliferation 3aphotosynthesis 3aabiotic stress 3astomata 3ametal tolerance 3aoxygen 3ahyperaccumulators 2aCadmiumxpharmacology 2aElectrochemistryxmethods 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanningxmethods 2aMustard Plantxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Transpirationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0astomatal pore size 0astomatal density 0aepidermis (plant)1 aMacfie, Sheila M.1 aDing, Zhifeng0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Nov., v. 56, no. 421 p.2831-2838x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2753Available from publisher's Web site  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02692naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245011500180300001600295520133400311650001301645650001301658650001101671650000901682650001501691650001101706650001301717650002101730650001201751650001701763650000901780653001901789653003401808653002901842700002501871700002201896700001901918700002501937773013401962852000902096856008502105930003302190946001102223655001202234IND4395291020221121174456.0070923e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439529102DNAL7 a175980912pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1377-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobo, Lara 10aNitrogen effects in multi-matrix calibrations by radiofrequency glow discharge - optical emission spectrometry  ap. 743-752.  aA study about the effect of nitrogen in the calibration curves of a series of analytical emission lines has been carried out in this work. Fifteen reference materials with different matrices (Fe, Al, Zn, Cu and Ni) were used (three of these reference materials contain nitrogen in their composition) and plots of intensity versus the product “sputtering rate times element concentration” were constructed for emission lines of the analytes considered in this work (Al, Fe, Cu, Cr, C, Mo, Zn, Si, Ti and Ni). Two different fits were performed in each plot, first considering only the points corresponding to samples without nitrogen in their composition and secondly including all the points. The results show almost negligible differences in the emission yields calculated. On the other hand, a mixture of Ar containing 0.5% N₂ was employed to check if the nitrogen effect was present at higher concentrations than those expected in analysis when samples with high nitrogen concentrations are used. Differences between the slopes of the calibration curves with the Ar/N₂ and pure Ar discharges were obtained (up to 30%). A study of the molecular bands recorded in the spectra when nitrogen is present in the discharge and determination of the resulting interferences on the analytes have been performed.

L. 10aHyphenation of reverse-phase HPLC and ICP-MS for metabolite profiling--application to a novel antituberculosis compound as a case study  ap. 777-786.  aIn this study, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry (MS) method was developed intended for use in metabolism studies of bromine-containing drugs, administered to test animals (or test persons). As a case study, the method was applied to a new antituberculosis compound, the bromine-containing diarylquinoline R207910. A method has been proposed to overcome the incompatibilities between the high organic solvent content (45%CH₃OH and 45% CH₃CN) used in the reverse-phase liquid chromatography (LC) separation on one hand and the limitations of the ICP on the other hand. Therefore, several instrument modifications had to be made. For the introduction of the column effluent, a combination of a perfluoroalkoxy LC nebulizer with a PC³ Peltier-cooled inlet system (operated at 2 °C) was used. Additionally, the standard injector tube (internal diameter 2 mm) was replaced by an injector tube with an internal diameter of 1 mm and to avoid carbon build-up on the interface cones and the torch, the nebulizer gas was admixed with 6% v/v of oxygen. After optimization of the method, HPLC-ICP-MS was applied for metabolite profiling of faeces samples after dosing of ¹⁴C-radiolabelled R207910 to dogs and rats. To evaluate the method developed, the HPLC-ICP-MS results were compared with those of HPLC with UV spectrophotometric and ¹⁴C radiochemical detection. As the HPLC-ICP-MS method gave rise to a higher selectivity than HPLC with UV detection and to a better detection limit (5 ng R207910) than the method with radiochemical detection (65 ng R207910), it can be concluded that ICP-MS can be used as a good alternative to the more traditional detection methods, even when a mobile phase with high organic solvent content has to be used in the LC separation. 3acarbon 3acase studies 3adetection limit 3adogs 3adrugs 3afeces 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aoxygen 3apeople 3aradionuclides 3arats 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asolvents 3asystem optimization 2aAnimals 2aAntitubercular Agentsxanalysis 2aCarbon Radioisotopes 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aDiarylquinolines 2aDogs 2aDrug Stability 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometryxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aOrganic Chemicalsxchemistry 2aPharmaceutical Preparationsxanalysis 2aQuinolinesxanalysis 2aRats 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aTemperature 0aHigh-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aOn-line coupling 0aMetabolite profiling 0aOrganic solvent1 aDe Samber, Björn 1 aDe Wolf, Kenny 1 aCuyckens, Filip 1 aVanhaecke, Frank 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Oct., v. 389, no. 3 p.777-786dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1303-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070923b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03516naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002700191245010300218300001800321520160700339650002501946650001001971650002301981650001202004650002402016650001302040650002302053650001102076650001802087650001202105650001802117650002002135650002502155650006302180650003802243650005002281650002602331650001302357650004202370650005302412650004302465650001702508650003902525653002802564653003002592700001902622700002502641773009202666852000902758856007802767930003302845945002502878946001102903655001202914IND4372523620141222000000.0050720e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437252362DNAL7 a159557882pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLudwig-Müller, Jutta.10aAnalysis of indole-3-butyric acid-induced adventitious root formation on Arabidopsis stem segments  ap. 2095-2105.  aRoot induction by auxins is still not well understood at the molecular level. In this study a system has been devised which distinguishes between the two active auxins indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IBA, but not IAA, efficiently induced adventitious rooting in Arabidopsis stem segments at a concentration of 10 [micro]M. In wild-type plants, roots formed exclusively out of calli at the basal end of the segments. Root formation was inhibited by 10 [micro]M 3,4,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), an inhibitor of polar auxin transport. At intermediate IBA concentrations (3-10 [micro]M), root induction was less efficient in trp1, a tryptophan auxotroph of Arabidopsis with a bushy phenotype but no demonstrable reduction in IAA levels. By contrast, two mutants of Arabidopsis with measurably higher levels of IAA (trp2, amt1) show root induction characteristics very similar to the wild type. Using differential display, transcripts specific to the rooting process were identified by devising a protocol that distinguished between callus production only and callus production followed by root initiation. One fragment was identical to the sequence of a putative regulatory subunit B of protein phosphatase 2A. It is suggested that adventitious rooting in Arabidopsis stem segments is due to an interaction between endogenous IAA and exogenous IBA. In stem explants, residual endogenous IAA is transported to the basal end of each segment, thereby inducing root formation. In stem segments in which the polar auxin transport is inhibited by TIBA, root formation does not occur. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3astems 3aadventitious roots 3arooting 3aindole butyric acid 3aexplants 3aindole acetic acid 3acallus 3abenzoic acids 3amutants 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3aregulatory sequences 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aIndolesxpharmacology 2aMutation 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Stemsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 2aTriiodobenzoic Acidsxpharmacology 0amolecular sequence data 0a3,4,5-triiodobenzoic acid1 aVertocnik, Amy1 aTown, Christopher D.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Aug., v. 56, no. 418 p.2095-2105x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2083Available from publisher's Web site  a20060118b20060202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03065naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100002400172245010700196300001800303500001500321520139000336650001501726650001501741650002101756650002001777650004401797650001701841650001001858650001501868650001901883650001301902650001201915650001301927650001401940650002601954650002701980650001702007650003602024650003502060650001702095653001602112700002302128700002102151700002002172700002302192700002402215773009202239852000902331856007802340930003302418945002502451946001102476655001202487IND4372525020221121174446.0050720e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437252502DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTerskikh, Victor V.10aIn vivo ¹³C NMR metabolite profiling: potential for understanding and assessing conifer seed quality  ap. 2253-2265.  a2019-12-04  aHigh-resolution ¹³C MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to profile a range of primary and secondary metabolites in vivo in intact whole seeds of eight different conifer species native to North America, including six of the Pinaceae family and two of the Cupressaceae family. In vivo ¹³C NMR provided information on the total seed oil content and fatty acid composition of the major storage lipids in a non-destructive manner. In addition, a number of monoterpenes were identified in the ¹³C NMR spectra of conifer seeds containing oleoresin; these compounds showed marked variability in individual seeds of Pacific silver fir within the same seed lot. In imbibed conifer seeds, the ¹³C NMR spectra showed the presence of considerable amounts of dissolved sucrose presumed to play a protective role in the desiccation-tolerance of seeds. The free amino acids arginine and asparagine, generated as a result of storage protein mobilization, were detected in vivo during seed germination and early seedling growth. The potential for NMR to profile metabolites in a non-destructive manner in single conifer seeds and seed populations is discussed. It is a powerful tool to evaluate seed quality because of its ability to assess reserve accumulation during seed development or at seed maturity; it can also be used to monitor reserve mobilization, which is critical for seedling emergence. 3aimbibition 3aasparagine 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aforest trees 3aseeds 3aoleoresins 3amonoterpenoids 3aPinaceae 3asucrose 3aarginine 3aseed oils 3asecondary metabolites 3anondestructive methods 3aseed quality 3achemical constituents of plants 3adesiccation (plant physiology) 3aCupressaceae 0ametabolites1 aFeurtado, J.

Through transgenic manipulation it has previously been shown that overexpression of SIPK leads to enhanced ozone-induced lesion formation with concomitant accumulation of ROS. In spite of this hypersensitive phenotype, the effect of this altered SIPK expression on the levels of various hormones that regulate ozone-induced cell death has remained unexplored. The response of both salicylate and ethylene, the major phytohormones that modulate ozone-induced cell death, have now been analysed in SIPK-OX tobacco plants. Ozone treatment strongly induced ethylene formation in the sensitive SIPK-OX plants at ozone concentrations that failed to elicit stress ethylene release in WT plants. By contrast, SIPK-overexpressing plants displayed no ozone-induced SA accumulation, whereas WT plants accumulated SA upon ozone exposure. Epistatic analysis of SIPK-OX function suggests that the ozone-induced cell death observed in SIPK-OX plants is either independent, or upstream, of SA accumulation. 3aplant stress 3acell death 3atransgenic plants 3aozone 3aethylene production 3agene expression 3aleaf spot 3abiochemical pathways 3aNicotiana tabacum 3asalicylic acid 3aplant damage 3atobacco 2aApoptosisxphysiology 2aDown-Regulation 2aEthylenesxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aOzonexpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aleaf spotting1 aWalia, Ankit1 aMansfield, Shawn D.1 aEllis, Brian E.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Aug., v. 56, no. 418 p.2195-2201x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2193Available from publisher's Web site  a20060118b20060202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02856naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157100002100174245007000195300001800265500001500283520129800298650002801596650002701624650002201651650001301673650001201686650001401698650002201712650001901734650001401753650001701767650002901784650003401813650001901847650003101866650003501897650002201932650002601954653001601980653002301996653002302019653001102042700001702053773008802070852000902158856007802167930003302245945002502278946001102303655001202314IND4373688020141222000000.0050825e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437368802DNAL7 a160877012pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBédard, Jocelyn10aRecognition and envelope translocation of chloroplast preproteins  ap. 2287-2320.  a2019-12-04  aPlastids are a diverse group of plant organelles that perform essential functions including important steps in many biosynthetic pathways. Chloroplasts are the best characterized type of plastid, and constitute the site of oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, a process essential to all higher life forms. It is well established that the majority (>90%) of chloroplast proteins are nucleus-encoded and must be post-translationally imported into these envelope-bound compartments. Most nucleus-encoded chloroplast proteins are translated in precursor form on cytosolic ribosomes, targeted to the chloroplast surface, and then imported across the double-membrane envelope by translocons in the outer and inner envelope membranes of the chloroplast, termed TOC and TIC, respectively. Recently, significant progress has been made in our understanding of how proteins are targeted to the chloroplast surface and translocated across the chloroplast envelope into the stroma. Evidence suggesting the existence of multiple import pathways at the outer envelope membrane for different classes of precursor proteins has been presented. These pathways appear to utilize similar TOC complexes equipped with different combinations of homologous GTPase receptors, providing preprotein recognition specificity. 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3atransmembrane proteins 3aprotein synthesis 3apeptides 3acytosol 3aribosomes 3aprotein transport 3acell membranes 3areceptors 3achloroplasts 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aProtein Precursorsxmetabolism 2aProtein Transport 2aRibosomesxmetabolism 0atranslocons 0aliterature reviews 0aprotein precursors 0aplants1 aJarvis, Paul0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 , v. 56, no. 419 p.2287-2320x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2433Available from publisher's Web site  a20051115b20051202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03694naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002500191245006100216300001800277500001500295520141900310650001001729650001601739650001801755650002201773650003301795650002001828650001301848650002101861650001901882650002001901650002201921650002501943650001901968650002101987650002102008650001902029650002402048650001802072650003302090650004402123650002302167650002302190650001602213650002302229650002802252650004202280650003702322650005202359650002202411650002302433650003402456650002502490650002702515653001002542653002502552653001502577653002802592700001802620700002502638700001702663773008802680852000902768856007802777930003302855945002502888946001102913655001202924IND4373688220221121174415.0050825e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437368822DNAL7 a160615112pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDhaubhadel, Sangeeta12aA soybean seed protein with carboxylate-binding activity  ap. 2335-2344.  a2019-12-04  aThe seed coat serves as a multifunctional organ with a role in protection and for the supply of nutrients to the embryo sac during development. The composition of the legume seed coat differs from other seed tissues in many ways including its protein composition. An abundant 24 kDa protein (SC24) has been purified and identified from soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr) seed hulls. The corresponding cDNA and genomic DNA clones for SC24 were isolated and characterized, and expression patterns were determined. The deduced protein sequence of 219 amino acids included an N-terminal signal peptide. Transcripts encoding SC24 were present in the seed coat from 30 days after pollination (DAP) until maturity, but the protein was not detected until the final stages of seed maturation. In mature seeds, most of the SC24 protein was localized to the parenchyma and aleurone layers of the seed coat. The expression of SC24 was also induced in vegetative tissues by pathogen infection and by wounding. The SC24 protein bound to an affinity column containing an isophthalic acid ligand, and was eluted with 7 mM citrate. Polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant SC24 cross-reacted with the seed coat peroxidase enzyme, suggesting that these two proteins may share an antigenic determinant. Overall, the results indicate that SC24 belongs to a novel class of plant defence proteins with carboxylate-binding activity. 3atesta 3aGlycine max 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aimmunochemistry 3asoybeans 3abinding proteins 3aaleurone layer 3agene expression 3amechanical damage 3anucleotide sequences 3asignal peptide 3abinding capacity 3acarboxylic acids 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCarboxylic Acidsxmetabolism 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Complementary 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSoybeansxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aseeds 0aamino acid sequences 0aparenchyma 0amolecular sequence data1 aKuflu, Kuflom1 aRomero, Maria Carmen1 aGijzen, Mark0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 , v. 56, no. 419 p.2335-2344x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2263Available from publisher's Web site  a20051115b20051202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03126naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157100002100174245007800195300001800273520159800291650003201889650001901921650001101940650003501951650001101986650001501997650002002012650001802032650001402050650002402064650002202088650001602110650001602126650001302142650001502155650003702170650003402207650002502241653001902266653002002285700002602305700002102331773008802352852000902440856007802449930003302527945002502560946001102585655001202596IND4373688920221121174502.0050825e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437368892DNAL7 a160143642pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAylor, Donald E.10aSome physical properties of teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis) pollen  ap. 2401-2407.  aIn parts of the world where teosinte and maize are grown in close proximity, there is concern about gene flow between them. Pollen is the primary vehicle for gene flow. Quantifying the biophysical properties of pollen, such as its settling speed and dehydration rate, is important for evaluating outcrossing potential. These properties were measured for teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis) pollen. Pollen was found to have an average settling speed of 0.165 m s⁻¹, which agrees well with theoretical values based on the size of the pollen grains. The conductance of the pollen wall for water was derived from the time rate of change of pollen grain size and gave an average conductance of 3.42x10⁻⁴ m s⁻¹. Water potential, [psi], of teosinte pollen was determined at various values of relative water content (dry-weight basis), {theta}, by using a thermocouple psychrometer and by allowing samples of pollen to come to vapour equilibrium with various saturated salt solutions. Non-linear regression analysis of the data yielded [psi] (MPa) = -4.13 {theta}[superscript -1.23] (r²=0.77). Results for conductance and [psi] were incorporated into a model equation for the rate of water loss from pollen grains, which yielded results that agreed well (r²=0.96) with observations of water loss from pollen grains in air. The data reported here are important building blocks in a model of teosinte pollen movement and should be helpful in establishing the main factors influencing the degree and the direction of pollination between teosinte populations and between maize and teosinte. 3aZea mays subsp. parviglumis 3awild relatives 3apollen 3adesiccation (plant physiology) 3aweight 3acell walls 3awater potential 3awater content 3aequations 3amathematical models 3across pollination 2aDesiccation 2aGermination 2aKinetics 2aOrgan Size 2aPollenxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aZea maysxphysiology 0asettling speed 0adesication rate1 aBaltazar, Baltazar M.1 aSchoper, John B.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 , v. 56, no. 419 p.2401-2407x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2323Available from publisher's Web site  a20051115b20051202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03083naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100003100191245012200222300001800344500001500362520111500377650002501492650002601517650001701543650001401560650002701574650002001601650002201621650001901643650002001662650001201682650002101694650001201715650001901727650002601746650003501772650003801807650002001845650003001865650002901895650002101924650004301945650003001988650002202018650002202040653002502062700001802087700001902105700002602124700001902150700002002169773008802189852000902277856007802286930003302364945002502397946001102422655001202433IND4373689820141222000000.0050825e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437368982DNAL7 a160143632pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGutiérrez-Alcalá, Gloria12aA versatile promoter for the expression of proteins in glandular and non-glandular trichomes from a variety of plants  ap. 2487-2494.  a2019-12-04  aA DNA regulatory fragment was isolated from the promoter region of the OASA1 gene, encoding the cytosolic O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase enzyme that is highly expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana trichomes. This DNA fragment has been named an ATP fragment and comprises 1435 bp of the genomic region upstream of the OASA1 gene and 375 bp of the transcriptional initiation start site containing the first intron of the gene. The ATP fragment, fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and {szligbeta}-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter genes, is able to drive high-level gene expression in A. thaliana trichomes. Deletion analysis of the ATP fragment determined that the region from -266 to -66 contains regulatory elements required for trichome expression. In addition, the region from +112 to +375, comprising the first intronic region of the gene, is also essential for trichome gene expression. Expression of the full-length ATP fragment in tobacco and peppermint shows that this fragment is also able to drive expression in glandular trichomes and suggests additional biotechnological applications for this promoter. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ain situ hybridization 3aplant glands 3atrichomes 3aadenosine triphosphate 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3aMentha piperita 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 3atobacco 3aplant proteins 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Reporter 2aMentha piperitaxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSequence Deletion 2aTobaccoxgenetics 0aregulatory sequences1 aCalo, Leticia1 aGros, Florence1 aCaissard, Jean-Claude1 aGotor, Cecilia1 aRomero, Luis C.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 , v. 56, no. 419 p.2487-2494x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2413Available from publisher's Web site  a20051115b20051202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/10/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02051naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245004100161300001600202520094000218650002201158650001801180650001701198650001601215653001001231653004101241653006101282653002501343700001801368700001501386700001701401773013301418852000901551856008501560930003301645946001101678655001201689IND4393770820221121145428.0070805e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439377082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0384-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFichet, P. 10aComparisons between LIBS and ICP/OES  ap. 338-344.  aIn the framework of the development of new techniques, the ability of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to analyse remotely complex aqueous solutions was investigated. The jet configuration with a collimated gas stream was chosen because it appeared to be the most promising method for the LIBS probe, particularly in terms of sensitivity and repeatability. For emission collection, the echelle spectrometer offers a simultaneously recorded wavelength range from the UV to the near IR and is interesting for multielemental analysis for LIBS and also for inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The importance of parameters influencing the quantitative results of LIBS such as multispecies analysis, sheath gas, use of an internal standard and temporal parameters for analysis is described. LIBS quantitative data have been directly compared with results from the more standard ICP/OES technique. 3aaqueous solutions 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 3awavelengths 0aLaser 0aLaser-induced breakdown spectroscopy 0aInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy 0aEchelle spectrometer1 aTabarant, M. 1 aSalle, B. 1 aGautier, C. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 May, v. 385, no. 2 p.338-344dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0384-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04003naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012700183300001800310520210000328650001902428650003002447650001402477650001102491650002802502650001102530650001502541650000902556650001302565650002602578650001602604650002502620650002102645650001502666650001102681650001302692650002902705650005402734650002202788650004902810650003902859650002302898650003202921650001702953653001402970653001702984653002903001700002103030700002203051700002203073700002003095773013603115852000903251856008503260930003303345946001103378655001203389IND4394039220221121145407.0070812e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439403922DNAL7 a164350922pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-005-0272-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumont, Emmie 10aLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS): a powerful combination for selenium speciation in garlic (Allium sativum)  ap. 1196-1206.  aLiquid chromatography (LC) hyphenated with both elemental and molecular mass spectrometry has been used for Se speciation in Se-enriched garlic. Different species were separated by ion-pair liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS) after hot-water extraction. They were identified by on-line reversed-phase liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Se-methionine and Se-methylselenocysteine were determined by monitoring their product ions. Another compound, γ-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, shown to be the most abundant form of Se in the garlic, was determined without any additional sample pre-treatment after extraction and without the need for a synthesized standard. Product ions for this dipeptide were detected by LC-ESI-MS-MS for three isotopes of Se--⁷⁸ Se, ⁸⁰Se: and ⁸²Se. The method was extended to the species extracted during in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Because both Se-methylselenocysteine and γ-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine have anticarcinogenic properties, their extractability and stability during human digestion are very important. Garlic was also treated with saliva, to enable detection and analysis of species extracted during mastication. Detailed information on the extractability of selenium species by both simulated gastric and intestinal fluid are given, and variation of the distribution of Se among the different species with time is discussed. Although the main species in garlic is the dipeptide γ-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, Se-methylselenocysteine is the main compound present in the extracts after treatment with gastrointestinal fluids. Two more, so far unknown compounds were observed in the chromatogram. The extracted species and their transformations were analysed by combining LC-ICP-MS and LC-ESI-MS-MS. In both the simulated gastric and intestinal digests, Se-methionine, Se-methylselenocysteine, and γ-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine could be determined by LC-ESI-MS-MS by measuring their typical product ions.

The defatted dry matter (crude protein fraction) from lamb meat was found to be a suitable probe for “light” element stable isotope ratio analysis. Significant differences were observed between the multi-element isotope ratios of lamb samples from different regions. The mean hydrogen isotopic ratios of the defatted dry matter from lamb were found to be significantly correlated with the mean hydrogen isotopic ratios of precipitation and groundwater in the production regions. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios were influenced by feeding practices and climate. Sulfur isotopic ratios were influenced by geographical location and surface geology of the production region. The results permitted differentiation of lamb meat, from most production regions, by inspection. However, more sophisticated evaluation of the data using multivariate methods, such as linear discriminant analysis, achieved 78% correct classification. 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acrude protein 3adiscriminant analysis 3ageology 3agroundwater 3ahydrogen 3alamb meat 3anitrogen 3aprovenance 3astable isotopes 3asulfur 2aAnimals 2aElements 2aFood Analysisxstandards 2aIsotopesxanalysis 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aSeasons 2aSheep 0aEurope 0aLamb 0aRatios 0aAuthenticity1 aBontempo, L. 1 aHeinrich, K. 1 aHoracek, M. 1 aKelly, S.

For this purpose the antimicrobial activity of the active packaging containing cinnamon or oregano was evaluated against E. coli and S. aureus. The vapour phase activity and the direct contact between the antimicrobial agents themselves, or once incorporated in the packaging material, and the microbial cells have been studied. The direct contact was studied using a broth dilution method. The vapour phase was evaluated by using a new method which involves the use of a filter disk containing the EOs. Furthermore, the kill time assay was used to determine the exposure time for the maximum efficiency in packaging, and transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the antimicrobial activity and the possible mechanism of action against E. coli and S. aureus. Finally, the compounds absorbed by cells were identified. The results showed that the techniques used provide relevant information about the antibacterial activity of cinnamon and oregano in direct contact as well as in the vapour phase. The antimicrobial packaging showed a fast efficiency which supports its likely application as a food packaging material. Bacteria treated with EOs exhibit a wide range of significant abnormalities; these include formation of blebs, coagulation of cytoplasmatic constituents, collapse of the cell structure and lack of cytoplasmatic material. Some of these observations are correlated to the ability of some of these substances to disrupt envelop structure, especially the inner membrane. After an extraction from dead cells, cinnamaldehyde was detected by GC-MS in E. coli exposed to the active packaging containing cinnamon. 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibacterial properties 3aantimicrobial packaging 3abacteria 3acell structures 3acinnamon 3acoagulation 3adirect contact 3aessential oils 3aexposure duration 3afood packaging 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3aoregano 3apackaging materials 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors 0aActive packaging 0aAntimicrobial plastic films 0aMicrobiological tests 0aCell damage 0aGC-MS analysis1 aGómez-Lus, R. 1 aGoñi, P. 1 aLópez, P. 1 aNerín, C. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 July, v. 388, no. 5-6 p.1003-1011dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1332-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02309naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245013900167300001800306520102800324650001601352650001101368650001101379650004601390650001401436650002101450650001201471650001301483650003101496653001901527653003001546653001101576700002501587700002301612773013801635852000901773856008501782930003301867946001101900655001201911IND4393083520221121111051.0070715e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439308352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1345-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazurowska, Lena 10aESI-MS method for in vitro investigation of skin penetration by copper-amino acid complexes: from an emulsion through a model membrane  ap. 1157-1163.  aCopper can be found in many cosmetic formulations, mainly as complexes with peptides, hydroxyacids or amino acids. The main reason that the usage of this element in this context is still increasing is its beneficial biochemical activity, although the mechanism that enables its complexes to permeate through skin barriers is largely unknown. The ability of copper complexes with amino acids to penetrate through the stratum corneum and participate in copper ion transport processes is key to their cosmetic and pharmaceutical activities. The penetration process was studied in vitro in a model system, a Franz diffusion cell with a liposome membrane, where a liquid crystalline system with physicochemical properties similar to those of the intercellular cement of stratum corneum was used to model the skin barrier. The influences of various ligands on the model membrane migration rate of copper ions was studied, and the results highlighted the crucial roles of metal ion complex structure and stability in this process. 3aamino acids 3acement 3acopper 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aemulsions 3ain vitro studies 3aligands 3apeptides 3aphysicochemical properties 0aDiffusion cell 0aModel membrane permeation 0aESI-MS1 aNowak-Buciak, Kinga 1 aMojski, Mirosław 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 July, v. 388, no. 5-6 p.1157-1163dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1345-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03828naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245010900188300001600297520162800313650001601941650002201957650003501979650002302014650002002037650001602057650002202073650001202095650002802107650000702135650001902142650003402161650002602195650001102221650001202232650005102244650001102295650003302306650002402339650001002363650003102373650002202404650003802426650001902464650004502483650003202528650001502560650003902575650001702614650002902631650002102660650001902681653002802700653002102728653003402749700002602783700002502809700002402834773013402858852000902992856008503001930003303086946001103119655001203130IND4393326120221121111056.0070722e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439332612DNAL7 a173331402pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1194-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, Mariana A. 10aDetermination of total mercury and methylmercury in biological samples by photochemical vapor generation  ap. 837-847.  aCold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) based on photochemical reduction by exposure to UV radiation is described for the determination of methylmercury and total mercury in biological samples. Two approaches were investigated: (a) tissues were digested in either formic acid or tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), and total mercury was determined following reduction of both species by exposure of the solution to UV irradiation; (b) tissues were solubilized in TMAH, diluted to a final concentration of 0.125% m/v TMAH by addition of 10% v/v acetic acid and CH₃Hg⁺ was selectively quantitated, or the initial digests were diluted to 0.125% m/v TMAH by addition of deionized water, adjusted to pH 0.3 by addition of HCl and CH₃Hg⁺ was selectively quantitated. For each case, the optimum conditions for photochemical vapor generation (photo-CVG) were investigated. The photochemical reduction efficiency was estimated to be ~95% by comparing the response with traditional SnCl₂ chemical reduction. The method was validated by analysis of several biological Certified Reference Materials, DORM-1, DORM-2, DOLT-2 and DOLT-3, using calibration against aqueous solutions of Hg²⁺; results showed good agreement with the certified values for total and methylmercury in all cases. Limits of detection of 6 ng/g for total mercury using formic acid, 8 ng/g for total mercury and 10 ng/g for methylmercury using TMAH were obtained. The proposed methodology is sensitive, simple and inexpensive, and promotes “green” chemistry. The potential for application to other sample types and analytes is evident. 3aacetic acid 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achemical reduction 3adetection limit 3aformic acid 3ahydrochloric acid 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3apH 3asolubilization 3atetramethylammonium compounds 3aultraviolet radiation 3avapors 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFishes 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFormatesxchemistry 2aGases 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMercuryxanalysis 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxanalysis 2aPhotochemistry 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxchemistry 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSolubility 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomicxmethods 2aTime Factors 2aTin Compoundsxchemistry 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aVolatilization 0aPhotochemical reduction 0aVapor generation 0aTetramethylammonium hydroxide1 aRibeiro, Anderson S. 1 aCurtius, Adilson J. 1 aSturgeon, Ralph E. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 June, v. 388, no. 4 p.837-847dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1194-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03619naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245020200171300001800373520205200391650002502443650001402468650001302482650002002495650001502515650001702530650001002547650001302557650000902570650001202579650001602591650001302607650001802620650001702638650001902655653001702674653003302691653001702724653001802741653001802759653002102777700001902798700002202817773013602839852000902975856008502984930003303069946001103102655001203113IND4393582720221121111030.0070729e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439358272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1273-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaranassios, Vassili 10aMicromachined, planar-geometry, atmospheric-pressure, battery-operated microplasma devices (MPDs) on chips for analysis of microsamples of liquids, solids, or gases by optical-emission spectrometry  ap. 1595-1604.  aBecause of their desirable characteristics, for example small size, lightness, low power and gas consumption, and potential for portability, miniaturized plasma sources are receiving significant attention in the scientific literature. To take advantage of these characteristics we micromachined and fabricated new, planar-geometry, self-igniting, atmospheric-pressure microplasma devices (MPDs) on chips. These microplasmas required such low power for their operation they could be operated from a re-chargeable battery (of the type used in cordless power-tools). Despite their advantages, most miniaturized plasma sources reported in the literature have not performed well with liquid samples; analysis of powders or solids that can be converted to a powder (and processed and used as slurries) is even more difficult. To address these shortcomings we coupled an electrothermal, mini-in-torch vaporization (mini-ITV) “dry” sample-introduction system to the low-power planar microplasma devices we developed. In this preliminary investigation, absolute detection limits obtained from microsamples of single-element liquid standards and optical emission spectrometry with photomultiplier-tube detection and a spectral bandpass similar to that of portable, commercially available fiber-optic spectrometers were in the low-pg to ng range, for example 2 pg (for K) to 25 ng (for Pb). Mini-ITV also enabled (as far as we are aware, for the first time) measurement of analyte emission from microsamples of powdered solids (as slurries). In addition to the 3% H₂ in Ar mixtures, the ac-operated microplasmas were sustained by use of a variety of electrode materials and different plasma-support gases (e.g. Ar, He and 3% H₂ in He) thus indicating fabrication versatility and operational flexibility. Such flexibility has the potential to enable microplasmas to be tailored to analytical problems, and this is demonstrated by using a He MPD and chlorine emission measurements (837.594 nm) from gaseous microsamples as an example.

The diethylamine-modified poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) monolithic capillary selected as the extraction medium exhibited a high extraction capability towards benzoic and sorbic acids. To obtain optimum extraction performance, several in-tube SPME parameters were investigated, including pH value, inorganic salt, and the organic solvent content of the sample matrix. After simple dilution with 0.02 mol/L phosphate solution (pH 4.0), carbonated drink, juice drink, sauce and jam samples could be directly injected for extraction. For succade samples, a small amount of acetonitrile was required to extract analytes prior to dilution and subsequent extraction. The linearity of the method was investigated over a concentration range of 5-20000 ng/mL for both analytes, and the correlation coefficients (R ² values) were higher than 0.999. The detection limits for benzoic and sorbic acids were 1.2 and 0.9 ng/mL, respectively. The method reproducibility was tested by evaluating the intra- and interday precisions; relative standard deviations of less than 4.4 and 9.9%, respectively, were obtained. Recoveries of compounds from spiked food samples ranged from 84.4 to 106%. The developed method was shown to be suitable for the routine monitoring of benzoic and sorbic acids in various types of food samples. 3aacetonitrile 3aacids 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ajuices 3amonitoring 3apH 3aphosphates 3arapid methods 3asolid phase microextraction 3asolvents 2aBenzoic Acidxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aChemical Fractionation 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Analysisxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aMethods 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSolid Phase Microextraction 2aSorbic Acidxanalysisxisolation & purification. 0aBenzoic and sorbic acids 0aIn-tube solid-phase microextraction 0aDiethylamine-modified poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) monolithic capillary1 aWang, Ying 1 aFeng, Yu-Qi 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Aug., v. 388, no. 8 p.1779-1787dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1395-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03473naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002300191245009300214300001600307500001500323520124000338650001801578650002201596650001601618650001201634650002801646650003701674650001201711650001201723650001101735650001601746650002201762650001001784650001901794650002501813650003601838650002101874650001201895650002801907650002501935650002501960650004701985650003302032650004302065650002302108650005302131650004002184650003002224650002402254650003702278650005102315650002802366653001402394653001502408700001802423700001902441700002202460773011302482852000902595856007802604930003302682945002502715946001102740655001202751IND4378466120221121111044.0060306e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437846612DNAL7 a164674112pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using transgenic tobacco plants expressing a GFP-labelled movement protein of the tobacco mosaic virus, it was demonstrated that the interspecific plasmodesmata are open. The transfer of substances in the phloem from host to the parasite is not selective. After simultaneous application of ³H-sucrose and ¹⁴C-labelled phloem-mobile amino acids, phytohormones, and xenobiotica to the host, corresponding percentages of the translocated compounds are found in the parasite. An open continuity between the host phloem and the Cuscuta phloem via the haustorium was demonstrated in CLSM pictures after application of the phloem-mobile fluorescent probes, carboxyfluorescein (CF) and hydroxypyrene trisulphonic acid (HPTS), to the host. Using a Cuscuta bridge ¹⁴C-sucrose and the virus PVY[superscript N] were transferred from one host plant to the another. The results of translocation experiments with labelled compounds, phloem-mobile dyes and the virus should be considered as unequivocal evidence for a symplastic transfer of phloem solutes between Cuscuta species and their compatible hosts. 3aplasmodesmata 3atransgenic plants 3ahost plants 3asucrose 3aplant growth substances 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aCuscuta 3asolutes 3aphloem 3aamino acids 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aweeds 3aPotato virus Y 3afluorescent labeling 3achemical constituents of plants 3aparasitic plants 3atobacco 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aBiological Transport 2aCarbon Radioisotopes 2aCuscutaxcytologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFluorescent Dyesxmetabolism 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aPelargoniumxcytologyxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlasmodesmataxphysiology 2aSucrosexmetabolism 2aTobaccoxcytologyxparasitology. 2aVicia fabaxanatomy & histologyxparasitology. 2aXenobioticsxmetabolism 0ahaustoria 0aparenchyma1 aHaupt, Sophie1 aHofius, Daniel1 aNeumann, Stefanie0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Mar., v. 57, no. 4 p.911-921dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0763Available from publisher's Web site  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03631naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174072001700191100002600208245012300234300001600357500001500373520092100388650002501309650001501334650002101349650001801370650001501388650001401403650001001417650001701427650001501444650002301459650001301482650001801495650002001513650001501533650001201548650002101560650001701581650001901598650005801617650006001675650007301735650002301808650001501831650006501846650003801911650001701949650002001966650002801986650001302014650005602027650001402083650003102097650002402128650006702152650006302219650003102282650003602313653003002349653001002379653001302389700001702402700001502419700001602434700001602450700002102466700002102487773011302508852000902621856007802630930003302708945002502741946001102766655001202777IND4378466720221121111041.0060306e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437846672DNAL7 a164889152pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Unlike most eukaryotes, Arabidopsis thaliana has three RAD21 gene homologues, and their cloning and characterization are reported here. All three genes, AtRAD21.1, AtRAD21.2, and AtRAD21.3, are expressed in tissues rich in cells undergoing cell division, and AtRAD21.3 shows the highest relative level of expression. An increase in steady-state levels of AtRAD21.1 transcript was also observed, specifically after the induction of DNA damage. Phenotypic analysis of the atrad21.1 and atrad21.3 mutants revealed that neither of the single mutants was lethal, probably due to the redundancy in function of the AtRAD21 genes. However, AtRAD21.1 plays a critical role in recovery from DNA damage during seed imbibition, prior to germination, as atrad21.1 mutant seeds are hypersensitive to radiation damage. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aimbibition 3aseed germination 3amessenger RNA 3aDNA damage 3aphenotype 3aseeds 3aplant stress 3achromatids 3aionizing radiation 3amutation 3acell division 3agene expression 3aDNA repair 3amutants 3amultigene family 3aplant damage 3aplant proteins 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aChromosomal Proteins, Non-Histonexgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Damage 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenes, Reporter 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPhenotype 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRadiation, Ionizing 2aSeedlingsxanatomy & histologyxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aSeedsxanatomy & histologyxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0aelectromagnetic radiation 0agenes 0acohesins1 aBhatt, A.

Papers presented at the Society for Experimental Biology's Annual Meeting, July 2005, Barcelona, Spain.  a2019-12-04  aThere is considerable variability in salt tolerance amongst members of the Triticeae, with the tribe even containing a number of halophytes. This is a review of what is known of the differences in salt tolerance of selected species in this tribe of grasses, and the potential to use wild species to improve salt tolerance in wheat. Most investigators have concentrated on differences in ion accumulation in leaves, describing a desirable phenotype with low leaf Na⁺ concentration and a high K⁺/Na⁺ ratio. Little information is available on other traits (such as 'tissue tolerance' of accumulated Na⁺ and Cl⁻) that might also contribute to salt tolerance. The sources of Na⁺ 'exclusion' amongst the various genomes that make up tetraploid (AABB) durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum), hexaploid (AABBDD) bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. ssp. aestivum), and wild relatives (e.g. Aegilops spp., Thinopyrum spp., Elytrigia elongata syn. Lophopyrum elongatum, Hordeum spp.) are described. The halophytes display a capacity for Na⁺ 'exclusion', and in some cases Cl⁻ 'exclusion', even at relatively high salinity. Significantly, it is possible to hybridize several wild species in the Triticeae with durum and bread wheat. Progenitors have been used to make synthetic hexaploids. Halophytic relatives, such as tall wheatgrass spp., have been used to produce amphiploids, disomic chromosome addition and substitution lines, and recombinant lines in wheat. Examples of improved Na⁺ 'exclusion' and enhanced salt tolerance in various derivatives from these various hybridization programmes are given. As several sources of improved Na⁺ 'exclusion' are now known to reside on different chromosomes in various genomes of species in the Triticeae, further work to identify the underlying mechanisms and then to pyramid the controlling genes for the various traits, that could act additively or even synergistically, might enable substantial gains in salt tolerance to be achieved. 3asalt tolerance 3aplant breeding 3aphenotype 3agenetic resistance 3asalinity 3awide hybridization 3agenome 3aion transport 3adurum wheat 3achlorides 3aTriticum aestivum 3asodium 3apotassium 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aadditive gene effects 3awild relatives 3aleaves 2aChimeraxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aGenome, Plant 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPoaceaexclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolyploidy 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aTriticumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aliterature reviews 0awheat1 aFlowers, T.

  1 aScott, Iain10aBIGYIN, an orthologue of human and yeast FIS1 genes functions in the control of mitochondrial size and number in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 1275-1280.  a2019-12-04  aReverse-genetics was used to evaluate the role of an Arabidopsis homologue of the human and yeast FIS1 genes, which are both involved in mitochondrial fission. Two independent T-DNA insertion mutants of gene At3g57090 were identified and genetically transformed to express mitochondria-targeted GFP to enable visualization of mitochondria in vivo. Plants homozygous for either of the recessive T-DNA mutant alleles, termed bigyin1-1 (bgy1-1) and bigyin1-2 (bgy1-2), displayed an abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Disruption of BIGYIN leads to a reduced number of mitochondria per cell, coupled to a large increase in the size of individual mitochondria, relative to wild-type. It is concluded that BIGYIN is an Arabidopsis FIS orthologue and is part of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial division apparatus. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalleles 3ahumans 3asequence alignment 3ayeasts 3atransfer DNA 3acell division 3amitochondria 3amutants 3asequence homology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aMembrane Proteins 2aMitochondriaxphysiology 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutant Proteins 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amitochondrial division 0amitochondrial morphology 0agenes 0amitochondrial size1 aTobin, Alyson K.1 aLogan, David C.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Mar., v. 57, no. 6 p.1275-1280dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0963Available from publisher's Web site  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02801naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003200145245009600177300001600273520148000289650004401769650001901813650001701832650001201849650004401861650001501905650002001920650001601940653003301956653002101989653000802010653000902018653002502027653001302052700002102065700002002086773013402106852000902240856008602249930003302335946001102368655001202379IND4391975420221120141754.0070529e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439197542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-005-0161-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, Gokulakrishnan 10aEffect of surface coverage on the conformation and mobility of C₁₈-modified silica gels  ap. 514-524.  aC₁₈-modified silica gels with surface coverages of 2 to 8.2 μmol m-², were prepared by different synthetic pathways and characterized by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and chromatographic measurements. The effects of temperature and bonding density on the conformational order of C₁₈-modified silica gels were studied in detail by FTIR spectroscopy. The silane functionality and degree of cross-linking of silane ligands on the silica surface were evaluated by ²⁹Si cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) NMR and the structural order and mobility of the alkyl chains were investigated by ¹³C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy. CH₂ symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching bands and CH₂ wagging bands were used as IR probes to monitor the conformational order and flexibility of the alkyl chains in the C₁₈ phases. Qualitative information about the conformational order was obtained from frequency shifts of the CH₂ symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching bands. The relative amounts of kink/gauche-trans-gauche, double-gauche, and end-gauche conformers in the alkyl chains were determined by analysis of CH₂ wagging bands. These results indicate that surface coverage plays a dominant role in the conformational order of C₁₈-modified silica gels. The FTIR and NMR data are discussed in the context of the chromatographic shape-selectivity differences.

  1 aGonzalez-Verdejo, Clara Isabel12aA peroxidase gene expressed during early developmental stages of the parasitic plant Orobanche ramosa  ap. 185-192.  a2019-12-04  aBroomrapes (Orobanche spp.) are holoparasitic weeds that cause devastating losses in many economically important crops. The molecular mechanisms that control the early stages of host infection in Orobanche are poorly understood. In the present study, the role of peroxidase has been examined during pre-infection growth and development of O. ramosa, using an in vitro model system. Peroxidase activity was histochemically localized at the tips of actively growing radicles and nascent attachment organs. Addition of exogenous catalase resulted in a significant reduction in the apical growth rate of the radicle. The prx1 gene encoding a putative class III peroxidase was cloned from a cDNA library of O. ramosa and was found to be expressed specifically during the early stages of the parasitic life cycle. The exogenous addition of sucrose resulted in significantly reduced prx1 transcript levels and in a dramatic change in radicle development from polarized apical growth to isotropic growth and the formation of tubercle-like structures. The results indicate an important role of peroxidases during the early parasitic stages of OROBANCHE: 3aroot tips 3aplant development 3acomplementary DNA 3aroot radicle 3acatalase 3asucrose 3adevelopmental stages 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3agenes 3aroot growth 3anutrient solutions 3aOrobanche ramosa 3anucleotide sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aparasitic plants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression 2aGene Library 2aGermination 2aHistocytochemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrobanchexenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPeroxidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & development 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSucrosexpharmacology 0aperoxidases 0amolecular sequence data1 aBarandiaran, Xabier1 aMoreno, Maria Teresa1 aCubero Salmerón, José Ignacio.1 aDi Pietro, Antonio0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.185-192x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20060228b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02674naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245006900186300001600255520146900271650002301740650001501763650002301778650001301801650001301814650002201827653002501849653002901874653002101903653001901924700002201943700001601965700002201981773013402003852000902137856008602146930003302232946001102265655001202276IND4391182420221120142018.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439118242DNAL7 a173931462pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1255-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Mitsuhiro 10aFiber-packed needle for dynamic extraction of aromatic compounds  ap. 619-625.  aA fiber-packed needle was developed as a novel extraction device for gas-chromatographic analysis of trace organic compounds in aqueous samples. In the extraction device, a bundle of the polymer-coated filaments as the sorbent material was longitudinally packed into a specially designed needle. The extraction was made by pumping the aqueous sample solution into the needle extraction device, and the subsequent desorption process was carried out with a flow of desorption solvent through the needle in a heated gas chromatograph injector. The needle device showed an excellent thermal stability for repeated use without any deterioration of extraction performance, and no carryover effect was observed after the optimization of the desorption conditions. Additionally, the extraction efficiency of the fiber-packed needle could be enhanced by optimizing the number of packed filaments. The selectivity for various compounds could be also tuned using an appropriate combination of the fibrous medium and the coating polymer. The relative standard deviation for run to run was from 3.88 to 4.55% (n = 5), and that for needle to needle was 7.21% (n = 3), clearly suggesting a good repeatability of the needle extraction technique developed. Upon successful optimization of the extraction conditions, a rapid extraction of trace organic compounds from an aqueous sample matrix was successfully demonstrated, where each extraction process was completed within 10 min. 3aaromatic compounds 3adesorption 3agas chromatography 3apolymers 3asolvents 3athermal stability 0aHeat-resistant fiber 0aNeedle extraction device 0aRapid extraction 0aAqueous sample1 aSaito, Yoshihiro 1 aUeta, Ikuo 1 aJinno, Kiyokatsu 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 June, v. 388, no. 3 p.619-625dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1255-63Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02749naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013400164300001600298500001500314520131400329650002201643650001601665650002001681650001601701650001101717650001301728650001301741650001501754650001801769650001601787650002201803650001301825650001801838650002401856650002801880653003001908653003701938653001401975700001701989773013402006852000902140856008602149930003302235946001102268655001202279IND4391180220221120142235.0070506e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439118022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0976-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shengfu.12aA novel amperometric immunosensor based on Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles/chitosan composite film for determination of ferritin  ap. 703-708.  a2019-12-05  aA novel amperometric immunosensor was developed by immobilizing ferritin antibody (FeAb) on the surface of Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles/chitosan composite film modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). This material combined the advantages of inorganic Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles with the organic polymer chitosan. The stepwise assembly procedure of the immunosensor was characterized by means of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and ac impedance. The K₃Fe(CN)₆/K₄Fe(CN)₆ was used as a marker to probe the interface and to determinate ferritin. The factors that could influence the performance of the resulting immunosensor were studied in detail. After the immunosensor was incubated with ferritin for 32 min at 35 °C, the DPV current decreased linearly with the logarithm of ferritin concentration in the range from 20 to 500 ng mL-¹ with a correlation coefficient of 0.995 and a detection limit of 7.0 ng mL-¹. This immunosensor was used to analyze ferritin in human serum samples. The analytical results showed that the developed immunoassay was comparable with the radioimmunoassay (RIA), and the studied immunosensor exhibited good accuracy, high sensitivity, and long-term stability for 3 weeks, which implies a promising alternative approach for detecting ferritin in clinical diagnosis. 3afilms (materials) 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3aferritin 3achitosan 3aantibodies 3aimmunosensors 3airon oxides 3aradioimmunoassays 3apolymers 3ananoparticles 3acomposite materials 3aglassy carbon electrode 0aAmperometric immunosensor 0aFe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles 0aimpedance1 aTan, Yu-Mei 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Jan., v. 387, no. 2 p.703-708dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0976-23Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03006naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157100002200174245006000196300001400256500016000270500001500430520111900445650002501564650001601589650002501605650001601630650002501646650001301671650001801684650001701702650001701719650001201736650002301748650004901771650003001820650002601850650002501876650002901901650005301930650005001983650002402033653002702057653001402084653001102098653002302109700002402132700001802156773008602174852000902260856007802269930003302347945002502380946001102405655001202416IND4376872720221120142048.0051225e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437687272DNAL7 a163038272pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Arabidopsis stomata are patterned iteratively via the orientation of an asymmetric division in a cell located next to an existing stoma. It was found that preprophase bands of microtubules (PPBs) were correctly placed away from stomata and from two types of precursor cells. This suggests that all three cell types participate in an intercellular signalling pathway that orients the division site. These and other asymmetric divisions in the pathway were preceded by a polarized cytoplasm, with the PPB around the nucleus at one end, and the vacuole at the other. PPBs before symmetric divisions of guard mother cells (GMCs) were broader than those in asymmetric divisions, and the GMC division site was marked by unusual end-wall thickenings. This work identifies an accessible system for studying cytoskeletal function and provides a foundation for analysing the role of genes involved in stomatal development. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aguard cells 3acell differentiation 3acell growth 3aspatial distribution 3avacuoles 3acell division 3acell nucleus 3amicrotubules 3astomata 3acell communication 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aCell Divisionxphysiology 2aCytoplasmxphysiology 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicrotubulesxphysiology 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aSignal Transduction 0adevelopmental pathways 0acytoplasm 0aleaves 0aguard mother cells1 aNadeau, Jeanette A.1 aSack, Fred D.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.71-79x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20060301b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03055naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002500191245004400216300001300260500001500273520133900288650001401627650001401641650002301655650002201678650001601700650001201716650001401728650001301742650001701755650001701772650001701789650002301806650001101829650002601840650001601866650003801882650001401920650002501934650002201959650004501981650002602026653001302052653002302065700002102088700002102109700001902130700001902149700002002168773008502188852000902273856007802282930003302360945002502393946001102418655001202429IND4376872420221120142233.0051225e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437687242DNAL7 a163170382pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTodd, Christopher D.10aUpdate on ureide degradation in legumes  ap. 5-12.  a2019-12-04  aWarm season N₂-fixing legumes move fixed N from the nodules to the aerial portions of the plant primarily in the form of ureides, allantoin and allantoate, oxidation products of purines synthesized de novo in the nodule. Ureides are also products of purine turnover in senescing tissues, such as seedling cotyledons. A combination of biochemical and molecular approaches in both crop and model species has shed new light on the metabolic pathways involved in both the synthesis and degradation of allantoin. Improved understanding of ureide biochemistry includes two 'additional' enzymatic steps in the conversion of uric acid to allantoin in the nodule and the mechanism of allantoin and allantoate breakdown in leaf tissue. Ureide accumulation and metabolism in leaves have also been implicated in the feedback inhibition of N₂-fixation under water limitation. Sensitivity to water deficit differs among soybean cultivars. Manganese supplementation has been shown to modify relative susceptibility or tolerance to this process in a cultivar-dependent manner. A discussion of the potential roles for ureides and manganese in the feedback inhibition of N₂-fixation under water limitation is presented. The existing data are examined in relation to potential changes in both aerial carbon and nitrogen supply under water deficit. 3amanganese 3acultivars 3anutrient transport 3anitrogen fixation 3aGlycine max 3aureides 3auric acid 3asoybeans 3aroot nodules 3awater stress 3aaerial parts 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 2aAllantoinxmetabolism 2aDehydration 2aFabaceaexenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aManganese 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aUreaxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aUric Acidxmetabolism 0aFabaceae 0aliterature reviews1 aTipton, Peter A.1 aBlevins, Dale G.1 aPiedras, Pedro1 aPineda, Manuel1 aPolacco, Joe C.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.5-12x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20060301b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03600naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245017300186300001600359520142300375650002401798650001501822650001001837650001201847650001301859650002001872650001701892650002301909650001301932650001201945650002301957650002801980650001802008650001102026650001302037650001702050650001302067650002302080650002402103650003702127650005602164650002002220650001102240650005702251650003102308650002202339650003102361650003002392650002202422650002402444653001702468653002302485653001502508700002002523700001902543700002602562700002202588700002002610773013302630852000902763856008602772930003302858946001102891655001202902IND4391184120221120142231.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439118412DNAL7 a173400782pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1208-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibičar, Darija 10aSimultaneous determination of trace levels of ethylmercury and methylmercury in biological samples and vaccines using sodium tetra(n-propyl)borate as derivatizing agent  ap. 329-340.  aBecause of increasing awareness of the potential neurotoxicity of even low levels of organomercury compounds, analytical techniques are required for determination of low concentrations of ethylmercury (EtHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in biological samples. An accurate and sensitive method has been developed for simultaneous determination of methylmercury and ethylmercury in vaccines and biological samples. MeHg and EtHg were isolated by acid leaching (H₂SO₄-KBr-CuSO₄), extraction of MeHg and EtHg bromides into an organic solvent (CH₂Cl₂), then back-extraction into Milli-Q water. MeHg and EtHg bromides were derivatized with sodium tetrapropylborate (NaBPr₄), collected at room temperature on Tenax, separated by isothermal gas chromatography (GC), pyrolysed, and detected by cold-vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CV AFS). The repeatability of results from the method was approximately 5-10% for EtHg and 5-15% for MeHg. Detection limits achieved were 0.01 ng g-¹ for EtHg and MeHg in blood, saliva, and vaccines and 5 ng g-¹ for EtHg and MeHg in hair. The method presented has been shown to be suitable for determination of background levels of these contaminants in biological samples and can be used in studies related to the health effects of mercury and its species in man. This work illustrates the possibility of using hair and blood as potential biomarkers of exposure to thiomersal. 3aambient temperature 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3aborates 3abromides 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agas chromatography 3aleaching 3amercury 3amethylene chloride 3amethylmercury compounds 3aneurotoxicity 3asaliva 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3avaccines 2aBoratesxchemistry 2aChromatography, Gas 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysis 2aEthylmercury Compoundsxanalysisxbloodxchemistry. 2aHairxchemistry 2aHumans 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxanalysisxbloodxchemistry. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSalivaxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 2aThimerosalxblood 2aVaccinesxchemistry 0aEthylmercury 0aBiological samples 0aThiomersal1 aLogar, Martina 1 aHorvat, Nuša 1 aMarn-Pernat, Andreja 1 aPonikvar, Rafael 1 aHorvat, Milena 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 May, v. 388, no. 2 p.329-340dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1208-03Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03586naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174072001700191100001800208245011800226300001600344500024900360500001500609520117000624650003101794650002601825650003001851650002101881650001601902650001601918650002401934650003101958650002001989650002502009650001302034650002202047650001402069650003402083650001802117650001602135650003002151650001602181650003002197650004202227650002202269650002602291650003102317650002102348650004302369650002402412650005302436650001602489653001202505653002302517653001502540653002802555653001902583700001802602773008802620852000902708856007802717930003302795945002502828946001102853655001202864IND4376945120221120142100.0060101e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437694512DNAL7 a163170402pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Paper presented at the Society for Experimental Biology Plant Frontiers meeting held March 20-23, 2005, Sheffield, UK.  a2019-12-04  aThe perception and subsequent transduction of environmental signals are primary events in the acclimation of living organisms to changes in their environment. Many of the molecular sensors and transducers of environmental stress cannot be identified by traditional and conventional methods. Therefore, the genomic information has been exploited in a systematic approach to this problem, performing systematic mutagenesis of potential sensors and transducers, namely, histidine kinases and response regulators, respectively, in combination with DNA microarray analysis, to examine the genome-wide expression of genes in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Using targeted mutagenesis, 44 out of the 47 histidine kinases and 42 out of the 45 response regulators of this organism have successfully been inactivated. The resultant mutant libraries were screened by genome-wide DNA microarray analysis and by slot-blot hybridization analysis under various stress and non-stress conditions. Histidine kinases have been identified that perceive and transduce signals of low-temperature, hyperosmotic, and salt stress, as well as manganese deficiency. 3anucleic acid hybridization 3amicroarray technology 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aosmotic pressure 3acold stress 3aacclimation 3asignal transduction 3agene expression regulation 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 3agenetic variation 3areceptors 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aCyanobacteria 3asalt stress 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aEnvironment 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aManganesexphysiology 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aSynechococcusxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTemperature 0akinases 0aliterature reviews 0aadaptation 0amolecular sequence data 0aabiotic stress1 aSuzuki, Iwane0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Jan., v. 57, no. 2 p.235-247x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/05/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03319naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245018200179300001600361520124300377650002301620650001201643650001201655650001701667650003001684650001101714650002101725650002001746650002101766650001501787650002101802650000701823650004001830650002501870650001201895650004001907650001601947650004301963650003702006650003002043650004002073650003102113650002402144650002802168650003302196650002402229650003102253653003102284653002602315653003402341653003002375700001602405773013302421852000902554856008602563930003302649946001102682655001202693IND4391185520221120142023.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439118552DNAL7 a173331392pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1198-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Xiao 10aSimultaneous determination of p-hydroxyacetophenone, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in Herba Artemisiae Scopariae by capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection  ap. 475-481.  aCapillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection has been employed for the determination of p-hydroxyacetophenone, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in Herba Artemisiae Scopariae (the dried sprout of Artemisia scoparia Waldst. et Kit.). The effects of several important factors, such as the concentration and the acidity of the running buffer, separation voltage, injection time, and detection potential, were investigated to acquire the optimum conditions. The detection electrode was a 300-μm-diameter carbon disc electrode at a working potential of +0.90 V (relative to the saturated calomel electrode). The three analytes can be well separated within 11 min in a 40-cm-long fused-silica capillary at a separation voltage of 15 kV in 50 mM borate buffer (pH 9.2). The relation between peak current and analyte concentration was linear over about 3 orders of magnitude, with detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio of 3) of 0.31, 0.39, and 0.50 μM for p-hydroxyacetophenone, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid, respectively. The proposed method has been successfully applied to monitor the three bioactive constituents in real plant samples and to differentiate between different herbal drugs with satisfactory assay results. 3aArtemisia scoparia 3aacidity 3aborates 3acaffeic acid 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acarbon 3achlorogenic acid 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aherbal medicines 3apH 2aAcetophenonesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aArtemisiaxchemistry 2aBuffers 2aCaffeic Acidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aCalibration 2aChlorogenic Acidxanalysisxchemistry. 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxchemistry 2aElectrochemistryxmethods 2aElectrophoresis, Capillaryxmethods 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlant Shootsxchemistry 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aRegression Analysis 2aReproducibility of Results 0aHerba Artemisiae Scopariae 0ap-Hydroxyacetophenone 0aChlorogenic and caffeic acids 0aElectrochemical detection1 aChen, Gang 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 May, v. 388, no. 2 p.475-481dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1198-y3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03089naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002200191245012500213300001600338500001500354520111900369650001701488650001601505650002101521650001701542650002901559650001201588650002401600650002101624650003601645650002001681650001701701650003201718650005401750650004101804650003901845650004101884650002501925650001901950650003401969650003802003650002702041650004802068653001802116653002302134653001602157653001102173700002202184773011302206852000902319856007802328930003302406945002502439946001102464655001202475IND4378464220221120142031.0060306e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437846422DNAL7 a164738932pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSharma, Shanti S.14aThe significance of amino acids and amino acid-derived molecules in plant responses and adaptation to heavy metal stress  ap. 711-726.  a2019-12-04  aPlants exposed to heavy metals accumulate an array of metabolites, some to high millimolar concentrations. This review deals with N-containing metabolites frequently preferentially synthesized under heavy metal stress such as Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn. Special focus is given to proline, but certain other amino acids and oligopeptides, as well as betaine, polyamines, and nicotianamine are also addressed. Particularly for proline a large body of data suggests significant beneficial functions under metal stress. In general, the molecules have three major functions, namely metal binding, antioxidant defence, and signalling. Strong correlative and mechanistic experimental evidence, including work with transgenic plants and algae, has been provided that indicates the involvement of metal-induced proline in metal stress defence. Histidine, other amino acids and particularly phytochelatins and glutathione play a role in metal binding, while polyamines function as signalling molecules and antioxidants. Their accumulation needs to be considered as active response and not as consequence of metabolic dys-regulation. 3aplant stress 3aglutathione 3achelating agents 3aheavy metals 3ametabolic detoxification 3aproline 3asignal transduction 3aplant adaptation 3achemical constituents of plants 3ametal tolerance 3aantioxidants 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aAmino Acidsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxphysiology. 2aGlutathionexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aHistidinexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMetals, Heavyxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhytochelatins 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPolyaminesxmetabolism 2aProlinexchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aoligopeptides 0aliterature reviews 0aamino acids 0aplants1 aDietz, Karl-Josef0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Mar., v. 57, no. 4 p.711-726dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0733Available from publisher's Web site  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03877naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002000191245010100211300001600312500024900328500001500577520172400592650001902316650002002335650001302355650002602368650002402394650002002418650001602438650002202454650001902476650001102495650002002506650006102526650004002587650003002627650003102657650002202688650001002710650002302720650003802743650005202781650002402833653001502857653002802872653002302900653001102923700001702934700002202951700002202973773008802995852000903083856007803092930003303170945002503203946001103228655001203239IND4376946320221120141907.0060101e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437694632DNAL7 a161576532pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/eri2792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Atkin, A.M. Borland, and A. Hodge.  Paper presented at the Society for Experimental Biology Plant Frontiers meeting held March 20-23, 2005, Sheffield, UK.  a2019-12-04  aAlthough leaf senescence results in a loss of photosynthetic carbon fixation, the senescence-dependent release of nutrients, especially of nitrogen, is important for the growth of young leaves and for reproduction. Environmental regulation of senescence is therefore a vital factor in the carbon and nitrogen economy of plants. Leaf senescence is a highly plastic trait that is affected by a range of different environmental factors including light, nutrient supply, CO₂ concentration, and abiotic and biotic stress. In this review, the focus is on the impact of environmental conditions on sugar accumulation and sugar signalling during senescence. By signalling a high availability of carbon relative to nitrogen in the old leaves, sugar accumulation can trigger leaf senescence. Sugar-induced senescence is therefore particularly important under low nitrogen availability and may also play a role in light signalling. Whether or not sugars are involved in regulating the senescence response of plants to elevated CO₂ remains unresolved. Senescence can be delayed or accelerated in elevated CO₂ and no clear relationship between sugar accumulation and senescence has been found. Plasticity in the response to environmental factors, such as daylength and sugar accumulation, varies between different Arabidopsis accessions. This natural variation can be exploited to analyse the genetic basis of the regulation of senescence and the consequences for growth and fecundity. Different evolutionary strategies, i.e. early senescence combined with a high reproductive effort or late senescence combined with a low reproductive effort, may be an important adaptation of Arabidopsis accessions to their natural habitat. 3acarbon dioxide 3aplant nutrition 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3asignal transduction 3alight intensity 3aacclimation 3agenetic variation 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 2aAcclimatization 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxphysiology 2aCarbohydratesxphysiology 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aGenetic Variation 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 0asenescence 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0aliterature reviews 0aplants1 aPurdy, Sarah1 aMacLean, Jamie A.1 aPourtau, Nathalie0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Jan., v. 57, no. 2 p.391-399x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eri2793Available from publisher's Web site  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/05/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03104naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002400191245008600215300001600301500014400317500001500461520120600476650002001682650001701702650001801719650001101737650002701748650001601775650001901791650002601810650000801836650002001844650001501864650001701879650001201896650003601908650002601944650003401970650003102004650005902035650004602094650002702140653002302167653001102190653001102201653003302212773011302245852000902358856007802367930003302445945002502478946001102503655001202514IND4378464520221120141850.0060306e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437846452DNAL7 a164674102pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fred10aSalivary secretions by aphids interacting with proteins of phloem wound responses  ap. 739-745.  aPaper presented at a session on "Phloem-Insect Interaction" at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Meeting, 2005, Barcelona, Spain.  a2019-12-04  aSuccessful phloem feeding requires overcoming a number of phloem-related plant properties and reactions. The most important hurdle is formed by the phloem wound responses, such as coagulating proteins in the phloem sieve elements of the plant and in the capillary food canal in the insect's mouth parts, i.e. the stylets. It seems that in order to prevent protein clogging inside a sieve element, ejection of watery saliva plays an important role. This ejection is detected in the electrical penetration graph (EPG) as E1 salivation and always precedes phloem sap ingestion. During this feeding from sieve elements, another regular and concurrent salivation also occurs, the watery E2 salivation. This E2 saliva is added to the ingested sap and, it probably prevents phloem proteins from clogging inside the capillary food canal. Whatever the biochemical mode of action of the inhibition of protein coagulation might be, in some plants aphids do not seem to be able to prevent clogging, which may explain the resistance to aphids in these plants. The relevance of this hypothesis is demonstrated by new experimental results and is related to new EPG results from plants with phloem-located resistance. 3aprotein binding 3ainsect pests 3atissue repair 3asaliva 3aplant-insect relations 3aplant pests 3asieve elements 3aresistance mechanisms 3asap 3apest resistance 3aAphidoidea 3aplant damage 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aElectric Conductivity 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlantsxanatomy & histologyxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aSalivaxchemistryxphysiologyxsecretion. 2aSalivationxphysiology 0aliterature reviews 0aphloem 0aplants 0aelectrical penetration graph0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Mar., v. 57, no. 4 p.739-745dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0883Available from publisher's Web site  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03841naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174072001700191100002200208245009700230300001600327500014400343500001500487520147300502650001301975650000801988650001901996650002002015650003002035650001802065650001802083650001602101650002002117650002602137650002502163650001902188650002302207650001802230650001702248650001602265650002702281650002902308650001102337650002002348650001302368650001202381650003002393650003802423650001802461650001302479650002602492650003102518650002102549650004802570650002902618650002302647650002702670650002402697653002302721653002602744653001102770700002102781773011302802852000902915856007802924930003303002945002503035946001103060655001203071IND4378464720221120141833.0060306e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437846472DNAL7 a164954092pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

These insects have evolved to survive on a nutritionally imbalanced diet of phloem sap, and to minimize wound responses in their host plants. As a consequence, plant perception of and responses to PFIs differ from plant interactions with other insect-feeding guilds. Transcriptome-wide analyses of gene expression are currently being applied to characterize plant responses to PFIs in crop plants with race-specific innate resistance, as well as in compatible interactions with susceptible hosts. Recent studies indicate that PFIs induce transcriptional reprogramming in their host plants, and that plant responses to PFIs appear to be quantitatively and qualitatively different from responses to other insects or pathogens. Transcript profiling studies also suggest that PFIs induce cell wall modifications, reduce photosynthetic activity, manipulate source-sink relations, and modify secondary metabolism in their hosts, and many of these responses appear to occur within the phloem tissue. Plant responses to these insects appear to be regulated in part by the salicylate, jasmonate, and ethylene signalling pathways. As additional transcript profiling data become available, forward and reverse genetic approaches will be necessary to determine which changes in gene expression influence resistance or susceptibility to PFIs. 3aethylene 3asap 3asalicylic acid 3apest resistance 3asource-sink relationships 3atissue repair 3ajasmonic acid 3aplant pests 3agene expression 3asecondary metabolites 3acell wall components 3aphotosynthesis 3adefense mechanisms 3amessenger RNA 3ainsect pests 3ahost plants 3aplant-insect relations 3atranscription (genetics) 3aphloem 3anutritive value 3agenomics 2aAnimals 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenomics 2aHemipteraxphysiology 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aOxidative Stress 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aRNA, Plantxbiosynthesis 2aSalivaxphysiology 2aSalivationxphysiology 2aSignal Transduction 0aliterature reviews 0aresistance mechanisms 0aplants1 aGoggin, Fiona L.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Mar., v. 57, no. 4 p.755-766dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj1353Available from publisher's Web site  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03282naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157100001400174245014500188300001600333500001500349520161200364650002001976650000901996650003602005650001702041650001502058650002002073650001302093650001402106650001702120650001802137650002202155650002302177650002902200650005002229650006502279650002902344650004202373650003702415653001702452700002602469773011302495852000902608856007802617930003302695945002502728946001102753655001202764IND4378465420221120141819.0060306e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437846542DNAL7 a164674122pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erj0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHaga, Ken10aAsymmetric distribution of auxin correlates with gravitropism and phototropism but not with autostraightening (autotropism) in pea epicotyls  ap. 837-847.  a2019-12-04  aThe relationships between the distribution of the native auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and tropisms in the epicotyl of red light-grown pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings have been investigated. The distribution measurement was made in a defined zone of the third internode, using ³H-IAA applied from the plumule as a tracer. The tropisms investigated were gravitropism, pulse-induced phototropism, and time-dependent phototropism. The investigation was extended to the phase of autostraightening (autotropism) that followed gravitropic curvature. It was found that IAA is asymmetrically distributed between the two halves of the zone, with a greater IAA level occurring on the convex side, at early stages of gravitropic and phototropic curvatures. This asymmetry was found in epidermal peels and, except for one case (pulse-induced phototropism), no asymmetry was detected in whole tissues. It was concluded, in support of earlier results, that auxin asymmetry mediates gravitropism and phototropism and that the epidermis or peripheral cell layers play an important role in the establishment of auxin asymmetry in pea epicotyls. During autostraightening, which results from a reversal of growth asymmetry, the extent of IAA asymmetry was reduced, but its direction was not reversed. This result demonstrated that autostraightening is not regulated through auxin distribution. In this study, the growth on either side of the investigated zone was also measured. In some cases, the measured IAA distribution could not adequately explain the local growth rate, necessitating further detailed investigation. 3aseedling growth 3apeas 3achemical constituents of plants 3agravitropism 3ainternodes 3alight intensity 3aduration 3aepicotyls 3aphototropism 3aPisum sativum 3aepidermis (plant) 3aindole acetic acid 2aGravitropismxphysiology 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPeasxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPhototropismxphysiology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & development. 0aplant growth1 aIino, M.q(Moritoshi)0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Mar., v. 57, no. 4 p.837-847dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erj0693Available from publisher's Web site  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03841naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003200164245020200196300001600398500001500414520133100429650001601760650001101776650002001787650001201807650001001819650001101829650002401840650001501864650001801879650001701897650001801914650004301932650001601975650001301991650002702004650001602031650001002047650002302057650001602080650005002096650002702146650003802173650002102211650001702232650001102249650000902260650001602269650002402285650002402309650002502333650004502358650002202403650003202425650003102457650003202488651001302520651001302533653000902546653002702555653003702582653004502619653001702664700001902681700002202700700001602722700002402738773013402762852000902896856008602905930003302991946001103024655001203035IND4391165620221120141829.0070506e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439116562DNAL7 a169243812pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0628-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChetiyanukornkul, Thaneeya 10aSimultaneous determination of urinary hydroxylated metabolites of naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene as multiple biomarkers of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  ap. 712-718.  a2019-12-05  aA method is presented for determining monohydroxy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OHPAHs) having 2-, 3- and 4-rings in human urine by using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. A urine sample containing conjugates of OHPAHs was hydrolysed in the presence of β-glucuronidase/aryl sulfatase and the solution was cleaned up with a solid-phase extraction (C₁₈ and silica). Eight OHPAHs, namely 1- and 2-hydroxynaphthalenes, 2-hydroxyfluorene, 2-, 3- and 4-hydroxyphenanthrenes, 3-hydroxyfluoranthene and 1-hydroxypyrene, were separated and 1- and 9-hydroxyphenanthrenes co-eluted on an alkylamide-type reversed-phase column with fluorimetric detection. The urinary concentrations of OHPAHs were quantified by using deuterated 1-hydoxypyrene as an internal standard. The method showed good repeatability for inter- and intra-day precisions as well as good linearity of calibration curves (r ² ranged from 0.996 to 0.999). The limits of detection (S/N=3) were in the range from 2.3 fmol to 2.2 pmol per injection. This method was successfully applied to urine samples from non-smoking taxi drivers, traffic policemen and rural villagers of Chiang Mai, Thailand. The results showed higher urinary concentrations of OHPAHs in rural villagers, consistent with higher respiratory exposure to PAHs. 3afluorometry 3asilica 3adetection limit 3atraffic 3aurine 3ahumans 3ainhalation exposure 3abiomarkers 3aarylsulfatase 3afluorescence 3aphenanthrenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anaphthalene 3acleaning 3asolid phase extraction 3ametabolites 2aAdult 2aBiomarkersxurine. 2aCalibration 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFluorenesxurine 2aFluorescence 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Structure 2aNaphthalenesxurine 2aPhenanthrenesxurine 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxurine. 2aPyrenesxanalysis 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 3aThailand 0aThailand 0aHPLC 0aFluorescence detection 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aHydroxy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aphenanthrene1 aToriba, Akira 1 aKameda, Takayuki 1 aTang, Ning 1 aHayakawa, Kazuichi 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 Oct., v. 386, no. 3 p.712-718dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0628-63Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01887naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009300168300001600261520081100277650000801088650002501096650002701121650001401148650001501162650003701177650001101214700002801225700002301253773013401276852000901410856008601419939003301505946001101538655001201549IND4391168120221120142043.0070506e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439116812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0704-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, Jan T. 10aPolycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles as information carriers in environmental studies  ap. 891-905.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a huge role in environmental analytical chemistry, both as pollutants and as markers for many processes. On the other hand, polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs; heterocyclic compounds related to PAHs) have been studied far less intensely, but such studies may lead to a great deal of information not available through the study of PAHs. Here we discuss analytical aspects of PASHs in environmental matrices and their use as information carriers. Since PASHs accompany PAHs in sampling and work-up, it is not necessary to expend much extra analytical effort in order to analyze them. This work reviews how they can provide information on diverse processes such as petroleum, industrial and vehicular pollution, and sources of air and marine pollution. 3aair 3aanalytical chemistry 3aheterocyclic compounds 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asulfur1 aHegazi, Abdelrahman H. 1 aRoberz, Benedikte 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 Oct., v. 386, no. 4 p.891-905dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0704-y3Available from publisher's Web site.  a00000000b00000000c20111102  aNon-US 7aarticle02448naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011400146300001600260520095100276650002101227650002701248650002501275650002801300650002501328650001701353650001601370650002401386650002601410650004001436650002101476650003301497650001601530650007201546650003101618650005001649650002601699700001601725700001701741700001701758773013701775852000901912930003301921945001301954946001101967655001201978IND2333094720221120141938.0030617e20030528ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233309472DNAL7 a127707132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadenhop, F.10aExpression and biochemical characterization of the 1-HO-carotenoid methylase CrtF from Rhodobacter capsulatus  ap. 237-242.  aIn purple bacteria, acyclic 1-methoxy carotenoids like spheroidene or spirilloxanthin are essential components of the photosynthetic apparatus. One of the last steps of their biosynthesis involves O-methylation of the 1-hydroxy group. The 1-HO-carotenoid methylase CrtF from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyzing this type of reaction was expressed in Escherichia coli in an active form. It was then purified by affinity chromatography and biochemically characterized. The enzymatic reaction depends on S-adenosylmethionine as the only cofactor. By complementation in E. coli, the substrate specificity of the enzyme was determined. It could be shown that the enzyme converts not only all possible 1-hydroxy carotenoids in the spheroidene/1'-HO-spheroidene biosynthetic pathway of R. capsulatus but also carotenoid intermediates leading to the formation of spirilloxanthin in a pathway which is absent in R. capsulatus but present in related species. 3aEscherichia coli 3aRhodobacter capsulatus 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3aaffinity chromatography 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3aenzymatic reactions 3asubstrate specificity 2aCarotenoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMethylation 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aRhodobacter capsulatusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aSteiger, S.1 aSandmann, M.1 aSandmann, G.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 May 28, v. 222, no. 2 p.237-242aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02106naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245009000142300001400232520118500246650002901431700001401460700001801474700001601492700001601508700002701524700001801551700001501569700001601584773013501600852000901735945002501744946001101769655001201780IND4361221120221120141822.0040203e20031205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436122112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aUchida, H.10aPurification and characterization of an aldehyde oxidase from Pseudomonas sp. KY 4690  ap. 31-36.  aAn aldehyde oxidase, which oxidizes various aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes using O₂ as an electron acceptor, was purified from the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas sp. KY 4690, a soil isolate, to an electrophoretically homogeneous state. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 132 kDa and consisted of three non-identical subunits with molecular masses of 88, 39, and 18 kDa. The absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme showed characteristics of an enzyme belonging to the xanthine oxidase family. The enzyme contained 0.89 mol of flavin adenine dinucleotide, 1.0 mol of molybdenum, 3.6 mol of acid-labile sulfur, and 0.90 mol of 5'-CMP per mol of enzyme protein, on the basis of its molecular mass of 145 kDa. Molecular oxygen served as the sole electron acceptor. These results suggest that aldehyde oxidase from Pseudomonas sp. KY 4690 is a new member of the xanthine oxidase family and might contain 1 mol of molybdenum-molybdpterin-cytosine dinucleotide, 1 mol of flavin adenine dinucleotide, and 2 mol of [2Fe-2S] clusters per mol of enzyme protein. The enzyme showed high reaction rates toward various aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and high thermostability. 3aaldehyde oxidoreductases1 aKondo, D.1 aYamashita, A.1 aNagaosa, Y.1 aSakurai, T.1 aFujii, Y.q(Yoshiyuki)1 aFujishiro, K.1 aAisaka, K.1 aUwajima, T.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Dec. 5, v. 229, no. 1 p.31-36aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03228naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245006300147300001600210520152800226650002201754650002701776650002201803650002201825650001201847650002001859650003101879650001801910650001601928650000901944650001601953650001201969650001301981650001401994650001202008650001202020650001402032650002502046650002102071650007502092650002002167650004202187650000902229650001602238650002302254650002802277650001402305653001402319653002702333700001702360700001902377700001502396773013702411852000902548930003302557945001302590946001102603655001202614IND2333094920221120142020.0030617e20030528ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233309492DNAL7 a127707182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolovliov, I.12aA method for allelic replacement in Francisella tularensis  ap. 273-280.  aA vector for mutagenesis of Francisella tularensis was constructed based on the pUC19 plasmid. By inserting the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis, oriT of plasmid RP4, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene of Shigella flexneri, a vector, pPV, was obtained that allowed specific mutagenesis. A protocol was developed that allowed introduction of the vector into the live vaccine strain, LVS, of F. tularensis by conjugation. As a proof of principle, we aimed to develop a specific mutant defective in expression of a 23-kDa protein (iglC) that we previously have shown to be prominently upregulated during intracellular growth of F. tularensis. A plasmid designated pPV-delta iglC was developed that contained only the regions flanking the encoding gene, iglC. By a double crossover event, the chromosomal iglC gene was deleted. However, the resulting strain, denoted delta iglC1, still had an intact iglC gene. Southern blot analysis verified that LVS harbors two copies for the iglC gene. The mutagenesis was therefore repeated and a mutant defective in both iglC alleles, designated delta iglC1+2, was obtained. The delta iglC1+2 strain, in contrast to delta iglC1, was shown to display impaired intracellular macrophage growth and to be attenuated for virulence in mice. The developed genetic system has the potential to provide a tool to elucidate virulence mechanisms of F. tularensis and the specific F. tularensis mutant illustrates the critical role of the 23-kDa protein, iglC, for the virulence of F. tularensis LVS. 3aBacillus subtilis 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aShigella flexneri 3aSouthern blotting 3aalleles 3achloramphenicol 3agene expression regulation 3alive vaccines 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aplasmids 3avirulence 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aEscherichia coli 2aFrancisella tularensisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aGenetic Vectors 2aMacrophages, Peritonealxmicrobiology 2aMice 2aMutagenesis 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aTularemiaxmicrobiology 2aVirulence 0adeletions 0aintracellular survival1 aSjostedt, A.1 aMokrievich, A.1 aPavlov, V.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 May 28, v. 222, no. 2 p.273-280aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01936naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001300178245011500191300001600306520108200322650002701404700001601431700001501447773013901462852000901601945002501610946001101635655001201646IND4361291320221120080912.0040213e20030926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436129132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

(2002) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 213, 251-255]. The insecticidal metabolites of this mutant were studied further. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis indicated that the mutant isolate lost the ability to produce cyclic peptide toxins, destruxins, both in vitro and in vivo. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the mutant concurrently lost a 1.05 Mb (approximately) chromosome, demonstrating for the first time that a conditionally dispensable (CD) chromosome exists in the insect pathogenic fungus, M. anisopliae. Concurrence of losing the ability to produce destruxins and a CD chromosome in the mutant suggests that the toxin synthetase genes of M. anisopliae are located on this CD chromosome, as similarly described for plant pathogenic fungi. Semi-quantitative api ZYM analysis showed more biochemical disparities between the mutant and the wild-type strain. 3aentomopathogenic fungi1 aSkrobek, A.1 aButt, T.M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2003 Sept. 26, v. 226, no. 2 p.373-378aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02174naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245011400163300001800277300002300295520081100318650002901129650001301158650002501171650001501196650002801211650002001239650004001259650002101299650003601320650003501356650003201391650002501423650002501448650005601473650002801529653001501557700001701572773008401589852000901673939003301682946001301715655001201728IND8801683920221120080520.0880616e198806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880168392DNAL7 a29672842pmid7 aPMC2112022pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrada, D.10aCoincident localization of secretory and plasma membrane proteins inorganelles of the yeast secretory pathway  ap. 2775-2783.  ap. 2775-2783. ill.  aAstract: Immunoelectron microscopy of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells embedded in Lowicryl K4M has been used to localize invertase and plasma membrane(PM) AtPase in secretory organelles, sec mutant cells incubated at 37 degrees C were prepared for electron microscopy, and thin sections were incubated with polyclonal antibodies, followed by decoration with protein A-gold.

The process of understanding and describing feed degradation mechanisms in the equine digestive system in general, and in the hindgut ecosystem in particular, is essential. Regardless of its importance for the nutritional status of the host, the significance of the cecum-colon ecosystem has not yet been fully understood, and few reports have focused deeply on the contribution of the hindgut microbial population to the nitrogen and energy requirements of the horse. Compared to ruminal activity, very little is known about hindgut ecosystem activity in the horse. Information concerning the metabolism of this microbial population and its requirements is lacking. The use of internal bacterial markers for quantifying microbial outflow in ruminants is widely reported. These techniques can be applied to cecum-colon microbial quantification, contributing to a better characterization of this ecosystem. It is likely wrong to believe that the optimization strategy in the hindgut is similar to what happens in the rumen – that is, to maximize microbial growth and, therefore, fermentation. If we consider the type of substrate that, in normal conditions, arrives in the hindgut, we can expect it to be nitrogen limiting, providing limited nitrogen-based substrates for microbial fermentation. In this review paper, we intend to gather existing information on the equine ecosystem and to provide future perspectives of research. 3ahorses 3acecum 3acolon 3aenergy requirements 3anitrogen 3ahindgut 3aecosystems 3amicrobial activity 0aliterature reviews1 aRodrigues, M.A.M.1 aBessa, R.J.B.1 aFerreira, L.M.1 aMartin-Rosset, W.0 tAnimal.g2011 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.48-56dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100015883Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/01/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02989naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001800186245011100204300001800315500002400333500001500357520143000372650001901802650000901821650001401830650002101844650001801865650001501883650001701898650001701915650002001932650002301952650000701975650001001982650001301992650001502005650001402020653002202034653002702056700001302083700001702096700001602113700001902129700001802148773009002166852000902256856008902265930003302354945002502387946001102412655001202423IND4411214220221120055835.0081010e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441121422DNAL7 a220638742pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ112 0aQ5021 aSchneider, J.10aFluorimetric detection of protoporphyrins as an indicator for quality monitoring of fresh intact pork meat  ap. 1320-1325.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn fresh meat production fast and non-destructive quality monitoring along the distribution chain is a key aspect to guaranteeing high quality and safe products for consumption. The applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy using protoporphyrins as indicators for meat ageing was investigated. Porcine musculus longissimus dorsi (MLD) was stored in slices over 20 days at 5 and 12°C and measured every day with an excitation of 420nm and an emission range of 550-750nm. Additionally, pH, drip loss and colour were examined to assess possible correlations. The obtained spectra of the MLD showed an increase in three peaks at 592, 638 and 705nm which could be reconstructed using the spectra of standard solutions of protoporphyrin IX (PP) and zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) or magnesium protoporphyrin (MgPP), respectively. Using principal component analysis (PCA) on the fluorescence spectral data, the meat slices stored at 5°C showed differences in the fluorescence signal after the 10th day and 5th day when stored at 12°C. An interrelationship between the additional analyses and the fluorescence intensities on these relevant days could not be established. In conclusion, the increase of ZnPP fluorescence due to temperature related changes of physiological meat properties is capable of serving as a quality indicator with regards to inadequate conditioning (e.g. during transportation and/or storage) of pork meat. 3aprotoporphyrin 3apork 3adrip loss 3ameat composition 3afood analysis 3amonitoring 3ameat quality 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3alongissimus muscle 3apH 3acolor 3araw meat 3ameat aging 3adetection 0alongissimus dorsi 0afluorimetric detection1 aWulf, J.1 aSurowsky, B.1 aSchmidt, H.1 aSchwägele, F.1 aSchlüter, O.0 tMeat science.g2008 Dec., v. 80, no. 4 p.1320-1325dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.06.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090128b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/12/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02557naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002100195245014400216300001800360500002400378520102400402650002301426650002401449650001801473650002101491650001701512650001301529650001701542650001601559650001701575650001701592650001701609650002001626650002101646650001201667653003001679653002301709653003001732700002001762773009001782852000901872856008901881930003301970945002502003946001102028655001202039IND4411214320221120055948.0081010e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441121432DNAL7 a220638752pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ103 0aQ113 0aQ5031 aTeets, Amanda S.10aInhibition of lipid oxidation in refrigerated and frozen salted raw minced chicken breasts with electron beam irradiated almond skin powder  ap. 1326-1332.  aIncludes references  aAntioxidant effects of electron beam irradiated almond skin powder (ASP) in raw minced chicken breasts (MCB) during refrigerated and frozen storage were studied.

Some of them display large seasonal variations in their annual breeding season, while others display a moderate seasonality or sexual activity all year round. This reproductive seasonality causes seasonality of milk, cheese and meat productions and, as a consequence, induces wide variation in producer incomes. To solve this problem and provide methods allowing producers to breed animals during the anestrous period and stabilize production all year round, it is necessary to have a deep knowledge of their annual sexual activity and to identify the environmental factors controlling the timing of the annual reproductive cycle. Then, it is possible to build on these knowledge sustainable breeding techniques adapted to the environmental, economic and social characteristics of the local breeding system. In this review, I will illustrate this strategy through the example of our experiments in subtropical goats. First, we determined the characteristics of the annual breeding season in both male and female goats. Second, we identified the photoperiod as the major environmental factor controlling the timing of this annual breeding season. Third, we used the photoperiod to stimulate indirectly the sexual behavior of does. Indeed, we used photoperiodic treatments to stimulate the sexual activity of bucks during the non-breeding season. These sexually active male goats were then used to induce and synchronize the estrous behavior and ovulatory activity of anestrous females in confined or grazing conditions by using the ‘male effect’. Under subtropical conditions, these results constitute an original manner to control the reproductive activity of local goats using the photoperiod combined with the ‘male effect.’ 3abreed differences 3asubtropics 3agoats 3amales 3aseasonal variation 3aphotoperiod 3aanimal breeding 3afemales 3abreeding season 0aliterature reviews 0aenvironmental factors0 tAnimal.g2011 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.74-81dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100014003Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/01/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03391naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001600163245010100179300001400280500002400294500001500318520202000333650000902353650001502362650001302377650001202390650001502402650001902417650001102436650001202447650001602459650001502475650002202490650002302512651001302535653001702548653001402565700002002579700001502599700001902614773008902633852000902722856008502731930003302816945002502849946001102874655001202885IND4446946620221120055851.0101228e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444694662DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311100015152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aBezabih, M.10aEvaluation of n-alkanes and their carbon isotope enrichments (δ13C) as diet composition markers  ap. 57-66.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlant cuticular n-alkanes have been successfully used as markers to estimate diet composition and intake of grazing herbivores. However, additional markers may be required under grazing conditions in botanically diverse vegetation. This study was conducted to describe the n-alkane profiles and the carbon isotope enrichment of n-alkanes of common plant species from the Mid Rift Valley rangelands of Ethiopia, and evaluate their potential use as nutritional markers. A total of 23 plant species were collected and analysed for long-chain n-alkanes ranging from heptacosane to hexatriacontane (C27 to C36), as well as their carbon isotopic ratio (13C/12C). The analysis was conducted by gas chromatography/combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry following saponification, extraction and purification. The isotopic composition of the n-alkanes is reported in the delta notation (δ13C) relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard. The dominant n-alkanes in the species were C31 (mean ± s.d., 283 ± 246 mg/kg dry matter) and C33 (149 ± 98 mg/kg dry matter). The carbon isotopic enrichment of the n-alkanes ranged from −19.37‰ to −37.40‰. Principal component analysis was used to examine interspecies differences based on n-alkane profiles and the carbon isotopic enrichments of individual n-alkanes. Large variability among the pasture species was observed. The first three principal components explained most of the interspecies variances. Comparison of the principal component scores using orthogonal procrustes rotation indicated that about 0.84 of the interspecies variances explained by the two types of data sets were independent of each other, suggesting that the use of a combination of the two markers can improve diet composition estimations. It was concluded that, while the n-alkane profile of the pasture species remains a useful marker for use in the study region, the δ13C values of n-alkanes can provide additional information in discriminating diet components of grazing animals. 3adiet 3abiomarkers 3aisotopes 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3asaponification 3acarbon 3aalkanes 3afeed intake 3aextraction 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3aEthiopia 0apurification 0an-alkanes1 aPellikaan, W.F.1 aTolera, A.1 aHendriks, W.H.0 tAnimal.g2011 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.57-66dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100015153Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/01/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03109naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002100195245009300216300001600309500002400325500001500349520159900364650002001963650003201983650001602015650001702031650002002048650001802068650002002086650002402106650002502130650001702155650001302172650001402185653003102199653001402230653002302244653001802267700001802285700002102303773008802324852000902412856008902421930003302510945002502543946001102568655001202579IND4411214820221120055923.0081010e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441121482DNAL7 a220638242pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aQ502 0aQ1021 aDemeyer, Daniël14aThe World Cancer Research Fund report 2007: A challenge for the meat processing industry  ap. 953-959.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOne of the 10 universal guidelines for healthy nutrition in a report of the World Cancer Research Fund released at the end of 2007 is to “limit intake of red meat and avoid processed meat”, as a result of the “convincing evidence” for an association with an increased risk of colorectal cancer development. In the present paper, the scientific evidence for the association between processed meats intake and colorectal cancer development is explored and the most probable hypothesis on the mechanism underlying this relationship formulated. It seems that the present state of knowledge is not well understood but relates to a combination of haem iron, oxidative stress, formation of N-nitroso compounds and related residues in the digestive tract as the causal factors. Although criticisms of the inaccurate definition of processed meats and the insufficient accounting for the large variability in composition of meat products have been expressed, it is clear that the report urges proper action by the meat and nutrition research community and the meat industry. Research items that in our view should be addressed are discussed. They include: (1) evaluating the health risks associated with processed meats intake within the context of the supply of beneficial nutrients and other nutrition associated health risks; (2) definition of the role of nitrites and nitrates in meat processing; (3) investigating the role of red and processed meats on the endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds in the digestive tract; and (4) developing improved processed meats using new ingredients. 3anutrient intake 3alivestock and meat industry 3acured meats 3anitrosamines 3ameat processing 3afood industry 3aprocessed foods 3abiomedical research 3acolorectal neoplasms 3asalt content 3ared meat 3aheme iron 0aWorld Cancer Research Fund 0aneoplasms 0aliterature reviews 0aN-nitrosamine1 aHonikel, Karl1 aDe Smet, Stefaan0 tMeat science.g2008 Dec., v. 80, no. 4 p.953-959dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.06.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090128b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02773naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100002100177245008900198300001800287500002400305500001500329520138500344650002401729650002101753650001301774650001801787650001201805650002301817650001701840650000901857650001001866650002301876650001701899650001501916653002201931700001601953700001801969700001601987700001902003773009002022852000902112856008902121930003302210945002502243946001102268655001202279IND4411213620221120050513.0081010e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441121362DNAL7 a220638682pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5021 aJackman, Patrick10aPrediction of beef eating quality from colour, marbling and wavelet texture features  ap. 1273-1281.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBeef longissimus dorsi colour, marbling fat and surface texture are long established properties that are used in some countries by expert graders to classify beef carcasses, with subjective and inconsistent decision. As a computer vision system can deliver objective and consistent decisions rapidly and is capable of handling a greater variety of image features, attempts have been made to develop computerised predictions of eating quality based on these and other properties but have failed to adequately model the variation in eating quality. Therefore, in this study, examination of the ribeye at high magnification and consideration of a broad range of colour and marbling fat features was used to attempt to provide better information on beef eating quality. Wavelets were used to describe the image texture of the beef surface at high magnification rather than classical methods such as run lengths, difference histograms and co-occurrence matrices. Sensory panel and Instron analyses were performed on duplicate steaks to measure the quality of the beef. Using the classical statistical method of partial least squares regression (PLSR) it was possible to model a very high proportion of the variation in eating quality (r ² =0.88 for sensory overall acceptability and r ² =0.85 for 7-day WBS). Addition of non-linear texture terms to the models gave some improvements. 3aautomatic detection 3ameat composition 3amarbling 3afood analysis 3atexture 3asensory properties 3abeef quality 3abeef 3acolor 3alongissimus muscle 3apalatability 3aprediction 0alongissimus dorsi1 aSun, Da-Wen1 aDu, Cheng-Jin1 aAllen, Paul1 aDowney, Gerard0 tMeat science.g2008 Dec., v. 80, no. 4 p.1273-1281dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090128b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/12/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02543naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125024001900146040001800165072001700183072001700200100001300217245012800230300001800358500001500376506007600391520080100467506003701268650001501305650001501320650001801335650003201353650003001385650002701415650001001442650002201452650001701474650001801491650003101509650002101540653002501561653001401586653001801600700001701618700001301635700001201648700002201660773014401682852000901826856008301835930003301918945002501951946001301976655001201989IND4369322020221207102508.0050428e20050315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436932202DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.05003121022doi7 aPMC5548112pmcid7 a157533002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Virulent Nectria haematococca infects pea plants and requires either pelA, which is induced by pectin, or pelD, which is induced only in planta. However, the host signal(s) that trigger pelD expression was unknown. Here we report the isolation of the host signals and identify homoserine and asparagine, two free amino acids found in uniquely high levels in pea seedlings, as the pelD-inducing signals. N. haematococca has evolved a mechanism to sense the host tissue environment by using the high levels of two free amino acids in this plant, thereby triggering the expression of pelD to assist the pathogenic process.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasparagine 3ahomoserine 3apectate lyase 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3afungal diseases of plants 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenes 3aFusarium eumartii 3apathogenesis 3aPisum sativum 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 0aNectria haematococca 0apelD gene 0apelD promoter1 aRogers, L.M.1 aSong, Y.1 aGuo, W.1 aKolattukudy, P.E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2005 Mar. 15, v. 102, no. 11 p.4197-4202x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.05003121023Available from publisher's Web site  a20050509b20050604c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/09  aOther US 7aarticle02703naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125024001900146040001800165072001700183072001700200100002200217245007500239300002000314506007600334520125000410506003701660650002901697650001101726650001501737650001601752650002001768650001801788650001801806650001901824650001001843650002201853653001401875700001901889700001601908773014601924852000902070856008302079930003302162945002502195946001302220655001202233IND4369323920221207102503.0050428e20041214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436932392DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.04043371012doi7 aPMC5360132pmcid7 a155831342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Elucidation of their precise physiological roles promises important insight into cellular and organismal osmoregulation. The genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two similar but differentially regulated aquaporins. Here, we show that expression of AQY1 is stimulated during sporulation and that the Aqy1 protein is detectable exclusively in spore membranes. When spores are rapidly frozen, those that lack Aqy1 survive better, providing for a functional test of active spore water channels. Under ambient conditions, lack of Aqy1 reduces spore fitness. Because this reduction is independent from germination conditions, Aqy1 may be important during spore formation rather than subsequent maintenance or germination. Indeed, it seems that Aqy1 is degraded after spores have been formed and during germination. Taken together, Aqy1 is developmentally controlled and may play a role in spore maturation, probably by allowing water outflow. Taken together, we demonstrate a functional role of an aquaporin in gametogenesis, as well as in the formation of durable structures such as spores, a role that may have wider biological and medical implications.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ayeasts 3aaquaporins 3asporulation 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3afungal spores 3acell membranes 3agenes 3aspore germination 0aAQY1 gene1 aPettersson, N.1 aHohmann, S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2004 Dec. 14, v. 101, no. 50 p.17422-17427x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.04043371013Available from publisher's Web site  a20050509b20050604c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/09  aOther US 7aarticle04223naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100003400189245016600223300001600389500002400405500001500429520231700444650002802761650002002789650001202809650002502821650002302846650001702869650001502886650001802901650001302919650002302932650001402955650001902969650001702988650001503005650001103020650001103031650002403042650002103066650001303087650001703100650001703117653002303134653002303157700002803180700002303208700001903231700002303250700002503273773010403298852000903402856009303411930003303504945002503537946001103562655001203573IND4411217220140724000000.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441121722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2008.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aQ505 0aQ1151 aFernández-Trujillo, J.

Linking climacteric pattern and main postharvest disorders and decay in a set of near-isogenic lines  ap. 125-134.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) of melon (Cucumis melo L.) was used to test the relationship between the climacteric pattern and postharvest disorders at harvest and after 30 days at 8°C. The NILs contained different chromosome introgressions in the linkage group III from the non-climacteric exotic Korean accession PI 161375 transferred into the genetic background of the non-climacteric Spanish cultivar 'Piel de Sapo' (PS). A quantitative trait locus (QTL) in this linkage group induced climacteric behavior in eight NILs accompanied by a peak of ethylene production and fruit dehiscence to different degrees. The cultivar 'Nicolás' and one NIL showed a non-climacteric pattern of respiration rate and ethylene production. The climacteric NILs were used to test the relationship between this pattern and postharvest disorders. The reference climacteric lines 'Fado' and 'Védrantais' were more sensitive to CI and associated Cladosporium rot than the NILs or PS. In general, a more intense climacteric behavior was accompanied by fruit dehiscence, and higher total losses and greater skin scald after storage, than in PS. A higher incidence of chilling injury (CI) in the climacteric NILs was found compared with the non-climacteric ones, although with exceptions (one NIL for CI in the form of scald; the same NIL and one more for pitting). The climacteric onset and netting scald were not related, and CI in the form of skin spots was only found in climacteric NILs and was positively correlated with the maximum peak of ethylene production. Some climacteric NILs did not follow the rule of a higher susceptibility to other disorders and decay after storage compared with PS, such as for example in fruit over-ripening (detected externally or internally), Cladosporium rot at the peduncle and Alternaria rot. Mealiness was independent of climacteric behavior. Three climacteric NILs obtained better flavor scores after storage than PS, although the maximum peak of ethylene production was positively correlated with off-flavor. Genotypic correlation between disorder data and the physiological data of climacteric fruit revealed positive (flavor index) or negative postharvest consequences (skin injuries, rots or off-flavors). At least one QTL can be assigned to most of the quality traits analyzed. 3aquantitative trait loci 3achilling injury 3atexture 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest losses 3afood storage 3aplant rots 3afruit quality 3agenotype 3adisease resistance 3acultivars 3aisogenic lines 3aCucumis melo 3aAlternaria 3aflavor 3amelons 3aethylene production 3acell respiration 3aripening 3aCladosporium 3acold storage 0aclimacteric fruits 0asensory properties1 aObando-Ulloa, Javier M.1 aMartínez, Juan A.1 aMoreno, Eduard1 aGarcia-Mas, Jordi.1 aMonforte, Antonio J.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2008 Nov., v. 50, no. 2-3 p.125-134dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2008.04.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20081209b20090206c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/11/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02284naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010700167500001900274520119000293592002801483650001201511650002201523650001201545650001301557650001301570650001101583650001401594651001701608700002201625700002001647700002001667700002701687773012001714856007901834852000901913655001201922IND60735166820221117163104.0210423e20210420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073516682DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120403712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrenn, Harald  W.10aNectar Uptake of a Long-Proboscid Prosoeca Fly (Nemestrinidae)—Proboscis Morphology and Flower Shape  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral Prosoeca (Nemestinidae) species use a greatly elongated proboscis to drink nectar from long-tubed flowers. We studied morphological adaptations for nectar uptake of Prosoecamarinusi that were endemic to the Northern Cape of South Africa. Our study site was a small isolated area of semi-natural habitat, where the long-tubed flowers of Babiana vanzijliae (Iridaceae) were the only nectar source of P. marinusi, and these flies were the only insects with matching proboscis. On average, the proboscis measured 32.63 ± 2.93 mm in length and less than 0.5 mm in diameter. The short labella at the tip are equipped with pseudotracheae that open at the apical margin, indicating that nectar is extracted out of the floral tube with closed labella. To quantify the available nectar resources, measurements of the nectar volume were taken before the flies were active and after observed flower visits. On average, an individual fly took up approximately 1 µL of nectar per flower visit. The measured nectar quantities and the flower geometry allowed estimations of the nectar heights and predictions of necessary proboscis lengths to access nectar in a range of flower tube lengths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabiana 3aflower morphology 3aflowers 3ageometry 3ahabitats 3anectar 3aproboscis 3aSouth Africa1 aKarolyi, Florian 1 aLampert, Peter 1 aMelin, Annalie 1 aColville, Jonathan F.,0 tInsects.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120403713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245003900154300001800193520053700211592002800748650002200776650001300798650001100811650001400822650001500836700002000851773009800871856007100969852000901040655001201049IND60518782420221120051337.0160419e198610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051878242DNAL7 a10.2307/19386692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangel, Marc10aTowards a Unifield Foraging Theory  ap. 1127-1138.  aIn the broadest sense, foraging adaptations can include problems of finding food, avoiding predation while looking for food, and reproducing.

Promastigotes of Leishmania species synthesized a large proportion of their sterol from leucine. L.âmajor (LV39), L.âamazonensis and L.âmexicana were the most efficient utilizers of leucine, producing at least 70â77% of their sterol from leucine; L.âbraziliensis, L.âdonovani and L.âtropica apparently produced less sterol from leucine (23â36%) and L.âmajor (LV561), L.âadleri and L.âpanamamensis were intermediate, utilizing leucine to provide 51â58% of their sterol. In all the cases the balance of the sterol produced was apparently synthesized from carbon arising from acetate. The related trypanosomatid Endotrypanumâmonterogeii also produced a large amount (77%) of its sterol from leucine rather than acetate. By contrast Trypanosomaâcruzi elaborated only 8% of its sterol from leucine and used acetate far more effectively than the Leishmania species for sterol biosynthesis.

The method uses Alernaria-specific primers and probe targeting the internal transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2 of the rRNA gene. The detection limit of the real-time RT-PCR assay to detect viable Alternaria spp. in food samples was 1Â CFU/g. The estimated Alternaria counts obtained by real-time RT-PCR showed a good correlation (RÂ²Â =Â 0.9881, PÂ <Â 0.01) in the range of 1â10âµÂ CFU/mL with the Alternaria counts obtained by culture methods. The applicability of the real-time RT-PCR protocol was assessed through analysis of 110 commercial food samples, including 60 fresh fruit and vegetable samples and 50 processed foodstuffs. The assay developed provides a useful tool for early detection of low concentrations of viable Alternaria spp. in naturally contaminated food samples, and could be applied as a quality and biosecurity marker of raw materials and final products in the fruits and vegetables processing industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3adetection limit 3afood contamination 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3araw materials 3araw vegetables 3aribosomal RNA1 aGonzÃ¡lez, Isabel1 aMartÃ­n, Rosario1 aGarcÃ­a, Teresa0 tFood control.g2012 Dec., v. 28, no. 2 p.286-294dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245014300186300001600329520069400345592002801039650002501067650000901092650001301101650001401114650001201128650001301140650002201153650002501175650001201200650003401212650002801246650003101274650003301305650003401338650001601372700001701388773013301405852000901538856008201547655001201629IND4441630520221121005809.0180619e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444163052DNAL7 a192243852pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-009-9305-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSfakianakis, D.G.10aEffect of temperature on muscle lactate metabolic recovery in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, L.) juveniles exposed to exhaustive exercise  ap. 387-390.  aMuscle lactate metabolic recovery in sea bass juveniles was studied in respect to the water temperature.

However, the NAPLs redistribution driven by freeze–thaw (FT) cycles is not well understood. In this study, the redistribution of NAPLs in porous media subjected to FT cycles in a temperature range from 20 °C to −15 °C was investigated using the low-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technique. The redistribution of NAPLs in the prepared samples with NAPLs saturation ranging from 13.56% to 72.05% was confirmed using the transverse spin-spin relaxation time (T₂) distribution and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Experimental results revealed that substantial remobilization and distribution of NAPLs occurred between the macropores (T₂ greater than 300 ms) and the mesopores (60 ms < T₂ < 300 ms) while the NAPLs in the micropores (T₂ < 60 ms) remained almost unchanged during 30 FT cycles. The main reason is attributed to the fact that the redistribution rate in micropores is much lower than in macropores and mesopores. Furthermore, the NAPLs content and the number of FT cycles were positively correlated for macropores while negatively correlated for mesopores. For the samples with low NAPLs saturation (e.g., SN=13.56% and 13.56%), the redistribution rate of NAPLs versus FT cycles exhibited an overall linear relationship for macropores and mesopores while a non-liner relationship for micropores. For all pore categories, the increment in SN can cause a remarkable deviation extent. The balance between capillary pressure and freezing-induced pressure was evaluated by the newly introduced dimensionless pressure ratio ΔP, which could help determine the ultimate mobilization and redistribution of NAPLs during FT cycles. Experimental tests suggested that the ΔP was much larger in macropores than in mesopores and micropores. This can explain the dramatic difference in the redistribution rate among different pore categories. This fundamental study is helpful in understanding the mobilization and redistribution mechanisms of NAPLs in cold regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3amacropores 3amagnetism 3amicropores 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 0aFreeze-thaw cycles 0aNAPLs 0aRedistribution 0aPore scale behavior 0aFreezing-induced pressure 0aNuclear magnetic resonance1 aChen, Yongqiang1 aZhuang, Chao1 aZhou, Zhifang1 aWang, Jinguo0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Sept., v. 612 p.128106-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1281063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015700169300001800326520096100344592002801305650002501333650001301358650001701371650001801388650002601406650002001432650001601452650001701468650001801485650001801503650000901521650001801530650002401548650001601572650003701588700001901625700001501644700001601659700001701675700001101692700001501703700001601718773009701734856008501831852000901916655001201925IND60087812520221118034559.0141102e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008781252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.10.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yanqin10aPreparation and properties of thermoreversible hydrogels based on methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-grafted chitosan nanoparticles for drug delivery systems  ap. 1828-1833.  aA thermoreversible nanoparticle hydrogels based on carboxylated methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-grafted chitosan (N-CS-g-mPEG) were investigated in this paper. The aqueous dispersion of N-CS-g-mPEG nanoparticle freeze-dried powder (NP-FDP) can undergo reversible gel–sol transition as the temperature changes. The structures of N-CS-g-mPEG NPs and hydrogels were characterized by TEM, DLS and ESEM. Using 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and dexamethasone (DXM) as model drugs, in vitro release behaviors of drug-loaded hydrogels were also investigated. The release results show that there is a sustained release of BSA and DXM from the drug-loaded hydrogel. In vitro cytotoxicity tests investigated by MTT assay indicate that N-CS-g-mPEG is non-toxic to normal mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (3T3). Therefore, the thermoreversible N-CS-g-mPEG NP hydrogels could be potentially applied in a local minimally invasive drug delivery system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adexamethasone 3adrug delivery systems 3aethylene glycol 3afibroblasts 3afluorouracil 3afreeze drying 3ahydrocolloids 3amice 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene glycol 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aDeng, Liandong1 aChen, Chen1 aZhang, Juan1 aZhou, Ruimei1 aLi, Xu1 aHu, Renjie1 aDong, Anjie0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 83, no. 4 p.1828-1833dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245009700133300001600230500001400246520059400260592002800854650001600882650001300898650002300911650001600934650001300950650002500963650002800988650001401016650001401030650000901044651001001053653001901063653002801082653002801110700001701138773013001155852000901285655001201294IND60709968020221123024926.0200908e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070996802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Rajendra10aDeep placement and foliar fertilization of nitrogen for increased use efficiency-An overview  ap. 420-424.  aNAL-light  aFertilizer nitrogen is the most important plant nutrient in agriculture all over the world.

Based on this, the temporal and spatial disparities of China's regional ecological energy efficiency are investigated. To explore the sources of China's regional ecological energy inefficiency, the overall ecological energy inefficiency is decomposed into several input-specific inefficiencies. And then, the energy saving and pollution abatement potentials of each Chinese region is calculated using the differences between the target values and the actual values of energy consumption and pollution emissions. The empirical results show that China's ecological energy efficiency is relatively low and regional differences are significant for the period 2007–2015. It can be demonstrated that the inefficiency to abate pollution is the main contributor to China's regional ecological energy inefficiency. By calculating the potentials of energy saving and pollution abatement, it can be found that the east area has the lowest potential, followed by the central area, with the west area having the highest potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aempirical research 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3amodels 3apollution 3apollution control 3aChina 0aEcological energy efficiency 0aEnergy saving and pollution abatement potentials 0aData envelopment analysis 0aEpsilon-based measure approach1 aWang, Ke-Liang1 aGeng, Ji-Chao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 194 p.300-308dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245010200171300001600273520143900289592002801728650002201756650002001778650001201798650001901810650002401829650001001853650001701863650002601880650001001906650001901916650001201935650000901947650001801956650003101974650001302005650002002018650003002038653003402068653003202102653002002134653002902154700001202183700001902195700001702214700001802231700001702249700001502266773009902281856009002380852000902470655001202479IND60599665820221122224408.0180702e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059966582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chi10aDual-functional nanoparticles targeting amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease mice  ap. 456-465.  aAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with few treatments. The limitations imposed by the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the non-selective distribution of drugs in the brain have hindered the effective treatment of AD and may result in severe side effects on the normal brains. We developed a dual-functional nanoparticle drug delivery system based on a PEGylated poly (lactic acid) (PLA) polymer. Two targeting peptides that were screened by phage display, TGN and QSH, were conjugated to the surface of the nanoparticles. TGN specifically targets ligands at the BBB, while QSH has good affinity with Aβ1-42, which is the main component of amyloid plaque. Tests probing the bEnd.3 cell uptake and in vivo imaging were conducted to determine the best density of TGN on the nanoparticles' surfaces. The optimal amount of QSH was studied using a Thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. The optimal maleimide/peptide molar ratio was 3 for both TGN and QSH on the surface of the nanoparticles (T3Q3-NP), and these nanoparticles achieved enhanced and precise targeted delivery to amyloid plaque in the brains of AD model mice. A MTT assay also validated the safety of this dual-targeted delivery system; little cytotoxicity was demonstrated with both bEnd.3 and PC 12 cells. In conclusion, the T3Q3-NP might be a valuable targeting system for AD diagnosis and therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aadverse effects 3aamyloid 3abacteriophages 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apeptides 3apolylactic acid 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aDual-functional nanoparticles 0aBlood–brain barrier (BBB) 0aAβ1-42 peptide 0aAlzheimer's disease (AD)1 aWan, Xu1 aZheng, Xiaoyao1 aShao, Xiayan1 aLiu, Qingfeng1 aZhang, Qizhi1 aQian, Yong0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.456-465dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03879naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245015100160500001900311520231600330592002802646650002902674650002202703650001902725650002002744650002502764650002102789650001202810650000902822650001902831650002602850650002102876650000702897650001902904650002402923650001502947651002102962651001002983700001502993700001903008700002103027700002403048700001703072700001903089700002603108700002403134773011803158856007603276852000903352655001203361IND60735167420221120171401.0210423e20210419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073516742DNAL7 a10.3390/land100404352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Prakash 10aCarbon Storage of Single Tree and Mixed Tree Dominant Species Stands in a Reserve Forest—Case Study of the Eastern Sub-Himalayan Region of India  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent decades, carbon (C) management is an important point on the agenda to identify the best viable mitigation strategies for its reduction. The study was conducted at Jaldapara National Park located in the Eastern Himalayan region of India. The study quantified litter production, decomposition, periodic nutrient release, soil fertility status, and soil organic carbon (SOC) of five major forest stands i.e., Tectona grandis (TGDS), Shorea robusta (SRDS), Michelia champaca (MCDS), Lagerstroemia parviflora (LPDS) and miscellaneous stand (MS). A stratified random nested quadrate method was adopted for sample collection. Results reveal that the greatest amount of litter production and decomposition was under MCDS followed by MS, LPDS, SRDS, and the smallest under TGDS. The material annual turnover through litter decomposition in all the stands varies between 96.46% and 99.34%. The content and amount of the available nutrients in litter varied significantly among the stands. Moreover, release of these nutrients was nearly equal to the amount available in the initial litter mass. In general, the magnitude of the total nutrient return was in the same order as the total litter fall and the nutrient availability was more closely related to litter nutrient content and soil organic carbon. The range of pH (4.86–5.16), EC (0.34–0.50), soil moisture (27.01–31.03) and available primary nutrients (N: (0.21–0.26 Mg/ha), P: (0.09–0.12 Mg/ha), K: (0.13–0.14 Mg/ha)) also varied significantly among the stands. Significant positive correlations were observed between SOC, N and K. Both the fertility indices exhibited no definite pattern in the stands but a significant correlation between the two indicates the healthy soil fertility status of the stands. SOC varies significantly under different forest stands, but the greatest content was found under MS. The estimated SOC ranges between 75.9 and 107.7 Mg ha⁻¹ up to 60 cm and is reported to be below the Indian average of 182.94 Mg ha⁻¹. The present study strongly recommends that Tectona grandis, Shorea robusta, Michelia champaca, and Lagerstroemia parviflora should be the important commercial timbers of the Eastern Himalayan region because they may help further to increase the C sink in agricultural and degraded landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagerstroemia parviflora 3aMagnolia champaca 3aShorea robusta 3aTectona grandis 3acarbon sequestration 3adominant species 3aforests 3aland 3anational parks 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3apH 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil water 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aVineeta,  1 aShukla, Gopal 1 aManohar K, Abha 1 aBhat, Jahangeer A.,1 aKumar, Amit 1 aKumar, Munesh 1 aCabral-Pinto, Marina 1 aChakravarty, Sumit 0 tLand.g2021 Apr. 19, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100404353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014900167506010400316506007600420520233100496592002802827506003702855650002102892650001502913650001602928650001902944650001402963650001602977650001302993650002803006653002503034653002403059653002703083653002803110653001603138653001603154700002103170773011403191856008203305852000903387655001203396IND60781337420221207130226.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078133742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2022.1133082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPioch, Jonathan10aOptimized flow cytometry protocol for dihydrorhodamine 123-based detection of reactive oxygen species in leukocyte subpopulations in whole blood  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of immune cells to mount an oxidative burst represent an important defense during microbial invasion, but is also recognized for playing a significant role in the progression of inflammatory disorders and disease. Although neutrophils produce the strongest ROS-response, other leukocytes and their cell subsets could play a significant role. Isolation of specific cells for determining their ROS-response can affect their functionality and is laborious or hard to replicate in different settings. We have therefore established a whole blood assay, that only requires 100 μL heparinized blood and utilizes the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 ROS-probe combined with cell surface antibody staining for the specific detection of ROS in several subsets of cells simultaneously using flow cytometry. Although the flow markers chosen are interchangeable with other direct conjugated and cell specific antibodies depending on the research question, we focused on neutrophils (SSCʰⁱᵍʰCD16ᵇʳⁱᵍʰᵗHLA-DRⁿᵉᵍ/ˡᵒʷ), eosinophils (SSCʰⁱᵍʰCD16ˡᵒʷHLA-DRˡᵒʷ/ⁿᵉᵍCD193ᵖᵒˢⁱᵗⁱᵛᵉCD125ᵖᵒˢⁱᵗⁱᵛᵉ) and monocyte subsets (SSCⁱⁿᵗᵉʳᵐᵉᵈⁱᵃᵗᵉHLA-DRʰⁱᵍʰCD14ˡᵒʷ⁻ᵖᵒˢⁱᵗⁱᵛᵉCD16ⁿᵉᵍᵃᵗⁱᵛᵉ⁻ᵖᵒˢⁱᵗⁱᵛᵉ). As a RBC-lysis reagent we compared BD FACS Lysis Solution to the in-house prepared ammonium-chloride‑potassium based ACK Lysis Buffer, that does not fix or permeabilize the immune cells. We find that ACK-lysis of stimulated and stained samples results in superior surface staining, decreased loss of cell subsets, and enhanced resolution of the DHR-signal. Compared to the other cells analyzed in healthy blood donors, neutrophils responded with the highest ROS-response to all tested stimuli (fMLP (low stimuli), E. coli, and PMA (high stimuli)), where eosinophils and the three monocyte subsets also showed an extensive ROS-response when stimulated with E. coli or PMA. Our assay provides the possibility for researchers to examine the ROS-response of specific cell subsets in specific patient groups ex vivo and could also allow the analysis of pharmacological intervention studies targeting ROS, which ultimately can advance the field of immunological research.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibodies 3aeosinophils 3aflow cytometry 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 3apatients 3areactive oxygen species 0aDihydrorhodamine 123 0aClassical monocytes 0aIntermediate monocytes 0aNon-classical monocytes 0aEosinophils 0aNeutrophils1 aBlomgran, Robert0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2022 Aug., v. 507 p.113308-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12466x0022-17597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2022.1133083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245005200204300002000256500001900276520107200295592002801367650000801395650002101403650002101424650001701445700006101462700005901523773014901582856007601731852000901807655001201816IND60700530820221121054248.0200701e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070053082DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c049782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbrahimi, Sasha B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2752-510910aDNA-Based Nanostructures for Live-Cell Analysis  ap. 11343-11356.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDNA-based probes constitute a versatile platform for making biological measurements due to their ability to recognize both nucleic acid and non-nucleic acid targets, ease of synthesis and chemical modification, amenability to be interfaced with signal amplification schemes, and inherent biocompatibility. Here, we provide a historical perspective of how a transition from linear DNA structures toward more structurally complex nanostructures has revolutionized live-cell analysis. Modulating the structure gives rise to probes that can enter cells without the aid of transfection reagents and can detect, track, and quantify analytes in live cells at the single-organelle, single-cell, tissue section, and whole organism levels. We delineate the advantages and disadvantages associated with different probe architectures and describe the advances enabled by these structures for elucidating fundamental biology as well as developing improved diagnostic and theranostic systems. We also discuss the outstanding challenges in the field and outline potential solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiocompatibility 3achemical species 3atransfection1 aSamanta, Devleena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0647-76731 aMirkin, Chad A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6634-76270 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 23, v. 142, no. 26 p.11343-11356dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c049783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245015200196300001500348520191600363592002802279650002602307650001502333650001302348650002002361650001202381650001402393650001502407650001202422650001002434700002102444700002302465700002202488773015202510856007002662856009502732990002302827852000902850655001202859IND60608655720221116145816.0190510e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060865572DNAL7 a10.3791/572672doi7 aPMC59317712pmcid7 a296081602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThurston, Sarah10aMethods of pairing and pair maintenance of new zealand white rabbits (Oryctolagus Cuniculus) via behavioral ethogram, monitoring, and interventions  ap. e57267.  aNew Zealand White (NZW) laboratory rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), as well as their ancestors the European Rabbit, are a social species that exhibit numerous benefits to being housed accordingly. Although these rabbits are innately gregarious, certain behaviors can still arise when kept in captivity, which if left unchecked, can confound research results or lead to wounding, which in extreme cases can be severe. To prevent these issues, there must be a well-structured plan for the monitoring and maintenance of paired laboratory rabbits. The purpose of this protocol is to present effective procedures for establishing newly paired NZW rabbits as well as methods for successful maintenance. Multiple methods have been tested for the creation of newly paired female rabbits from the vendor, but the most efficacious technique emphasizes capitalizing on the stress bonding from transport, urine marking, pairing in a neutral cage with no forced sharing of resources and a system of monitoring and intervention. To determine the best method of housing paired rabbits in a standard caging environment, data were collected to generate a behavioral ethogram. Behaviors were then quantified as positive, neutral or negative and were tracked across the lifespan of the pair to determine which behaviors indicated pair success or failure. With the newfound knowledge of socially housed laboratory NZW rabbit behavior, enrichment intervention was applied to alleviate aggression and prevent wounding, thus resulting in a higher percentage of successful pairs. Through several years of trialing different pairing methods, the development of the ethogram and the resulting enrichment interventions, understanding of the highly complex social constructs that dominate pair housed rabbit behavior has dramatically increased and allowed for the provision of more species-specific care and increased standards of welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aaggression 3aancestry 3acaptive animals 3afemales 3alongevity 3amonitoring 3arabbits 3aurine1 aBurlingame, Lisa1 aLester, Patrick A.1 aLofgren, Jennifer0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Mar. 16, , no. 133 p.e57267-e57267dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/572673Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57267/methods-pairing-pair-maintenance-new-zealand-white-rabbits  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010400172300001600276520176300292592002802055650002702083650004402110650003502154650001502189650001402204650002402218650001702242650001102259650002702270650004402297650001402341650001502355650001302370650002802383653002402411653001302435653001702448653001702465653002602482653002702508700002202535700002402557700002202581700001902603700001902622700002602641773011902667856008502786852000902871655001202880IND60623657420221119204143.0190129e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062365742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmigoni, Loredana10aMethacycline displays a strong efficacy in reducing toxicity in a SCA3 Caenorhabditis elegans model  ap. 279-290.  aWe have previously demonstrated the neuroprotective activity of tetracycline on a Spinocerebellar Ataxia 3 nematode model. Here, we present the screening of a small library of tetracycline congeners in order to identify the most effective compound in preventing ataxin-3 aggregation.We performed the assays on the Josephin Domain as it is directly involved in the onset of fibrillation. We used thioflavin T and solubility assays to spot out the most effective tetracycline congeners; Fourier transform infrared and NMR spectroscopies to characterize their mode of action. We employed an ataxic Caenorhabditis elegans model to evaluate the pharmacological efficacy of tetracycline congeners.Methacycline was identified as the most effective compound. Like tetracycline, methacycline neither significantly affected the aggregation kinetics nor did it change the secondary structures of the final aggregates but increased the solubility of the aggregated species. Saturation transfer NMR experiments demonstrated methacycline capability to only bind the oligomeric species of Josephin Domain. Competition assays also showed that methacycline binds to the Josephin Domain more tightly than tetracycline. The treatment with methacycline induced a significant improvement in motility and locomotion of the transgenic C. elegans without changing its lifespan. The efficacy was distinctly stronger than that of tetracycline. Noteworthy, unlike tetracycline, methacycline was able to retard aging-related decline in motility of even the healthy worms used.The apparent absence of toxic effects displayed by methacycline, along with its stronger efficacy in contrasting expanded ataxin-3 toxicity, makes it a possible candidate for a chronic treatment of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3agenetically modified organisms 3alocomotion 3alongevity 3amechanism of action 3amethacycline 3amodels 3aneuroprotective effect 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascreening 3asolubility 3atoxicity 3aubiquitinyl hydrolase 1 0aAmyloid aggregation 0aataxin-3 0atetracycline 0amethacycline 0amolecular recognition 0aCaenorhabditis elegans1 aAiroldi, Cristina1 aNatalello, Antonino1 aRomeo, Margherita1 aDiomede, Luisa1 aTortora, Paolo1 aRegonesi, Maria Elena0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Feb., v. 1863, no. 2 p.279-290dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010100155300001600256520163700272592002801909650001701937650001201954650002001966650001601986650001902002650002602021650002502047650001402072650001202086650000902098650001202107653000902119653001102128653001802139653002402157653002002181700001702201700002002218700001902238700001802257700002102275700001802296773010602314856007402420852000902494655001202503IND60133455320221120131821.0190415e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013345532DNAL7 a10.1093/mp/sst0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Dapeng10aOsMADS16 Genetically Interacts with OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 in Specifying Floral Patterning in Rice  ap. 743-756.  aRice (Oryza sativa) has unique floral patterns that contribute to grain yield. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the specification of floral organ identities in rice, particularly the interaction among floral homeotic genes, remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the floral homeotic gene OsMADS16 (also called SUPERWOMAN1, SPW1, a B-class gene) acts together with the rice C-class genes OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 in specifying floral organ patterning. OsMADS16 and the two C-class genes have an overlapping expression pattern in the third whorl founder cells. Compared with the single mutants, both spw1-1 osmads3-4 and spw1-1 osmads58 double mutants exhibit additional whorls of glume-like organs within the flower, particularly an extra whorl of six glume-like structures formed at the position of the wild-type stamens. These ectopic glume-like structures were shown to have palea identity through cellular observation and in situ hybridization analysis using marker genes. Our results suggest that B- and C-class genes play a key role in suppressing indeterminate growth within the floral meristem, particularly whorl-3 primordia. We also hypothesize that, in contrast to previous assumptions, the specialized spikelet organ in rice, the palea, is the counterpart of the sepal in eudicots, and the lemma is homologous to the bract.The rice floral homeotic B-class gene OsMADS16 interacts with C-class genes in specifying floral organ patterning, particularly suppressing indeterminate growth within whorl-3 primordia. This work provides the evidence of the origin of the specialized organs, the lemma and the palea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aflowers 3agenetic markers 3agrain yield 3ahomeotic genes 3ain situ hybridization 3aindeterminate growth 3ameristems 3amutants 3arice 3astamens 0arice 0aflower 0aB and C genes 0agenetic interaction 0astamen identity1 aLiang, Wanqi1 aDreni, Ludovico1 aYin, Changsong1 aZhou, Zhigang1 aKater, Martin M.1 aZhang, Dabing0 tMolecular plant.g2013 May, v. 6, no. 3 p.743-756dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mp/sst0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245008600163300001800249500000900267520179600276592002802072650001402100650002102114650000902135650001902144650001802163650002602181650002502207650001502232650001502247650002102262650001902283650001302302650001702315650001602332650001602348650002202364651001002386700002802396773013902424852000902563856007902572655001202651IND4388157020221120162309.0191125e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438815702DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2005.03432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Santiago, Ana10aPredicting Iron Chlorosis of Lupin in Calcareous Spanish Soils from Iron Extracts  ap. 1945-1950.  aepub  aIron deficiency chlorosis is a major nutritional problem affecting sensitive cultivated plants in calcareous soils. Our main objective was to study the suitability of various Fe extracts for predicting the incidence of Fe deficiency chlorosis in calcareous soils from southern Spain. Six single Fe extractions were used: unbuffered hydroxylamine (room temperature), DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) at 2 and 17 h, “rapid” ammonium oxalate, ammonium oxalate, and pyrophosphate. The Fe forms that account for most of the Fe supplied to plants were studied by using a sequential Fe fractionation process involving four extractants: citrate–bicarbonate, citrate at pH 6, citrate–ascorbate (a mild reductant), and citrate–bicarbonate–dithionite (a strong reductant). Suitability of Fe extracts for predicting Fe chlorosis was checked by establishing correlations between the amount of Fe extracted from soil and the chlorophyll content in white lupin (Lupinus albus L.). The amounts of Fe extracted by hydroxylamine accounted for a minimal portion of Fe associated with oxides, thus indicating that this extractant is not efficient at reducing Fe oxides. Hydroxylamine Fe, however, accounted for 63 and 72% of the variance in chlorophyll meter readings at 2 and 3 wk of growth, respectively, in contrast to “rapid” oxalate (32 and 11%) and DTPA at 2 h (29 and 15%). At 3 wk of growth, the variance in meter readings explained by hydroxylamine Fe was much higher than that explained by the active CaCO₃ equivalent (56%). This ability of hydroxylamine Fe to predict chlorophyll meter readings is due to the relationship of the Fe extract to poorly crystalline Fe fractions, which showed the strongest relationship with the active CaCO₃ content (R ² = 0.84, P < 0.001).  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorosis 3acalcareous soils 3airon 3asoil nutrients 3aLupinus albus 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplant micronutrients 3aprediction 3aextraction 3aammonium oxalate 3apyrophosphates 3acitrates 3abicarbonates 3achlorophyll 3airon oxides 3acalcium carbonate 3aSpain1 aDelgado, A.q(Antonio),0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2006 Nov., v. 70, no. 6 p.1945-1950dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x1435-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2005.03433Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03199naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010400171500002200275520189800297592002802195650001302223650001402236650002602250650000902276650001202285650001402297650001202311650002102323650001802344650001602362650001902378650001402397650001402411650000902425650001302434653001202447653002102459653001402480653001202494653001302506653001802519773009802537856008502635852000902720655001202729IND60623657520221119203725.0190815e20181019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062365752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDórea, José G.10aMultiple low-level exposures: Hg interactions with co-occurring neurotoxic substances in early life  aPre-press version  aAll chemical forms of Hg can affect neurodevelopment; however, low levels of organic Hg (methylmercury-MeHg and ethylmercury-EtHg in Thimerosal-containing vaccines, hereafter ‘TCV’) exposures during early life (pregnancy and lactation) co-occur with other environmental neurotoxic substances. These neurotoxicants may act in parallel, synergistically, or antagonistically to Hg. Nevertheless, the risks of neurotoxicity associated with multiple neuro-toxicants depend on type, time, combinations of exposure, and environmental and/or genetic-associated factors. Neurological developmental disorders, delays in cognition and behavioral outcomes associated with multiple exposures (which include Hg) may show transient or lasting outcomes depending on constitutional and/or environmental factors that can interact to neutralize, aggravate or attenuate these effects; often these studies are challenging to interpret. During pregnancy and lactation, fish-MeHg exposure is frequently confounded with the opposing effects of neuroactive nutrients (in fish) that lead to positive, negative, or no effects on neurobehavioral tests. In infancy, exposures to acute binary mixtures (TCV- EtHg and Al-adjuvants in infant immunizations) are associated with increased risks of tics and other developmental disorders. Despite the certitude that promulgates single environmental neurotoxicants, empirical comparisons of combined exposures indicate that Hg-related outcome is uneven. Hg in combination with other neurotoxic mixtures may elevate risks of neurotoxicity, but these risks arise in circumstances that are not yet predictable. Therefore, to achieve the goals of the Minamata treaty and to safeguard the health of children, low levels of mercury exposure (in any chemical form) needs to be further reduced whether the source is environmental (air- and food-borne) or iatrogenic (pediatric TCVs).  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3acognition 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3ainfancy 3alactation 3amercury 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotoxins 3aneutralization 3anutrients 3apregnancy 3arisk 3avaccines 0aMercury 0aNeurodevelopment 0aPregnancy 0aInfants 0aChildren 0aBreastfeeding0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Oct. 19, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006300171520131000234592002801544650002301572650001201595650001301607650001201620650001101632650002501643650001901668650001501687650002801702650001101730650002501741650001501766650002901781650002601810650001901836650001401855650002101869650001801890650001101908653003201919653001201951653001401963653001901977653002901996653001202025700002302037700002302060773011302083856008602196852000902282655001202291IND60686665720221121030649.0201024e20200620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068666572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatuštík, Jan10aLife cycle assessment of biochar-to-soil systems: A review  aThe climate change and soil degradation are among the most prominent environmental issues of today and solutions need to be looked for. Pyrolysis of (waste) biomass to produce biochar that is then applied to agricultural soil could be one of the means to tackle these problems. Many authors have used the Life Cycle Assessment method to evaluate the environmental impact of biochar-to-soil projects and in this paper those studies are systematically reviewed to uncover the overall trend. Although the differences in the contexts and characteristics of these studies disallow direct comparison of results, it is still obvious that the application of biochar brings significant benefits, either to neutralize the greenhouse gas emission of agricultural production or as a carbon capture method. There is also a great potential for energy production by utilizing the co-products - syngas and bio-oil. The benefits of carbon sequestration in biochar and the energy production usually overcompensate the greenhouse gas emissions produced during feedstock production and handling. However, the effect on other impact categories needs to be evaluated and limited and the economic sustainability of the project needs to be assured. To facilitate future progress, some methodology unification would be beneficial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3acoproducts 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afeedstocks 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alife cycle assessment 3aneutralization 3apyrolysis 3asoil degradation 3asynthesis gas 3awastes 0aLife cycle assessment (LCA) 0aBiochar 0aPyrolysis 0aClimate change 0aBiochar soil application 0aBiomass1 aHnátková, Tereza1 aKočí, Vladimír,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 20, v. 259 p.120998-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001900176245009200195300001500287520177200302592002802074650000802102650001002110650001002120650002002130650002402150650000902174650001202183650001702195650001302212650001902225650001202244650002302256650001202279700002002291700001702311773015202328856007002480856010502550990002302655852000902678655001202687IND60608655820221116145800.0190510e20180710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060865582DNAL7 a10.3791/572702doi7 aPMC61246342pmcid7 a300590312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shih-Yun10aStereotaxic surgery for genetic manipulation in striatal cells of neonatal mouse brains  ap. e57270.  aMany genes are expressed in embryonic brains, and some of them are continuously expressed in the brain after birth. For such persistently expressed genes, they may function to regulate the developmental process and/or physiological function in neonatal brains. To investigate neurobiological functions of specific genes in the brain, it is essential to inactivate genes in the brain. Here, we describe a simple stereotaxic method to inactivate gene expression in the striatum of transgenic mice at neonatal time windows. AAV-eGFP-Cre viruses were microinjected into the striatum of Ai14 reporter gene mice at postnatal day (P) 2 by stereotaxic brain surgery. The tdTomato reporter gene expression was detected in P14 striatum, suggesting a successful Cre-loxP mediated DNA recombination in AAV-transduced striatal cells. We further validated this technique by microinjecting AAV-eGFP-Cre viruses into P2Foxp2fl/fl mice. Double labeling of GFP and Foxp2 showed that GFP-positive cells lacked Foxp2 immunoreactivity in P9 striatum, suggesting the loss of Foxp2 protein in AAV-eGFP-Cre transduced striatal cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate an effective genetic deletion by stereotaxically microinjected AAV-eGFP-Cre viruses in specific neuronal populations in the neonatal brains of floxed transgenic mice. In conclusion, our stereotaxic technique provides an easy and simple platform for genetic manipulation in neonatal mouse brains. The technique can not only be used to delete genes in specific regions of neonatal brains, but it also can be used to inject pharmacological drugs, neuronal tracers, genetically modified optogenetics and chemogenetics proteins, neuronal activity indicators and other reagents into the striatum of neonatal mouse brains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abrain 3adrugs 3agene expression 3agenetic engineering 3amice 3aneurons 3aoptogenetics 3aproteins 3areporter genes 3asurgery 3atransgenic animals 3aviruses1 aKuo, Hsiao-Ying1 aLiu, Fu-Chin0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 July 10, , no. 137 p.e57270-e57270dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/572703Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57270/stereotaxic-surgery-for-genetic-manipulation-striatal-cells-neonatal  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003900148245014900187300001100336520103600347592002801383650001901411650002201430650002301452650001601475650002101491650001201512650002801524650001201552650001001564650002401574700002101598700002201619700002501641700002301666700006501689773015601754856008301910852000901993655001202002IND60762908120221116162523.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076290812DNAL7 a10.1186/s40538-021-00274-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiwattanawanichakun, Phatcharaphon10aToxicity of isolated phenolic compounds from Acorus calamus L. to control Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) under laboratory conditions  ap. 10.  aBACKGROUND: Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), the tobacco cutworm, is an prominent agricultural pest. To reduce the use of chemical pesticides that cause health problems and that leave residue in the environment, some botanical pesticides have been developed. Our research aimed to evaluate the insecticidal efficacy of Acorus calamus L. extract for the control of S. litura under laboratory conditions. RESULTS: After 24 h of topical application, the A. calamus methanolic crude extract showed toxicity against secondary instar S. litura larvae (LD₅₀ ~ 7.438 µg/larva). Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxy flavone), one of the isolated phenolic compounds, showed optimal control efficiency (LD₅₀ ~ 2.752 µg/larva) and showed a reduction in carboxylesterase activities, which have detoxification reduction roles in larvae. CONCLUSION: Chrysin in the crude extract of A. calamus may be an active compound to control this pest, and it may be applied as an alternative to minimize the usage of chemical insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcorus calamus 3aSpodoptera litura 3aactive ingredients 3aagriculture 3acarboxylesterase 3achrysin 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainstars 3apests 3atopical application1 aSaehlee, Siriwan1 aYooboon, Thitaree1 aKumrungsee, Nutchaya1 aNobsathian, Saksit1 aBullangpoti, Vasakorn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9192-63750 tChemical and biological technologies in agriculture.g2022 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.10-10dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:27327x2196-56417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40538-021-00274-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009200166300001600258520106200274592002801336650001601364650001301380650001601393650001101409650001601420650001301436650001401449650001501463650002701478650001001505650003501515650001401550650001401564653002101578653001801599653002501617653001401642700001901656773008801675852000901763856008101772655001201853IND4442964120221122050821.0170416e20100923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444296412DNAL7 a10.2478/s11535-010-0070-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlavchev, Georgi10aViability and survival capability of quinolone-resistant uropathogenic Escherichia coli  ap. 827-830.  aUropathogenic strains of E. coli isolated from urine of patients with urinary tract infections were tested for antibiotic sensitivity using bio-Merieux kits and ATB-UR 5 expression system. The virulence of strains was evaluated by serum bactericidal assay, macrophage “killing” and bacterial adhesive tests. Survival capability of strains was assessed under starvation in saline. The results showed that quinolone-resistant uropathogenic strains of E. coli exhibit significantly reduced adhesive potential but relatively high resistance to serum and macrophage bactericidity. In contrast to laboratory strains, the quinolone-resistant uropathogenic clinical isolate demonstrated increased viability during starvation in saline. Our study suggests that quinolone-resistant uropathogenic strains are highly adaptable clones of E. coli, which can exhibit compensatory viability potential under unfavorable conditions. The clinical occurrence of such phenotypes is likely to contribute to the survival, persistence and spread strategy of resistant bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3aclones 3amacrophages 3apatients 3aphenotype 3astarvation 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli 3aviability 3avirulence 0aEscherichia coli 0aUropathogenic 0aQuinolone resistance 0aVirulence1 aMarkova, Nadya0 tOpen life sciences.g2010 Sept. 23, v. 5, no. 6 p.827-830dVersitax2391-54127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-010-0070-93Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03064naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010500179300001600284520161100300592002801911650002301939650000801962650001601970650001201986650001201998650001102010650002302021650002102044650001502065650001102080650001202091650001002103650001802113650001602131650001102147650001302158650001802171650001302189653002502202653001302227653002302240653002602263653001202289653001202301700002002313773011902333856008502452852000902537655001202546IND60623657720221119203829.0190129e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062365772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalaraman, Priyadarshini10aChemotaxis by Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 17453) towards camphor involves cytochrome P450cam (CYP101A1)  ap. 304-312.  aThe camphor-degrading microorganism, Pseudomonas putida strain ATCC 17453, is an aerobic, gram-negative soil bacterium that uses camphor as its sole carbon and energy source. The genes responsible for the catabolic degradation of camphor are encoded on the extra-chromosomal CAM plasmid. A monooxygenase, cytochrome P450cam, mediates hydroxylation of camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor as the first and committed step in the camphor degradation pathway, requiring a dioxygen molecule (O2) from air. Under low O2 levels, P450cam catalyzes the production of borneol via an unusual reduction reaction. We have previously shown that borneol downregulates the expression of P450cam. To understand the function of P450cam and the consequences of down-regulation by borneol under low O2 conditions, we have studied chemotaxis of camphor induced and non-induced P. putida strain ATCC 17453. We have tested camphor, borneol, oxidized camphor metabolites and known bacterial attractants (d)-glucose, (d) - and (l)-glutamic acid for their elicitation chemotactic behavior. In addition, we have used 1-phenylimidazole, a P450cam inhibitor, to investigate if P450cam plays a role in the chemotactic ability of P. putida in the presence of camphor. We found that camphor, a chemoattractant, became toxic and chemorepellent when P450cam was inhibited. We have also evaluated the effect of borneol on chemotaxis and found that the bacteria chemotaxed away from camphor in the presence of borneol. This is the first report of the chemotactic behaviour of P. putida ATCC 17453 and the essential role of P450cam in this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3aair 3aattractants 3aborneol 3acamphor 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3achemoattractants 3achemotaxis 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahydroxylation 3ametabolites 3aoxygen 3aplasmids 3asoil bacteria 3atoxicity 0aBacterial chemotaxis 0aCYP101A1 0aPseudomonas putida 0aAerobic soil bacteria 0aCamphor 0aBorneol1 aPlettner, Erika0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Feb., v. 1863, no. 2 p.304-312dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007700168300001600245520189400261592002802155650001502183650001702198650002502215650002002240650003902260650001302299650002602312650001302338650001302351650001802364650001802382650001802400650002102418650001102439650001302450650001302463651001002476653003002486653003202516653001602548653003302564700005102597700002102648700001502669700001502684700002002699773008302719856008402802852000902886655001202895IND60556707020221117161213.0161102e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055670702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Weiming10aGranulation of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria for autotrophic denitrification  ap. 507-519.  aSulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) was successfully employed for effective autotrophic denitrification and sludge minimization in a full-scale application of saline sewage treatment in Hong Kong. In this study, a Granular Sludge Autotrophic Denitrification (GSAD) reactor was continuously operated over 600 days for SOB granulation, and to evaluate the long-term stability of SOB granules, microbial communities and denitrification efficacy. Sludge granulation initiated within the first 40 days of start-up with an average particle size of 186.4 μm and sludge volume index (SVI5) of 40 mL/g in 5 min. The sludge granules continued to grow reaching a nearly uniform size of mean diameter 1380 ± 20 μm with SVI5 of 30 mL/g during 600 days of GSAD reactor operation at hydraulic retention time of 5 h and nitrate loading rate of 0.33 kg-N/m3/d. The GSAD reactor with SOB granular sludge achieved 93.7 ± 2.1% nitrogen and complete sulfide removal with low sludge yield of 0.15 g-volatile suspended solids (VSS)/g-N, and much lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emission than the heterotrophic denitrifying process. Microbial community analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique revealed that granules were enriched with SOB contributing to autotrophic denitrification. Furthermore, 16S rRNA analysis showed diverse autotrophic denitrification related genera, namely Thiobacillus (32.6%), Sulfurimonas (31.3%), and Arcobacter (0.01%), accounting for 63.9% of total operational taxonomic units at the generic level. No heterotrophic denitrification related genera were detected. The results from this study could provide useful design and operating conditions with respect to SOB sludge granulation and its subsequent application in a full-scale autotrophic denitrification in the Sulfate reduction-Autotrophic denitrification-Nitrification Integrated (SANI) process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArcobacter 3aThiobacillus 3aautotrophic bacteria 3adenitrification 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agranules 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aparticle size 3aribosomal RNA 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3asulfates 3asulfides 3aChina 0aSulfur-oxidizing bacteria 0aAutotrophic denitrification 0aGranulation 0aMicrobial community analysis1 aLu, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0084-92291 aKhanal, Samir K.1 aZhao, Qing1 aMeng, Liao1 aChen, Guang-Hao0 tWater research.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 104 p.507-519dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245012000178300001400298520199100312592002802303650001302331650001502344650002802359650000902387650002302396650001302419650002402432650002302456650002202479650002102501700002502522700002002547773010702567852000902674856008902683655001202772IND2044976020221120095301.0181002e199501  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204497602DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-199501000-000062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDJINADOU, KOUBOURA A.10aPhosphorus and micronutrient availability from dual application of nitrogen and phosphorus using liquid fertilizers  ap. 49-58.  aApplications of ammoniacal forms of N along with P in the same injection zone can enhance P availability relative to applications of P alone. The spatial and temporal variability of available P was assessed in acid soil and in alkaline soil, using ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as a P source and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) as a N source. Either ammonium polyphosphate or APP+UAN, at a constant P application rate, was injected into soil-filled boxes using an apparatus that allowed a needle to be pulled through the soil below the surface, simulating subsurface band application. Soils boxes were sampled by sequentially removing concentric cylindric cores of increasing radii centered around the line of fertilizer injection. Sampling times were 1, 4, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Available P was determined by either the Bray-1 or the Olsen procedure. Available Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn were also determined with the DTPA procedure. For both soils, soil pH generally decreased in the first 12 weeks and then increased during the remaining incubation period. Treatment comparisons within rings over time showed that APP+UAN generally gave significantly higher extractable P when compared with the APP treatment. Total available P, calculated as the sum of the products of soil dry mass and extractable P for each ring, was significantly higher for APP+UAN compared with APP at all sampling times. The decline in total available P with time was best described by y = a(e + c), where y is the total available P (mg) at time t (weeks) and a, b, and c are curve-fitting parameters. The value of b was greater for the APP treatment for both soils, indicating that total available P declined faster for this treatment than for the APP+UAN treatment. Treatment effects on DTPA-extractable Fe and Mn generally corresponded to changes in soil pH with concentrations increasing with decreasing pH. For DTPA-extractable Zn and Cu, however, concentrations were often lower for the treatment with the lowest pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aammonium polyphosphates 3aurea 3aliquid fertilizers 3amixtures 3aapplication methods 3atemporal variation 3aspatial variation 3aammonium nitrate1 aPierzynski, Gary M.,1 aHAVLIN, JOHN L.0 tSoil science.g1995 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.49-58dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-199501000-000063Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03606naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245019100171300001600362520162200378592002802000650001102028650002402039650001502063650001202078650001202090650001302102650001102115650001502126650002002141650001602161650002302177650000902200650001402209650001402223650001102237650001102248650002202259650001102281650001302292650001402305650001402319650001602333650001502349650001702364650001402381650001002395650001102405650001102416650001202427650001302439651001802452653002102470653001902491653002402510653002102534653002302555700002002578700002202598700002302620700001902643700001902662773012202681856008402803852000902887655001202896IND60541401320221119140932.0190318e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054140132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2013.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJourand, Philippe10aEctomycorrhizal Pisolithus albus inoculation of Acacia spirorbis and Eucalyptus globulus grown in ultramafic topsoil enhances plant growth and mineral nutrition while limits metal uptake  ap. 164-172.  aEctomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) isolates of Pisolithus albus (Cooke and Massee) from nickel-rich ultramafic topsoils in New Caledonia were inoculated onto Acacia spirorbis Labill. (an endemic Fabaceae) and Eucalyptus globulus Labill. (used as a Myrtaceae plant host model). The aim of the study was to analyze the growth of symbiotic ECM plants growing on the ultramafic substrate that is characterized by high and toxic metal concentrations i.e. Co, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni, deficient concentrations of plant essential nutrients such as N, P, K, and that presents an unbalanced Ca/Mg ratio (1/19). ECM inoculation was successful with a plant level of root mycorrhization up to 6.7%. ECM symbiosis enhanced plant growth as indicated by significant increases in shoot and root biomass. Presence of ECM enhanced uptake of major elements that are deficient in ultramafic substrates; in particular P, K and Ca. On the contrary, the ECM symbioses strongly reduced transfer to plants of element in excess in soils; in particular all metals. ECM-inoculated plants released metal complexing molecules as free thiols and oxalic acid mostly at lower concentrations than in controls. Data showed that ECM symbiosis helped plant growth by supplying uptake of deficient elements while acting as a protective barrier to toxic metals, in particular for plants growing on ultramafic substrate with extreme soil conditions. Isolation of indigenous and stress-adapted beneficial ECM fungi could serve as a potential tool for inoculation of ECM endemic plants for the successful restoration of ultramafic ecosystems degraded by mining activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aPisolithus 3abiomass 3acalcium 3achromium 3acobalt 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3ahost plants 3aindigenous species 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amining 3amodels 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aoxalic acid 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aroots 3ashoots 3athiols 3atopsoil 3atoxicity 3aNew Caledonia 0aAcacia spirorbis 0aEctomycorrhiza 0aEucalyptus globulus 0aPisolithus albus 0aUltramafic topsoil1 aHannibal, Laure1 aMajorel, Clarisse1 aMengant, Stéphane1 aDucousso, Marc1 aLebrun, Michel0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 171, no. 2 p.164-172dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2013.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245014000211300001400351520134800365592002801713650002001741650002501761650001001786650001401796650002601810650002201836650001701858650004301875650001001918650001701928651001601945653001701961653004601978653001802024653002002042653002202062653002902084700002002113700002102133700005602154700001902210773007302229856008502302852000902387655001202396IND60545109020221122054459.0161019e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054510902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2014.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvitti, Lauren1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9518-084910aFirst identification of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in the flatworm Stylochoplana sp.; a source of TTX for the sea slug Pleurobranchaea maculata  ap. 23-29.  aHigh concentrations of the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) were detected by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) in the Platyhelminthes Stylochoplana sp. from Pilot Bay (Tauranga, New Zealand). This is the first detection of TTX in this genus. Concentrations were monitored from March to November (2013) and found to significantly decrease from a peak in July (avg. 551 mg kg−1) to November (avg. 140 mg kg−1). Stylochoplana sp. co-occurred with TTX-containing Pleurobranchaea maculata (Opisthobranchia). A Stylochoplana sp.-specific real-time PCR assay was developed targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene to determine if P. maculata consumed Stylochoplana sp. Positive Stylochoplana sp. signals were obtained for 7 of 19 P. maculata tested. Mass calculations indicate Stylochoplana sp. could supply Pilot Bay P. maculata with the TTX required to account for the concentrations reported in previous studies (ca. 1.04 mg TTX per individual) based on an ingestion rate of one individual every 2–3 days throughout their lifetime. However, due to the lack of Stylochoplana sp. in areas with dense P. maculata populations, and high concentration (ca. 1400 mg kg−1) of TTX detected in some individuals, it is unlikely that Stylochoplana sp. represent the sole source of TTX in P. maculata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatyhelminthes 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3aingestion 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amitochondria 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aslugs 3atetrodotoxin 3aNew Zealand 0aTetrodotoxin 0aLiquid chromatography–mass spectrometry 0aReal-time PCR 0aPlatyhelminthes 0aStylochoplana sp. 0aPleurobranchaea maculata1 aWood, Susie A.,1 aTaylor, David I.1 aMcNabb, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1234-63001 aCary, S.

The two enzymes are almost indiscernible from each other because of their highly similar sequences and structures. Metal ions are bound to residues on the β1- and β2-strands and one mobile loop. However, FBP has another phosphate and FBPases exist as a higher oligomeric state, which may discriminate FBPases from IMPases. There are three genes annotated as FBPases in Zymomonas mobilis, termed also cbbF (ZmcbbF). The revealed crystal structure of one ZmcbbF shows a globular structure formed by five stacked layers. Twenty-five residues in the middle of the sequence form an α-helix and a β-strand, which occupy one side of the catalytic site. A non-polar Leu residue among them is protruded to the active site, pointing out unfavorable access of a bulky charged group to this side. In vitro assays have shown its dimeric form in solution. Interestingly, two β-strands of β1 and β2 are disordered in the ZmcbbF structure. These data indicate that ZmcbbF might structurally belong to IMPase, and imply that its active site would be reorganized in a yet unreported way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZymomonas mobilis 3aactive sites 3acrystal structure 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3ainosine monophosphate 3ametal ions 3aphosphates 0aDLS 0aFBP 0aFBPase 0aIMP 0aIMPase 0aML 0armsd 0aSEC 0aCrystal structure 0aIMPase 0aFBPase 0acbbF 0aZymomonas mobilis1 aPark, Suk-Youl1 aKim, Jeong-Sun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Feb. 28, v. 445 p.78-83dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.01.1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009200168300001800260500001100278520114000289592002801429596006201457596009401519650002001613650002101633650001301654650000901667650001701676650001901693650001501712650001901727650002301746650001901769650001601788650001101804700002901815700002701844700003001871773012401901856008302025852000902108655001202117IND60756145120221122183308.0211111e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075614512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-021-09742-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmagro, Lorena10aRecent trends in the biotechnological production of tocopherols using in vitro cultures  ap. 1193-1207.  aReview  aTocopherols, a class of terpenoid compounds with vitamin-E activity, are produced by photosynthetic organisms, including cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. The chemical structure of tocopherols consists of a hydrophobic prenyl tail linked to a polar chromanol head. Depending on the position and number of methyl groups on the chromanol head, tocopherols are classed as α, β, γ, and δ isomers. Tocopherols play a key role in plant defense, and have bioactive properties beneficial for human health, being reported to prevent atherosclerosis, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, eyesight degeneration, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. The high market demand for tocopherols calls for new strategies to improve their supply from sustainable sources, and a promising approach is to develop biotechnological factories with tocopherol-producing plant and microalgae in vitro cultures. This review provides a detailed overview of different strategies devised to enhance tocopherol production using such systems, with particular focus on elicitation and feeding, culture conditions, and the application of metabolic engineering.  aPublisher supplied data  aBIO2017-82374-RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  a19876/GERM/15cFundación Seneca-Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia 3aatherosclerosis 3acoronary disease 3adiabetes 3ahead 3ahuman health 3ahydrophobicity 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant biochemistry 3asupply balance 3atocopherols 3avision1 aSabater-Jara, Ana Belén1 aBelchí-Navarro, Sarai1 aPedreño, María Ángeles0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2021 Dec., v. 20, no. 6 p.1193-1207dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870073x1568-77677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-021-09742-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013100169300001600300520195100316592002802267650004402295650003602339650001502375650002502390650001102415650002202426650001102448650001002459650002402469650002502493650001302518650000702531650003102538650000902569650001802578650003302596650001302629650002302642650002402665650002102689650002002710650001902730653001502749653003902764653001902803653001302822653000902835653001002844653000902854653000702863653000802870653000802878653001002886653000702896653000802903653000802911700002402919773009802943856008503041852000903126655001203135IND60546971120221121222847.0160903e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054697112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzbay, Nurgul10aFactorial experimental design for Remazol Yellow dye sorption using apple pulp/apple pulp carbon–titanium dioxide co-sorbent  ap. 333-343.  aDye containing effluents can cause severe organic and color pollution in the water environment, thus removal of reactive dyes by sorption is an important circumstance. The aim of this study was to identify the operating conditions which influence Remazol Yellow dye sorption from aqueous solutions. There are limited numbers of literature studies about Remazol Yellow dye sorption. Despite that the sorption of Remazol Yellow dye by co-sorbent system and optimization of such process have not yet been studied. Thus, apple pulp and carbonized apple pulp at 550 °C were used as sorbents, also apple pulp–titanium dioxide and apple pulp carbon–titanium dioxide mixtures were used as co-sorbents. Elemental analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, zeta potential, particle size distribution, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis were conducted to analyze apple pulp and apple pulp carbon. The effects of pH, initial dye concentration and contact time were investigated by 33 full factorial experimental design method and analysis of variance statistical approach to optimize the operating conditions. The maximum percentage dye removal was obtained as 86.97% (sorbent type = apple pulp–titanium dioxide, pH = 2, initial dye concentration = 10 mg/L and contact time = 120 min). pH, initial dye concentration and contact time were found as significant within a 95% confidence level for all type of sorbents. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich equations and the Langmuir model showed the best fit with equilibrium isotherm data. Furthermore, pseudo-first and second-order kinetic models were also used to analyze sorption kinetics. Since apple pulp was low-cost and easily available material, and also application of co-sorbent was influential for dye sorption; it could be successfully applied for the removal of Remazol Yellow dye from aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aanalysis of variance 3aapples 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3aindustrial effluents 3akinetics 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3apulp 3areactive dyes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3asystem optimization 3atitanium dioxide 3awater pollution 3azeta potential 0aApple pulp 0aFull factorial experimental design 0aRemazol Yellow 0aSorption 0aTiO2 0aANOVA 0aAOPs 0aAP 0aAPC 0aATR 0aFT-IR 0aRY 0aSEM 0aXRF1 aYargic, Adife Seyda0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 100 p.333-343dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011300167300001600280520157700296592002801873650001501901650001201916650001301928650002001941653000801961653002601969653003601995653001502031700001702046700001602063700001502079700001902094773012202113856008302235852000902318655001202327IND60779698320221120120547.0220719e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077969832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tongxin10aIn-situ comparison of interface instability of basal and edge planes during unidirectional growth of sea ice  ap. 169-177.  aThe evolutions of water/ice interface with distinct ice orientations are one of the central problems in sea ice growth. Some misunderstandings prevailed in previous hypothesis on morphological evolution of sea ice, which need the validation with carefully designed experiments. Up to now, there is no in-situ comparison of unidirectional freezing behavior between distinct ice orientations, which makes the previous hypothesis on sea ice growth skeptical about its physical basis. The aim of this paper is to provide an in-situ comparison of unidirectional growth behavior of lamellar sea ice between basal and edge planes. Our experiment is realized by a delicate design of parallel freezing samples with two specified ice orientations in a modeled sea water under an imposed thermal gradient. The planar instability as well as the unidirectional cellular/dendritic growth patterns of water/ice interfaces of basal and edge plane ice are compared. It is found that the instability grows faster for edge plane ice, which is addressed by an incubation time coupled with the surface tension anisotropy. In addition, two types of tilted growth patterns of sea ice after planar instability are observed simultaneously, which are suggested to stem from distinct physical origins and provide a new insight into the tilted growth of cellular/dendritic ice. Collectively, these experimental results are suggested to promote our understanding of morphological evolution of unidirectional growth of sea ice, as well as its diverse relevance to many other areas involving ice growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3asea ice 3aseawater 3asurface tension 0aIce 0aInterface instability 0aUnidirectional freezing pattern 0aAnisotropy1 aWang, Zhijun1 aWang, Lilin1 aLi, Junjie1 aWang, Jincheng0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Nov., v. 625 p.169-177dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013100168500002200299520068200321592002801003650001601031650002601047650002301073650001701096650001301113650001001126650002001136650001901156650001901175650001901194650001401213653003101227653002201258653001701280700002501297700002201322700002501344700001901369700002001388773007901408856008201487852000901569655001201578IND60656046920221116214736.0190815e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065604692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.1304982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogers, David A.10aVisible-light photocatalytic activation of N-chlorosuccinimide by organic dyes for the chlorination of arenes and heteroarenes  aPre-press version  aA variety of arenes and heteroarenes are chlorinated in moderate to excellent yields using N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) under visible-light activated conditions.

According to mechanistic studies described within, the reaction is speculated to proceed via a single electron oxidation of NCS utilizing methylene green under visible-light photoredox pathway.

Previous theories suggested that changes in stress in the wood caused by daytime heating and nighttime cooling might be linked with sap flow. Consequently, a study of itaya-kaede maple (Aver mono) and shirakamba birch (Betula platyphylla var.japonica) looked at tangential strains. One-hour intervals for 3 years of the tangential strains on the inner bark of stem and root were measured in itaya-kaede maple and shirakamba birch during the sap exudation season. The measurements indicated different mechanisms of sap exudation in these two trees. During the sap exudation season in late March, when the temperature fluctuated around 0°C, the tangential strain in the root of itaya-kaede maple showed expansion in the daytime and contraction at night. Conversely, in early April the tangential strain in the root of shirakamba birch exhibited contraction in the daytime and expansion at night. The changes in tangential strains in itaya-kaede maple were attributed to conditioning, a known concept used to explain the uptake mechanism of soil water in maple and its exudation during early spring. However, because the change in tangential strain in the roots of shirakamba birch was similar to that found during the rampant season, sap exudation was not attributed to conditioning but to the plentiful supply of water from the roots. The implications of these mechanisms are that different sap harvesting techniques may be appropriate for different tree species.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3aAcer pictum subsp. mono 3astems 3aBetula pendula subsp. mandshurica 3aair temperature 3asap flow 3aexudation 3anight temperature 3aseasonal variation 3abark 3aroots 0aspecies differences 0aBetula platyphylla1 aYamamoto, O.q(Osamu),1 aOkuyama, Takashi1 aTamai, Yutaka1 aSano, Yuzou1 aTerazawa, Minoru0 tJournal of wood science.g1999 Oct., v. 45, no. 5 p.361-367dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF011779063Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04046naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245014600162300001300308520253800321592002802859650002102887650001502908650001702923650001302940650001702953650001302970650001902983650001903002650001403021650001703035650001403052650001503066650000903081650001003090650002103100650001303121650002003134653002003154653003203174653001003206653001403216653003003230700001603260700001803276700002603294700002303320773008003343856008403423852000903507655001203516IND60556707320221117161249.0170713e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055670732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei10aImpact of prechlorination on organophosphorus pesticides during drinking water treatment: Removal and transformation to toxic oxon byproducts  ap. 1-10.  aPrechlorination is commonly used to minimize operational problems associated with biological growth as well as taste and odor control during drinking water treatment. However, prechlorination can also oxidise micropollutants into intermediate byproducts. This could impose profound effects on the safety of the finished water if the transformed byproducts are more toxic and less removable. This study investigated the effect of prechlorination on decomposition and subsequent removal of the four organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs): chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion and tolclofos-methyl using a simulated conventional water treatment process of powdered activated carbon assisted coagulation-sedimentation-filtration (PAC-CSF) and postchlorination. It was found that, following prechlorination, not only did the percentage of OPPs oxidation vary significantly, but also the concentration of transformed oxons, which are more toxic than their parent compounds, increased as the major identified oxidation byproducts in water. Removal of these oxons proved to be more difficult by the PAC-CSF than their parent OPPs, because they are more water soluble and more hydrophilic. Both the OPP oxidation and oxon formation increased with chlorine dose during prechlorination. Meanwhile, the continuing chlorination of OPPs by residual free chlorine during PAC-CSF further complicated the pesticide removal processes, generally resulting in a gradually increased formation of oxons. Moreover, in the final treatment stage of postchlorination, the more chlorine-reactive pesticides, malathion and diazinon, were completely oxidised and the formation of corresponding oxons was increased with the prechlorine dose. In contrast, a certain amount of the less chlorine-reactive pesticide tolclofos-methyl still remained in solution after postchlorination, accompanied by an increased formation of tolclofos-methyl oxon with prechlorine dose. Since the oxons are resistant to further oxidation and less adsorbable during the PAC-CSF process, the gross removal of these pesticides and their oxons decreased with increase of the prechlorine dose. This led to an accumulation of the more toxic oxons in the finished water, especially at higher chlorine doses during prechlorination. The significance of this work is the demonstration that, under circumstances where prechlorination is used and source water contains traces of OPPs, alternative practices should be prioritized to avoid the potential risks involved in consumption of the treated water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abyproducts 3achlorination 3achlorine 3achlorpyrifos 3adiazinon 3adrinking water 3ahydrophilicity 3amalathion 3aodor control 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3arisk 3ataste 3atolclofos-methyl 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 0aPrechlorination 0aOrganophosphorus pesticides 0aOxons 0aOxidation 0aPowdered activated carbon1 aWu, Ruiqing1 aDuan, Jinming1 aSaint, Christopher P.1 aLeeuwen, John van,0 tWater research.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 105 p.1-10dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009300168300001600261520177700277592002802054650002502082650003602107650002402143650002502167650001002192650001302202650002102215650001902236651001002255653003602265653002502301653001902326653002602345653001002371653000802381653000802389700002202397773009802419856008502517852000902602655001202611IND60546971320221121204409.0160903e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054697132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Qinghua10aEvaluating practices and drivers of corporate social responsibility: the Chinese context  ap. 315-324.  aCorporate social responsibility (CSR) has gained an increasing attention all over the world, but studies are mainly about developed countries. Developing countries have promoted CSR but concepts and approaches can be different from those in developed countries due to geographic, political, and economic contexts. In a unique developing country of China, the government has initially encouraged state-owned companies (SOCs) to implement CSR practices. However, no clear and commonly accepted CSR definition or concept exists. This paper develops items on CSR practices mainly based on the internationally accepted ISO26000 framework while integrating characteristics of Chinese SOCs. Statistical results of 146 usable questionnaires show that Chinese SOCs implement four types of CSR practices under the ISO26000 framework, they are those related to employee rights, consumer issues, fair operation and labor practices. Charity is a specific CSR dimension in China, but it is only implemented at the low level. Chinese SOCs have the high internal CSR values which promote most CSRs except those related to charity and employee rights. External institutional drivers for CSR practices are relatively low. Normative drivers motivate most CSR practices while competitive drivers only motivate consumer issues-related CSR practices. This paper contributes to extend previous studies mainly for developed countries to develop a CSR concept for Chinese SOCs by using both the international ISO26000 framework and considering the specific context. Statistic results identify how to motivate CSR practices among Chinese SOCs effectively, which can provide implications for not only the Chinese government, but also multi-national companies that do or plan to do business in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acorporate social responsibility 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3alabor 3apolitics 3apublic ownership 3aquestionnaires 3aChina 0aCorporate social responsibility 0aInstitutional driver 0aInternal value 0aState-owned companies 0aChina 0aCSR 0aSOC1 aZhang, Qiangzhong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 100 p.315-324dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245007900209500001900288520163600307592002801943650001501971650001601986650001402002650002402016653002402040653002102064653001402085653001902099653002502118653003002143700003402173700006002207700005502267773009302322856008602415852000902501655001202510IND60716511320221118143604.0210124e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071651132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e032252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDvornik, Josip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0620-981210aExact arithmetic as a tool for convergence assessment of the IRM-CG method  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUsing exact computer arithmetic, it is possible to determine the (exact) solution of a numerical model without any rounding error. For such purposes, a corresponding system of equations should be exactly defined, either directly or by rationalising the numerically given input data. In the latter case, there is an initial round-off error, but this does not propagate during the solution process. If this system is exactly solved first and then using floating-point arithmetic, the convergence of the numerical method easily follows. As an example, the IRM–CG, which is an alternative to the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method and a special case of the more general Iterated Ritz Method (IRM), is verified. The method is not based on conjugacy; therefore, restarting strategies are not required, while an overrelaxation factor and preconditioning like techniques could be easily adopted. The exact arithmetic approach is introduced by means of a simple example and is then applied to small structural engineering problems. The perturbation of the displacement increment and the different condition numbers of the system matrix are used to check the stability of the algorithm. Interestingly, a large difference in the number of steps between the exact and numerical approaches is detected, even for well-conditioned systems. According to the tests, the IRM-CG may be considered to be stable and useful for not well-posed or well-posed but ill-conditioned models. Because the computer demands and execution time grow enormously with the number of unknowns using this strategy, three possibilities for larger systems are also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aarithmetics 3acomputers 3amathematical models 0aApplied mathematics 0aExact arithmetic 0aBenchmark 0aRounding error 0aIterated Ritz Method 0aConjugate gradient method1 aJaguljnjak Lazarevic, Antonia1 aLazarevic, Damir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7439-719X1 aUros, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2964-02340 tHeliyon.g2020 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e03225-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e032253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016200165300001600327520113800343592002801481650000801509650002401517650001901541650001401560650002101574650001801595650001301613650001801626650001301644650001101657650001101668650000901679653002201688653003601710653003401746653002301780700001701803700001901820700001401839700001301853700001601866773012201882856008302004852000902087655001202096IND60779698520221120120606.0220719e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077969852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Weichao10aIron-nickel alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries  ap. 278-288.  aIn this work, we present an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst comprising iron-nickel (FeNi) alloy nanoparticles confined in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (denoted FeNi-NCNT) for zinc-air batteries. The FeNi-NCNT electrocatalyst is fabricated by anion-exchange of nickel(II) ion/zinc(II) ion-2,4,6-tris-(di(pyridin-2-yl)amino)-1,3,5-triazine complex with ferricyanide anion followed by mixing with melamine and then carbonization. The resultant FeNi-NCNT electrocatalyst displays excellent bifunctional activity with a low reversible oxygen electrode index of 0.725 V. The rechargeable aqueous zinc-air battery fabricated with FeNi-NCNT air cathode manifests both high specific capacity (819 mAh g⁻¹Zₙ at 5.0 mA cm⁻²) and long cycle life (1500 cycles/1000 h at 10 mA cm⁻², 600 cycles/400 h at 25 mA cm⁻², and 165 cycles/110 h at 50 mA cm⁻²).

The antennae of cattle grub males and females were examined through stereoscopic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to reveal the general morphology, combined with distribution, type, size, and ultrastructure of the antennal sensilla. All of the three antennal segments (antennal scape, pedicel, and funiculus) possess microtrichiae on their surface. Mechanoreceptors only exist on the antennal scape and pedicel. The antennal funiculus presents four types of antennal sensilla: trichoid, basiconic, coeloconic, and clavate sensilla. Three distinctive characters of H. lineatum are obvious: (1) the relatively slender, flexible, and equal-height mechanoreceptors; (2) the enlarged antennal pedicel, and numerous antennal sensory pits and pit sensilla on the antennal funiculus; and (3) all types of antennal sensilla clustered in sensory pits, respectively. Additionally, the enlarged antennal pedicel and abundant sensory pits and pit sensilla might facilitate odor detection, enhance olfactory sensitivity and accuracy, and also protect the fragile antennal sensilla from mechanical irritation or damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypoderma lineatum 3aantennae 3afemales 3amales 3amechanoreceptors 3aodors 3apedicel 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensilla 3aultrastructure1 aLiu, X.

Results showed that the average concentration of ∑PAHs in the urban greenland of Nanjing (499.47 ng/g) was comparable to the value reported for other cities under similar conditions. Acenaphthene was the dominant compound (46.2% of the ∑PAHs), and low molecular weight PAHs (LPAHs) represented the largest share of ∑PAHs. Concentrations of ∑PAHs in 6 function zones were different, with the highest value in IZ (954.33 ng/g) and lowest value in URF (147.81 ng/g). The soil showed the highest ∑PAHs contamination in the layer 10~20 cm in all zones (on average 547.01 ng/g). ∑PAHs of IZ showed the highest values in all soil layers. Isomer ratio and factor analysis were used to determine the source of PAHs in soil. Petroleum combustion (PC), coal and biomass combustion (CBC), mixed (M) and petroleum (P) sources were finally identified as the four main sources of PAHs in Nanjing urban greenland soil, accounting for 50.2%, 14.9%, 8.4% and 6.6%, respectively. Bap toxic equivalent (TEQBₐₚ) was used to analyze the ecological risk. TEQBₐₚ was 20.59 ng/g in total zones (TZ), below the threshold for multipurpose soil of Dutch legislation (32.96 ng/g), but 69% of samples exceeded this threshold. TEQBₐₚ of different functional zones is ordered as: IZ (43.62 ng/g)>RZ (23.89 ng/g) > BZ (20.62 ng/g) > CZ (19. 93 ng/g) > UP (12.97 ng/g) > URF (2.01 ng/g). In the industrial area, more than 97% of TEQBₐₚ depended on seven carcinogenic PAHs (∑PAH₇c), which indicated that IZ had high ecological risk. Lifetime risk of cancer (ILCR) model was used to assess the health risk of ∑PAHs. ILCRs ranked as following: children > youth > adults, with soil oral intake determining the highest cancer risk, followed by skin contact and breath intake. ILCRs of children were in high cancer risk range, with values of 3.77 × 10⁻⁴ (for boy) and 3.87 × 10⁻⁴ (for girl), while ILCRs of youth and adults were in an acceptable range; ILCRs were highest in IZ, followed by RZ, BZ, CZ, UP and URF. The soil PAHs analysis in different function greenland zones of Nanjing showed that land use influenced the concentration and distribution of PAHs in soils. This difference should be taken into account in the urban greenland planning and management to reduce the risks for the environment and human health.  aPublisher supplied data  a31670615cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31270664cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aPAPDcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (CN)  a586247-EPP-1-2017-1-IT-EPPKA2- CBHE-JPcErasmus+ Program of the Europen Union 3abiomass 3aboys 3acarcinogenicity 3acoal 3acombustion 3afactor analysis 3aforests 3ageochemistry 3agirls 3ahuman health 3aisomers 3aland use 3alaws and regulations 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apetroleum 3arisk 3asoil 3aurban parks 3ayouth 3aChina 3aGreenland1 aYang, Jingyu1 aYu, Fei1 aLiu, Xiaodong1 aYu, Yuanchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4625-44900 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2020 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.4327-4340dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870049x0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-019-00490-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009600167300001600263520122500279592002801504650001701532650002601549650001101575650001601586650001101602650001501613650002101628650002001649650001401669650001101683653001101694653001101705653000801716653001001724653002001734653002001754653003001774653002001804653002401824700001801848700001801866700001301884773012101897856008202018852000902100655001202109IND60532962720221120122324.0160728e20140228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053296272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.01.1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Chan-Hun10aRetarded protein folding of the human Z-type α1-antitrypsin variant is suppressed by Cpr2p  ap. 191-195.  aThe human Z-type α1-antitrypsin variant has a strong tendency to accumulate folding intermediates due to extremely slow protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes. Human α1-antitrypsin has 17 peptidyl-prolyl bonds per molecule; thus, the effect of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases on Z-type α1-antitrypsin protein folding was analyzed in this study. The protein level of Cpr2p, a yeast ER peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, increased more than two-fold in Z-type α1-antitrypsin-expressing yeast cells compared to that in wild-type α1-antitrypsin-expressing cells. When CPR2 was deleted from the yeast genome, the cytotoxicity of Z-type α1-antitrypsin increased significantly. The interaction between Z-type α1-antitrypsin and Cpr2p was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. In vitro folding assays showed that Cpr2p facilitated Z-type α1-antitrypsin folding into the native state. Furthermore, Cpr2p overexpression significantly increased the extracellular secretion of Z-type α1-antitrypsin. Our results indicate that ER peptidyl-prolyl isomerases may rescue Z-type α1-antitrypsin molecules from retarded folding and eventually relieve clinical symptoms caused by this pathological α1-antitrypsin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agenome 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3aisomerases 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein folding 3asecretion 3ayeasts 0aPPIase 0aα1-AT 0aYPD 0aYPGal 0aα1-Antitrypsin 0aFolding disease 0aPeptidyl-prolyl isomerase 0aProtein folding 0aProtein interaction1 aKim, Yang-Hee1 aLee, Kyunghee1 aIm, Hana0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Feb. 28, v. 445 p.191-195dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.01.1563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009900166300001600265520115500281592002801436650001501464650002101479650001701500650001601517650001001533650001301543650002001556650003901576650001701615653001301632653005101645653002601696653003901722653000801761653001201769653000801781653000801789653000901797700001801806700002101824700002001845700006301865700002201928700001901950700001801969700002101987700001902008700001702027773012102044856008202165852000902247655001202256IND60533123320221122033334.0160728e20150213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053312332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmano, Yosuke10aOncogenic TPM3-ALK activation requires dimerization through the coiled-coil structure of TPM3  ap. 457-460.  aInflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a mesenchymal tumor that can arise from anywhere in the body. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements, most often resulting in the tropomyosin 3 (TPM3)-ALK fusion gene, are the main causes of IMT. However, the mechanism of malignant transformation in IMT has yet to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of the TPM3 region in the transformation of IMT via TPM3-ALK. Lentivirus vectors containing a TPM3-ALK fusion gene lacking various lengths of TPM3 were constructed and expressed in HEK293T and NIH3T3 cell lines. Focus formation assay revealed loss of contact inhibition in NIH3T3 cells transfected with full-length TPM3-ALK, but not with ALK alone. Blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) revealed that TPM3-ALK dimerization increased in proportion to the length of TPM3. Western blot showed phosphorylation of ALK, ERK1/2, and STAT3 in HEK293T cells transfected with TPM3-ALK. Thus, the coiled-coil structure of TPM3 contributes to the transforming ability of the TPM3-ALK fusion protein, and longer TPM3 region leads to higher dimer formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentivirus 3aWestern blotting 3adimerization 3agene fusion 3agenes 3alymphoma 3aphosphorylation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atropomyosins 0aTPM3-ALK 0aBlue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 0aCoiled-coil structure 0aInflammatory myofibroblastic tumor 0aALK 0aBN-PAGE 0aGFP 0aIMT 0aTPM31 aIshikawa, Rie1 aSakatani, Toshio1 aIchinose, Junji1 aSunohara, Mitsuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5671-68981 aWatanabe, Kousuke1 aKage, Hidenori1 aNakajima, Jun1 aNagase, Takahide1 aOhishi, Nobuya1 aTakai, Daiya0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Feb. 13, v. 457 p.457-460dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01282naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009900167300001600266520027900282592002800561650001700589650001100606650001200617650002400629650002300653650001000676650001700686700002300703700002300726773011700749856008100866852000900947655001200956IND60523566120221120181419.0160623e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052356612DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117160200412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFominykh, A.

P. B.) was studied in selected habitats under spatially different light regimes: (a) shade condition under oak trees, (b) half shade in a shrubby area and (c) full-sun conditions on unshaded grassland. This study assessed the variations in AMF colonization of the grass dependent on the light supply in field habitats. Soil, root and shoot samples were collected four times during the vegetation period (in June, July, September and October). Root colonization, root and shoot biomass as well as soil water content were determined. The highest rate of AMF colonization was detected in June under half-sun and full-sun conditions, where about 50% of the roots were colonized. The average amount of arbuscules was less than 20% in the roots at the three sites, with the highest number of arbuscules in June, under half-sun and full-sun conditions, however, not under the trees. Overall, best mycorrhizal colonization occurred during summer, and its rate decreased in autumn. This tendency inversely correlated with the amount of precipitation, and thus with the water content of soils. The high colonization rate of the examined root samples, and also its seasonal fluctuation, might reflect the importance of the symbiosis where inorganic nutrients and water are the growth-limiting factors. The marginal AMF colonization of chalk false-brome under shade conditions indicates that plants do not use AMF under all stress conditions. When low light limits photosynthesis and thus growth of the plants, they dispense with the colonization of AMF in order to save the expenditure of organic carbon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachypodium pinnatum 3aQuercus 3aautumn 3abiomass 3acarbon 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrients 3aphotoperiod 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asummer 3atrees 3awater content 0aChalk false-brome 0aBrachypodium pinnatum 0aArbuscular mycorrhiza 0aLight stress 0aStress-alleviation by mycorrhiza1 aBothe, Hermann1 aMolnár, Edit,1 aBiró, Borbála0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 171, no. 5 p.1-6dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2013.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014200178500001900320520155000339592002801889650001401917650001801931650001101949650001301960650001701973650001101990650001302001650001502014650002402029650001702053650001902070653001702089653001902106653001702125653002502142653001702167653001102184653001302195653002502208653003202233653001002265700002402275700002502299773009302324856008602417852000902503655001202512IND60716511620221118143541.0210124e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071651162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e032292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMphahlele, Rebogile R.10aEffects of packaging and duration on quality of minimally processed and unpitted litchi cv. ‘Mauritius’ under low storage temperature  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPericarp drying is a major postharvest challenge affecting the shelf life of litchi fruit resulting in loss of market value and consumer rejection. Sulphur dioxide (SO₂) is considered an allergen due to its ability to cause irritation in people, particularly those vulnerable to asthma. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of packaging and storage duration without SO₂ on the quality attributes of minimally processed litchi fruit cv. ‘Mauritus’. Minimally processed litchi cv. ‘Mauritius’ were packed inside clamshell trays with different perforation sizes: 0 (P-0), 1.1 mm (P-1), and 5.4 mm (P-2) and stored at 1 °C for 15 days, and then held at 12 °C for 2 days for shelf life study (mimicking retail practices). The least mass loss % was observed in fruit packaged under P-0 followed by P-1 and P-2 until the end of storage. Fruit packed in P-2 (5.4 mm perforation) had the highest firmness compared to samples from other packages, but, they also had the highest decay incidences at day 9. The TSS (°Brix) was highest in fruit packed under P-0 followed by P-2 than P-1 at the end of storage. The TSS:TA increased significantly with storage duration with highest value obtained on day 9 in P-0 (121.63) in comparison to P-1 (108.44) and P-2 (103.35). Ascorbic acid and radical scavenging activity declined with prolonged storage irrespective of package type. Overall litchi fruit were better maintained in non-perforated and 1.1 mm perforated clamshell trays up to 9 days, without decay incidences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3aascorbic acid 3aasthma 3afirmness 3amarket value 3apeople 3apericarp 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3asulfur dioxide 0aFood science 0aFood packaging 0aFood quality 0aAgricultural science 0aHorticulture 0aLitchi 0aAllergen 0aTotal soluble solids 0aRadical scavenging activity 0aDecay1 aCaleb, Oluwafemi J.1 aNgcobo, Mduduzi E.K.0 tHeliyon.g2020 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e03229-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e032293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006700167300001600234520064700250592002800897650002400925650002200949650002100971650002200992650001101014650001001025650001701035651001101052773011701063856008101180852000901261655001201270IND60523566220221120181342.0160623e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052356622DNAL7 a10.1134/S207511171602003X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorisova, E.

In practice, however, using Ar as a cryogen for Ar adsorption measurements is not preferred due to its higher cost than liquid N₂. We propose using O₂ which has a much lower quadrupole moment than N₂, and its adsorption can be measured using standard liquid N₂ as a coolant. To support using O₂, we demonstrate good agreement between the PSDs calculated from O₂ and Ar adsorption. In the present work, we develop several semiempirical models based on nonlocald density functional theory (NLDFT) for the PSD characterization of several types of zeolites. We discuss the underlying difficulties in modeling gas adsorption on zeolites which adsorption potential field depends on both the pore width and the chemical structure of the zeolite. For the analysis of ultra microporous zeolites such as Chabazite and molecular sieve 5A, we apply H₂ in combination with O₂ at 77 K. H₂ molecule has a smaller diameter than O₂ and diffuses faster into ultra micropores, reducing the time of isotherm measurement. Moreover, we show that the dual gas analysis method can be used with O₂ isotherms measurements omitting low-pressure points, making the analysis faster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical structure 3adensity functional theory 3aliquid nitrogen 3amicropores 3aporosity 3aporous media 3azeolites 0aUltra microporous zeolites 0aDual gas adsorption analysis 0aNLDFT models for O2 and H2 analysis1 aKenvin, Jeffrey0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Nov., v. 625 p.178-186dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015300209300001800362500001900380520147400399592002801873650003601901650002001937650002101957650001501978650001701993650001602010650001702026650001202043650000902055650000902064650001902073651001302092700005602105700005702161700005602218773014002274856008202414852000902496655001202505IND60718731220221118113021.0201125e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071873122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-020-00514-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossini-Oliva, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6774-472310aSoil–plant system and potential human health risk of Chinese cabbage and oregano growing in soils from Mn- and Fe-abandoned mines: microcosm assay  ap. 4073-4086.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn Portugal, many abandoned mines are often close to agricultural areas and might be used for plant food cultivation. Soils in the vicinity of two Mn- and Fe-abandoned mines (Ferragudo and Rosalgar, SW of Portugal) were collected to cultivate two different food species (Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis (Lour.) Hanelt and Origanum vulgare L.). Chemical characterization of the soil–plant system and potential risk of adverse effects for human health posed by plants associated with soil contamination, based on the estimation of hazard quotient (HQ), were assessed in a microcosm assay under greenhouse conditions. In both soils, the average total concentrations of Fe and Mn were above the normal values for soils in the region and their concentration in shoots of both species was very high. Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis grew better in Ferragudo than in Rosalgar soils, and it behaved as an excluder of Cu, Mn, Fe, S and Zn in both soils. The HQ for Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in the studied species grown on both soils was lower than unit indicating that its consumption is safe. The high Mn tolerance found in both species might be due in part to the high contents of Fe in the soil available fraction that might contribute to an antagonism effect in the uptake and translocation of Mn. The obtained results emphasize the need of further studies with different food crops before cultivation in the studied soils to assess health risks associated with high metal intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3aChinese cabbage 3aOriganum vulgare 3aantagonism 3ageochemistry 3agreenhouses 3ahuman health 3aoregano 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3aPortugal1 aAbreu, M.

Patrick10aInduction of Polyphenol Oxidase Activity in Dormant Wild Oat (Avena fatua) Seeds and Caryopses: A Defense Response to Seed Decay Fungi  ap. 137-144.  aPersistence of the soil seed bank requires both dormancy and resistance to seed decay organisms. However, there is little or no information evaluating biochemical responses of dormant weed seeds to pathogens. Wild oat caryopses were incubated with four pathogenic fungal isolates to evaluate the response of the pathogen defense enzyme, polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Caryopsis PPO activity was induced by three Fusarium spp. isolates previously obtained from whole seeds incubated in the field whereas caryopsis PPO activity was decreased by a Pythium isolate. Fusarium avenaceum isolate F.a.1 caused the greatest PPO induction and was studied in more detail. When whole wild oat seeds were incubated on F.a.1, PPO activity was induced in seeds, hulls (lemma and palea), and caryopses. Incubation of whole seeds on F.a.1 gradually induced caryopsis PPO activity over an 8-d period, whereas incubation of caryopses on F.a.1 over a 4-d period caused a greater and more rapid induction of PPO activity. Very little PPO activity could be leached from untreated caryopses, but nearly all of the induced PPO activity in F.a.1-treated caryopses was readily leached when incubated in buffer. In Western blots, both untreated and F.a.1-treated leachates contained a ∼∼57-kilodalton (kD) protein, putatively the mature and relatively inactive form of PPO. However, lower molecular weight antigenic proteins between ∼∼52 and ∼∼25 kD were strongly induced in F.a.1-treated caryopses, with this induction being correlated with the increase in PPO activity. We hypothesize that dormant weed seeds possess biochemical defenses against pathogens and, more specifically, that proteolysis in the presence of fungal pathogens may release an activated form of PPO from the surface of wild oat caryopses and hulls.Nomenclature: Wild oat, Avena fatua L.

Needles from trees of one loblolly pine clone were assayed for the EOs α-pinene, β-pinene, terpineol, limonene, and caryophyllene across a growing season. Results showed strong positive correlations among EOs, except for caryophyllene, with Pearson’s correlation values ranging from .66–.96. Simultaneously, physiological attributes of tree stomatal conductance, water stress, and environmental attributes including soil moisture, photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity were measured. The plants modulated the EO concentrations as a function of a changing environment season. The collection month had the largest effect on EO yields and highest yields were during the beginning of the growing season. Decreases in EOs were evident as the growing season progressed and as plants exhibited greater water stress, temperatures, solar radiation, and less stomatal conductance and soil moisture. Loblolly pine’s main constituents of EOs were tightly linked and were influenced by seasonal changes (i.e., month); still, environmental/physiological attributes exhibited significant effects on α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene concentrations. Early spring conditions with ample water were most conducive to high concentrations of EOs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3aalpha-pinene 3aantibacterial properties 3abeta-pinene 3aessential oils 3agrowing season 3alimonene 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3arelative humidity 3aseasonal variation 3asoil water 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3astomatal conductance 3atemperature 3aterpineol 3atrees 3awater stress 3awind speed 3aUnited States 0aEssential oils 0aphysiological environmental interactions 0apine 0aseasonal variations1 aAdams, Joshua P.1 aSakul, Richard1 aMartin, Elizabeth M.1 aRicke, Steven C.1 aGibson, Kristen E.1 aCarrier, D.

In Brazil, patients with severe scorpion envenoming have mainly cardiovascular events, including acute heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock, death is rare. We described 58 accidents presumably caused by Tityus obscurus in Brazilian Amazonia. Patients reported a sensation of “electric shocks” which could last hours. The vast majority of patients presented a clinical picture compatible with acute cerebellar dysfunction, beginning minutes and lasting up to 2 days after the accident. They presented cerebellar ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, dysmetry, dysarthria, dyslalia, nausea and vomiting. Besides, some patients presented myoclonus and fasciculation which can also be attributed to cerebellar dysfunction or maybe the result of direct action on skeletal muscle. Two patients had evidence of intense rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. The clinical picture in this scorpion envenoming is mainly characterized by an acute dysfunction of cerebellar activities and abnormal neuromuscular manifestations and in some cases muscle injury which are not described in any other region of the world. This work presents clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory and treatment aspects of this unmatched scorpion envenoming in the state of Pará, northern Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTityus 3aaccidents 3aacute respiratory distress syndrome 3aataxia (disorder) 3acerebellum 3adeath 3aheart failure 3akidneys 3amuscles 3anausea 3apatients 3apublic health 3arhabdomyolysis 3asensation 3askeletal muscle 3avomiting 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 3aIndia 3aLatin America 3aMiddle East 3aNorthern Africa 0aScorpion sting 0aEnvenomation 0aCerebellum 0aTityus 0aAmazonia1 aQuiroga, Mariana M.M.1 aAbati, Paulo A.M.1 aMascheretti, Melissa1 aCosta, Walter Silva1 aCampos, Luciana P.1 aFrança, Francisco O.S.0 tToxicon.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 96 p.68-73dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2014.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014400175500001900319520116200338592002801500650000901528650001501537650001701552650001301569650001701582650001701599650002501616650000901641653001801650653001701668653001101685653001601696653003601712653001201748700001901760700007101779700002001850773009301870856008601963852000902049655001202058IND60716511820221118143521.0210124e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071651182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e032312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkbarzadeh, Fatemeh12aA novel synthesis of new antibacterial nanostructures based on Zn-MOF compound: design, characterization and a high performance application  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the novel zinc metal-organic frameworks (MOF) nanostructure has been employed, which was developed using an affordable, environmental friendly, efficient and fast method of ultrasound-assisted reverse micelle (UARM). These nanostructures were identified with various techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, BET, SEM, TG-DSC, TEM and EDS. It was found that the Zn-MOF samples have favorable physicochemical properties. The impact of experimental parameters of the UARM method is effective on the resulting properties, such as high surface area of the products that increases the interactions between the Zn-MOF nanostructure and bacteria.Their antibacterial activities were investigated using diffusion methods in agar and also with dilutions of Zn-MOF samples. Antibiotics (tetracycline and ampicillin) and their anti-biofilm effects were evaluated using microplate method. Obtained results revealed that the Zn-MOF nanostructures have high antibacterial properties which, could be due to the nature of the applied Zn-MOF as well as the optimization process. The Zn- MOF nanostructures could be a novel antibacterial material as biocatalyst processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aampicillin 3abiocatalysts 3amicelles 3asurface area 3atetracycline 3aultrasonic treatment 3azinc 0aBiotechnology 0aMicrobiology 0aZn-MOF 0aUARM method 0aGrowth inhibitory concentration 0aBiofilm1 aMotaghi, Mehdi1 aChauhan, Narendra Pal Singh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3241-74601 aSargazi, Ghasem0 tHeliyon.g2020 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e03231-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e032313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245009000206300001600296520161400312592002801926596003101954596003101985650002502016650001202041650001702053650002902070650001702099650001602116700006002132700002002192700002102212700001602233700006002249773012802309856008302437852000902520655001202529IND60756145720221122231108.0220225e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075614572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05116-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanikawa, Toko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6042-807110aCan ground-penetrating radar detect adjacent roots and rock fragments in forest soil?  ap. 239-257.  aAIM: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been used for estimating root biomass, estimating pull-out resistance force of roots, and reconstructing root system architecture. Although GPR can estimate the diameter of a single root, it has not yet been verified whether it can successfully estimate the diameters of adjacent roots or whether rock fragments occurring in the soil matrix can be misidentified as roots. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the visual properties of GPR images of root bundles and rock fragments, and (2) clarify whether they have the potential to create non-negligible errors in GPR surveys. METHODS: Root bundle samples buried in a sandy soil bed were scanned using 900 MHz and 1500 MHz antennas. Sole roots of Cryptomeria japonica and rock fragments in the bed were also scanned. RESULTS: A bundle of root formed one hyperbola with an apex in the radar profile, like a sole root. However, the contrast of the hyperbolas was weak and GPR indices relating to diameter were reduced compared to those of the comparably sized sole root. Stones did not form clear images, but boulders were faintly visible with non-negligible GPR indices. CONCLUSIONS: For evaluation of root biomass, adjacent roots had the potential to lead to significant errors. Similarly, in reconstructions of root system architecture, adjacent roots might lead to incorrect modelling of root point connections, because of incorrect diameters. For pull-out resistance force, adjacent roots could lead to only underestimation, i.e., safe-side error. Misidentification of rock fragments as roots depends on their sizes.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP20H03040cKAKENHI Grants  aJP20H03028cKAKENHI Grants 3aCryptomeria japonica 3abiomass 3aforest soils 3aground-penetrating radar 3aroot systems 3asandy soils1 aIkeno, Hidetoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5134-54851 aYamase, Keitaro1 aDannoura, Masako1 aAono, Kenji1 aHirano, Yasuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9983-670X0 tPlant and soil.g2021 Nov., v. 468, no. 1-2 p.239-257dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05116-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010100170300001600271520151800287592002801805650001201833650001301845650000901858650001701867650002401884650002701908650002301935650001201958700002001970700002301990700001802013700001902031773011002050856005502160852000902215655001202224IND4467251920221118213702.0120605e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446725192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4603.2011.00330.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAres, Gaston,10aConsumers' texture perception of milk desserts. i – relationship with rheological measurements  ap. 203-213.  aStudying and predicting consumers' texture perception of milk desserts are important for dairy companies during new product development and the design of positioning, advertising and communication strategies. In this context, the aim of the present work was to study the relationship between consumers' texture perception of milk desserts and rheological measurements. Six commercial milk desserts were evaluated by a panel of 50 consumers, who were asked to answer a check‐all‐that‐apply question. The rheological behavior of the desserts was evaluated using oscillatory tests, flow curves and the evaluation of structural breakdown by α‐amylase. Multiple factor analysis showed that data from rheological measurements and consumers' responses to the check‐all‐that‐apply (CATA) question provided similar information and were able to identify differences in the texture of the evaluated milk desserts. Rheological measurements were able to predict consumers' perception of the characteristics responsible for the largest texture differences between the desserts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Check‐all‐that‐apply question consisted on a useful and simple methodology to gather an insight on consumers' perception of the sensory characteristics of milk desserts, providing information that was in agreement with rheological measurements. The advantage of this methodology is that it only requires participants to select words from a list, being easier, less time consuming and more natural to use.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairies 3adesserts 3amilk 3anew products 3aproduct development 3arheological properties 3asensory properties 3atexture1 aBUDELLI, ELIANA1 aBRUZZONE, FERNANDA1 aGIMÉNEZ, ANA1 aLEMA, PATRICIA0 tJournal of texture studies.g2012 June, v. 43, no. 3 p.203-213dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4603.2011.00330.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010600164300001600270520143700286592002801723650002001751650001901771650001601790650001601806650002601822650001301848650001101861650002401872650002001896653001501916653002401931653000901955653000901964653002501973700005801998773008302056856008402139852000902223655001202232IND60556707820221123040812.0170713e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055670782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Biao10aJoint interpretation of enantiomer and stable isotope fractionation for chiral pesticides degradation  ap. 178-186.  aChiral pesticides are important contaminants affecting the health and functioning of aquatic systems. The combination of stable isotope and enantiomer analysis techniques has been recently proposed to better characterize the fate of these contaminants in natural and engineered settings. We introduce a modeling approach with the aim of unifying and integrating the interpretation of isotopic and enantiomeric fractionation. The model is based on the definition of enantiomer-specific isotopologues and jointly predicts the evolution of concentration, enantiomer fractionation, as well as changes in stable isotope ratios of different elements. The method allows evaluating different transformation pathways and was applied to investigate enzymatic degradation of dichlorprop (DCPP), enzymatic degradation of mecoprop methyl ester (MCPPM), and microbial degradation of α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH) by different bacterial strains and under different redox conditions. The model accurately reproduces the isotopic and enantiomeric data observed in previous experimental studies and precisely captures the dual-dimensional trends characterizing different reaction pathways. Furthermore, the model allows testing possible combinations of enantiomer analysis (EA), compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA), and enantiomer specific isotope analysis (ESIA) to identify and assess isotope and enantiomer selective reaction mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHCH (pesticide) 3abiodegradation 3adichlorprop 3aenantiomers 3aisotope fractionation 3amecoprop 3amodels 3areaction mechanisms 3astable isotopes 0aPesticides 0aEnantiomer analysis 0aCSIA 0aESIA 0aDegradation pathways1 aRolle, Massimo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8833-89510 tWater research.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 105 p.178-186dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245015700179300001600336520100000352592002801352650005001380650002501430650002601455650001401481650001501495650003701510650001401547650002001561651001701581651001001598651002501608653000901633653001401642653002801656653001901684653002901703700001701732700002301749700002601772700002001798700002201818773011501840856008801955852000902043655001202052IND60540135920221118202041.0190318e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054013592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcquavita, Alessandro14aThe PAH level, distribution and composition in surface sediments from a Mediterranean Lagoon: The Marano and Grado Lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy)  ap. 234-241.  aThe Marano and Grado Lagoon is one of the best conserved transitional environment in the whole Mediterranean area. On the other hand, it suffers from industrial, agricultural and fisheries activities, which could have an important impact on its environmental quality. With the application of the WFD, the sediment chemical status was investigated. In this work, 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons included by the US EPA within the priority pollutants were considered. PAHs values ranged from non-detectable to 1056ngg−1 showing the highest contamination close to the Aussa-Corno River mouth, which received the industrial inputs. The contamination level was comparable to that observed in low contaminated sites of the Mediterranean region, and lower than the adjacent Gulf of Trieste. The ratios of selected PAHs congeners pointed out the prevalence of pyrolitic sources. Moreover, the application of the ERL/ERM displayed an environment, which should not have a potential biological impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental quality 3afisheries 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediments 3awater pollution 3aAdriatic Sea 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 0aPAHs 0aSediments 0aMarano and Grado Lagoon 0aIsomeric ratio 0aEcotoxicological effects1 aFalomo, Jari1 aPredonzani, Sergio1 aTamberlich, Francesco1 aBettoso, Nicola1 aMattassi, Giorgio0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 81, no. 1 p.234-241dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245005500210300001400265520096700279592002801246650002501274650002501299650002201324650001901346650001001365650001601375650001901391650001101410650002501421650002601446650001601472650001601488650001601504650001001520653002901530653001901559653001701578653002001595700002101615700002401636700006401660700002001724700002501744700002301769700002301792773011001815856008301925852000902008655001202017IND60779698920221120120559.0220829e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077969892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2022.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Conti, Elisa R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2978-270X10aEosinophilic Granulomatous Myocarditis in Two Pigs  ap. 21-25.  aEosinophilic myocarditis is a human condition that has been rarely documented in animals.

Timely review and comparison of the most recently proposed statistical methods will provide a useful guide for choosing among them for data analysis. Particular interest surrounds the ability to detect differential expression (DE) in genes. Here we compare four recently proposed statistical methods, edgeR, DESeq, baySeq, and a method with a two-stage Poisson model (TSPM), through a variety of simulations that were based on different distribution models or real data. We compared the ability of these methods to detect DE genes in terms of the significance ranking of genes and false discovery rate control. All methods compared are implemented in freely available software. We also discuss the availability and functions of the currently available versions of these software.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3agene expression 3agenes 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3astatistical analysis 2aBase Sequence 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aComputer Simulation 2aDatabases, Nucleic Acid 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aModels, Genetic 2aPoisson Distribution 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aROC Curve 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSequence Analysis, RNAxmethods 2aSoftware1 aLiu, Peng1 aSi, Yaqing0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2012 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.248-256dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.11003403Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012400168300001200292500001900304520149900323592002801822650001601850650002001866650000901886650002101895650001401916650001701930650001201947650001601959650002701975650001502002650001402017650001802031650001602049650000902065650001102074650001502085651001102100700002802111700003302139700003202172700004402204773015202248856008302400852000902483655001202492IND60718731620221118113038.0201217e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071873162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08742-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Randy H.10aHuman health risks from fish consumption following a catastrophic gas oil spill in the Chiquito River, Veracruz, Mexico  ap. 783.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn industrial accident resulted in a gas oil spill of 11,808 barrels in the upper part of the Coatzacoalcos River watershed. After river shore cleanup, concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in muscle (+ skin) were determined in captured fish to evaluate human health risk due to fish consumption post-spill in the most affected communities. Data on fish consumption, body weight, and diet factor were collected by questionnaires and field observations. Using standard formulas for carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic substances, site-specific remediation levels were calculated in fish, comparing them to the real levels observed. Likewise, the levels of PAHs in fish captured pre- and post-spill were compared to determine their origin (pyrolytic vs. petrogenic). The TPH concentrations were between 119,000 and 523,000 ng/g (dry weight) and no significant difference (P > 0.05) was found pre- vs. post-spill. The concentration of total PAHs varied between 2494.83 and 35,412.23 ng/g (dry weight), with the concentrations of naphthalene (520.9 ng/g) and phenanthrene (7532.7 ng/g) being much higher than in control samples, and being from the gas oil spill (petrogenic origin). The site-specific remediation levels calculated for TPH and PAH were much higher than the maximum levels actually detected. No human health risks were found from hydrocarbons from the spill, at least after cleanup efforts and natural attenuation (six months).  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acarcinogenicity 3afish 3afish consumption 3afuel oils 3ahuman health 3amuscles 3anaphthalene 3aoccupational accidents 3aoil spills 3apetroleum 3aphenanthrenes 3aremediation 3arisk 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aMexico1 aOjeda-Castillo, Valeria1 aGuzmán-Osorio, Francisco J.1 aÁlvarez-Coronel, Gerónimo1 aDomínguez-Rodríguez, Verónica Isidra0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Dec., v. 192, no. 12 p.783-783dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08742-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012900168300001600297520161400313592002801927650001701955650002101972650001201993650001502005650001102020650001902031650002902050650002102079653003702100653003202137653002902169653001602198700001702214700001802231773009802249856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60546972320221120025000.0160903e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054697232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Linjia10aReduction of potential greenhouse gas emissions of room air-conditioner refrigerants: a life cycle carbon footprint analysis  ap. 262-268.  aFluorinated gases (F-gases) are considered to be greenhouse gases (GHG) and are widely used as room air conditioner (RAC) refrigerants. This study was initiated to determine the potential to reduce the GHG emission of the RAC refrigerants by calculating their life cycle carbon footprints (CFPs). The life cycle of a refrigerant includes the processes of production, filling of RACs, service, disposal, and energy consumption. The refrigerant functional unit was assumed to produce 1 kW of cooling capacity. The assumed calculation conditions included an RAC service life of 10 years and a unit usage use of 2 h per day, 100 days per year. Specifically, the GHG emission reduction potential of refrigerants was further analyzed based on 15%, 30% and 50% refrigerant recycle rates scenarios.RAC refrigerants were divided into three types: high global warming potential (GWP), middle GWP and low GWP. Analysis of the results indicated that the life cycle CFPs of high GWP refrigerants were larger than those of the middle and low GWP refrigerants. Service and disposal processes contributed most to RAC refrigerants' life cycle CFPs.There are two ways to reduce the GHG emission of RAC refrigerants. One approach is to avoid direct GHG emissions during the disposal process. When the refrigerant recycle rate was improved from 5% to 15%, 30%, and 50%, the reduction of GHG emission of the refrigerants increased by 5%, 12%, and 20%, respectively. The second method is to substitute middle and low GWP refrigerants for high GWP refrigerants. This method can lead to a GHG emission reduction of at least 45.57%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon footprint 3acooling 3adurability 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 0aGHG emission reduction potential 0aLife cycle carbon footprint 0aEnvironmental management 0aRefrigerant1 aZeng, Weihua1 aYuan, Zengwei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 100 p.262-268dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015700167300001800324520102700342592002801369650002701397650002501424650001701449650001401466650001801480650002301498650001401521650001801535650001601553650002101569650001701590650003201607653002201639653001601661653002001677653001401697653001701711700002001728773010601748856008501854852000901939655001201948IND60537114020221120230032.0160807e20160817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053711402DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10654932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelim, Samy10aAnti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiangiogenic activities of diosgenin isolated from traditional medicinal plant, Costus speciosus (Koen ex.Retz.)

The present study was conducted to evaluate the in vitro anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiangiogenic activities of diosgenin isolated from C. speciosus. The diosgenin was isolated from C. speciosus by HPTLC and its biological activities were studied by different protocols. The results demonstrated that LPS stimulated TNF-α generation in RAW 264.7 macrophage culture supernatant up to 3.7-fold of the control and that sample treatment (50 μg/mL) resulted in a highly significant inhibitory effect on LPS-stimulated TNF-α (p < 0.01) in a similar manner to methotrexate inhibitory effect. The tested sample possessed an effective antioxidant scavenging affinity against DPPH radicals as compared with the standard antioxidant activity of vitamin C. The results presented here may suggest that diosgenin isolated from C. speciosus possess anticancer, apoptotic and inhibitory effects on cell proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheilocostus speciosus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aascorbic acid 3acell proliferation 3adiosgenin 3afree radicals 3amacrophages 3amedicinal plants 3amethotrexate 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aantioxidant 0aanti-angiogenic 0adiosgenin 0aC. speciosus1 aAl Jaouni, Soad0 tNatural product research.g2016 Aug. 17, v. 30, no. 16 p.1830-1833dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2015.10654933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245009700167300001600264520181900280592002802099650001802127650001602145650002602161650001702187650002102204650001202225650001402237650001102251650001202262650003102274650002702305650001202332650001202344650000802356650001402364650001302378650001002391650003202401650001202433650002502445700002002470700001902490700001902509773009902528856008502627852000902712655001202721IND4467633620221121020749.0141112e20111031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446763362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayavalli, R.10aBreaking the intergeneric hybridization barrier in Carica papaya and Vasconcellea cauliflora  ap. 787-794.  aThe present investigation was undertaken to develop PRSV (Papaya ringspot virus) resistant hybrids through intergeneric hybridization. Intergeneric hybridization was done involving nine Carica papaya cultivars as female and Vasconcellea cauliflora as male. To break the intergeneric hybridization barrier, various nutrient combinations were used. Among the combinations used, sucrose 5%, sucrose 5%+boron 0.5% and sucrose 5%+CaCl₂ 0.5% improved the fruit set and seed set percentage. A total number of 1197 flowers were pollinated and 308 fruits were obtained. On extraction, 721 seeds were obtained from CO 7, Pusa Nanha and CP 50. Out of 721 F₀ seeds (crossed seeds) sown, 419 seeds germinated and artificial screening for PRSV was carried out 27 days after sap inoculation. Out of 29 F₁ hybrid plants from CO 7 x V. cauliflora cross, only six plants namely CO 7V1 to CO 7V6 were found free from PRSV symptoms. Similarly, out of 55 F₁ hybrids from cross involving Pusa Nanha x V. cauliflora only 23 plants namely PNV1 to PNV23 were found free from the symptoms and 70 plants namely CPV1 to CPV70 out of 335 plants of CP50 x V. cauliflora cross were found free from PRSV symptoms. Among the crosses, Pusa Nanha x V. cauliflora had higher yield under PRSV infected conditions, however, total soluble solids and total sugars were found lesser than the CO 7 x V. cauliflora cross. The hybridity of the progenies were confirmed by using ISSR (Inter Simple Sequence Repeats) primers by the amplification of DNA from progenies and their parents. ISSR primers UBC 856, UBC807 and ISSR primer combinations UBC 856-817, UBC 810-817, UBC 861-817, UBC 856-810, UBC 861-810 and UBC 856-817 clearly amplified specific bands of the male parent, which were present in F₁ progenies, but it was absent in female parents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3aDNA primers 3aPapaya ringspot virus 3aVasconcellea 3aartificial seeds 3aflowers 3afruit set 3afruits 3ahybrids 3aintergeneric hybridization 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3aprogeny 3asap 3ascreening 3aseed set 3aseeds 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3asucrose 3atotal soluble solids1 aBalamohan, T.N.1 aManivannan, N.1 aGovindaraj, M.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2011 Oct. 31, v. 130, no. 4 p.787-794dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003400132040001800166100002500184245013700209300001600346500001500362506017300377520112400550536020901674592002801883650002001911650002201931650001601953650001301969650002001982650003802002650003402040650001602074650001802090650001102108650001202119650003002131650006402161650005202225650001102277650006102288650006002349650001902409653003202428700002202460700002202482773013202504856008102636856011202717956010702829961000902936852000902945655001202954IND4463897220221122044213.0181016e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446389722DNAL7 a225291222pmid7 a10113/545102hdl7 a10.1177/10406387124430572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVander Ley, Brian L.10aBovine viral diarrhea virus antigen detection across whole cattle hides using two antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  ap. 546-548.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBovine viral diarrhea virus is a costly disease of cattle that can be controlled by vaccination, biosecurity, and removal of persistently infected cattle. Development and proficiency testing of assays to identify persistently infected cattle requires substantial quantities of known positive- and negative-sample material. The objective of this study was to determine what sections of bovine skin contained Bovine viral diarrhea virus antigen. Two commercially available antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunoassays were used to test subsamples representing the entire skin of 3 persistently infected calves. Both assays detected Bovine viral diarrhea virus antigen in the samples indicated for use by assay protocol. However, one assay identified all subsamples as positive, while the second assay identified 64.4% of subsamples as positive. These results show that use of samples other than those specified by the assay protocol must be validated for each individual assay. In this study, alternative sample sites and use of the entire hide for proficiency testing would be acceptable for only one of the assays tested.  aThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research presented in this article was funded by Cattle Stats, LLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle diseases 3aantigen detection 3abiosecurity 3aantigens 3ahides and skins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3avaccination 3askin (animal) 3acalves 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxanalysis 2aBovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Diseasexdiagnosisxvirology. 2aCarrier Statexdiagnosisxveterinaryxvirology. 2aCattle 2aDiarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viralxisolation & purification 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSkinxvirology 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aRidpath, Julia F.1 aSweiger, Shaun H.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 24, no. 3 p.546-548dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387124430573Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/545103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/114480_113832_2012_JVDI_24_3_p_546_548.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009900168300001600267500001500283520063300298592002800931650001600959650002100975650001800996650000801014650002601022650002301048650002701071650003101098653001201129653002201141653001801163653001901181700002001200700001701220773012101237856008201358852000901440655001201449IND60533123920221121225720.0160728e20150220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053312392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Seung Won10aEvaluation of the formation of a junctional DNA nanostructure through annealing curve analysis  ap. 542-546.  a2019-12-06  aDuring the self-assembly of different numbers of oligonucleotides comprising junctional DNA nanostructures, a change in environmental variables (e.g., temperature or salt concentration) has a substantial influence on the final products.

However, contradicting findings appear in literature regarding the denitrification capacities of PAO due to the lack of clade specific highly enriched PAO cultures. Whereas some studies suggest that only PAO clade I may be capable of using nitrate as external electron acceptor for anoxic P-uptake, other studies indicate that PAO clade II may be responsible for anoxic P-removal. In the present study, a highly enriched PAO clade IC culture (>99% according to FISH) was cultivated in an SBR operated under Anaerobic/Oxic conditions and subsequently exposed to Anaerobic/Anoxic/Oxic conditions using nitrate as electron acceptor. Before and after acclimatization to the presence of nitrate, the aerobic and anoxic (nitrate and nitrite) activities of the PAO I culture were assessed through the execution of batch tests using either acetate or propionate as electron donor. In the presence of nitrate, significant P-uptake by PAO I was not observed before or after acclimatization. Using nitrite as electron acceptor, limited nitrite removal rates were observed before acclimatization with lower rates in the acetate fed reactor without P-uptake and slightly higher in the propionate fed reactor with a marginal anoxic P-uptake. Only after acclimatization to nitrate, simultaneous P and nitrite removal was observed. This study suggests that PAO clade IC is not capable of using nitrate as external electron acceptor for anoxic P-removal. The elucidation of the metabolic capacities for individual PAO clades helps in better understanding and optimization of the relation between microbial ecology and process performance in enhanced biological phosphate removal processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aacetates 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3amicrobial ecology 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apropionic acid 0a‘ Candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis’ clade I 0aDenitrification 0aNitrate 0aNitrite 0aAcetate 0aPropionate 0aEBPR1 aWelles, Laurens1 aAbbas, Ben1 aLopez-Vazquez, Carlos M.1 avan Loosdrecht, Mark C.M.1 aBrdjanovic, Damir0 tWater research.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 105 p.97-109dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245010000154300001600254500001500270520105800285592002801343650002001371650002501391650001201416650002101428650001801449650001301467650002101480650002001501650002701521650001301548653001901561773011501580852000901695856007501704655001201779IND2206359220221121070152.0190314e199908  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220635922DNAL7 a10.1007/BF008335002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhga, Shoji10aEffect of water potential on fruit body formation ofLentinula edodes in sawdust-based substrate  ap. 337-342.  a2019-12-05  aThe influence of substrate water potential (ψ) on the growth and fruiting of three genotypes of shiitake (Lentinula edodes) was investigated. A slight reduction ofψ (−0.5MPa) stimulated mycelial and colony growth on liquid, agar, and sawdust-based substrates.L. edodes has been found to grow well at aψ around −0.5 MPa, which corresponds to a moisture content around 55%. A small decrease inψ at the final vegetative growth phase had positive effects on flush quantity. The substrateψ was significantly affected by the interaction between genotypes and spawn run time. Theψ of well-colonized mature substrate was −0.7MPa before and −4.OMPa after the fruiting. Theψ rose again to −0.7MPa during rapid absorbance of water by soaking, and this rise was repeated during the second and third flushes. It is suggested that the water-holding capacity of a substrate is related to culture maturity. Excellent water-providing capacity (higherψ) is expected in the substrate of well-matured cultures with a high density of mycelial colonization.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater potential 3adevelopmental stages 3asawdust 3aLentinula edodes 3awater content 3agenotype 3amushroom compost 3afruiting bodies 3abiological development 3amycelium 0afungal anatomy0 tJournal of wood science.g1999 Aug., v. 45, no. 4 p.337-342dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF008335003Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03820naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009500168300001600263520235600279592002802635650001202663650001402675650001502689650001902704650003102723650001202754650002102766650001202787650002902799650002102828650001302849650002602862650002002888650002602908651001002934653002002944653001502964653002602979653003503005653001903040700002803059700003003087700001703117773009803134856008503232852000903317655001203326IND60546972620221120064427.0160903e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054697262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrada, Marta10aAnalysis of three forest chippers: productivity, costs and GHG emissions in Northern Spain  ap. 238-244.  aThe study and development of efficient forest-fuel systems with different species in different climates has become one of the biggest challenges in forestry. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare productivity, costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of three different chippers in thinning, using a whole tree harvesting system. The relation between chipper productivities and GHG emissions was also examined. Trials were conducted in young pine stands in Northern Spain. Stand inventories before and after the thinning, plus a work sampling time study (64.81 h in total) of each chipper was conducted to calculate productivity. All work elements were recorded on a fixed time interval (1 min) with a hand-held field computer. Costs with regards to productive and total time were also calculated. In order to calculate the GHG emissions produced by the process of obtaining chips from timber in the forest, the three chip production systems were evaluated. The system boundary considered included the chipping, felling and forwarding phases. The amount of kg CO2e emitted was estimated from the productivity and fuel consumption data of each machine involved in the process. Results showed that chipper productivities varied between 5.78 and 7.29 odt SMH−1 (oven dry tonnes per Scheduled Machine Hours). Furthermore, the two more powerful chippers achieved a productivity not so different to the productivity of the lowest powered chipper, due to the former's organizational delays and poor forestry planning in that these chippers had to wait for replacement containers before continuing chipping at roadside, while the less powerful machine chipped continuously onto the ground, highlighting the importance of operation management. Chipping costs were 3.03, 3.10 and 4.06 € MWhchip−1. The GHG emissions evaluated were 7.09, 8.41 and 7.6 kgCO2e MWhchip−1, with the chipping phase being the greatest contributor to GHG emissions in two of the systems studied. Energy balance varied between 2.92 and 4.02%, demonstrating high efficiency since an energy input of only 2–4 % of the energy produced was required. Studies of this kind are essential to identify those factors which affect productivity and how they may influence costs and GHG emissions, in order to improve forest-fuel systems from an environmental point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acomputers 3acontainers 3aenergy balance 3aenergy use and consumption 3afelling 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aplanning 3aproduction technology 3asystem boundary 3awhole tree harvesting 3aSpain 0aForest thinning 0aTime study 0aWhole-tree harvesting 0aBiofuel chip production system 0aEnergy balance1 aMartínez-Alonso, Celia1 aSánchez García, Sandra,1 aCanga, Elena0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 101 p.238-244dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007500147245009200222500002200314520186400336592002802200650002402228650002202252650001502274650001402289650002202303650001202325650001102337650001102348650002402359650001502383650001902398650001602417650001102433653001902444653002202463653001002485653001402495700002502509700002402534700002702558700002302585773008702608856008202695852000902777655001202786IND60656048020221116141452.0190809e20190804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065604802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2019.1783552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherginets, V.

The course of interaction of Eu2O3 with K2SrCl4 melt at 973 K obeys the Shchukarev equation.The analysis of van’t Hoff diagrams for these processes showed that the stage of Eu2O3 solubilization under the action of CCl4 is clearly detected. The data corresponding to the finishing of Eu2O3 solubilization in K2SrCl4 melt allowed to estimate the solubility product of Eu2O3 as 1.2·10-22 mol5·kg-5 in molality scale and 3.2·10-26 in mole fractions. The corresponding values for EuOCl are 1.47·10-7 mol3·kg-3 (mCl-= 13.1 mol kg-1) or 1.05·10-9 (mole fractions).An application of the Shreder-Le Chatelier equation for the recalculation of some literature data on the solubilization of rare-earth metal oxides and oxochlorides at different temperatures allowed us to compare them with the results obtained in this work. It was confirmed that the running of the carbochlorination process at low oxide ion concentrations was determined by the rare earth oxide (oxochloride) dissolution similarly to the situation observed in other chloride melts where HCl was used as a chlorinating agent. The literature data and data of this work expressed in units of oxoacidity function Ω and reduced to the same temperature (973 K) are in a good agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3acomparative study 3aelectrodes 3aequations 3ahydrochloric acid 3amelting 3aoxides 3aoxygen 3arare earth elements 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3avapors 0aeuropium oxide 0acarbochlorination 0amelts 0achlorides1 aRebrov, Alexander L.1 aRebrova, Tatyana P.1 aPonomarenko, Tamara V.1 aYurchenko, Oleg I.0 tThermochimica acta.g2019 Aug. 04, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2019.1783553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001600287520084400303592002801147650001501175650001801190650001001208650002401218650000901242650002301251650001001274650001401284650001101298650002201309700002001331700001801351773011701369856008101486852000901567655001201576IND60523567020221120181324.0160623e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052356702DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117160201442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakovleva, G.

In common gull (Larus canus), this parasite occurred more often. In little gull (L. minutus), trematodes were single specimens. Mature A. müehlingi are registered only in these gull species during the spring period, immediately after their return from the wintering areas. Detection of the parasite indicates a potential environmental threat. To date, A. müehlingi is found only in the definitive host. However, the penetration of gastropods Lithoglyphus naticoides Pfeiffer, 1828, the parasite’s first intermediate host, into Lake Ladoga will form favorable conditions for the life cycle of the parasite. This may lead to the epizooty of fish by A. müehlingi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aHeterophyidae 3aLarus 3aecological invasion 3afish 3aintermediate hosts 3alakes 3aparasites 3aspring 3awintering grounds1 aLebedeva, D.

Sustained lipolysis and increased plasma fatty acids concentrations are characteristic of dairy cows with hyperketonemia. However, the status of ALP in adipose tissue during this physiological condition is not well known. The present study aimed to ascertain whether lipolysis is associated with activation of ALP in adipose tissues of dairy cows with hyperketonemia and in calf adipocytes. In vivo, blood and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) biopsies were collected from nonhyperketonemic (nonHYK) cows [blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration <1.2 mM, n = 10] and hyperketonemic (HYK) cows (blood BHB concentration 1.2–3.0 mM, n = 10) with similar days in milk (range: 3–9) and parity (range: 2–4). In vitro, calf adipocytes isolated from 5 healthy Holstein calves (1 d old, female, 30–40 kg) were differentiated and used for (1) treatment with lipolysis inducer isoproterenol (ISO, 10 µM, 3 h) or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor Torin1 (250 nM, 3 h), and (2) pretreatment with or without the ALP inhibitor leupeptin (10 μg/mL, 4 h) followed by ISO (10 µM, 3 h) treatment. Compared with nonHYK cows, serum concentration of free fatty acids was greater and serum glucose concentration, DMI, and milk yield were lower in HYK cows. In SAT of HYK cows, ratio of phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase to hormone-sensitive lipase, and protein abundance of adipose triacylglycerol lipase were greater, but protein abundance of perilipin 1 (PLIN1) and cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-α-like effector c (CIDEC) was lower. In addition, mRNA abundance of autophagy-related 5 (ATG5), autophagy-related 7 (ATG7), and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B), protein abundance of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, and cathepsin D, and activity of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase were greater, whereas protein abundance of sequestosome-1 (p62) was lower in SAT of HYK cows. In calf adipocytes, treatment with ISO or Torin1 decreased protein abundance of PLIN1, and CIDEC, and triacylglycerol content in calf adipocytes, but increased glycerol content in the supernatant of calf adipocytes. Moreover, the mRNA abundance of ATG5, ATG7, and MAP1LC3B was upregulated, the protein abundance of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, cathepsin D, and activity of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase were increased, whereas the protein abundance of p62 was decreased in calf adipocytes treated with ISO or Torin1 compared with control group. Compared with treatment with ISO alone, the protein abundance of p62, PLIN1, and CIDEC, and triacylglycerol content in calf adipocytes were higher, but the glycerol content in the supernatant of calf adipocytes was lower in ISO and leupeptin co-treated group. Overall, these data indicated that activated ALP is associated with increased lipolysis in adipose tissues of dairy cows with hyperketonemia and in calf adipocytes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fragmentation 3aHolstein 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acalves 3adairy science 3aglycerol 3ahyperketonemia 3aisoproterenols 3alipolysis 3amembrane proteins 3amilk 3amilk yield 3arapamycin 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols 0aautophagy-lysosomal pathway 0aadipocyte 0alipid mobilization 0aketosis1 aFan, Minghe1 aChen, Xiying1 aJiang, Xiuhuan1 aLoor, Juan J.1 aAboragah, Ahmad1 aZhang, Cai1 aBai, Hongxu1 aFang, Zhiyuan1 aShen, Taiyu1 aWang, Zhe1 aSong, Yuxiang1 aLi, Xinwei1 aLiu, Guowen1 aLi, Xiaobing1 aDu, Xiliang0 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Aug., v. 105, no. 8 p.6997-7010dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-212873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005300166300001600219520073800235592002800973650001101001650002401012650001001036650001401046650002301060650002101083650002201104650001501126651001101141700001801152773011701170856008101287852000901368655001201377IND60523567220221120172136.0160623e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052356722DNAL7 a10.1134/S20751117160201202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilaeva, T.

The building sector accounts for a significant portion of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing attention has focused on the expansion of green buildings that are designed to minimize such negative environmental impacts. While green building certification is generally regarded an important driver expanding green buildings, researchers have given little attention to the relation between green building certification and potential tenants’ willingness to rent space in a building. This study examines whether green building certification can enhance potential tenants’ willingness to rent space in a building. It also explores under what conditions the effect of such certification can be heightened by considering the characteristics of potential tenants, buildings, and certifications. To test our hypotheses, 220 participants responded to a virtual office space rental scenario and 219 to an apartment rental scenario. The results show that (a) a green building certification increased potential tenants’ willingness to rent; (b) however, a higher certification grade did not further enhance potential tenants’ willingness to rent; and (c) potential tenants with higher levels of eco-friendliness exhibited higher willingness to rent buildings with a green certification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acertification 3adesign for environment 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aleasing 3aresearchers 0aGreen building 0aEco-labeling 0aCertification 0aVignette-based experiment 0aTenant 0aEco-friendliness1 aKim, Bosung1 aKim, Sŭng-hak,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 194 p.645-655dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012800156300001800284520109500302592002801397650001601425650002401441650002101465650001701486650001501503650001101518650003301529700002301562773013401585856007401719852000901793655001201802IND60661397720221117174747.0190829e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066139772DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cs35362h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlin, J.

Owing to time-resolved experiments using Small Angle X-ray or Neutron Scattering (SAXS or SANS), it is possible to follow in situ the formation of a material during its synthesis via the Cooperative Templating Mechanism (CTM). Such experiments directly provide unique information about the structural properties of the material inside the synthesis solution. One of the main findings is that phase transformations often occur in the material prior to the stabilisation of its final structure. Moreover, during the very early stages of the synthesis, it is also possible to detect the first hybrid silica–surfactant micellar aggregates, prior to the precipitation of the material, as reported in the case of the SBA-15 materials. All these experiments allow a better understanding of the formation mechanisms and of the influence of the many synthesis parameters. These results open the way to a better prediction and control of the structure of mesoporous materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aneutron diffraction 3aphase transition 3aporous media 3aprediction 3asilica 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering1 aImpéror-Clerc, M.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 42, no. 9 p.4071-4082dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cs35362h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016700168300001400335520183100349592002802180650000802208650001502216650001402231650002602245650001802271650002202289650001802311650001702329650001302346650001402359650002402373650001702397653002402414653001402438653002802452653001702480653001802497653003002515700001702545700001502562700001602577773011202593856008602705852000902791655001202800IND60597505820221116141026.0200110e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059750582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ningli14aThe heterogeneous effect of democracy, political globalization, and urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations in G20 countries: Evidence from panel quantile regression  ap. 54-68.  aPM2.5 emissions have serious adverse impacts on health and impede transport activities, especially air and highway. Consequently, policymakers and economists have focused on this issue. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of democracy, political globalization, and urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations within G20 countries. Ecological modernization theory is used to gain the best understanding of the impact of these driving forces on PM2.5 concentrations and obtains an analytical framework. The method utilized is the panel quantile regression, which takes into account the unobserved individual and distributional heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that, first, the direct effect of democracy on PM2.5 concentrations is significantly positive in countries with higher emissions, and has no impact on lower-emission countries. Second, the direct effect of political globalization on PM2.5 concentrations is significantly positive and especially greater in extremely low- and high-emission countries. Third, persuasive evidence proves the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve between urbanization and PM2.5 concentrations. Additionally, this paper further assesses the direct and indirect influence mechanisms of democracy and political globalization on PM2.5 concentrations across pollution levels. Both have a positive (negative) indirect effect on PM2.5 concentrations in countries with higher (lower) emissions, through its effect on GDP per capita. The total effect appears positive, suggesting that the increase in democracy and political globalization degrade environmental quality. These results provide policymakers with critical policy recommendations that contribute to the reduction of PM2.5 concentrations and ensure sustainable economic development in the G20 countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aeconomists 3aemissions 3aenvironmental quality 3aglobalization 3aissues and policy 3amodernization 3aparticulates 3apolitics 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aurbanization 0aPM2.5 concentration 0aDemocracy 0aPolitical globalization 0aUrbanization 0aG20 countries 0aPanel quantile regression1 aZhu, Huiming1 aGuo, Yawei1 aPeng, Cheng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 194 p.54-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008700166300001800253520126700271592002801538650001601566650001601582650001201598650001501610650002101625650001801646650001401664700001401678773009701692856008501789852000901874655001201883IND60087810420221118034646.0141102e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008781042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lei10aParticulate structure of phytoglycogen nanoparticles probed using amyloglucosidase  ap. 1665-1671.  aPhytoglycogen is a plant-based, high-density carbohydrate nanoparticle that can be used as a starting material for preparing novel functional nano-constructs. In this study, the particulate structure of phytoglycogen was probed using amyloglucosidase hydrolysis, with amylopectin of waxy corn starch as a reference. Glucose release was monitored; molar mass, root mean square (RMS) radius, and dispersed molecular density were evaluated using multiangle laser-light scattering. The goal was to reveal the structural features of phytoglycogen nanoparticles. After extended amyloglucosidase hydrolysis, the total glucose release of phytoglycogen was lower than that of amylopectin. At the initial stage of hydrolysis, however, glucose was released at a higher rate from phytoglycogen, suggesting a dense distribution of nonreducing ends at the surfaces of nanoparticles. The reduction of molar mass and RMS radius caused by amyloglucosidase hydrolysis were much lower for phytoglycogen than for amylopectin. The dispersed molecular density of amylopectin remained at about 60g/molnm³ during hydrolysis. In contrast, the density of phytoglycogen decreased from about 1200 to 950g/molnm³, suggesting a density increment towards the external region of nanoparticle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3acorn starch 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3awaxy corn1 aYao, Yuan0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 83, no. 4 p.1665-1671dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245012300166500001900289520149500308592002801803650001401831650001301845650003001858650001501888650001501903650001801918650002701936650002001963650001201983651001201995651001202007651001202019700002102031700002102052700002502073700002502098773012002123856007902243852000902322655001202331IND60735164920221120202828.0210423e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073516492DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120403532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhelifa, Rassim 10aRemarkable Population Resilience in a North African Endemic Damselfly in the Face of Rapid Agricultural Transformation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAgriculture can be pervasive in its effect on wild nature, affecting various types of natural habitats, including lotic ecosystems. Here, we assess the extent of agricultural expansion on lotic systems in Northern Africa (Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco) and document its overlap with the distribution of an endemic damselfly, Platycnemis subdilatata Selys, using species distribution modeling. We found that agricultural land cover increased by 321% in the region between 1992 and 2005, and, in particular, the main watercourses experienced an increase in agricultural land cover from 21.4% in 1992 to 78.1% in 2005, together with an increase in the intensity of 226% in agricultural practices. We used capture–mark–recapture (CMR) surveys in terrestrial habitats surrounding a stream bordered by grassland and cropland in northeastern Algeria to determine demographic parameters and population size, as well as cropland occupancy. CMR modeling showed that the recapture and survival probabilities had an average of 0.14 (95%CI: 0.14–0.17) and 0.86 (0.85–0.87), respectively. We estimated a relatively large population of P. subdilatata (~1750 individuals) in terrestrial habitats. The occupancy of terrestrial habitats by adults was spatially structured by age. Our data suggest that P. subdilatata has survived agricultural expansion and intensification better than other local odonate species, mainly because it can occupy transformed landscapes, such as croplands and grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZygoptera 3acropland 3ageographical distribution 3agrasslands 3aland cover 3alotic systems 3amark-recapture studies 3apopulation size 3astreams 3aAlgeria 3aMorocco 3aTunisia1 aMahdjoub, Hayat 1 aBaaloudj, Affef 1 aCannings, Robert  A.1 aSamways, Michael J.,0 tInsects.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120403533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011700167300001100284520176000295592002802055596004702083650001502130650001402145650001702159650001202176650000902188650001302197650002702210650001702237650001602254651000902270700006002279700002302339700002102362773013202383856008302515852000902598655001202607IND60762905320221118154811.0220130e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076290532DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-022-10169-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiani, Mojtaba10aInvestigating the geological and geomechanical characteristics governing the weathering behavior of Meymand tuff  ap. 45.  aThe Meymand world heritage site (Kerman Province, Iran) is a rock-hewn village carved within a pyroclastic rock mass, Meymand Tuff. This site, having an ancient local population with an age of 2000 years, is hosted by a weak rock exposed to deterioration and weathering processes. However, our understanding of the characteristics of the Meymand Tuff is limited to some previous general studies. Therefore, in the present study, the stratigraphy and intrinsic characteristics of the Meymand tuff are investigated to determine its weathering behavior and durability. For this purpose, comprehensive field and laboratory investigations were carried out. The stratigraphy of the valley and the pyroclastic flows that had deposited the Meymand tuff were identified and outlined based on field investigations and many surveyed sections along the Meymand valley. Next, the mineralogical composition, texture, structure, physical and mechanical properties, water absorption rate, slake durability, wetting–drying durability, shrinkage potential of the fine portion, and collapse potential of the Meymand tuff were assessed through laboratory investigations. The results revealed that two pyroclastic flows had deposited the host tuff rocks of the Meymand site. These rocks have a heterogeneous texture comprising very coarse-grained clasts to the fine-grained matrix. Rock characteristics including heterogeneous texture, high porous and open structure, clay-rich mineralogical composition, high water absorption capacity, and swelling and shrinkage potential of the fine portion of the matrix have resulted in adverse behaviors in Meymand tuff.

In this review, we discuss monolayer structures ranging from surfaces (two-dimensional) down to single molecules (zero-dimensional), with a focus on applications of each type of structure, and on techniques that enable characterization of monolayer physical properties down to the single-molecule scale.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ananomaterials 3aphysical properties1 aLiao, Wei-Ssu1 aThomas, John C.1 aZhao, Yuxi1 aCao, Huan H.1 aCheunkar, Sarawut1 aSerino, Andrew C.1 aAndrews, Anne M.1 aWeiss, Paul S.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2013 Mar. 11, v. 42, no. 7 p.2725-2745dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cs35365b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245014300194300001500337520141200352592002801764650002401792650001401816650002001830650002301850650001801873650002601891650001901917650001001936700002501946700002101971773015101992856007002143856010302213990002302316852000902339655001202348IND60608654520221116150434.0190510e20180517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060865452DNAL7 a10.3791/572542doi7 aPMC61012212pmcid7 a298636552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPishvar, Maya10aMagnet assisted composite manufacturing: a flexible new technique for achieving high consolidation pressure in vacuum bag/lay-up processes  ap. e57254.  aThis work demonstrates a protocol to improve the quality of composite laminates fabricated by wet lay-up vacuum bag processes using the recently developed magnet assisted composite manufacturing (MACM) technique. In this technique, permanent magnets are utilized to apply a sufficiently high consolidation pressure during the curing stage. To enhance the intensity of the magnetic field, and thus, to increase the magnetic compaction pressure, the magnets are placed on a magnetic top plate. First, the entire procedure of preparing the composite lay-up on a magnetic bottom steel plate using the conventional wet lay-up vacuum bag process is described. Second, placement of a set of Neodymium-Iron-Boron permanent magnets, arranged in alternating polarity, on the vacuum bag is illustrated. Next, the experimental procedures to measure the magnetic compaction pressure and volume fractions of the composite constituents are presented. Finally, methods used to characterize microstructure and mechanical properties of composite laminates are discussed in detail. The results prove the effectiveness of the MACM method in improving the quality of wet lay-up vacuum bag laminates. This method does not require large capital investment for tooling or equipment and can also be used to consolidate geometrically complex composite parts by placing the magnets on a matching top mold positioned on the vacuum bag.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic investment 3aequipment 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3asteel1 aAmirkhosravi, Mehrad1 aAltan, M.

The Sch@Aka nanostructure had a pincushion-like shape composed of radially well-aligned nanorods with an average length of about 250 nm and a mean diameter of about 60 nm. Trace SO₄²⁻ ions played a key role in the formation of the Sch@Aka nanostructure. In the presence of Fe³⁺, Cl⁻ and trace SO₄²⁻ ions, schwertmannite was preferentially nucleated and then served as a core for akaganeite growth. The novel Sch@Aka nanostructure not only exhibited a higher adsorption capacity (43.0 mg g⁻¹) for heavy metal Cr(VI) ions, but also delivered a larger reversible storage capacity of 1245 mA h·g⁻¹ with Coulombic efficiency of close to 82% as the anode material in Li-ion batteries, indicating its potential application value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3achlorides 3achromium 3aheavy metals 3aions 3airon 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananorods 3asulfates 3awastes 0aSchwertmannite@Akaganeiten core/shell nanostructure 0aHydrochloric pickle waste liquor 0aFormation mechanism 0aAdsorbent 0aAnode material1 aWu, Meng1 aXiao, Bing1 aChen, Rufen1 aWei, You,1 aLiu, Hui1 aWu, Na0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 01, v. 260 p.120961-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001300136245013100149300001600280520278000296592002803076650001903104650002503123650002703148650001603175650001603191650001303207650001803220650001303238650002703251650001103278650001403289650001203303650001803315651001203333700001503345773011403360856003903474852000903513655001203522IND4485819020221119164938.0120302e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448581902DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.13822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKail, J.10aAnalysis and evaluation of largeâscale river restoration planning in Germany to better link river research and management  ap. 985-999.  aIn December 2008, the draft programmes of measures (PoM) have been published in the EU member states, which list the measures that will be taken to enhance the ecological status of surface and groundwater bodies, and to reach the environmental objectives of the EUâWater Framework Directive (WFD). We have analysed the German PoM to identify the main pressures and the restoration measures water managers planned to implement in streams and rivers. The objective was to evaluate the PoM and to identify the main, practically relevant knowledge gaps in river management on which applied river research should focus on. In general, the selection of measures in the PoM was reasonable. In accordance with the analysis of pressures and impacts in Germany, the PoM focussed on measures addressing morphological alterations and river continuity, and the results indicated that diffuse source pollution and fine sediment input were additional main pressures in Central European streams and rivers. Although point source pollution was not a main pressure in most rivers, respective point source measures have been selected for many water bodies. Apparently, these were soâcalled basic measures that have to be taken due to other EUâDirectives or national laws. Therefore, although in line with the WFD, it seemed doubtful if the point source measures would help to substantially enhance the ecological status. Furthermore, the results indicated that there was a general lack of knowledge on the effect of restoration measures and a specific knowledge gap in how to enhance the ecological state of heavily modified water bodies (HMWB) in the lowland region with a high landâuse pressure, which was reflected by the high share of water bodies for which conceptual measures have been selected (e.g. developing management plans). Based on the analysis of the PoM and a literature review, we identified the following, practically relevant knowledge gaps in river management: (i) the morphodynamics of river reaches where natural channel dynamics have been restored, (ii) the combined effect of measures addressing diffuse nutrient and fine sediment input at different spatial scales (e.g. riparian buffer strips and landâuse changes), (iii) methods to identify suitable and efficient measures and to define environmental objectives for HMWB and (iv) the effect of measures on less wellâstudied biological groups like macrophytes and phytoplankton. There is a strong need to summarize recent research results on these issues, to identify the knowledge gaps and research needs in detail, and to make the results of such a comprehensive literature review or metaâanalysis available for the next 6âyear management cycle and second WFD management plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aconservation buffers 3aecological restoration 3agroundwater 3amacrophytes 3amanagers 3aphytoplankton 3aplanning 3apoint source pollution 3arivers 3asediments 3astreams 3asurface water 3aGermany1 aWolter, C.0 tRiver research and applications.g2011 Oct., v. 27, no. 8 p.985-999dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.1382  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245016600208300001400374520183600388592002802224650002502252650001802277650001502295650001602310650000902326650000902335650000902344650001002353650003102363650001502394650002202409650001402431650001002445650002302455650001402478650002202492650002502514650001502539650001202554650001602566650001302582653001002595653002302605653003002628653001602658653001702674700001802691700002102709700001602730700002002746700001802766700001902784700002102803773010902824856008502933852000903018655001203027IND60623654920221119204147.0190319e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062365492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassetto, C.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2370-356110aTrials with the Haemonchus vaccine, Barbervax®, in ewes and lambs in a tropical environment: Nutrient supplementation improves protection in periparturient ewes  ap. 52-57.  aHaemonchus contortus is an economic problem in sheep farms worldwide, mainly in the tropics and subtropics. A vaccine against haemonchosis, called Barbervax®, was evaluated in ewes under two nutritional status, naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes. Ewes were divided into four groups: Supplemented Diet – Vaccine; Supplemented Diet – No vaccine; Basal Diet – Vaccine and Basal Diet – No vaccine. Their lambs were divided in Vaccinated and No vaccine. Ewes were immunised six times starting about 1 month of pregnancy with the first three doses at 3 week intervals and the last three shots at 4 week intervals. Supplemented ewes had higher body weight, body score and packed cell volume compared with those fed a basal diet. Both groups of vaccinated ewes showed a similar response in circulating anti-vaccine antibodies but the vaccine had no discernible effect on either body weight, body score and packed cell volume. There was a marked group difference in the number of ewes that received precautionary treatments with anthelmintic. All 14 Basal Diet – No vaccine ewes required treatment. In contrast only 7 ewes, in the Supplemented Diet – Vaccine group required anthelmintic treatment. In the Basal Diet – Vaccine and in the Supplemented Diet – No Vaccine groups, 12 and 13 ewes needed anthelmintic treatment, respectively. Vaccinated lambs showed much higher antibody titres resulting in 80% less Haemonchus spp. egg counts comparing with no vaccine lambs. Taken together these results clearly suggest that in pregnant and lactating ewes a combined protective effect between vaccination and improved nutrition resulted in fewer precautionary anthelmintic treatments. Thus, it was possible to achieve a more sustainable level of control of the haemonchosis, less dependent on anthelmintic drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aanthelmintics 3aantibodies 3abody weight 3adiet 3aeggs 3aewes 3afarms 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3ahematocrit 3alactating females 3alactation 3alambs 3anutritional status 3apregnancy 3aprotective effect 3aprotozoal infections 3asubtropics 3atropics 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aSheep 0aImproved nutrition 0aParasitic gastroenteritis 0aProphylaxis 0aHaemonchosis1 aAlmeida, F.A.1 aNewlands, G.F.J.1 aSmith, W.D.1 aCastilhos, A.M.1 aFernandes, S.1 aSiqueira, E.R.1 aAmarante, A.F.T.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 264 p.52-57dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245009300170300001600263520058200279592002800861650001100889650002400900650001600924700002300940700002300963700002500986700002401011700001901035700002101054700002301075700002001098700002001118773012401138856007901262852000901341655001201350IND60302136120221123045006.0150704e20131108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030213612DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12432242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiljkovic, Katarina,10aAsymmetric Distribution of Lunar Impact Basins Caused by Variations in Target Properties  ap. 724-726.  aWhich Side of the Moon?

Fossil fuels used in power plants to generate power have the highest contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) worldwide. Considering the large share of the agriculture sector in power consumption, the processing and drying industries account for the highest energy consumption in this sector. Formation and emission of GHG are associated with farm practices. These emissions are more important in the drying process because it is required large amounts of energy. This study examined GHG emissions (NOX, CO₂ and SO₂) during the drying of pistacia atlantica samples using 5 different types of dryers, namely hot air (HA), hybrid hot air–Infrared (HA–IR), hybrid hot air–microwave (HA–MW), continuous multistage (CMS) conveyor dryer, and hybrid collector-equipped hot air - solar (HA–Solar) dryers. Different types of turbines (steam, gas, and combined) running on natural gas, heavy oil and gasoil were used to supply their energy requirements. Results indicated that the highest (340.97 kWh/kg) and lowest (6.01 kWh/kg) specific energy consumption (SEC) occurred in CMS and HA–MW dryers, respectively. In general, the highest NOₓ, CO₂ and SO₂ emissions were 357336.6, 1974.21 and 5210.02 g, respectively, in the continuous dryer at 40 °C using an air velocity of 1.5 m/s and a conveyor speed of 10.5 mm/s for one kg of dried crop. The lowest NOₓ, CO₂ and SO₂ emissions were also 2704.5, 11.47 and 0 g, respectively, in the HA–MW dryer at 70 °C using an air velocity of 0.5 m/s exposed to 630 W of microwave power for one kg of dried crop. The experimental results showed that GHG emissions for all dryers were reduced with the increase in the air temperature and reduction in the inlet air velocity. In the IR, MW and CMS, GHG emissions were lower at an increased IR power, increased MW power, and low conveyor speed, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia atlantica 3aagricultural industry 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3adryers 3adrying 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3aenergy use and consumption 3afarms 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3anatural gas 3anitrogen oxides 3aoils 3apower plants 3aspecific energy 3asteam 3asulfur dioxide 3aturbines 0aDrying 0aGreenhouse gases (GHG) 0aPistacia atlantica 0aSpecific energy consumption (SEC)1 aAmiri Chayjan, Reza1 aTaghinezhad, Ebrahim1 aRasooli Sharabiani, Vali1 aMotevali, Ali0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 20, v. 259 p.120963-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245014700193300001800340520183200358592002802190650003102218650002302249650001602272650001602288650001302304650001102317650001102328650002202339650001702361650005002378650001802428650004902446650001402495650002102509650001602530650001102546650002202557650003302579650003102612650005902643650003302702650002602735650004602761700002702807700002602834700002502860700002002885773011602905856004803021852000903069655001203078IND50073478220221122033803.0140228e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007347822DNAL7 a242032752pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0569-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulaganti, Madhusudana10aMolecular Modeling and Docking Studies of O-Succinylbenzoate Synthase of M. tuberculosis—a Potential Target for Antituberculosis Drug Design  ap. 1407-1432.  aMenaquinone is a lipid-soluble naphthoquinone that is essential for various pivotal functions of bacteria. Naphthoquinone is synthesized from chorismate of the shikimate pathway in microorganisms. Due to its absence in humans and animals, menaquinone biosynthesis has been an attractive target for development of antibiotics against a number of important microbial pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In shikimate pathway, O-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS) plays a major role and is one of the major potential drug targets. For Mtb-OSBS, a systematic study was conducted to get an insight about Mtb-OSBS enzyme and the corresponding inhibitors using in silico methods. The 3-D model of Mtb-OSBS was built using structure coordinates of Thermobifida fusca. O-succinylbenzoate synthase, the model, was further refined. The active site amino acids have been identified by comparing the template sequence with the Mtb-OSBS sequence. We identified that Lys¹⁰⁸, Asn¹⁴⁰, Asp¹³⁸, Lys¹¹⁰, Glu¹⁸⁹, Ser²³⁶, Asp¹⁸⁸, Arg²⁷, Tyr⁵², and Ser²³⁷ are highly conserved, and these may play a vital role as active residues, similar to that in template protein. As per the competitive binding of substrate (2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC)), we screened the SHCHC through AutoDock 4.0. The SHCHC molecule was further modified structurally and optimized through PRODRG server. Docking of the 12 lead molecules for best interactions with Mtb-OSBS has given an insight that all the lead molecules have shown interactions with active site amino acids of Mtb-OSBS. MD simulation analysis report has shown the stable conformation annotations of Mtb-OSBS. These hypothetical studies create another way to develop more potential drugs against the deadly mycobacterium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aThermobifida fusca 3aamino acids 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3ahumans 3amodels 3ashikimate pathway 3atuberculosis 2aAntitubercular Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBinding Sites 2aCarbon-Carbon Lyasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCatalysis 2aCatalytic Domain 2aDrug Design 2aHumans 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Docking Simulation 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aMycobacterium tuberculosisxenzymologyxpathogenicity. 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTuberculosisxdrug therapyxmicrobiology.1 aBanaganapalli, Babajan1 aMulakayala, Chaitanya1 aChitta, Suresh Kumar1 aC.

For comparison, the soil samples were also analysed for total P. Three treatments were compared: no P application (P0), 26âkg P/ha/yr (P26) and 52âkg P/ha/yr (P52). Significant effects of P fertilizer were observed on U content and, to a lesser extent, on Th content as a result of the P52 treatment at two of the field trials. This effect was demonstrated both in the analyses at the end of the field trials [P52âP0: +0.25 and +0.44âmgâU/kg soil, +0.58 (not significant) and +1.03âmg Th/kg soil] and when considering the changes in U and Th contents between the beginning and the end of the field trials (endâstart: +0.18 and +034âmgâU/kg soil, +0.35 and +0.45âmgâTh/kg soil). The P fertilizer effect was also supported by the correlations of U and Th with total levels of P in the soil. However, in one of the three trials, no significant accumulation of U or Th because of fertilizer could be seen, suggesting either that less U and Th were applied using a different P fertilizer and/or that soil heterogeneity masked significant effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil sampling 3athorium 3atopsoil 3auranium1 aRicher De Forges, A.

L.). Powerful diagnostic tools and management strategies are desired to control HLB. Host small RNAs (sRNA) play a vital role in regulating host responses to pathogen infection and are used as early diagnostic markers for many human diseases, including cancers. To determine whether citrus sRNAs regulate host responses to HLB, sRNAs were profiled from Citrus sinensis 10 and 14 weeks post grafting with Ca. L. asiaticus (Las)-positive or healthy tissue. Ten new microRNAs (miRNAs), 76 conserved miRNAs, and many small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were discovered. Several miRNAs and siRNAs were highly induced by Las infection, and can be potentially developed into early diagnosis markers of HLB. miR399, which is induced by phosphorus starvation in other plant species, was induced specifically by infection of Las but not Spiroplasma citri that causes citrus stubborn—a disease with symptoms similar to HLB. We found a 35% reduction of phosphorus in Las-positive citrus trees compared to healthy trees. Applying phosphorus oxyanion solutions to HLB-positive sweet orange trees reduced HLB symptom severity and significantly improved fruit production during a 3-year field trial in south-west Florida. Our molecular, physiological, and field data suggest that phosphorus deficiency is linked to HLB disease symptomology.We identified several HLB-induced citrus small RNAs that can be potentially developed into early diagnostic markers of HLB. Induction of miR399 by Las led to the discovery that HLB-positive trees suffer from phosphorus starvation. Applying phosphorus solutions help reduce HLB symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandidatus Liberibacter 3aCitrus sinensis 3aSpiroplasma citri 3abacteria 3adiagnostic techniques 3aearly diagnosis 3afield experimentation 3agreening disease 3ahuman diseases 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3aoranges 3aoxyanions 3apathogens 3aphosphorus 3asmall interfering RNA 3astarvation 3atrees 3aFlorida 0aHuanglongbing 0asmall RNA 0amiRNA399 0adisease diagnosis 0aphosphorus deficiency1 aSun, Ruobai1 aAlbrecht, Ute1 aPadmanabhan, Chellappan1 aWang, Airong1 aCoffey, Michael D.1 aGirke, Thomas1 aWang, Zonghua1 aClose, Timothy James,1 aRoose, Mikeal1 aYokomi, Raymond K.1 aFolimonova, Svetlana1 aVidalakis, Georgios1 aRouse, Robert1 aBowman, Kim D.1 aJin, Hailing0 tMolecular plant.g2013 Mar., v. 6, no. 2 p.301-310dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mp/sst0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03687naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245019400184300001600378520176500394592002802159650001602187650002002203650002502223650002102248650001102269650001602280650002502296650001602321650000902337650001102346650001402357650001302371650003502384650001102419650001802430650001602448650002502464650003002489650002402519650001702543650001902560650002102579650002502600650001202625650003102637650001702668650002202685650002102707650002002728650002402748650002102772651002202793700002202815773013302837852000902970856008202979655001203061IND4441631420221118173602.0180619e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444163142DNAL7 a193304582pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-009-9316-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega, Aurelio10aComparison of the lipid profiles from wild caught eggs and unfed larvae of two scombroid fish: northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus L., 1758) and Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda Bloch, 1793)  ap. 461-471.  aLipids and essential fatty acids are determinants of the reproductive process in marine fish, affecting fecundity, egg quality, hatching performance, pigmentation and larval malformation. We have analyzed and characterized the lipids of eggs and unfed larvae of two wild caught scombroid fish, the Atlantic northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda). Dry matter and total lipid contents, polar and neutral lipid classes and total lipid fatty acid contents were determined in the eggs of bluefin tuna and eggs and unfed larvae during the development of Atlantic bonito. Bluefin tuna eggs had slightly but significantly more dry mass than bonito eggs but very similar lipid content. However, bluefin tuna eggs presented a higher polar lipid content due to increased proportions of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Bonito eggs and larvae showed increasing dry mass and decreasing lipid content with development. The proportion of polar lipids increased due to increased PE, PS and PI, whereas choline-containing polar lipids (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) remained relatively constant. Free cholesterol also increased, whereas the levels of other neutral lipids, especially triacylglycerol and steryl ester fractions, decreased, presumably due to utilization for energy to drive development. Bluefin tuna eggs had higher levels of n − 3 and n − 6 highly unsaturated fatty acids due to higher docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acid contents, respectively, than bonito eggs. The results are discussed in relation to the lipid and fatty acid requirements of larval scombroid fish in comparison to those of other larval marine finfish species under culture conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarda sarda 3aThunnus thynnus 3aabnormal development 3aarachidonic acid 3abonito 3acholesterol 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aegg quality 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afecundity 3ahatching 3ahighly unsaturated fatty acids 3alarvae 3alipid content 3amarine fish 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphosphatidylserines 3apigmentation 3asphingomyelins 3atriacylglycerols 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aDensitometry 2aLarvaxmetabolism 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aOvumxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTunaxmetabolism 0aMediterranean Sea1 aMourente, Gabriel0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 36, no. 3 p.461-471dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-009-9316-83Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02758naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245010400199300002000303500001900323520132900342592002801671650002601699650001901725650001501744650002501759650002001784650001901804650002001823650001001843650001501853650001401868700001701882700005401899700005501953700001902008700001602027700005902043773014902102856007602251852000902327655001202336IND60700529020221121024800.0200701e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070052902DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c024342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Hai-Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2388-095510aTuning Push–Pull Electronic Effects of AIEgens to Boost the Theranostic Efficacy for Colon Cancer  ap. 11442-11450.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aColon cancer is one of the most common cancers with high mortality in humans. Early diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer is of great significance for cancer therapy. Numerous theranostic agents have been developed to detect and kill cancer cells. However, few reports have focused on how these agents control and affect the gene expression of cancer cells in vivo. Herein, three pyridinium-functionalized tetraphenylethylene derivatives, namely, TPE-OM, TPE-H, and TPE-NO₂, with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups were facilely synthesized as theranostic agents for cell imaging and anticolon cancer therapy. Among these AIE luminogens (AIEgens), TPE-OM with donor and acceptor structure showed the best treatment efficacy for colon cancer through systematic biological evaluation and comparison. Both in vitro cell imaging and in vivo tumor treatment experiments demonstrated that TPE-OM can be utilized as an efficient theranostic agent to diagnose and kill colon cancer cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the cell cycle process was disturbed by TPE-OM in colon cancer cells. Deep insight into the gene level revealed that the expressions of cell-cycle-promoting genes was inhibited upon addition of TPE-OM. This study may open a new venue for unraveling the mechanisms of cancer metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological assessment 3acancer therapy 3acell cycle 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aearly diagnosis 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3agenes 3ametastasis 3amortality1 aZou, Shaomin1 aChen, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4071-66041 aXiong, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5750-53711 aLee, Mong-Hong1 aFang, Lekun1 aTang, Ben Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0293-964X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 01, v. 142, no. 26 p.11442-11450dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c024343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245012600178246011400304300001500418520202000433592002802453650001402481650001102495650001402506650001502520650000902535651001602544700002302560773010302583856005502686852000902741655001202750IND4475736520221118213902.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447573652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01794.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARLATO, ELIZABETH H.10aUn Método Integral para la Predicción del Destino de Reintroducciones con Datos Demográficos de Múltiples Poblaciones3 aAnIntegrated Approach for Predicting Fates of Reintroductions with Demographic Data from Multiple Populations  ap. 97-106.  aWe devised a novel approach to model reintroduced populations whereby demographic data collected from multiple sites are integrated into a Bayesian hierarchical model. Integrating data from multiple reintroductions allows more precise population‐growth projections to be made, especially for populations for which data are sparse, and allows projections that account for random site‐to‐site variation to be made before new reintroductions are attempted. We used data from reintroductions of the North Island Robin (Petroica longipes), an endemic New Zealand passerine, to 10 sites where non‐native mammalian predators are controlled. A comparison of candidate models that we based on deviance information criterion showed that rat‐tracking rate (an index of rat density) was a useful predictor of robin fecundity and adult female survival, that landscape connectivity and a binary measure of whether sites were on a peninsula were useful predictors of apparent juvenile survival (probably due to differential dispersal away from reintroduction sites), and that there was unexplained random variation among sites in all demographic rates. We used the two best supported models to estimate the finite rate of increase (λ) for populations at each of the 10 sites, and for a proposed reintroduction site, under different levels of rat control. Only three of the reintroduction sites had λ distributions completely >1 for either model. At two sites, λ was expected to be >1 if rat‐tracking rates were <5%. At the other five reintroduction sites, λ was predicted to be close to 1, and it was unclear whether growth was expected. Predictions of λ for the proposed reintroduction site were less precise than for other sites because distributions incorporated the full range of site‐to‐site random variation in vital rates. Our methods can be applied to any species for which postrelease data on demographic rates are available and potentially can be extended to model multiple species simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3afecundity 3amodels 3apredators 3aprediction 3arats 3aNew Zealand1 aARMSTRONG, DOUG P.0 tConservation biology.g2012 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.97-106dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01794.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001200176245012900188300001500317520136800332592002801700650001201728650001001740650001901750650003101769650003101800650001301831650002401844700002201868700002001890700003501910700001701945700002301962773015201985856007002137856010002207990002302307852000902330655001202339IND60608654720221116150312.0190510e20180609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060865472DNAL7 a10.3791/572562doi7 aPMC61016482pmcid7 a299391882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Dan10aWhole-brain segmentation and change-point analysis of anatomical brain mri—application in premanifest huntington's disease  ap. e57256.  aRecent advances in MRI offer a variety of useful markers to identify neurodegenerative diseases. In Huntington's disease (HD), regional brain atrophy begins many years prior to the motor onset (during the "premanifest" period), but the spatiotemporal pattern of regional atrophy across the brain has not been fully characterized. Here we demonstrate an online cloud-computing platform, "MRICloud", which provides atlas-based whole-brain segmentation of T1-weighted images at multiple granularity levels, and thereby, enables us to access the regional features of brain anatomy. We then describe a regression model that detects statistically significant inflection points, at which regional brain atrophy starts to be noticeable, i.e. the "change-point", with respect to a disease progression index. We used the CAG-age product (CAP) score to index the disease progression in HD patients. Change-point analysis of the volumetric measurements from the segmentation pipeline, therefore, provides important information of the order and pattern of structural atrophy across the brain. The paper illustrates the use of these techniques on T1-weighted MRI data of premanifest HD subjects from a large multicenter PREDICT-HD study. This design potentially has wide applications in a range of neurodegenerative diseases to investigate the dynamic changes of brain anatomy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrophy 3abrain 3adisease course 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apatients 3aregression analysis1 aFaria, Andreia V.1 aYounes, Laurent1 aRoss, C.

Sugarcane + garlic (1: 2) with 100% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) to sugarcane (150, 37.1, 49.8 kg N, P, K/ha) and garlic (100, 34.9, 66.4 kg N, P, K/ha) showed significantly higher dry weight of garlic bulb (1.14 t/ha), bulb yield of garlic (3.5 t/ha), cane-equivalent yield (130.3 t/ha), land-equivalent ratio (1.30), area-time equivalent ratio (1.08), net returns (1, 96, 300/ha) and benefit: cost ratio (2.96) than rest of the fertilizer treatments. The total N, P and K uptake by sugarcane and garlic were also found the maximum in this treatment. Fertility levels did not affect available N and K status after harvesting of sugarcane and garlic but significantly increased organic carbon and available P when analyzed after harvesting of sugarcane and garlic. Intercropping system exhibited significantly lowest incidence of early shoot borer (6.7%) than sole sugarcane (11.4%). Different irrigation schedules significantly influenced growth and yield attributes. Application of 4 irrigations at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after sowing (DAS), being at par with 3 irrigations, resulted in higher cane yield (92.4 t/ha), bulb yield of garlic (3.6 t/ha) and land-equivalent ratio (1.36) than the remaining irrigation levels. With the increase in irrigation from 1 to 4 resulted increase in cane-equivalent yield, area-time equivalent ratio and net returns, maximum being recorded with 4 irrigations at 30, 60, 90 and 120 DAS. However, benefit: cost ratio (3.05) and N, P and K uptake by sugarcane were significantly improved up to 3 irrigations (30, 60 and 90 DAS). There was increasing trend of soil organic carbon and available N, P and K in post-harvest soil with increasing irrigation levels, whereas increasing level of irrigation reduced the incidence of early shoot borer in sugarcane. Sugarcane + garlic with 100% RDF to both the crops in combination with 4 irrigations (30, 60, 90 and 120 DAS) resulted in the highest N (29.1 kg/ha), P (12.5 kg/ha) and K (27.6 kg/ha) uptake by garlic. The interaction effects showed that sugarcane + garlic (1: 2) with 100% RDF to both the crops in combination with 3 irrigations at 30, 60 and 90 DAS gave at par net returns with that of sugarcane + garlic with 100% RDF to both the crops along with 4 irrigations at 30, 60, 90 and 120 DAS in sugarcane + garlic intercropping system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aChilo infuscatellus 3aSaccharum 3aagronomy 3aautumn 3abulbs 3acosts and returns 3acrops 3adosage 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3agarlic 3aharvesting 3ahybrids 3aincidence 3aintercropping 3airrigation rates 3airrigation requirement 3airrigation scheduling 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient utilization 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3asole 3asowing 3asugarcane 3atotal nitrogen 3aweight 3aIndia 0aFertilizer 0aIrrigation 0aResource-use efficiency 0aShoot borer 0aSugarcane + garlic1 aKumari, Geeta1 aAnil Kumar,1 aPaswan, Sudhir0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2016 Sept., v. 61, no. 3 p.297-306dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04092naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245007500159300001800234520260800252592002802860650001302888650002202901650002102923650001802944650002402962650002102986650001203007650002303019650002803042650002403070650002503094650001203119650002403131650001403155650001203169650002403181650001503205650001003220650002203230650001303252650001903265650001403284650001003298650001003308651002003318651001103338700002303349773009803372856007103470852000903541655001203550IND60518781320221120081738.0160419e198610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051878132DNAL7 a10.2307/19386882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRisch, Stephen J.10aEffects of Seed Predation by a Tropical Ant on Competition Among Weeds  ap. 1319-1327.  aThe native fire ant, Solenopsis geminata, harvests small—sized seeds, especially grasses, in disturbed habitats in wet tropical areas of Mexico and Central America. When common, this ant can lower overall abundance of many weedy species, grasses in particular. We studied experimentally the effect of the ant on pairwise competition between weed plants, using a replacement series design; the pairs were (1 Paspalum distichum and Daucus carota, (2) Leptochloa dubia and Capsella bursapastoris, (3) Panicum clandestinum and Pennisetum ciliare, and (4) Cynodon dactylon and Festuca arundinacea. When the ant strongly preferred seeds from one of the plant species, total plant biomass was significantly lower (by up to 50%) in the plots with ants for about the first 50 after plants. Subsequently, the nonpreferred species increased, and 83 d after planting, total plant biomass was about the same in the presence and absence of ants. A crop growing with ants could thus benefit from reduced competition early in the season. For one of the plant pairs, ants reversed the course of plant competition and changed which of the species was eventually excluded from the plots. For two of the weed pairs, when the ant preferentially ate the seeds of the inferior competitor, the inferior competitor disappeared more rapidly. For the fourth pair, ants created a stable equilibrium between two species, whereas otherwise one of the plant species would have disappeared. Feeding preference studied conducted in the field demonstrated that the amount of each seed type removed by the ants was strongly influenced by the amount and kinds of other seeds in the immediate area. A strongly preferred seed was removed less frequently if it occurred in the midst of nonpreferred seeds. Nonpreferred seeds were taken much more readily if they occurred with preferred seeds. The importance of this "seed environment" effect was less significant in determining final composition of a weed mixture than: (1) inherent preference of the ants for certain weed species, or (2) relative competitive ability of the weeds in the mixture. Although S. geminata can increase the proportion of dicots in a weed assemblage, several factors limit this process: (1) as grasses become rare, a large fraction of their seeds will fall into the protective cover of dicots, (2) as grasses become rare, S. geminata may move their nests to areas of higher food abundance, and (3) the vegetative reproduction of some grasses occurs independently of seed removal by ants, or may even be accelerated by the reduced competition with grass seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsella 3aCenchrus ciliaris 3aCynodon dactylon 3aDaucus carota 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aLeptochloa dubia 3aPanicum 3aPaspalum distichum 3aPennisetum clandestinum 3aSolenopsis geminata 3aasexual reproduction 3abiomass 3afeeding preferences 3afire ants 3agrasses 3ahabitat destruction 3aharvesting 3anests 3aplant competition 3aplanting 3aseed predation 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aweeds 3aCentral America 3aMexico1 aCarroll, C.

The algorithm can be used to simulate from Bayesian posterior distributions, using either data tempering or power tempering, or for optimization. A key feature of SABL is that the introduction of information is adaptive and controlled, ensuring that the algorithm performs reliably and efficiently in a wide variety of applications with off-the-shelf settings, minimizing the need for tedious tuning, tinkering, trial and error by users. The algorithm is pleasingly parallel, and a Matlab toolbox implementing the algorithm is able to make efficient use of massively parallel computing environments such as graphics processing units (GPUs) with minimal user effort. This paper describes the algorithm, provides theoretical foundations, applies the algorithm to Bayesian inference and optimization problems illustrating key properties of its operation, and briefly describes the open source software implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3atempering 0aC11 0aC61 0aSequential Monte Carlo 0aSimulated annealing 0aPosterior simulation 0aBayesian learning 0aParallel computing 0aParticle filtering1 aDurham, Garland0 tJournal of econometrics.g2019 May, v. 210, no. 1 p.4-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001300156245010200169300001600271520134400287592002801631650002301659650003901682650001701721650003901738650001901777650001601796650001001812650003101822650001401853650001301867650001701880650001801897650001501915650002401930650001101954653001801965653002601983653002702009653003102036653002002067700001302087700001602100700001402116700001402130700001802144700001602162700002302178700001502201700001402216700001702230773009902247856009002346852000902436655001202445IND60599664420221123012229.0180702e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059966442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Kai10aSelf-assembled magnetic fluorescent polymeric micelles for magnetic resonance and optical imaging  ap. 344-355.  aStable and cytocompatible hybrid PEGylated micelles with multimodal imaging capabilities are described. The F3O4-encapsulated polymeric micelles composed of cores containing magnetic nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol (PEG) shells are synthesized by self-assembly of amphiphilic poly(HFMA-co-VBK)-g-PEG copolymers and oleic acid stabilized Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles in the core produce T2-weighted MR imaging functionalities, whereas the small fluorescent monomer carbazole in the polymer shell introduces good fluorescent properties. The multifunctional micelles exhibit excellent paramagnetic properties with the maximum saturation magnetization of 9.61 emu/g and transverse relaxivity rate of 157.44 mm⁻¹ S⁻¹. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reveal enhanced contrast between the liver and spleen. Fluorescence spectra show characteristic emission peaks from carbazole at 350 nm and 365 nm and vivid blue fluorescence can be observed by 2-photon confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM). In vivo optical imaging demonstrates the unique fluorescent characteristics of the Fe3O4-encapsulated polymeric micelles in the liver and spleen and the excellent multifunctional properties suggest potential clinical use as nanocarriers in magnetic resonance imaging and optical imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3aliver 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amagnetism 3amicelles 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3apolyethylene glycol 3aspleen 0aSelf-assembly 0aAmphiphilic copolymer 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aMagnetic resonance imaging 0aOptical imaging1 aLi, Huan1 aLi, Penghui1 aZhu, Haie1 aShen, Jie1 aYi, Changfeng1 aWu, Shuilin1 aYeung, Kelvin W.K.1 aXu, Zushun1 aXu, Haibo1 aChu, Paul K.0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.344-355dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04129naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003000132040001800162100001800180245010100198300001800299500000900317520176900326592002802095650001402123650001902137650002402156650001402180650001302194650001502207650001302222650001302235650001502248650000902263650001302272650001802285650001002303650000902313650001102322650001102333650001502344650002202359650001302381650001102394650001102405650001202416650002802428650002702456650000902483650002302492650002102515650002002536650003102556650004902587651001802636651001102654651001802665700001502683700001702698700002102715773019402736774015902930852000903089856009503098856011203193856007703305961001303382655001203395IND4414265720221121184152.0191028e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441426572DNAL7 a189484962pmid7 a10113/231982hdl7 a10.2134/jeq2008.00792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarmel, Daren14aThe MANAGE Database: Nutrient Load and Site Characteristic Updates and Runoff Concentration Data  ap. 2403-2406.  aepub  aThe “Measured Annual Nutrient loads from AGricultural Environments” (MANAGE) database was developed to be a readily accessible, easily queried database of site characteristic and field-scale nutrient export data. The original version of MANAGE, which drew heavily from an early 1980s compilation of nutrient export data, created an electronic database with nutrient load data and corresponding site characteristics from 40 studies on agricultural (cultivated and pasture/range) land uses. In the current update, N and P load data from 15 additional studies of agricultural runoff were included along with N and P concentration data for all 55 studies. The database now contains 1677 watershed years of data for various agricultural land uses (703 for pasture/rangeland; 333 for corn; 291 for various crop rotations; 177 for wheat/oats; and 4–33 yr for barley, citrus, vegetables, sorghum, soybeans, cotton, fallow, and peanuts). Across all land uses, annual runoff loads averaged 14.2 kg ha⁻¹ for total N and 2.2 kg ha⁻¹ for total P. On average, these losses represented 10 to 25% of applied fertilizer N and 4 to 9% of applied fertilizer P. Although such statistics produce interesting generalities across a wide range of land use, management, and climatic conditions, regional crop-specific analyses should be conducted to guide regulatory and programmatic decisions. With this update, MANAGE contains data from a vast majority of published peer-reviewed N and P export studies on homogeneous agricultural land uses in the USA under natural rainfall-runoff conditions and thus provides necessary data for modeling and decision-making related to agricultural runoff.

The rise in air pollution is associated with an increased probability of purchasing medical insurance. Results suggest that the effect of air pollution on the demand for medical insurance may be overestimated without considering the migration of people. Furthermore, the substitution between basic medical and commercial insurance is becoming increasingly evident with the reform of the medical system. The effect of air pollution on the demand for medical insurance is mainly observed on women, children, the elderly, and people with high income and educational levels, all of whom are more likely to take an avoidance behavior. This study suggests that environmental issues must be considered in future medical insurance designs due to avoidance behavior to mitigate the negative effects of poor air quality. Avoidance costs must also be considered when governments formulate environmental policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aavoidance behavior 3achildren 3aeconomic demand 3aeducational status 3aelderly 3aenvironmental policy 3ahealth insurance 3aincome 3anutrition surveys 3aprobability 3apurchasing 3awomen 3aChina 0aAir pollution 0aAvoidance behavior 0aMedical insurance1 aChen, Zhongfei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 20, v. 259 p.120970-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245006800175300001600243520159500259592002801854650002901882650001301911650001201924650002101936650001401957650001801971650002201989650002202011650001602033650000902049650001502058653001902073653002202092653003102114653002402145653003002169700002302199700001902222700001802241773007802259856008102337852000902418655001202427IND4487208320221119164955.0160511e20120823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448720832DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-012-0098-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNallapan Maniyam, Maegala10aCyanide degradation by immobilized cells of Rhodococcus UKMP-5M  ap. 837-844.  aAnthropogenic sources contribute to the bulk presence of cyanide, which causes substantial health and environmental concerns. A petroleum-contaminated soil isolate, Rhodococcus UKMP-5M has been verified to efficiently degrade high concentration of cyanide in the form of KCN in our previous study. In order to enhance the cyanide-degrading ability of this bacterium, different encapsulation matrices were screened to immobilize cells of Rhodococcus UKMP-5M for degradation of cyanide. It was revealed that the biocatalyst activity and bead mechanical strength improved significantly when calcium alginate encapsulation technique was employed as compared to free cells. The results also indicated that the immobilized cell system could tolerate a higher level of KCN concentration and were able to support a higher biomass density. In addition, the embedded cells retained almost 96% of their initial cyanide removal efficiency during the first five batches and the entrapped cell system maintained 64% of its initial activity after eight successive batches. The encapsulated beads could be easily recovered from the production medium and reused for up to five batches without significant losses of cyanide-degrading ability, which proved to be advantageous from an economic point of view. From this study, it could be inferred that the novel Rhodococcus UKMP-5M strain demonstrated high cyanide-degrading ability and the optimized calcium alginate immobilization technique provided a promising alternative for practical application of large scale remediation of cyanide-bearing wastewaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abacteria 3abiomass 3acalcium alginate 3aeconomics 3aencapsulation 3aimmobilized cells 3apotassium cyanide 3aremediation 3asoil 3awastewater 0aimmobilization 0abiotransformation 0acyanide-degrading activity 0aRhodococcus UKMP-5M 0acalcium alginate capsules1 aSjahrir, Fridelina1 aIbrahim, Abdul1 aCass, Anthony0 tBiologia.g2012 Aug. 23, v. 67, no. 5 p.837-844dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-012-0098-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009100168520135700259592002801616650001101644650001101655650002201666650002201688650002901710650002601739650001001765650002101775650002001796651001001816653002301826653002601849653003801875653001001913700001501923700001501938700001801953700001801971700001801989700001502007700001102022700001202033700001802045773011302063856008602176852000902262655001202271IND60686663220221122014356.0210212e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068666322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yuhan10aSocioeconomic drivers of water withdrawals driven by provincial energy demand in China  aEnergy and water resources are essential to human beings, and energy and water systems are closely interconnected. Existing studies have quantified the energy-water nexus in China, but the socioeconomic factors that influence the provincial energy-water nexus have not been assessed. This study quantified the water withdrawals driven by the provincial final demand of energy products, and explored the driving factors of the provincial energy-water nexus in China from 2007 to 2012. The results show that actions to reduce the water withdrawals should focus on the changes in energy demand structure and per capita energy demand in economically developed and populous provinces (e.g., Beijing, Guangdong, and Jiangsu). For water-scarce and energy resource-abundant provinces (e.g., Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Anhui), the changes in water withdrawal intensity and production structure will have more impacts on water withdrawal reductions. Furthermore, the reduction of water withdrawals in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Anhui is highly linked to the energy demand in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Jiangsu. Population growth has small effects on the energy-water nexus in China. Considering inter-provincial trade in energy-water-related policies can contribute to sustainable energy and water resource management in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3apopulation growth 3arenewable energy sources 3asocioeconomic factors 3atrade 3awater management 3awater resources 3aChina 0aEnergy-water nexus 0aInput-output analysis 0aStructural decomposition analysis 0aChina1 aLiang, Sai1 aXu, Lixiao1 aFeng, Cuiyang1 aQi, Jianchuan1 aYang, Xuechun1 aLi, Yumeng1 aLi, Ke1 aLi, Hui1 aYang, Zhifeng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 10, v. 258 p.120971-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1209713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009500166500001900261520174400280592002802024650002402052650001202076650003002088650002302118650001002141650002002151650002302171650003102194651001302225700001902238700001802257700001802275700001802293700002102311700001902332773012002351856007902471852000902550655001202559IND60735165920221121013342.0210423e20210419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073516592DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120403622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽugelj, Alenka 10aERIC and WGS Typing of Paenibacillus larvae in Slovenia: Investigation of ERIC I Outbreaks  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPaenibacillus larvae is the causative agent of American foulbrood (AFB), a fatal disease of honeybee brood. Here, we obtained 506 P. larvae isolates originating from honey or brood samples and from different geographic regions of Slovenia in the period 2017–2019. In the first part of the study, we conducted ERIC-PCR typing to assess the frequency of ERIC types in Slovenia. Capillary electrophoresis was used for the analysis of ERIC patterns, revealing good separation efficiency and enabling easy lane-to-lane comparisons. ERIC II was the predominant type (70.2%), followed by ERIC I (29.8%); two slightly altered ERIC I banding patterns were observed but were not considered relevant for the discrimination of ERIC types. No evident spatiotemporal clustering of ERIC types was observed. To assess the clonality of the outbreak-related P. larvae ERIC I isolates, 59 isolates of this type underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) revealed seven ERIC I-ST2 outbreak clusters (≤35 allele differences) with the median intra-outbreak diversity ranging from 7 to 27 allele differences. In all seven clusters, the transmission of P. larvae outbreak clone within a 3-km radius (AFB zone) was observed, which could be explained by the activity of honeybees. In three clusters, the transmission of the outbreak clone between geographically distant apiaries was revealed, which could be explained by the activities of beekeepers such as migratory beekeeping and trading of bee colonies. The present findings reinforce the importance of beekeeping activities in the transmission of P. larvae. WGS should be used as a reference typing method for the detection of P. larvae transmission clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmerican foul brood 3aalleles 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aetiological agents 3ahoney 3ahoney bee brood 3amigratory behavior 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aSlovenia1 aPapić, Bojan 1 aZdovc, Irena 1 aZajc, Urška 1 aGolob, Majda 1 aAvberšek, Jana 1 aKušar, Darja 0 tInsects.g2021 Apr. 19, v. 12, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120403623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245003500190300001600225520062000241650001700861650002200878650001600900650001600916650001000932650001400942650001800956650001200974650003000986650005001016650001601066650001101082650004701093650006801140650001801208653002101226653002201247653001301269653002101282773012001303852000901423856008501432930003301517946001101550655001201561IND4413775820221122105426.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441377582DNAL7 a190158852pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-008-0707-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikitenko, Leonid L. 10aVascular endothelium in cancer  ap. 223-240.  aThe vascular endothelium plays an essential role during organogenesis and in tissue homeostasis. Growing evidence also supports its essential and complex role in tumour biology and cancer progression. In particular, excessive proliferation and transformation or dysfunction of endothelial cells leads to pathological (lymph)angiogenesis or vascular malfunctions, which are hallmarks of neoplastic and malignant disorders. Reciprocal interactions between endothelial cells and the local tumour microenvironment may regulate tumour progression and resistance to anti-cancer therapies in a tumour-type-specific manner. 3aangiogenesis 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3ahomeostasis 3alymph 3aneoplasms 3aorganogenesis 2aAnimals 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasm 2aEndothelium, Vascularxmetabolismxpathology. 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aNeoplasmsxmetabolismxpathologyxtherapy. 2aNeovascularization, Pathologicxmetabolismxpathologyxtherapy. 2aOrganogenesis 0aEndothelial cell 0aLymphangiogenesis 0aNeoplasm 0aKaposi's sarcoma0 tCell and tissue research.g2009 Jan., v. 335, no. 1 p.223-240dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-008-0707-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04688naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002000185245015100205300001600356500002400372500001500396520216200411650002502573650002002598650002402618650001502642650001602657650002102673650001202694650002002706650001702726650002802743650003002771650001402801650002802815650002002843650001102863650002002874650002302894650001802917650001702935650001902952650003702971650001203008650004903020650004703069650001103116650005603127650002903183650003403212650006203246650004203308650004003350650001203390650004303402651001203445653002003457653001303477700001803490700002203508700001903530700002203549700002503571700002403596773009603620852000903716856008803725930003303813945002503846946001103871655001203882IND4420189420221122105323.0090508e20090528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018942DNAL7 a191860102pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8331 aAngen, Øystein10aRespiratory disease in calves: Microbiological investigations on trans-tracheally aspirated bronchoalveolar fluid and acute phase protein response  ap. 165-171.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTrans-tracheal aspirations from 56 apparently healthy calves and 34 calves with clinical signs of pneumonia were collected in six different herds during September and November 2002. The 90 samples were cultivated and investigated by PCR tests targeting the species Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma dispar, and Mycoplasma bovirhinis. A PCR test amplifying the lktC-artJ intergenic region was evaluated and shown to be specific for the two species M. haemolytica and Mannheimia glucosida. All 90 aspirations were also analyzed for bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine corona virus by antigen ELISA. Surprisingly, 63% of the apparently healthy calves harbored potentially pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract, 60% of these samples contained either pure cultures or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. Among diseased calves, all samples showed growth of pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract. All of these were classified as pure culture or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. A higher percentage of the samples were positive for all bacterial species in the group of diseased animals compared to the clinically healthy animals, however this difference was only significant for M. dispar and M. bovirhinis. M. bovis was not detected in any of the samples. BRSV was detected in diseased calves in two herds but not in the clinically healthy animals. Among the diseased calves in these two herds a significant increase in haptoglobin and serum amyloid A levels was observed compared to the healthy calves. The results indicate that haptoglobin might be the best choice for detecting disease under field conditions. For H. somni and M. haemolytica, a higher percentage of the samples were found positive by PCR than by cultivation, whereas the opposite result was found for P. multocida. Detection of P. multocida by PCR or cultivation was found to be significantly associated with the disease status of the calves. For H. somni a similar association with disease status was only observed for cultivation and not for PCR. 3aacute phase proteins 3acattle diseases 3abacterial pneumonia 3abiomarkers 3aherd health 3adisease severity 3abronchi 3amixed infection 3ahaptoglobins 3aepidemiological studies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abioassays 3apathogen identification 3aimmune response 3acalves 3aviral pneumonia 3adisease prevalence 3amycoplasmosis 3abacteriology 3adisease course 2aAcute-Phase Proteinsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluidxmicrobiology 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aHaptoglobinsxmetabolism 2aLungxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aPneumoniaxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSerum Amyloid A Proteinxmetabolism 2aTrachea 2aVirus Diseasesxdiagnosisxveterinary. 3aDenmark 0aserum amyloid A 0aetiology1 aThomsen, John1 aLarsen, Lars Erik1 aLarsen, Jesper1 aKokotovic, Branko1 aHeegaard, Peter M.H.1 aEnemark, Jörg M.D.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 May 28, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.165-171dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03306naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245006700143300001800210500001500228520144100243650001601684650003501700650002701735650001601762650001901778650001801797650002901815650002001844650002501864650001901889650001801908650001801926650002101944650002301965650001101988650003201999650001802031650004502049650002802094650002902122650005602151650005502207650002402262650002002286650004102306650003802347653001002385653002302395653001402418653001002432700002002442700001402462700001702476700001202493700001502505773008302520852000902603939003302612946001102645655001202656IND9205117520221122082921.0920813e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920511752DNAL7 a15347022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoupil, P.10aTranscriptional regulation of a seed-specific carrot gene, DC8  ap. 1049-1063.  a2019-12-04  aMany late embryogenesis abundant (Lea) protein genes in plants are regulated by abscisic acid (ABA). The RNA level of a carrot gene, DC8, increases in response to ABA in developing seeds. However, DC8 cannot be induced by ABA in adult tissues. We used chimeric genes made of various DC8 promoter fragments fused to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) to analyze the transcriptional regulation of DC8. DC8:GUS expression was measured in electroporated carrot protoplasts and in stably transformed carrots. The region of the DC8 promoter from -170 to -51 contained ABA-responsive sequences that required a 5' upstream region for high levels of expression in embryogenic callus protoplasts. 505 bp of the DC8 promoter conferred GUS expression in stably transformed somatic and zygotic embryos. DC8:GUS was expressed only in tissues formed in the seed. This includes cells in the embryo, the endosperm and the germinating seedlings. Gel retardation and competition experiments were performed to analyze the embryo nuclear protein-DNA binding activities in vitro. No binding activity was detected on the putative ABA-responsive region; however the 5' upstream regions located between -505 and -301 interacted with embryo nuclear factors. An additional site of DNA-protein interaction was located between positions -32 and +178. The nuclear proteins that bind these sequences were found in the embryo nuclei only, not in the nuclei from leaves or roots. 3aprotoplasts 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenetic transformation 3atransposons 3aembryo (plant) 3aDaucus carota 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aDNA-binding proteins 3areporter genes 3aabscisic acid 3aembryogenesis 3apromoter regions 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acallus 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aBase Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxembryologyxgenetics. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSeedsxgenetics 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 2aVegetablesxembryologyxgenetics. 0aseeds 0agenetic regulation 0alea genes 0agenes1 aHatzopoulos, P.1 aFranz, G.1 aHempel, F.D.1 aYou, R.1 aSung, Z.R.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1992 Apr., v. 18, no. 6 p.1049-1063x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01940naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009900126300001600225500001500241520079200256650001901048650001401067650001601081650001601097650000901113650001101122650001201133650002001145650001301165650001301178650001601191650001601207650001601223650002301239653001501262653001201277653001401289700001401303700001501317773008401332852000901416930003301425945001301458946001101471655001201482IND2326774520221122082943.0020428e200105  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232677452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, O.E.10aCorn steeping: influence of time and lactic acid on isolation and thermal properties of starch  ap. 251-256.  a2019-12-05  aA semi-dent corn hybrid was laboratory batch-steeped at 52 degrees C in a sulfur dioxide solution (2500 ppm) and sulfur dioxide solution with lactic acid (2500 ppm SO2 + 0.5% v/v lactic acid) for various time intervals. Starch was laboratory wet milled and gelatinization characteristics were analyzed by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Starch isolated from corn steeped in SO2 solution alone had higher peak temperatures and narrower gelatinization range as the steeping time increased. This demonstrated that the wet milling process anneals corn starch during the isolation procedure. Such an effect was less pronounced when starch was milled from corn steeped with lactic acid. Higher starch yields were obtained from corn steeped in sulfur dioxide solution with lactic acid. 3asulfur dioxide 3asolutions 3acorn starch 3awet milling 3acorn 3ayields 3asoaking 3amilling quality 3aduration 3agelation 3alactic acid 3atemperature 3acorn gluten 3athermal properties 0amaize germ 0amilling 0aisolation1 aHaros, M.1 aSuarez, C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 May, v. 48, no. 3 p.251-256x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02953naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245011200169300001400281520150800295650002201803650001401825650001801839650001001857650001401867650001001881650002401891650003001915650004501945650003001990650001002020650001002030651001102040653001702051653002902068653002502097653002102122653002102143653002502164700001502189700001402204773010802218852000902326856009202335930003302427946001102460655001202471IND4414724620221122061422.0090109e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441472462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2008.00677.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOCHBERG, O.14aThe response of ACCase-resistant Phalaris paradoxa populations involves two different target site mutations  ap. 37-46.  aPhalaris paradoxa (awned canary-grass) is an aggressive annual winter weed in wheat and other arable crops that is controlled mainly by ACCase-inhibiting herbicides: cyclohexanediones (DIMs), aryloxyphenoxypropionates (FOPs) and phenylpyrazolines (DENs, e.g. pinoxaden). The selection pressure imposed on the weed populations by repeated use of these herbicides has resulted in the evolution of increased numbers of ACCase-resistant populations of P. paradoxa in Israel and other countries. Two populations, Revadim (RV) and Mishmar Ha'emek (MH) that were exposed to differing weed and crop management tactics were investigated. Both populations were highly resistant to all FOPs, pinoxaden and cycloxydim, but responded differently to some DIMs. RV plants exhibited much higher resistance to tralkoxydim than MH plants, while showing similar low levels of resistance to tepraloxydim and clethodim. Both populations were equally susceptible to graminicides with other modes of action. The mutations responsible for the observed resistance were identified using PCR-RFLP and by sequencing the carboxyl transferase domain of the chloroplastic ACCase gene. RV plants possess a substitution of Asp₂₀₇₈ to Gly, whereas in MH population a mixture of Ile₂₀₄₁ to Asn or Asp₂₀₇₈ to Gly was found. Our study demonstrates that lack of herbicide and crop rotation may result in the evolution of diverse target site mutations and differential response of the whole plant to ACCase inhibitors. 3aPhalaris paradoxa 3aclethodim 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3aevolution 3agenes 3amechanism of action 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aweeds 3awheat 3aIsrael 0acanary-grass 0aaryloxyphenoxypropionate 0acarboxyl transferase 0acyclohexanedione 0aphenylpyrazoline 0atarget site mutation1 aSIBONY, M.1 aRUBIN, B.0 tWeed research.g2009 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.37-46dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2008.00677.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04605naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009300170300001800263520249800281650001602779650002902795650001902824650002502843650001702868650002502885650001902910650002302929650001802952650001702970650003902987650002903026650002103055650001303076650002103089650001803110650001903128650001303147650002503160650002003185650001803205650001803223650002703241651001903268653002503287653002003312653002003332653002203352653002803374653003603402653002103438700002403459700002203483700001803505700001903523700002103542700002303563700002703586700002803613773012103641852000903762856009203771930003303863946001103896655001203907IND4412790220221122052919.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441279022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01701.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLICHTER, JOHN10aSoil carbon sequestration in a pine forest after 9 years of atmospheric CO₂ enrichment  ap. 2910-2922.  aThe impact of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions on climate change may be mitigated in part by C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems as rising atmospheric CO₂ concentrations stimulate primary productivity and ecosystem C storage. Carbon will be sequestered in forest soils if organic matter inputs to soil profiles increase without a matching increase in decomposition or leaching losses from the soil profile, or if the rate of decomposition decreases because of increased production of resistant humic substances or greater physical protection of organic matter in soil aggregates. To examine the response of a forest ecosystem to elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, the Duke Forest Free-Air CO₂ Enrichment (FACE) experiment in North Carolina, USA, has maintained atmospheric CO₂ concentrations 200 μL L⁻¹ above ambient in an aggrading loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation over a 9-year period (1996-2005). During the first 6 years of the experiment, forest-floor C and N pools increased linearly under both elevated and ambient CO₂ conditions, with significantly greater accumulations under the elevated CO₂ treatment. Between the sixth and ninth year, forest-floor organic matter accumulation stabilized and C and N pools appeared to reach their respective steady states. An additional C sink of ~30 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹ was sequestered in the forest floor of the elevated CO₂ treatment plots relative to the control plots maintained at ambient CO₂ owing to increased litterfall and root turnover during the first 9 years of the study. Because we did not detect any significant elevated CO₂ effects on the rate of decomposition or on the chemical composition of forest-floor organic matter, this additional C sink was likely related to enhanced litterfall C inputs. We also failed to detect any statistically significant treatment effects on the C and N pools of surface and deep mineral soil horizons. However, a significant widening of the C : N ratio of soil organic matter (SOM) in the upper mineral soil under both elevated and ambient CO₂ suggests that N is being transferred from soil to plants in this aggrading forest. A significant treatment x time interaction indicates that N is being transferred at a higher rate under elevated CO₂ (P=0.037), suggesting that enhanced rates of SOM decomposition are increasing mineralization and uptake to provide the extra N required to support the observed increase in primary productivity under elevated CO₂. 3aPinus taeda 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3achemical degradation 3aclimate change 3aconiferous forests 3aforest litter 3aforest soils 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahumic substances 3aleaching 3alosses from soil 3amineral soils 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aprimary productivity 3asoil aggregates 3asoil horizons 3asoil profiles 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aNorth Carolina 0a¹³C stable isotope 0adrought effects 0aFACE experiment 0aice-storm effects 0aparticle-size fractions 0aprogressive nitrogen limitation 0asoil carbon sink1 aBILLINGS, SHARON A.1 aZIEGLER, SUSAN E.1 aGAINDH, DEEYA1 aRYALS, REBECCA1 aFINZI, ADRIEN C.1 aJackson, Robert B.1 aSTEMMLER, ELIZABETH A.1 aSchlesinger, William H.0 tGlobal change biology.g2008 Dec., v. 14, no. 12 p.2910-2922dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01701.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03426naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002000181245016100201300001600362500002400378500001500402520184700417650002602264650001502290650002102305650001502326650001702341650002402358650001402382650002302396650002102419650001302440651001902453653001402472653002602486653003002512653001802542700002902560700002302589700002102612773010002633852000902733856008502742930003302827945002502860946001102885655001202896IND4415172720221122052945.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441517272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9249-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aM001 0aL300 0aL8311 aDunn, Jenny C. 10aCompetition and parasitism in the native White Clawed Crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes and the invasive Signal Crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus in the UK  ap. 315-324.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMany crayfish species have been introduced to novel habitats worldwide, often threatening extinction of native species. Here we investigate competitive interactions and parasite infections in the native Austropotamobius pallipes and the invasive Pacifastacus leniusculus from single and mixed species populations in the UK. We found A. pallipes individuals to be significantly smaller in mixed compared to single species populations; conversely P. leniusculus individuals were larger in mixed than in single species populations. Our data provide no support for reproductive interference as a mechanism of competitive displacement and instead suggest competitive exclusion of A. pallipes from refuges by P. leniusculus leading to differential predation. We screened 52 P. leniusculus and 12 A. pallipes for microsporidian infection using PCR. We present the first molecular confirmation of Thelohania contejeani in the native A. pallipes; in addition, we provide the first evidence for T. contejeani in the invasive P. leniusculus. Three novel parasite sequences were also isolated from P. leniusculus with an overall prevalence of microsporidian infection of 38% within this species; we discuss the identity of and the similarity between these three novel sequences. We also screened a subset of fifteen P. leniusculus and three A. pallipes for Aphanomyces astaci, the causative agent of crayfish plague and for the protistan crayfish parasite Psorospermium haeckeli. We found no evidence for infection by either agent in any of the crayfish screened. The high prevalence of microsporidian parasites and occurrence of shared T. contejeani infection lead us to propose that future studies should consider the impact of these parasites on native and invasive host fitness and their potential effects upon the dynamics of native-invader systems. 3acompetitive exclusion 3aparasitism 3amicrosporidiosis 3aThelohania 3aPacifastacus 3aecological invasion 3abody size 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3acrayfish 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAstacidae 0aThelohania contejeani 0ainterspecific competition 0aMicrosporidia1 aMcClymont, H.

The stress-strain data of the compression test were modelled using a simple mathematical model, containing parameters such as the maximum stress (sigma max), the maximum strain (epsilon max), the elasticity parameter (epsilon) and the viscoelastic exponent (p). The effect of oil content, oil temperature and oil type on the compression behaviour of fried potatoes was introduced through the corresponding effects upon the model parameters. The results showed that maximum stress and maximum strain increase during frying. Crispness of potato strips is higher for hydrogenated oil, while the use of refined oil decreases potato crispness. 3aviscoelasticity 3amathematical models 3afood processing quality 3atexture 3acooking fats and oils 3aequations 3aFrench fries 3apretreatment 3aduration 3atemperature 3adeep fat frying 3aprediction 0apurification1 aOreopoulou, V.1 aMaroulis, Z.B.1 aMarinos-Kouris, D.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 May, v. 48, no. 3 p.213-218x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03682naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245011200145300001600257500002400273520196100297650002002258650002802278650003702306650001702343650001102360650001202371650001002383650002002393650001202413650000902425650001002434650002102444650001502465650002002480650001302500650001202513650001002525650000902535650002202544650001802566650002002584650002802604650001302632650001102645650002502656650001802681650001102699650001202710650002102722650002402743651001102767700002302778700001402801700001602815700001802831700001502849773017102864852000903035655001203044IND4368193320221122035750.0050405e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436819332DNAL7 a150515962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolland, Y.10aMuscle strength in obese elderly women: effect of recreational physical activity in a cross-sectional study  ap. 552-557.  aIncludes references  aBackground: Muscle strength (MS) may be impaired in obese persons, and this impairment may be a consequence of both obesity and low physical fitness. Objective: We investigated whether MS differed between obese [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) > 29], normal-weight (BMI = 24-29), and lean (BMI < 24) elderly subjects and compared the MS of sedentary and active subjects according to their BMI group. Design: The study included 215 obese [average (+/- SD) age: 80.0 +/- 3.5 y; BMI: 31.9 +/- 2.6], 630 normal-weight (age: 80.2 +/- 3.7 y; BMI: 26.3 +/- 1.4), and 598 lean (age: 80.7 +/- 3.5 y; BMI: 21.6 +/- 1.8) women with good functional ability. A cross-sectional design was used. Anthropometric measures (weight, height); measures of appendicular skeletal muscle mass (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), isometric knee and elbow extension (by statergometer), and isometric handgrip strength (by dynamometer); and data on health status and self-reported recreational physical activity (RPA: walking, gymnastics, cycling, swimming, gardening) were collected. Results: Absolute (unadjusted) MS was higher in obese than in lean women (P < 0.01), except for handgrip strength (P > 0.05). When adjusted for age, height, RPA, pain, depression, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass, MS did not differ significantly between obese, normal-weight, and lean subjects, except for knee extension (significant interaction effect with RPA; P = 0.01). With increasing BMI, lower limb strength did not change in the sedentary women but increased in active (greater than or equal to 1 h/wk in greater than or equal to 1 RPA for greater than or equal to 1 mo) women. All adjusted MS measures in active participants were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those in their sedentary peers. Conclusion: The adjusted MS of elderly women is not associated with obesity but is higher in active subjects than in sedentary ones, especially in the lower limbs of obese subjects. 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3adynamometers 3aelbows 3aelderly 3aknees 3amuscle strength 3aobesity 3apain 3apeers 3aphysical fitness 3arecreation 3askeletal muscle 3aswimming 3awalking 3awomen 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aGeriatric Assessment 2aHand Strength 2aHumans 2aObesity 2aPhysical Fitness 2aProspective Studies 0aFrance1 aLauwers-Cances, V.1 aPahor, M.1 aFillaux, J.1 aGrandjean, H.1 aVellas, B.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Apr., v. 79, no. 4 p.552-557dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245009500145300001500240520120600255650001401461650002901475650001601504700001201520700001601532700003101548700001501579700002301594700001301617773009301630852000901723945002501732946001101757655001201768IND4361942020221122035704.0040406e20040215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436194202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Mitochondrial complex I in the parasitic helminth Ascaris suum uses ubiquinone-9 (UQ9) and rhodoquinone-9 (RQ9) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. In this study, we investigated structural features of the quinone reduction site of A. suum complex I using a series of quinazoline-type inhibitors and also by the kinetic analysis of rhodoquinone-2 (RQ2) and ubiquinone-2 (UQ2) reduction. Structure¡activity profiles of the inhibition by quinazolines were comparable, but not completely identical, between NADH-RQ2 and NADH-UQ2 oxidoreductase activities. However, the inhibitory mechanism of quinazolines was competitive and partially competitive against RQ2 and UQ2, respectively. The pH profiles of both activities differed remarkably; NADH-RQ2 oxidoreductase activity showed an optimum pH at 7.6, whereas NADH-UQ2 oxidoreductase activity showed two optima pH at 6.4 and 7.2. Our results indicate that although A. suum complex I uses both RQ2 and UQ2 as an electron acceptor, the manner of reaction (or binding) of the two quinones differs. 3ahelminths 3aelectron transport chain 3aubiquinones1 aIno, T.1 aMiyoshi, H.1 aSakamoto, Kiyohiko,d1933-1 aOsanai, A.1 aNakamaru-Ogiso, E.1 aKita, K.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 Feb. 15, v. 1608, no. 2-3 p.97-103x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  aINDdLDPe2004/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03348naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003200145245010700177300001700284520198800301650001602289650001502305650002202320650002402342650002102366650002202387650000902409650002302418650001602441650001202457650002502469650002102494650001502515650001502530651000902545653002602554653001102580653002402591700001802615773011902633852000902752856008502761930003302846946001102879655001202890IND4433964520221122035748.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443396452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-009-9482-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzha, Alphonce Chenjerayi 10aApplication of the Distributed Hydrological Model, TOPNET, to the Big Darby Creek Watershed, Ohio, USA  ap. 979-1003.  aEvaluation of the applicability and utility of watershed hydrologic models in different hydro-geologic and soil conditions is necessary for a range of spatial scales and to assess the utility of these models as watershed water resources management tools. This study presents the application of the hydrological model TOPNET to the Big Darby Creek watershed, Ohio, United States. It focuses on the simulation modeling of stream flow in the watershed based on meteorological data for the eight year period of 1992-1999. Visual comparison of time series plots and statistical measures namely, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), coefficient of correlation (R²), and the percent bias (PBIAS) were used to assess the model performance. The statistical model evaluation results indicated that the model has a relatively high confidence and can give a good representation of the flow hydrographs for the watershed. For the calibration period simulations of annual stream flow were accurate with a mean R² and NS of 86% and 85% for the Big Darby at Darbyville gaging station. For the little Darby at West Jefferson gaging station a mean R² of 81% was obtained while the NS averaged 78%. Further analysis based on the aggregation of the water years into wet seasons and dry seasons, the model was also able to adequately simulate stream flow for both gaging stations and for both low flow periods and high flow periods. Statistical analysis for the validation period also yielded high R² values of 88% and 83% for the Darby at Big Darby at Darbyville gaging station and Little Darby at West Jefferson gaging station respectively. The worst PBIAS obtained for both calibration and validation period was 18% and this is better than recommended values for satisfactory daily simulations of ±25% for PBIAS. The encouraging simulation results obtained in this study shows the utility and usefulness of the TOPNET model in hydrological modeling and ultimately as a water resources management tool. 3acorrelation 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3amodel validation 3asimulation models 3asoil 3astatistical models 3astream flow 3astreams 3atime series analysis 3awater management 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aOhio 0aHydrological modeling 0aTOPNET 0aBig Darby watershed1 aHardy, T.

Another aim was to investigate some agent-specific environmental and individual risk factors. Milk samples were collected from 987 udder quarter cases from 829 cows during six 2-month periods from May 2002 to April 2003, and data on risk factors and demography were collected at sampling by means of a questionnaire. In total, 1056 bacteriological diagnoses were made. The most frequently isolated bacterial species was Staphylococcus aureus constituting 21.3% of the diagnoses, followed by Escherichia coli (15.9%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (15.6%), Streptococcus uberis (11.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6.2%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (6.1%) and Klebsiella spp. (4.2%). Samples with no growth or contamination constituted 10.6% and 4.5% of the diagnoses, respectively. A major shift in the panorama of udder pathogens was not observed compared to the survey in 1994-1995. Isolation of Klebsiella spp. was strongly associated with the use of sawdust as bedding material. On the other hand, using sawdust as bedding reduced the risk of isolating S. uberis relative to using straw or peat. The risk of isolating E. coli increased with increasing milk yield and was higher in loose housing systems than in tie stalls. Isolation of S. aureus was associated with tie stalls, and A. pyogenes with low yielding cows and teat lesions. S. dysgalactiae infections were also associated with teat lesions. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3asawdust 3aKlebsiella 3adairy cows 3arisk assessment 3aStreptococcus dysgalactiae 3aEscherichia coli 3aepidemiological studies 3atemporal variation 3aacute course 3arisk factors 3apathogen identification 3alitter (bedding) 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3aArcanobacterium pyogenes 3alongitudinal studies 3aenvironmental factors 3aStreptococcus uberis 3abovine mastitis 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aMastitis, Bovinexepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aRisk Factors 2aSeasons 3aSweden 0aSwedenxepidemiology. 0abacterial infections 0aanimal housing 0aetiology1 aLindberg, A.1 aPersson Waller, K.1 aEkman, T.1 aArtursson, K.1 aNilsson-Öst, M.1 aBengtsson, B.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 May 28, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.90-97dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01906naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245011500172300001600287500002400303520101600327650001501343650001401358650001301372650002101385650001101406700001801417700001801435773009401453852000901547856004801556655001201604IND4430707920221122005442.0100101e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443070792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-009-0039-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Daryl Lindsay10aRiverine habitat heterogeneity: the role of slackwaters in providing hydrologic buffers for benthic microfauna  ap. 181-191.  aIncludes references  aSlackwater habitats within lowland rivers support abundant biotic communities and provide these communities with a refuge from increases in discharge. These refuges allow biota to persist as discharges, vary and provide a source of colonists for slackwaters further downstream. In order to investigate the response of slackwater benthic microfaunal communities to changes in discharge, artificial slackwaters were created within the main channel of a lowland river and benthic microfaunal communities were sampled over a 60-day period. Benthic microfauna within the artificial and reference slackwaters were recorded in higher richness and abundance than in the main river channel. Within days the communities in the artificial slackwaters were similar to those in the reference slackwaters. The rapid speed of colonisation suggests that initial colonisation of slackwaters is likely to occur via active or passive dispersal of biota and that these systems and communities are resilient to changes in discharge. 3abiocenosis 3ahydrology 3alowlands 3ariverine habitat 3arivers1 aGigney, Helen1 aWatson, Garth0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 Jan., v. 638, no. 1 p.181-191dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0039-8 7aarticle04270naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001900185245015400204300001400358500002400372500001500396520186200411650001302273650002602286650002702312650002102339650001202360650002602372650001102398650001602409650002302425650001802448650000902466650001802475650002102493650002102514650001702535650001502552650002002567650001202587650004002599650004602639650003502685650001102720650005402731650001302785650003502798650003602833650003002869650005702899650004902956650004403005653001303049653001203062653002503074700002103099700001603120700002203136700001703158700001503175700001603190700002203206773009403228852000903322856008803331930003303419945002503452946001103477655001203488IND4420191020221122005554.0090508e20090528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442019102DNAL7 a191501822pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aMelchior, M.B.10aBiofilm formation and genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus bovine mastitis isolates: Evidence for lack of penicillin-resistance in Agr-type II strains  ap. 83-89.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe increasing evidence for a role of biofilm formation in bovine mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus led to further investigations on biofilm formation by S. aureus isolates from mastitis in two growth media (TSBg and bovine milk serum). The ability of 99 S. aureus strains that were recently isolated or obtained from a culture collection (historical strains) to form biofilm, in both growth media as well as the correlation of biofilm formation with the presence of the ica-, bap-, and IS257 genes are described. These genes have been correlated with biofilm formation by human S. aureus isolates. All strains were also genotyped with respect to their Agr-type and -subtype, and for the presence of the antibiotic resistance genes blaZ and smr by PCR. The prevalence of the Agr-types and the investigated genes and their correlation with biofilm formation were statistically evaluated. The Agr-type of a strain had a marked effect on the biofilm formation, by that strain, however in contrast to human isolates no significant effect of ica- and IS257 genes on biofilm formation was observed. The bap gene was not found in any of the investigated strains. The presence of biofilm related genes showed a high correlation with the Agr-type of the strains. The data give evidence for a very strong correlation of Agr-type I strains and penicillin-resistance in the bovine S. aureus mastitis strains; none of the Agr-type II strains was found to harbor penicillin-resistance genes. These data indicate that the most prevalent Agr-types in S. aureus bovine mastitis, Agr-type I and II, can be regarded as different subspecies, with different abilities for the formation of biofilm in bovine milk serum. The very high correlation between Agr-type II and penicillin-susceptibility strongly suggests that these strains are not able to accommodate blaZ genes. 3aetiology 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacterial colonization 3ain vitro culture 3abiofilm 3aantibiotic resistance 3acattle 3apenicillins 3astrain differences 3aculture media 3awhey 3apathogenicity 3amicrobial growth 3ain vitro studies 3apathogenesis 3apathotypes 3abovine mastitis 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aCattle 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxphysiology 2aGenotype 2aMastitis, Bovinexmicrobiology 2aPenicillin Resistancexgenetics 2aPenicillinsxpharmacology 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenotype 0astrains 0abacterial infections1 avan Osch, M.H.J.1 aGraat, R.M.1 avan Duijkeren, E.1 aMevius, D.J.1 aNielen, M.1 aGaastra, W.1 aFink-Gremmels, J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 May 28, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.83-89dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01548naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245008400171300001600255520062300271650001800894650002300912650001300935653001500948653001200963700002000975773011100995852000901106856008501115930003301200946001301233655001201246IND4433967720221122005401.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443396772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11149-009-9110-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBel i Queralt, Germa.10aPrivatization, regulation and airport pricing: an empirical analysis for Europe  ap. 142-161.  aThis paper examines factors determining airport charges. Using data for 100 large airports in Europe, we find that they charge higher prices when they move more passengers. Additionally, competition from other transport modes and nearby airports imposes some discipline on the pricing behavior of airports. Low-cost carriers and airlines with a high market share seem to have a stronger countervailing power. We also find that private airports not regulated charge higher prices than public or regulated airports. Finally, the regulation mechanism does not seem to influence substantially the level of airport charges. 3aprivatization 3aair transportation 3aairports 0aRegulation 0aPricing1 aFageda, Xavier 0 tJournal of regulatory economics.g2010 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.142-161dBoston : Springer USx0922-680X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11149-009-9110-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01934naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245012300174300001600297500002800313520093900341650001701280650001301297650001101310653001001321653001901331700002001350700002401370773011401394852000901508856009201517946001101609655001201620IND4418949520221121201016.0090410s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441894952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2009.00492.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVriesekoop, Frank14aThe role of acetaldehyde and glycerol in the adaptation to ethanol stress of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other yeasts  ap. 365-371.  aPublisher supplied data  aEthanol inhibition is a commonly encountered stress condition during typical yeast fermentations and often results in reduced fermentation rates and production yields. While past studies have shown that acetaldehyde addition has a significant ameliorating effect on the growth of ethanol-stressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this study investigated the potential ameliorating effect of acetaldehyde on a wide range of ethanol-stressed yeasts. Acetaldehyde does not appear to be a universal ameliorating agent for yeasts exposed to ethanol stress. It is also shown that as a result of an ethanol stress, most yeasts rapidly produce glycerol as an alternative means of NAD⁺ regeneration rather than having a specific requirement for glycerol. The results strongly suggest that both ethanol and acetaldehyde exposure have a direct effect on the cellular NAD⁺/NADH ratio, which can manifest itself as modulations in glycerol production. 3aacetaldehyde 3aglycerol 3ayeasts 0aredox 0aethanol stress1 aHaass, Cornelia1 aPamment, Neville B.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2009 May, v. 9, no. 3 p.365-371dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2009.00492.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03193naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245006000191300001800251520188300269650001602152650001502168650002202183650001202205650001502217650001402232650002502246650001102271650002002282653002902302653001002331653001502341653001702356653002502373653001602398653001602414653002002430700002302450773011702473852000902590856009202599930003302691946001102724655001202735IND4440274520221121161356.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444027452DNAL7 a206186972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04688.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowe, Winsor H.10aWhat can genetics tell us about population connectivity  ap. 3038-3051.  aGenetic data are often used to assess 'population connectivity' because it is difficult to measure dispersal directly at large spatial scales. Genetic connectivity, however, depends primarily on the absolute number of dispersers among populations, whereas demographic connectivity depends on the relative contributions to population growth rates of dispersal vs. local recruitment (i.e. survival and reproduction of residents). Although many questions are best answered with data on genetic connectivity, genetic data alone provide little information on demographic connectivity. The importance of demographic connectivity is clear when the elimination of immigration results in a shift from stable or positive population growth to negative population growth. Otherwise, the amount of dispersal required for demographic connectivity depends on the context (e.g. conservation or harvest management), and even high dispersal rates may not indicate demographic interdependence. Therefore, it is risky to infer the importance of demographic connectivity without information on local demographic rates and how those rates vary over time. Genetic methods can provide insight on demographic connectivity when combined with these local demographic rates, data on movement behaviour, or estimates of reproductive success of immigrants and residents. We also consider the strengths and limitations of genetic measures of connectivity and discuss three concepts of genetic connectivity that depend upon the evolutionary criteria of interest: inbreeding connectivity, drift connectivity, and adaptive connectivity. To conclude, we describe alternative approaches for assessing population connectivity, highlighting the value of combining genetic data with capture-mark-recapture methods or other direct measures of movement to elucidate the complex role of dispersal in natural populations. 3aimmigration 3ainbreeding 3apopulation growth 2aAnimals 2aDemography 2aGene Flow 2aGenetics, Population 2aHumans 2aModels, Genetic 0ademographic connectivity 0adrift 0aemigration 0aF-statistics 0agenetic connectivity 0aimmigration 0asource-sink 0aspatial ecology1 aAllendorf, Fred W.0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 Aug., v. 19, no. 15 p.3038-3051dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04688.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20111217b20120106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01817naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245004900168300001600217500013100233520065200364650002401016650001701040650002501057650001201082650001101094650001801105650001501123650002201138651001601160700002101176700001701197700001901214773009101233852000901324856005401333939003301387946001101420655001201431IND9303241620221121161323.0930527e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930324162DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.1992.297.512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, K.A.10aKiwifruit root systems: structure & function  ap. 383-389.  aPaper presented at the Second International Symposium on Kiwifruit.

On the basis of root length per unit volume of soil, mean densities within these volumes fall in the range 0.5–1.1 cm cm-3 and root length densities can be as high as 7 cm cm-3 within 1 m of the base of the vine. These densities are an order of magnitude greater than those found under other horticultural trees and vines. Kiwifruit roots are clumped. Relatively large volumes, up to 20% of the rooting volume, of soil contains no roots. In this they differ from other trees and vines. We use a simulation model to study aspects of water extracton by kiwifruit root systems. 3aActinidia deliciosa 3aroot systems 3aspatial distribution 3adensity 3alength 3atranspiration 3asoil water 3asimulation models 3aNew Zealand1 aWilligen, P. de,1 aGandar, P.W.1 aClothier, B.E.0 tActa horticulturae.g1992 Apr., , no. 297 p.383-389wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.1992.297.51  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03602naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001300179245012000192300001400312500002400326500001500350520203400365650001502399650001602414650002002430650001802450650002102468650001302489650001702502650001702519650001302536650001602549650001902565650002402584650001502608650001602623653001402639700001202653700001502665700001402680700001502694700001602709700001502725700001302740773011302753852000902866856009202875930003302967945002503000946001103025655001203036IND4420186220221121124754.0090508e20090512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2008.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5011 aWang, C.10aEffects of glycerol on lactation performance, energy balance and metabolites in early lactation Holstein dairy cows  ap. 12-20.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective was to evaluate effects of glycerol supplementation on feed intake, milk yield and milk composition, blood metabolites and energy balance in Holstein dairy cows from 4 to 63 days in milk (DIM). Thirty-six multiparous cows, blocked by lactation number, previous 305 day mature equivalent milk production and expected calving date, were arranged into four groups in a randomized block design. Treatments were: control (without glycerol), glycerol-low (LG), glycerol-medium (MG) and glycerol-high (HG) with 100, 200 and 300g glycerol per cow per day, respectively. The supplement of food grade glycerol (0.998g/g glycerol) was hand-mixed into the top one-third of the daily ratio. Cows were fed ad libitum a total mixed ratio consisting of equal proportions of forage and concentrate. Feed intake, milk yield and its components were not affected by glycerol supplementation. The energy balance, expressed as differences between energy input NEI and output (NEM +NEL) in MJ per cow per day, was higher (P <0.04) as glycerol supplementation level increased, especially during the first 17 and last 20 days of the 63 day period. Glycerol-supplemented cows tended (P <0.06) toward less loss of BW, especially first 17 and last 20 days of the 63 day period. Concentrations of glucose in plasma were higher for cows fed glycerol relative to control (54.1mg/dL versus 58.1mg/dL, respectively) and linearly increased (P <0.01) with increasing glycerol supplementation level. Concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate and urine ketones were lower for glycerol-supplemented cows at 7, 14 and 21 days of lactation and linearly (P <0.01) decreased with increasing glycerol supplementation. Although milk yield and feed intake were not affected, glycerol-supplemented cows has a more positive energy status (higher concentrations of plasma glucose, lower concentrations of plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, lower concentrations of urine ketones), suggesting that net energy availability may have been increased. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3aearly lactation 3amilk analysis 3amilk composition 3aglycerol 3adiet therapy 3amilk quality 3aHolstein 3afeed intake 3aenergy balance 3adietary supplements 3amilk yield 3ametabolites 0alactation1 aLiu, Q.1 aYang, W.Z.1 aHuo, W.J.1 aDong, K.H.1 aHuang, Y.X.1 aYang, X.M.1 aHe, D.C.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 May 12, v. 151, no. 1-2 p.12-20dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2008.10.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/26  aNon-US 7aarticle04728naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245008300200300001600283500002400299500001500323520202100338650001802359650002102377650001302398650001902411650002502430650004302455650001502498650002402513650002202537650002502559650002102584650001102605650001202616650002002628650001802648650000902666650001202675650002102687650002202708650002502730650001802755650002402773650001202797650003202809650002402841650001402865650006802879650006202947650002703009650001103036650006503047650002403112650005503136650005203191650000903243650003403252650000903286650002103295650003303316651001103349653002603360653001903386653002603405700001703431700002003448700001903468700001903487700001903506700001903525700001903544773010003563852000903663856008503672930003303757945002503790946001103815655001203826IND4420191620221121124737.0090508e20090622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442019162DNAL7 a194293642pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aS2001 aLeu, Yann Lii10aExtract isolated from Angelica hirsutiflora with insulin secretagogue activity  ap. 208-212.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthnopharmacological relevance: Angelica genus (Umbelliferae) has traditionally been used as the medicine and health food considered alleviating several disorders including diabetes mellitus. Angelica hirsutiflora Liu Chao & Chuang is an endemic species and a folk medicine in Taiwan. Aim of the study: The scientific evidence of anti-diabetic effect for Angelica hirsutiflora remains unknown. The methanolic extracts isolated from Angelica hirsutiflora were studied for its insulin secretagogue and hypoglycemic activities. Materials and methods: The in vitro effects and possible mechanisms of Angelica hirsutiflora extract on the insulin secretion in isolated mouse and human islets and pancreatic β-cell line HIT-T15 were determined; and tested the regulation of blood glucose in fasted mice and high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice. Results: Angelica hirsutiflora extract potently stimulated the release of insulin from cultured HIT-T15 cells and isolated mouse and human islets. The intracellular calcium levels were also increased in HIT-T15 cells and isolated human islets treated with Angelica hirsutiflora extract. Angelica hirsutiflora extract was capable of enhancing the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 protein in HIT-T15 cells. Specific ERK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited the increase of insulin secretion by Angelica hirsutiflora extract in HIT-T15 cells and isolated mouse islets. When Angelica hirsutiflora extract was administered to the fasted mice, it decreased the rise in blood glucose level after starch loading. The plasma insulin level was also increased by Angelica hirsutiflora extract treatment. In high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice, Angelica hirsutiflora extract markedly improved the oral glucose intolerance as compared with the vehicle control. Conclusions: These findings support that Angelica hirsutiflora extract may be useful in the control of hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by acting as an insulin secretagogue. 3ahigh fat diet 3amedicinal plants 3aAngelica 3aplant extracts 3adietary carbohydrate 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3acell lines 3amechanism of action 3ainsulin secretion 3amedicinal properties 3aherbal medicines 3ahumans 3acalcium 3aglycemic effect 3ablood glucose 3amice 3ainsulin 3ain vitro studies 3aglucose tolerance 3aislets of Langerhans 3aanimal models 2aAngelicaxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effects 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aInsulinxsecretion. 2aInsulin-Secreting Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aIslets of Langerhansxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMedicine, Chinese Traditional 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 0aTaiwan 0ainsulin secretagogues 0acultured cells 0aAngelica hirsutifolia1 aChen, Ya Wen1 aYang, Ching Yao1 aHuang, Chun Fa1 aLin, Guan Hong1 aTsai, Keh Sung1 aYang, Rong Sen1 aLiu, Shing Hwa0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 June 22, v. 123, no. 2 p.208-212dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.0273Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01638naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001800151245007100169300001600240500013100256520054800387650002400935650002800959651001600987653000901003653001001012653002001022653001401042700001801056700001601074773009101090852000901181856005401190939003301244946001101277655001201288IND9303241120221121065701.0930527e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930324112DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.1992.297.462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenzell, R.F.10aImproving kiwifruit vine productivity with plant growth regulators  ap. 345-350.  aPaper presented at the Second International Symposium on Kiwifruit.

Chicks were randomly allocated into six experimental groups and orally administered with vehicle, 5.0 mg/kg body weight (BW)/12 h nifedipine or 15.0 mg/kg BW/12 h diltiazem from 16 to 43 days of age under low temperature. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), the ascites heart index (AHI), the erythrocyte packed cell volume (PCV) and the relative percentage of medial pulmonary artery thickness were examined on days 29, 36 and 43. The data showed that administration of diltiazem protected broilers from low temperature-induced pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling. Although nifedipine prevented mPAP from increasing during the early stage, it did not suppress the development of PH during the late stage and did not keep heart rate (HR), PCV, AHI and the thickness of pulmonary small artery smooth muscle layer at the normal levels. Taken together, our results showed that diltiazem can effectively prevent low temperature-induced pulmonary hypertension in broilers with fewer side-effects and may be a potential compound for the prevention of this disease in poultry industry. 3aadverse effects 3aantagonists 3aascites 3abody weight 3acalcium 3achicks 3adisease prevention 3aerythrocytes 3aheart 3aheart rate 3ahematocrit 3ahypertension 3aoral administration 3apoultry diseases 3apoultry industry 3apulmonary artery 3asmooth muscle 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aCalcium Channel Blockersxtherapeutic use 2aChickens 2aCold Temperaturexadverse effects 2aDiltiazemxtherapeutic use 2aHypertension, Pulmonaryxetiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aMale 2aNeovascularization, Physiologicxdrug effects 2aNifedipinextherapeutic use 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & control 2aPulmonary Circulationxdrug effects 0acalcium antagonists 0apulmonary hypertension 0apulmonary vascular remodeling1 aGao, Mingyu1 aGuo, Yuming1 aQiao, Jian0 tAnimal science journal =.g2010 Aug., v. 81, no. 4 p.494-500dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2010.00762.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120413b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02055naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001600213500001500229520095900244650001401203650002801217650001201245650001301257650001601270650001101286650000901297650001401306650001601320650001601336650001901352653000901371653002701380653001001407700001901417700001501436700002001451773008401471852000901555930003301564945001301597946001101610655001201621IND2326806020221121054241.0020430e200105  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232680602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcotte, M.10aEvaluation of rheological properties of selected salt enriched food hydrocolloids  ap. 157-167.  a2019-12-05  aRheological properties of hydrocolloids are important for the design and operation of continuous processes such as ohmic heating. Addition of salt to hydrocolloids may be desirable to enhance the efficiency of ohmic heating. A rotational viscometer was used to characterize the flow behavior of pectin, starch, xanthan and carrageenan solutions at four temperatures (20 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 60 degrees C and 80 degrees C) and three concentrations. Salt was added at 1%. Samples were subjected to a programmed shear rate increasing from 0 to 300 s(-1) in 3 min, held constant at 300 s(-1) for 10 min and linearly decreasing to 0 during 3 min. The power law model was fitted to shear stress vs. shear rate data to obtain the consistency coefficient (m) and the flow behavior index (n) for starch and pectin whereas the Herschel-Bulkley model was used for carrageenan and xanthan. Both m and n were sensitive to changes in temperature and concentration. 3asolutions 3afood processing quality 3apectins 3acolloids 3acarrageenan 3astarch 3aflow 3aviscosity 3axanthan gum 3atemperature 3aheat treatment 0asalt 0arheological properties 0ashear1 aTaherian, A.R.1 aTrigui, M.1 aRamaswamy, H.S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 May, v. 48, no. 2 p.157-167x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03852naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001300182245014200195300001600337500002400353500001500377520134500392650002501737650001101762650001401773650002501787650001701812650001601829650002101845650002101866650001301887650004301900650001901943650002001962650002001982650001002002650004102012650004102053650003702094650002602131650001102157650005602168650001102224650006502235650002402300650004202324650000902366650001602375650004102391650005302432650007002485650002402555650003902579650003902618650001602657653001402673653001402687653001402701653001802715653002002733700001602753700001302769700001302782773010002795852000902895856008502904930003302989945002503022946001103047655001203058IND4420192220221121045346.0090508e20090622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442019222DNAL7 a194293702pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aLi, H.X.10aProduction of Th1- and Th2-dependent cytokines induced by the Chinese medicine herb, Rhodiola algida, on human peripheral blood monocytes  ap. 257-266.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthnopharmacological relevance: Rhodiola algida, an herb ingredient used in Chinese medicine, has been clinically proven to be effective in enhancing human immune responses. Aim of study: This study attempted to identify the potential immunomodulatory effect of Rhodiola algida extract in human immune system in vitro, and to examine its underlying molecular effects. Materials and methods: Firstly, the bioactive marker compound salidroside was used for standardization of Rhodiola algida extract by reversed-phase HPLC. Secondly, the regulation of human immune responses was investigated in human peripheral blood monocytes. A series of cytokines known to play important roles in the human immune responses were examined. Results: The current study provided quantitative assay for the marker compound, salidroside, in the Rhodiola algida extract for ensuring the quality consistency of Rhodiola algida used in the following experiments. Biological assay indicated that Rhodiola algida stimulates human peripheral blood lymphocytes and its underlying immunomodulatory effects probably through its regulation of IL-2 in Th1 cells and IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 in Th2 cells. Conclusion: The findings may enable us to further explain the pharmacological properties in Chinese medicine and make Rhodiola algida a very promising immunomodulating agent. 3atraditional medicine 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3abioactive properties 3ainterleukins 3alymphocytes 3aimmunomodulators 3amedicinal plants 3aRhodiola 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aplant extracts 3aimmune response 3aquality control 2aAdult 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCytokinesxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbal 2aFemale 2aGlucosidesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aImmunologic Factorsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInterleukinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMonocytesxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aPhenolsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxstandards. 2aRhodiolaxchemistry 2aTh1 Cellsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aTh2 Cellsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aYoung Adult 0acytokines 0aTh1 cells 0aTh2 cells 0aimmune system 0aRhodiola algida1 aSze, S.C.W.1 aTong, Y.1 aNg, T.B.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 June 22, v. 123, no. 2 p.257-266dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01558naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245007400168300001600242500017300258520038600431650002600817650001900843650001200862650001800874650002400892653002200916700001600938700001400954700001500968700001500983773009100998852000901089856005401098939003301152946001101185655001201196IND9304233120221121045343.0930719e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930423312DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.1992.319.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajada, J.P.10aAutomatic control of physical parameters in "in vitro" liquid culture  ap. 101-106.  aPaper presented at the "International Symposium on Transplant Production Systems: Biological, Engineering and Socioeconomic Aspects," July 21-26, 1992, Yokohama, Japan.  aA computerized "in vitro" liquid medium culture system has been developed, through a careful control of relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, frequency of irrigation in the vessel and ventilation, plants can be multiplied at rates that compare favourably with traditional methods, but they do not need an acclimation period and rooting takes place ex vitro. 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3atissue culture 3aliquids 3aculture media 3acomputer techniques 0aautomatic control1 aTames, R.S.1 aFal, M.A.1 aIbarra, R.1 aMateos, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g1992 Oct., , no. 319 p.101-106wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.1992.319.10  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02430naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008200165300001600247500002400263520140400287650001301691650002301704650001401727650001201741650002101753700002001774700001801794700001801812700002001830700001701850700001901867700001801886773010701904852000902011856004802020655001202068IND4414653220221121032708.0090105e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441465322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-008-0379-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReintamm, Tõnu10aSponge OAS has a distinct genomic structure within the 2-5A synthetase family  ap. 453-466.  aIncludes references  a2',5'-Oligoadenylate synthetases (2-5A synthetases, OAS) are enzymes that play an important role in the interferon-induced antiviral defense mechanisms in mammals. Sponges, the evolutionarily lowest multicellular animals, also possess OAS; however, their function is presently unclear. Low homology between primary structures of 2-5A synthetases from vertebrates and sponges renders their evolutionary relationship obscure. The genomic structure of vertebrate OASs has been thoroughly examined, making it possible to elucidate molecular evolution and expansion of this gene family. Until now, no OAS gene structure was available from sponges to compare it with the corresponding genes from higher organisms. In the present work, we determined the exon/intron structure of the OAS gene from the marine sponge Geodia cydonium and found it to be completely different from the strictly conserved exon/intron pattern of the OAS genes from vertebrates. This finding was corroborated by the analysis of OAS genes from another sponge, Amphimedon queenslandica, whose genome was recently sequenced. Our data suggest that vertebrate and sponge OAS genes have no direct common intron-containing ancestor and two (sub)types of OAS may be discriminated. This study opens new perspectives for understanding the phylogenesis and evolution of 2-5A synthetases as well as functional aspects of this multigene family. 3aAnimalia 3adefense mechanisms 3aevolution 3aligases 3amultigene family1 aKuusksalu, Anne1 aMetsis, Madis1 aPäri, Mailis1 aVallmann, Kerli1 aLopp, Annika1 aJustesen, Just1 aKelve, Merike0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2008 Nov., v. 280, no. 5 p.453-466dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-008-0379-5 7aarticle01690naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007500125300001600200500001500216520068400231650002800915650001500943650001400958650001600972650002000988650000901008650001301017650001601030650001301046653002401059653001201083653001301095700002001108700001301128773008501141852000901226930003301235945001301268946001101281655001201292IND2326775720221121032733.0020428e200106  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232677572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNassar, G.10aMonitoring of milk gelation using a low-frequency ultrasonic technique  ap. 351-359.  a2019-12-05  aA low-frequency ultrasonic device (50-100 kHz) in highly sharpened end sensors that behave as point sources was applied to explore the relations between the physical properties measured through the variation of the wave time-of-flight (transit time of wave) and structural changes during gel formation.

The present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of these flavonoids from Astragalus complanatus (FAC) on human hepatocarcinoma cell viability and apoptosis and to investigate its mechanisms of action in SMMC-7721 cells. Materials and methods: Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. To detect apoptotic cells, SMMC-7721 cells treated with FAC were stained with Hoechst 33258 and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantitative detection of apoptotic cells was performed by flow cytometry. The effects of FAC on apoptosis and cell cycle regulatory genes and proteins in SMMC-7721 cells were examined using an S series apoptosis and cell cycle gene array and Western blot analysis. Results: The growth of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells was inhibited by treatment with FAC. Cell death induced by FAC was characterized by nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, the cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 and S phases in FAC-treated SMMC-7721 cells. A sub-G1 peak with reduced DNA content was also formed. The activity of caspase-3 was significantly increased following FAC treatment. Microarray data indicated that the expression levels of 76 genes were changed in SMMC-7721 cells treated with FAC: 35 genes were up-regulated and 41 were down-regulated. Western blot analysis showed that caspase-3, caspase-8, Bax, P21, and P27 protein levels in SMMC-7721 cells were increased after 48h of FAC treatment, while cyclinB1, cyclinD1, CDK1, and CDK4 protein levels were decreased. Conclusions: These results suggest that FAC may play an important role in tumor growth suppression by inducing apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma cells via mitochondria-dependent and death receptor-dependent apoptotic pathways. 3amechanism of action 3aviability 3ahuman cell lines 3aAstragalus 3acell cycle 3ahepatoma 3aseeds 3acell growth 3acytotoxicity 3agene expression regulation 3amedicinal plants 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3aflavonoids 3acell proliferation 3aapoptosis 3ain vitro studies 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aAstragalus Plantxchemistry 2aBlotting, Western 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDNA Fragmentationxdrug effects 2aFlavonoidsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLiver Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aMitochondriaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aSeeds 0amedicinal properties 0aAstragalus complanatus1 aLiu, Chun-Yu1 aDu, Chong-Min1 aZhang, Jian1 aWu, Wen-Qian1 aGu, Zhen-Lun0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 June 22, v. 123, no. 2 p.293-301dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02266naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245017400166300001400340500017300354520097400527650002201501650001401523650002101537650001901558650001901577650001501596653001501611653002101626653001401647700001501661700002101676773008901697852000901786856005301795939003301848946001101881655001201892IND9304232320221121023930.0930719e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930423232DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.1992.319.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCournac, L.10aImprovement of photoautotrophic Solanum tuberosum plantlet culture by light and CO2 : Differential development of photosynthetic characteristics and varietal constraints  ap. 53-58.  aPaper presented at the "International Symposium on Transplant Production Systems: Biological, Engineering and Socioeconomic Aspects," July 21-26, 1992, Yokohama, Japan.  aBoth light (350 vs 80 μmol photons m-2 s-1) and CO2 (20000 vs 340 μL.L-1 CO2) stimulated growth of photoautotrophic cultures of Solanum tuberosum cv. Haig. CO2 enrichment had the strongest effect on fresh weight increase. Light stimulation of photosynthetic oxygen exchange was greater in plantlets grown in high light than in plantlets grown in low light. Cultivation in high light also stimulated protein content and Rubisco activity. In order to test if CO2 and light stimulation of photoautotrophic growth could be generalized, the behaviour of 28 cultivars of Solanum tuberosum has been studied. Eight cultivars bleached and died rapidly, six survived but grew slowly and fourteen grew well. Among the growing cultivars, three groups were distinguished. Growth response of plantlets was correlated to the development of photosynthetic carbon metabolism. The high light regime, stimulating growth of some cultivars (e.g. cv. Haig), was a stressor for some others. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acultivars 3ain vitro culture 3acarbon dioxide 3aphotosynthesis 3aautotrophs 0aenrichment 0aartificial light 0atreatment1 aCirier, I.1 aChagvardieff, P.0 tActa horticulturae.g1992 Oct., , no. 319 p.53-58wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.1992.319.2  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02074naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245009500172300001800267520096800285650001801253650001401271650001401285650002501299650001901324700002301343700002001366700002001386700002701406700002001433773013301453852000901586856008501595930003301680946001101713655001201724IND4433999420221121023947.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443399942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-009-0239-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoWangYin, Kiave-Yune 10aDifferent functional outcomes of intercellular membrane transfers to monocytes and T cells  ap. 1133-1145.  aTrogocytosis is the uptake of membranes from one cell by another. Trogocytosis has been demonstrated for monocytes, B cells, T cells, and NK cells. The acquisition of the tolerogenic molecule HLA-G by T cells and NK cells makes them behave as regulatory cells. We investigated here whether HLA-G, which is expressed by tumor cells in vivo, could be acquired by monocytes and if this transfer could have functional consequences. We demonstrate that resting, and even more so, activated monocytes efficiently acquire membrane-bound HLA-G from HLA-G tumor cells by trogocytosis. However, we demonstrate that HLA-G quickly disappears from the surface of the monocytes in contrast to the HLA-G acquired by T cells. Consequently, HLA-Gacq⁺ monocytes do not reliably inhibit the on-going proliferation of autologous activated T cells and do not inhibit their cytokine production. Thus, we show that the acquirer cell may control the functional outcome of trogocytosis. 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytokines 3amonocytes 3anatural killer cells 3aneoplasm cells1 aAlegre, Estibaliz 1 aDaouya, Marina 1 aFavier, Benoit 1 aCarosella, Edgardo D. 1 aLeMaoult, Joel 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 Apr., v. 67, no. 7 p.1133-1145dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-009-0239-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03542naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245012300188300001600311520179600327650000902123650000802132650001802140650001702158650002602175650001202201650001202213650001702225650001602242650001102258650002202269650001502291650001202306650001002318650001002328650001002338650001202348650001402360650001402374650001102388650001402399650001602413650002902429650002202458651001302480651001302493653003202506653002802538700002002566700002102586700002402607700001802631773012202649852000902771856009202780930003302872946001102905655001202916IND4415858820221121023902.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441585882DNAL7 a193021252pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01489.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, A.J.10aTrading offspring size for number in a variable environment: selection on reproductive investment in female Soay sheep  ap. 354-364.  a1. Given energetic constraints, female reproductive strategy is expected to be shaped by a trade-off between offspring size and offspring number, the optimal resolution of which may vary with environmental conditions. 2. We tested the hypothesis that selection will favour the production of larger litters, even at some expense to offspring size, under good conditions (and vice versa in harsh environments) using data from a long-term study of an unmanaged population of Soay sheep on the islands of St Kilda, NW Scotland. 3. Both litter size (which is either 1 or 2) and offspring birth weight are under positive selection through female annual fitness, but the strength of selection varies systematically with environmental conditions. Age effects were also detected, with selection weakening as female age increases. 4. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the selective trade-off between litter and offspring size is shifted in favour of the latter under poor environmental conditions. Thus, direct selection on offspring birth weight increases under harsh environmental conditions, particularly for females producing twins. 5. However, singletons are only favoured when environmental conditions are very poor, and offspring weight is constrained to be low. Thus, the current low incidence of twinning (13·5% of litters produced since 1985) appears to be suboptimal with respect to the empirically estimated selection regime. Thus, litter size, a trait known to be heritable, may be expected to evolve upwards in this population. 6. Our study highlights the necessity of incorporating environmental heterogeneity and age structure into analyses of natural selection, and suggests that the common assumption of optimality used in models of life history may sometimes be problematic. 3aSoay 3aage 3aage structure 3abirth weight 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3aislands 3alife history 3alitter size 3amodels 3anatural selection 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3asheep 3atwins 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aGeography 2aLitter Size 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSheepxphysiology 3aScotland 0aScotland 0aenvironmental heterogeneity 0aevolutionary constraint1 aPemberton, J.M.1 aPilkington, J.G.1 aClutton-Brock, T.H.1 aKruuk, L.E.B.0 tJournal of animal ecology.g2009 Mar., v. 78, no. 2 p.354-364dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01489.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02402naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245012800159300001800287520104200305650002001347650001101367650002501378650001401403650002501417650000901442650002001451650002301471650001701494650001601511700001701527700002001544700001801564700002001582700001901602700002401621700002201645700001801667773013301685852000901818856008501827930003301912946001101945655001201956IND4433999820221121012114.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443399982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-009-0247-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Ni 10aAccessibility of host cell lineages to medaka stem cells depends on genetic background and irradiation of recipient embryos  ap. 1189-1202.  aChimera formation is a powerful tool for analyzing pluripotency in vivo. It has been widely accepted that host cell lineages are generally accessible to embryonic stem (ES) cells with the actual contribution depending solely on the intrinsic pluripotency of transplanted donor cells. Here, we show in the fish medaka (Oryzias latipes) that the host accessibility to ES cell contribution exhibits dramatic differences. Specifically, of three albino host strains tested (i ¹ , i ³ and af), only strain i ¹ generated pigmented chimeras. Strikingly, this accessibility is completely lost in i ¹ but acquired in i ³ after host γ-irradiation. Host irradiation also differentially affected ES cell contribution to somatic organs and gonad. Therefore, the accessibility of various host cell lineages can vary considerably depending on host strains and cell lineages as well as on irradiation. Our findings underscore the importance of host genotypes for interpreting donor cell pluripotency and for improving ES-derived chimera production. 3aOryzias latipes 3aalbino 3acell differentiation 3achimerism 3aembryonic stem cells 3afish 3agamma radiation 3agenetic background 3ahost strains 3airradiation1 aLi, Mingyou 1 aZeng, Zhiqiang 1 aYi, Meisheng 1 aDeng, Jiaorong 1 aGui, Jianfang 1 aWinkler, Christoph 1 aSchartl, Manfred 1 aHong, Yunhan 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 Apr., v. 67, no. 7 p.1189-1202dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-009-0247-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03842naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001500176245014000191300001600331500002400347500001500371520165600386650002002042650002702062650001302089650001002102650003102112650001902143650002602162650001002188650002502198650002202223650003002245650002802275650001002303650001302313650002102326650001802347650003002365650002702395650001902422650001202441650004202453650001302495650002402508650007702532650005202609650004702661650003202708650001002740650004502750653001602795653001702811653001602828653001602844700002202860773009602882852000902978856008802987930003303075945002503108946001103133655001203144IND4420189020221121012450.0090508e20090528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018902DNAL7 a191714432pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aSong, Yong10aDevelopment of a multiplex qPCR for detection and quantitation of pathogenic intestinal spirochaetes in the faeces of pigs and chickens  ap. 129-136.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnaerobic intestinal spirochaetes of the genus Brachyspira include several important pathogenic species, particularly those infecting pigs and chickens. In this study a multiplex-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (M-qPCR) assay was developed based on amplification of a 198 base pair portion of the NADH oxidase gene, using TaqMan probes for detecting and quantifying the three main pathogenic species, B. hyodysenteriae, B. pilosicoli and B. intermedia. The specificity of the assay was validated using 130 spirochaete strains belonging to members of the seven officially named and two provisionally named Brachyspira species. The detection limit for all three targeted species was 1-10 viable cells and 10fg DNA per reaction. Further detection limit testing was conducted on porcine and chicken faecal specimens that were spiked with spirochaete cells before DNA extraction. The assay could detect 10² to 10³ cells per 0.2g of sample, giving an improved detection threshold compared to standard PCRs. The M-qPCR was further developed by incorporating a novel internal control (IC) that employed host cells as template DNA. This adaptation allowed monitoring of the quality of the extracted DNA and ensured that there was no inhibition of the PCR reaction. Use of the IC further improved the detection limits of the assay and increased confidence in being able to detect low numbers of pathogens in faecal samples. Taken together, the results indicate that the new M-qPCR assay is a valuable tool for detecting and quantifying low numbers of pathogenic intestinal spirochaetes in the faeces of pigs and chickens, and potentially other species. 3aenteropathogens 3aBrachyspira intermedia 3avalidity 3agenes 3aBrachyspira hyodysenteriae 3aswine diseases 3adifferential staining 3afeces 3abacterial infections 3adisease detection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apathogen identification 3aswine 3achickens 3apoultry diseases 3arapid methods 3adigestive system diseases 3aBrachyspira pilosicoli 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aBrachyspiraxisolation & purification 2aChickens 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGram-Negative Bacterial Infectionsxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 0amethodology 0aNADH oxidase 0aBrachyspira 0anew methods1 aHampson, David J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 May 28, v. 137, no. 1-2 p.129-136dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.12.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle04282naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001800183245010800201300001600309500002400325500001500349520174600364650001602110650001702126650001502143650001802158650001202176650002002188650002002208650002202228650002002250650001802270650001502288650002102303650002802324650002802352650002702380650002702407650002502434650002302459650002302482650002502505650002302530650002602553650001202579650003602591650004302627650001102670650004902681650005602730650002402786650003102810650007202841650005902913650001402972650002302986650002703009651001903036651001903055653002503074653001003099700001303109700001403122700002203136700001503158700001703173773009803190852000903288856008603297930003303383945002503416946001103441655001203452IND4415264420221120155608.0090123e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441526442DNAL7 a184718382pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aDolejská, M.10aAntimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli isolates in cattle and house sparrows on two Czech dairy farms  ap. 491-494.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRectal smears of calves, cows and young bulls, as well as cloacal smears of house sparrows (Passer domesticus), from farms at the villages of Šumice and Troskotovice, Czech Republic, were examined for E. coli resistant to 12 antimicrobials. The resistant isolates were tested for antimicrobial-resistance genes and integrons. Totals of 40% (n = 183), 3% (n = 95), 0% (n = 33), and 9% (n = 54) of Escherichia coli isolates from calves, cows, young bulls and house sparrows, respectively, were antimicrobial resistant. The following genes were identified in cattle E. coli isolates: tetA, tetB (isolates resistant to tetracycline), blaTEM (beta-lactams), strA, aadA (streptomycin), sul1, sul2 (sulphonamides), and cat, floR (chloramphenicol). Seven of 16 antimicrobial-resistant calf isolates from the Šumice farm possessed class 1 integrons with the aadA1 gene cassette integrated, 1 kb in size. On the Troskotovice farm, eight of 57 antimicrobial-resistant calf isolates possessed class 1 integrons. Integrons of 1.5 kb with the dhfr1- aadA1 gene cassette were found in four isolates, followed by a 1 kb integron with the aadA1 gene found in three isolates, and a 1.7 kb integron with the dhfr17-aadA5 gene cassette and the phenotype ASSuTSxtNaCipCCfG. The prevalence of resistant E. coli in calves compared to adult cattle was much higher and probably was influenced by oral antimicrobial usage in calves, feeding with milk and colostrum from treated cows, as well as mechanisms unrelated to antimicrobial drug selection. Although house sparrows lived together with the cattle and came into contact with cattle waste on the farm, they were not infected by resistant E. coli isolates with the same characteristics as those found in cattle. 3adairy herds 3adairy cattle 3awild birds 3abird diseases 3astrains 3adrug resistance 3acattle diseases 3aPasser domesticus 3arisk assessment 3adairy farming 3apathotypes 3aEscherichia coli 3aepidemiological studies 3apathogen identification 3amolecular epidemiology 3aEscherichia infections 3adisease surveillance 3adisease reservoirs 3adisease prevalence 3adisease transmission 3amolecular genetics 3aanti-infective agents 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxmicrobiology 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDairyingxstandards 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aIntegrons 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aSparrowsxmicrobiology 3aCzech Republic 0aCzech Republic 0aantimicrobial agents 0abirds1 aSenk, D.1 aCizek, A.1 aRybaříková, J.1 aSychra, O.1 aLiterák, I.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 Dec., v. 85, no. 3 p.491-494dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.03.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02454naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245011600146300001400262500009000276520146900366650001801835650001901853650001301872650004401885650002301929700002001952773009001972852000902062930003302071945002502104946001102129655001202140IND4368250820221120155602.0050407e20050225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436825082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

MacMillan.  aTyrosine radicals play catalytic roles in essential metalloenzymes. Their propertiesmidpoint potential, stability...o̲r environment varies considerably from one enzyme to the other. To understand the origin of these properties, the redox tyrosines are studied by a number of spectroscopic techniques, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy. An increasing number of vibrational data are reported for the (modified-) redox active tyrosines in ribonucleotide reductases, photosystem II, heme catalase and peroxidases, galactose and glyoxal oxidases, and cytochrome oxidase. The spectral markers for the tyrosinyl radicals have been recorded on models of (substituted) phenoxyl radicals, free or coordinated to metals. We review these vibrational data and present the correlations existing between the vibrational modes of the radicals and their properties and interactions formed with their environment: we present that the v7a(C-O) mode of the radical, observed both by RR and FTIR spectroscopy at 1480-1515 cm -1, is a sensitive marker of the hydrogen bonding status of (substituted)-phenoxyl and Tyr., while the v8a(C-C) mode may probe coordination of the Tyr. to a metal. For photosystem II, the information obtained by light-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy for the two redox tyrosines TyrD and TyrZ and their hydrogen bonding partners is discussed in comparison with those obtained by other spectroscopic methods. 3afree radicals 3aphotosynthesis 3atyrosine 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy1 aHienerwadel, R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2005 Feb. 25, v. 1707, no. 1 p.51-66x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050408b20050501c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/04/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02078naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245010100141300001600242520124100258650001901499650002201518653002001540700001601560700002001576700001501596773008701611852000901698930003301707945002501740946001101765655001201776IND4370403420221120155517.0050523e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437040342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLange, C.14aThe transient complex of poplar plastocyanin with cytochrome f: effects of ionic strength and pH  ap. 179-188.  aThe orientation of poplar plastocyanin in the complex with turnip cytochrome f has been determined by rigid-body calculations using restraints from paramagnetic NMR measurements. The results show that poplar plastocyanin interacts with cytochrome f with the hydrophobic patch of plastocyanin close to the heme region on cytochrome f and via electrostatic interactions between the charged patches on both proteins. Plastocyanin is tilted relative to the orientation reported for spinach plastocyanin, resulting in a longer distance between iron and copper (13.9 A). With increasing ionic strength, from 0.01 to 0.11 M, all observed chemical-shift changes decrease uniformly, supporting the idea that electrostatic forces contribute to complex formation. There is no indication for a rearrangement of the transient complex in this ionic strength range, contrary to what had been proposed earlier on the basis of kinetic data. By decreasing the pH from pH 7.7 to pH 5.5, the complex is destabilized. This may be attributed to the protonation of the conserved acidic patches or the copper ligand His87 in poplar plastocyanin, which are shown to have similar pKa values. The results are interpreted in a two-step model for complex formation. 3aphotosynthesis 3aelectron transfer 0aprotein complex1 aCornvik, T.1 aDiaz-Moreno, I.1 aUbbink, M.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2005 , v. 1707, no. 2-3 p.179-188x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050601b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/06/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03441naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245015100145300001400296520248100310650001802791650001902809650002002828653002702848700001502875700001502890700002002905700002102925773009102946852000903037930003303046945002503079946001103104655001203115IND4368011220221120150612.0050329e20050107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436801122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSchlodder, E.10aP700+- and 3P700-induced quenching of the fluorescence at 760 nm in trimeric photosystem I complexes from the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis  ap. 53-67.  aThe 5 K absorption spectrum of Photosystem I (PS I) trimers from Arthrospira platensis (old name: Spirulina platensis) exhibits long-wavelength antenna (exciton) states absorbing at 707 nm (called C707) and at 740 nm (called C740). The lowest energy state (C740) fluoresces around 760 nm (F760) at low temperature. The analysis of the spectral properties (peak position and line width) of the lowest energy transition (C740) as a function of temperature within the linear electron-phonon approximation indicates a large optical reorganization energy of approximately 110 cm(-1) and a broad inhomogeneous site distribution characterized by a line width of approximately 115 cm(-1). Linear dichroism (LD) measurements indicate that the transition dipole moment of the red-most state is virtually parallel to the membrane plane. The relative fluorescence yield at 760 nm of PS I with P700 oxidized increases only slightly when the temperature is lowered to 77 K, whereas in the presence of reduced P700 the fluorescence yield increases nearly 40-fold at 77 K as compared to that at room temperature (RT). A fluorescence induction effect could not be resolved at RT. At 77 K the fluorescence yield of PS I trimers frozen in the dark in the presence of sodium ascorbate decreases during illumination by about a factor of 5 due to the irreversible formation of P700(+)F(-)A/B in about 60% of the centers and the reversible accumulation of the longer-lived state P700(+)F(-)X. The quenching efficiency of different functionally relevant intermediate states of the photochemistry in PS I has been studied. The redox state of the acceptors beyond A0 does not affect F760. Direct kinetic evidence is presented that the fluorescence at 760 nm is strongly quenched not only by P700(+) but also by 3P700. Similar kinetics were observed for flash-induced absorbance changes attributed to the decay of 3P700 or P700(+), respectively, and flash-induced fluorescence changes at 760 nm measured under identical conditions. A nonlinear relationship between the variable fluorescence around 760 nm and the [P700red]/[P700total] ratio was derived from titration curves of the absorbance change at 826 nm and the variable fluorescence at 760 nm as a function of the redox potential imposed on the sample solution at room temperature before freezing. The result indicates that the energy exchange between the antennae of different monomers within a PS I trimer stimulates quenching of F760 by P700+. 3aCyanobacteria 3aphotosynthesis 3aenergy transfer 0afluorescence quenching1 aÇetin, M.1 aByrdin, M.1 aTerekhova, I.V.1 aKarapetyan, N.V.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2005 Jan. 7, v. 1706, no. 1-2 p.53-67x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/04/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03581naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001300181245006500194300001800259506007600277520133300353506003701686650002801723650001101751650002501762650001101787650002301798650001701821650002701838650002301865650001801888650002401906650001201930650001801942650006801960650006502028650001802093650002302111650002302134650001302157650003602170650001102206650002202217650002802239650003102267650004502298650001902343650003302362650003302395650004602428650001402474653001802488653003802506700001902544700001302563700001402576773014202590852000902732856008302741930003302824945001302857946001302870655001202883IND2047016820221207134248.0950727e19950703dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204701682DNAL7 a75415402pmid7 aPMC415262pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.14.64042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVita, C.10aScorpion toxins as natural scaffolds for protein engineering  ap. 6404-6408.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA compact, well-organized, and natural motif, stabilized by three disulfide bonds, is proposed as a basic scaffold for protein engineering. This motif contains 37 amino acids only and is formed by a short helix on one face and an antiparallel triple-stranded beta-sheet on the opposite face. It has been adopted by scorpions as a unique scaffold to express a wide variety of powerful toxic ligands with tuned specificity for different ion channels. We further tested the potential of this fold by engineering a metal binding site on it, taking the carbonic anhydrase site as a model. By chemical synthesis we introduced nine residues, including three histidines, as compared to the original amino acid sequence of the natural charybdotoxin and found that the new protein maintains the original fold, as revealed by CD and 1H NMR analysis. Cu2+ ions are bound with Kd = 4.2 X 10(-8) M and other metals are bound with affinities in an order mirroring that observed in carbonic anhydrase. The alpha/beta scorpion motif, small in size, easily amenable to chemical synthesis, highly stable, and tolerant for sequence mutations represents, therefore, an appropriate scaffold onto which polypeptide sequences may be introduced in a predetermined conformation, providing an additional means for design and engineering of small proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeiurus quinquestriatus 3atoxins 3aamino acid sequences 3acopper 3achemical reactions 3apolypeptides 3amolecular conformation 3asynthetic peptides 3abinding sites 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aCarbonic Anhydrasesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCarrier Proteinsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCharybdotoxin 2aCircular Dichroism 2aCopperxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMetals 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPeptidesxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aPoint Mutation 2aProtein Engineeringxmethods 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aScorpion Venomsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aScorpions 0acharybdotoxin 0asynthetic metal binding sequences1 aRoumestand, C.1 aToma, F.1 aMenez, A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 July 3, v. 92, no. 14 p.6404-6408x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.14.64043Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03121naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001200181245009400193300001800287500001500305506007600320520086000396506003701256650002001293650002201313650001701335650002301352650002901375650002001404650002001424650002501444650001901469650001101488650002801499650002101527650001201548650001601560650002501576650006001601650003101661650003001692650002001722650003001742650003101772650005001803650002401853650004601877650003801923650002401961650002601985653001302011653001702024653003302041653001702074700001802091700002002109773014302129852000902272856008302281930003302364945001302397946001302410655001202423IND2047280020221207134245.0950814e19950718dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204728002DNAL7 a76243652pmid7 aPMC414662pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.15.70362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeh, E.10aGreen fluorescent protein as a vital marker and reporter of gene expression in Drosophila  ap. 7036-3040.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have used the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria as a vital marker/reporter in Drosophila melanogaster.

Here, we show that GFP could be detected in freshly dissected ovaries, imaginal discs, and the larval nervous system without prior fixation or the addition of substrates or antibodies.

This phenomenon, known as cytoplasmic incompatibility, also occurs between strains infected by different symbionts in some species, including Drosophila simulans. Wolbachia was found in two species closely related to D. simulans, Drosophila mauritiana, and Drosophila sechellia, and shown to cause incompatibility in the latter species but not in D. mauritiana. Comparison of bacterial and mtDNA history clarifies the origins of bacterial and incompatibility polymorphisms in D. simulans. Infection in D. mauritiana is probably the result of introgression of an infected D. simulans cytoplasm. Some D. simulans and D. sechellia cytoplasmic lineages harbor two bacteria as a consequence of a double infection which probably occurred in a common ancestor. The descendant symbionts in each species are associated with similar incompatibility relationships, which suggests that little variation of incompatibility types has occurred within maternal lineages beyond that related to the density of symbionts in their hosts.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila simulans 3aWolbachia 3aDrosophila mauritiana 3asymbiosis 3asymbionts 3aribosomal DNA 3acrossing 3anucleotide sequences 3aDrosophila sechellia 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aDrosophilaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRickettsiaceaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosis 0aincompatibility 0aspeciation 0agenbank/x80978 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x80979 0agenbank/x80977 0aDrosophila1 aSolignac, M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 July 3, v. 92, no. 14 p.6389-6393x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.14.63893Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03571naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002100170245014100191300001600332500002400348500001500372520193800387650002502325650001502350650002302365650002802388650002302416650001002439650002202449650001502471650001002486650001202496650001902508650000902527650001802536650001302554650001102567653000902578653002402587653002102611653002102632700001502653700001602668700002202684700001402706773011502720852000902835856009202844930003302936945002502969946001102994655001203005IND4420186320221120130031.0090508e20090512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2008.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aFerreira, L.M.M.10aDifferences between domestic herbivores species in alkane faecal recoveries and the accuracy of subsequent estimates of diet composition  ap. 128-142.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study aimed to evaluate effects of animal species on faecal recovery of n-alkane markers. In addition, impacts of using different sets of alkane faecal recoveries on diet composition estimates was assessed. Six mature crossbred mares (383±59kg live weight (LW)), six adult cows (500±72kg LW) of Asturiana de los Valles breed, eight Cashmere does (29±5kg LW) and eight crossbreed ewes (30±5kg LW) were used. Animals were housed in individual stalls and randomly assigned to one of two diets composed of herbage (D1) or herbage plus heather (D2) (3 animals per diet in the equine and cattle groups and 4 animals per diet in the goat and sheep groups). Diet composition was estimated from alkane concentrations (i.e., C₂₅-C₃₃) in diets and faeces by least-squares procedures. Alkane faecal recovery (AFR) was incomplete and increased (P<0.001) linearly with carbon chain length in all animal species. Animal species had an effect on faecal recovery of all alkanes, with equines having the highest recovery and goats the lowest. Differences in AFR between equines and ruminant species were higher for the shorter chain alkanes and tended to decrease with increased of carbon chain length. Within ruminant species, cattle had, in general, the highest faecal recovery for all alkanes indicating a lower level of disappearance of these markers in the digestive tract of cattle. The AFR set used in diet composition calculations affected (P<0.05) the estimated proportions of all plant species in both diets. Utilization of uncorrected faecal alkane concentrations (AFR0) provided the poorest estimates of diet composition, and use of mean faecal recovery data of the dietary treatment (AFR1) yielded the most accurate. Results show that application of a general set of alkane faecal recoveries (AFR2) results in estimates of diet composition which distinguish less well between diet components with similar alkane profiles. 3achemical composition 3aestimation 3aruminant nutrition 3ainterspecific variation 3aexperimental diets 3asheep 3achemical analysis 3aherbivores 3afeces 3aalkanes 3aanimal feeding 3acows 3adigestibility 3aaccuracy 3ahorses 0adiet 0aspecies differences 0adiet composition 0adomestic animals1 aCelaya, R.1 aGarcía, U.1 aRodrigues, M.A.M.1 aOsoro, K.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 May 12, v. 151, no. 1-2 p.128-142dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2008.11.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03070naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001800137245009400155300001600249500002400265520159100289650001801880650002301898650001301921650001901934650001501953650001901968650001601987650001502003650001602018650002202034650002102056650001302077650002902090650002802119650005002147651002902197651002402226700001502250700001402265773013102279852000902410856007402419930003302493945002502526946001302551655001202564IND4415279620221120110626.0090123s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF100 0aX620 0aX1001 aMcCarty, J.L.12aA Hybrid Remote Sensing Approach to Quantifying Crop Residue Burning in the United States  ap. 515-527.  aIncludes references  aCrop residue burning is an important land use activity in the United States. Currently, satellite-based burned area methodologies specifically calibrated for crop residue burning are limited. This article describes a satellite observations-based hybrid approach to estimate the amount of burned crop residues that combines Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day differencing of Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) burned area mapping with MODIS active fire counts calibrated into area. The dNBR approach utilizes the spectral response of the 2.1- micrometer shortwave infrared MODIS band to detect burned pixels. A time series of 8-day MODIS composites produces burned area estimates during harvest on a near-weekly scale. This approach was tested on the study area of MODIS tile h10v05, which encompasses much of the Mississippi River Delta and the southern Great Plains, for the years 2003 through 2006. Within this area, an average of 12,700 and 10,835 km 2 burned in the spring and fall harvests, respectively. Results from the hybrid approach are validated through comparison with high-resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and field data. Validation of the hybrid approach shows strong correspondence with both the ASTER (mean R 2 = 0.92) and in-situ data (mean accuracy 85.5%). At the state level, the estimated burn rates from this analysis compare well with reported Arkansas burn rates. Results suggest potential for using the approach to monitor and quantify fire activity in cropland areas of the United States. 3acrop residues 3aprescribed burning 3aland use 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aimage analysis 3acalibration 3aestimation 3acartography 3aspectral analysis 3amodel validation 3aaccuracy 3aenvironmental monitoring 3acrop residue management 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aMississippi Delta region 3aGreat Plains region1 aLoboda, T.1 aTrigg, S.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2008, v. 24, no. 4 p.515-527dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/12  aOther US 7aarticle03062naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001900188245007300207300001600280500002400296520179600320650002102116650001002137650001702147650001402164650002002178650002902198650002002227650001402247650001202261650001902273700001902292700002502311773011002336852000902446856009202455930003302547945002502580946001102605655001202616IND4415282620221120110608.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441528262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01586.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aF900 0aX100 0aX7501 aRout, Tracy M.10aUsing sighting records to declare eradication of an invasive species  ap. 110-117.  aIncludes references  a1. A major challenge for eradication managers is deciding when a programme can be deemed successful. Regan et al. (2006) were the first to pose this problem within a decision theory framework, minimizing the net expected cost of the decision. The optimal time to declare eradication was based on the number of consecutive surveys in which the species was not found ('absent surveys'). Their formulation used estimates of detectability and persistence - parameters that are often difficult to estimate - to calculate the probability that the invasive species is still present. 2. Here we use a similar decision-making framework but instead predict presence based on the pattern of sightings, using a method developed by Solow (1993a) that assumes a constant sighting rate. This method does not require estimates of detectability and persistence. We find the number of absent surveys after which eradication should be declared, using three approaches: a stochastic dynamic program, which finds the exact optimal solution, a rule of thumb, and an approximation. We then compare these results with a method assuming a declining sighting rate. 3. Both the rule of thumb and approximation give results that are close to the exact optimal solution. The rule of thumb with the declining sighting rate method generally gives a larger optimal number of absent surveys. 4. Synthesis and applications. Analysing this problem within a decision theory framework enables us to minimize the expected cost of declaring eradication. By using the more readily available sighting data, we make this framework applicable to a wider range of invasive species. Our approximation is a simple calculation, making it an accessible tool that could be applied by managers of eradication programmes for invasive species. 3ainvasive species 3aweeds 3aweed control 3adetection 3aBayesian theory 3adecision support systems 3adecision making 3aequations 3asurveys 3aeconomic costs1 aSalomon, Yacov1 aMcCarthy, Michael A.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2009 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.110-117dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01586.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02919naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001700181245006400198300001800262506007600280520100900356506003701365650002901402650002101431650002701452650002501479650001801504650002401522650001201546650004401558650002301602650004301625650003701668650001101705650004501716650000901761650002801770650004401798650004801842650005201890650003401942650002801976653001702004700002202021700001702043773014202060852000902202856008302211930003302294945001302327946001302340655001202353IND2047396020221207135530.0950818e19950801dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204739602DNAL7 a76382242pmid7 aPMC413722pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.16.75252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDingwall, C.12aA family of Ran binding proteins that includes nucleoporins  ap. 7525-7529.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRan, a small nuclear GTP binding protein, is essential for the translocation of nuclear proteins through the nuclear pore complex. We show that several proteins, including the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nup2p and Caenorhabditis elegans F59A2.1 nucleoporins, contain domains similar to the previously characterized murine Ran binding protein (RBP, termed RBP1). To test the significance of this similarity, we have used the corresponding domains of Nup2p and a putative S. cerevisiae RBP in Ran binding assays and the yeast two-hybrid system. Both proteins bind S. cerevisiae Ran, but only the putative S. cerevisiae RBP binds human Ran. Two-hybrid analysis revealed Ran-Ran interactions and that yeast and human Rans can interact. These data identify Nup2p as a target for Ran in the nuclear pore complex, suggesting a direct role for it in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. We discuss the possibility that proteins harboring Ran binding domains link the Ran GTPase cycle to specific functions in the nucleus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abinding proteins 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aran GTP-Binding Protein 0ainteractions1 aKandels-Lewis, S.1 aSeraphin, B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 1, v. 92, no. 16 p.7525-7529x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.16.75253Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03339naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001300181245010500194300001800299500001500317506007600332520143100408506003701839650004501876650001201921650001901933650001401952650001101966650002201977650001501999650001302014650002202027650003202049650003402081650002002115650002502135650003602160650002102196650001502217650001402232650001802246650001502264650002402279653001902303653002102322653003602343700002202379700001302401700001702414773014302431852000902574856008302583930003302666945001302699946001302712655001202725IND2047648820221207135103.0950908e19950815dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204764882DNAL7 a76444832pmid7 aPMC412172pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.17.77192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, K.10aRapid genome change in synthetic polyploids of Brassica and its implications for polyploid evolution  ap. 7719-7723.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough the evolutionary success of polyploidy in higher plants has been widely recognized, there is virtually no information on how polyploid genomes have evolved after their formation. In this report, we used synthetic polyploids of Brassica as a model system to study genome evolution in the early generations after polyploidization. The initial polyploids we developed were completely homozygous, and thus, no nuclear genome changes were expected in self-fertilized progenies. However, extensive genome change was detected by 89 nuclear DNA clones used as probes. Most genome changes involved loss and/or gain of parental restriction fragments and appearance of novel fragments. Genome changes occurred in each generation from F2 to F5, and the frequency of change was associated with divergence of the diploid parental genomes. Genetic divergence among the derivatives of synthetic polyploids was evident from variation in genome composition and phenotypes. Directional genome changes, possibly influenced by cytoplasmic-nuclear interactions, were observed in one pair of reciprocal synthetics. Our results demonstrate that polyploid species can generate extensive genetic diversity in a short period of time. The occurrence and impact of this process in the evolution of natural polyploids is unknown, but it may have contributed to the success and diversification of many polyploid lineages in both plants and animals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ahybrids 3aBrassica nigra 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenetic variation 3apolyploidy 3agenomics 3aBrassica oleracea 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3agenetic markers 2aBiological Evolution 2aBrassicaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA Probes 2aFertility 2aGenome, Plant 2aPolyploidy 2aRestriction Mapping 0agenetic change 0agenome evolution 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris1 aLu, Ponzy,d1942-1 aTang, K.1 aOsborn, T.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 15, v. 92, no. 17 p.7719-7723x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.17.77193Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02971naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001200181245009200193300001800285506007600303520088400379506003701263650002901300650002501329650000801354650002101362650002901383650001801412650001801430650001801448650002301466650004001489650002501529650004401554650003901598650003001637650002301667650002801690650003001718650003001748650002401778650004101802650003801843650003801881650002701919653001701946653002501963653002801988700001602016700001902032773014302051852000902194856008302203930003302286945001302319946001302332655001202345IND2047648720221207135046.0950908e19950815dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204764872DNAL7 a76444762pmid7 aPMC412082pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.17.76772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, He.12aA single GAL4 dimer can maximally activate transcription under physiological conditions  ap. 7677-7680.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMost eukaryotic promoters contain multiple binding sites for one or more transcriptional activators that interact in a synergistic manner. A common view is that synergism is a manifestation of the need for many contacts between activators and the general transcription machinery that a single activator presumably cannot fulfill. In this model, various combinations of protein-protein interactions control the level of gene expression. However, we show here that under physiological conditions, a single binding site and presumably binding of a single dimer of the prototypical yeast activator GAL4 can activate transcription to the maximum possible level in vivo. Synergistic effects in this natural system are shown to be consistent with cooperative DNA binding. These results point to DNA occupancy as the major element in fine tuning gene expression in the galactose regulon.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aDNA 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 3abinding sites 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aModels, Structural 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotides 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 0ainteractions 0atranscription factor 0acooperative dna binding1 aKodadek, T.1 aJohnston, S.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 15, v. 92, no. 17 p.7677-7680x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.17.76773Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03890naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100002500188245009700213300001600310500002400326520247100350650002102821650002202842650001102864650001302875650002502888650002002913650002402933651000902957700002502966700002102991700002503012700002403037700002203061700002403083700002103107773011003128852000903238856009203247930003303339945002503372946001103397655001203408IND4415282820221120095416.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441528282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01591.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aL820 0aL300 0aX1001 aTyrrell, Claudine L.10aEvaluation of trap capture in a geographically closed population of brown treesnakes on Guam  ap. 128-135.  aIncludes references  a1. Open population mark-recapture analysis of unbounded populations accommodates some types of closure violations (e.g. emigration, immigration). In contrast, closed population analysis of such populations readily allows estimation of capture heterogeneity and behavioural response, but requires crucial assumptions about closure (e.g. no permanent emigration) that are suspect and rarely tested empirically. 2. In 2003, we erected a double-sided barrier to prevent movement of snakes in or out of a 5-ha semi-forested study site in northern Guam. This geographically closed population of >100 snakes was monitored using a series of transects for visual searches and a 13 x 13 trapping array, with the aim of marking all snakes within the site. Forty-five marked snakes were also supplemented into the resident population to quantify the efficacy of our sampling methods. We used the program mark to analyse trap captures (101 occasions), referenced to census data from visual surveys, and quantified heterogeneity, behavioural response, and size bias in trappability. Analytical inclusion of untrapped individuals greatly improved precision in the estimation of some covariate effects. 3. A novel discovery was that trap captures for individual snakes consisted of asynchronous bouts of high capture probability lasting about 7 days (ephemeral behavioural effect). There was modest behavioural response (trap happiness) and significant latent (unexplained) heterogeneity, with small influences on capture success of date, gender, residency status (translocated or not), and body condition. 4. Trapping was shown to be an effective tool for eradicating large brown treesnakes Boiga irregularis (>900 mm snout-vent length, SVL). 5. Synthesis and applications. Mark-recapture modelling is commonly used by ecological managers to estimate populations. However, existing models involve making assumptions about either closure violations or response to capture. Physical closure of our population on a landscape scale allowed us to determine the relative importance of covariates influencing capture probability (body size, trappability periods, and latent heterogeneity). This information was used to develop models in which different segments of the population could be assigned different probabilities of capture, and suggests that modelling of open populations should incorporate easily measured, but potentially overlooked, parameters such as body size or condition. 3ainvasive species 3aBoiga irregularis 3asnakes 3atrapping 3aprobability analysis 3aanimal behavior 3amathematical models 3aGuam1 aChristy, Michelle T.1 aRodda, Gordon H.1 aYackel Adams, Amy A.1 aEllingson, Aaron R.1 aSavidge, Julie A.1 aDean-Bradley, Kathy1 aBischof, Richard0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2009 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.128-135dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01591.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/04/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02444naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002200167245007700189300001600266500002400282520116400306650002201470650001601492650001401508650001601522650001801538650002801556650002101584650001901605650002301624650001601647650001101663650001701674650001201691650002601703773010201729852000901831856008901840930003301929945002501962946001101987655001201998IND4420184120221120085902.0090508e20090617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442018412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2009.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aF6001 aBaninasab, Bahram10aAmelioration of chilling stress by paclobutrazol in watermelon seedlings  ap. 144-148.  aIncludes references  aPaclobutrazol (PBZ) is a member of the triazole plant-growth inhibitor group that is responsible for inducing tolerance to number of biotic and abiotic stresses. An experiment was, therefore, conducted to test whether PBZ application at various concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 75mgL⁻¹) through seed soaking or foliar spray would protect watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) seedlings, subjected to chilling stress. Thirty-five-day old plants were exposed to chilling 5h/day at 4°C for 5 days. PBZ improved growth rate of watermelon seedling subjected to chilling stress and increased relative leaf chlorophyll content (RLCC) and chlorophyll fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm) compared with the control at the end of chilling stress. PBZ ameliorated the injury caused by chilling stress by inhibiting increases in proline and leaf electrolyte leakage, which suggested that PBZ ameliorated the negative effect of chilling stress. PBZ was most effective in increased chilling tolerance of watermelon seedling when applied using the seed soak method than as a foliar spray.

Recently, this protein has been shown to be a catalase whose enzymatic activity is inhibited by SA binding. We have proposed that the resulting increase in intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species plays a role in the induction of defense responses such as PR protein gene expression. Here we report that INA, like SA, binds the SA-binding protein/catalase and inhibits its enzymatic activity. In fact, the dose-response curves for inhibition of catalase by these two compounds are similar. Furthermore, the ability of both INA analogues and SA derivatives to bind and inhibit tobacco catalase correlates with their biological activity to induce PR-1 gene expression and enhance resistance to tobacco mosaic virus. Comparison of the structures of INA, SA, and their analogues reveals several common features that appear to be important for biological activity. Thus, these results not only suggest that INA and SA share the same mechanism of action that involves binding and inhibition of catalase but also further indicate an important role for reactive oxygen species in the induction of certain plant defense responses. This is supported by the demonstration that INA-mediated PR-1 gene activation is suppressed by antioxidants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana tabacum 3asalicylic acid 3aniacin 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aenzyme activity 3acatalase 3abinding proteins 3adisease resistance 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3adefense mechanisms 3aantioxidants 3apathogenesis-related proteins 0ainhibition 0aderivatives 0aanalogs 0asalicylic acid binding protein1 aChen, Z.X.1 aRicigliano, J.R.1 aKlessig, D.F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 1, v. 92, no. 16 p.7143-7147x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.16.71433Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01311naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007600164300001600240500002800256520029200284650000900576650002100585653001800606653001400624700002200638700001800660700002100678773019300699852000900892856008500901946001100986655001200997IND4414583220090207004705.0090105s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441458322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10517-008-0111-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShreder, O.

Structurally related proteins of 145 and 143 kDa copurify with a soluble chloroplast processing enzyme (CPE) that cleaves the precursor for the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein and have been implicated in the maturation of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and acyl carrier protein. The 145- and 143-kDa proteins have not been found as a heterodimer and thus may represent functionally independent isoforms encoded by separate genes. Here we describe the primary structure, of a 140-kDa polypeptide encoded by cDNAs isolated by using antibodies raised against the 145/143-kDa doublet. The 140-kDa polypeptide contains a transit peptide, and strikingly, a His-Xaa-Xaa-Glu-His zinc-binding motif that is conserved in a recently recognized family of metalloendopeptidases, which includes Escherichia coli protease III, insulin-degrading enzyme, and subunit beta of the mitochondrial processing peptidase. Identity of 25-30%, concentrated near the N terminus of the 140-kDa polypeptide, is found with these proteases. Expression of CPE in leaves is not light dependent. Indeed, transcripts are present in dark-grown plants, and the 145/143-kDa doublet and proteolytic activity are both found in etioplasts, as well as in root plastids. Thus, CPE appears to be a necessary component of the import machinery in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues, and it may function as a general stromal processing peptidase in plastids.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPisum sativum 3acomplementary DNA 3aproteinases 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aproteolysis 3aplant proteins 3achloroplasts 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aMetalloendopeptidasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Structure 2aMolecular Weight 2aPeasxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aProtein Precursorsxmetabolism 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aZincxmetabolism 0aprecursors 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u251111 aBennett, T.M.1 aOblong, J.E.1 aLamppa, G.K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 1, v. 92, no. 16 p.7177-7181x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.16.71773Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02444naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245014000166300001800306520111800324650001601442650001501458650001101473650001601484650002001500650002101520650002501541650002001566650002201586650002601608650002901634650001501663700002601678700003501704700002101739773013601760852000901896856008501905930003301990946001102023655001202034IND4434014220221120073004.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443401422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-009-3445-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampàs, Monica.10aColorimetric and electrochemical phosphodiesterase inhibition assays for yessotoxin detection: development and comparison with LC-MS/MS  ap. 2321-2330.  aThis work describes the development and applicability of two functional assays for the detection of yessotoxin (YTX), a polycyclic ether marine toxin produced by dinoflagellates. The assays are based on the interaction between this toxin and the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme and the subsequent measurement of the enzyme activity by colorimetric and electrochemical methods. Firstly, several enzyme substrates were tested in order to select those able to be detected by colorimetry or electrochemistry after enzymatic hydrolysis. The substrates that provided the highest absorbance values and density currents were p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate and α-naphthyl phosphate, respectively. After optimisation of the experimental parameters, limits of detection of 0.8 and 0.6 µM were attained by colorimetry and electrochemistry, respectively. An inhibitory effect of YTX on the PDE activity was observed. The assays have been applied to the analysis of YTX production by Protoceratium reticulatum cultures, and results were compared with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

The action of cathepsin D on troponin T was examined at various pHs (pH 4.0-6.5). The degradation of intact troponin T was observed at pH 4.0, but not observed at pH 5.5 and 6.5. As a result of the degradation of troponin T, the 30 kDa fragment was not generated in any pH condition. The action of the crude cathepsins on troponin T was also examined at various pHs (pH 4.0-6.5). The intact troponin T was degraded at pH 4.0 and the 30 kDa fragments were observed. These 30 kDa fragments disappeared during further incubation. On the other hand, at pH 5.5 and 6.5, the intact troponin T was degraded and the 30 kDa fragment was accumulated. These results suggested that the cathepsin D scarcely contributed to the degradation of troponin T during postmortem aging, but crude cathepsins containing cathepsins B and L were partially involved in the degradation of troponin T and the generation of 30 kDa fragments. 3acathepsin B 3acathepsin D 3ameat aging 3amuscles 3apH 3aswine 3atroponin T 2aAnimals 2aCathepsinsxpharmacology 2aMeat 2aPostmortem Changes 2aSwinexphysiology 2aTroponin Txmetabolism 0a30 kDa fragment 0apostmortem aging 0atroponin T degradation1 aKudo, Kazuyuki1 aChikuni, Koichi1 aWatanabe, Itaru1 aNishimura, Toshihide0 tAnimal science journal =.g2010 Aug., v. 81, no. 4 p.501-505dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2010.00756.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120413b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03339naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165100001900182245015500201300001600356520137600372592002801748650002301776650000901799650001801808650001601826650001601842650002001858650002201878650002501900650002001925650001201945650002101957650001201978650004401990650000902034650004502043650004502088650002802133650003502161650000902196650001702205653003102222653003102253653002302284700001702307700001502324700001502339700001602354700002102370773013502391852000902526856008602535930003302621945002502654946001102679990002302690655001202713IND4375208720221120054409.0051014e20050701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437520872DNAL7 a162293422pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.75.4.2572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Neutrophil enzymes are important in invasion, inflammation, and infection processes. In order to understand the basic effects of protein malnutrition on neutrophils we studied matrix metalloproteinases 8 and 9 (MMP-8 and MMP-9) production in severe quantitative and qualitative protein malnutrition in rats. Wistar rats (2 months old) were divided into four groups each with three subgroups and fed various protein-containing diets (24% protein, 20% gelatin-containing and N-free) for 7, 14, 21, and/or 28 days. Neutrophil enzyme expression was determined by Western blotting. Leukocytes decreased significantly due to malnutrition (p = 0.001) whilst the percentage of neutrophils increased (p = 0.02) in protein-deprived groups. Neutrophils of malnourished rats produced lower levels of MMP-8 at early stages of protein deprivation with an increase in the following weeks. MMP-9 production by neutrophils from N-free diet fed animals was highest after one week. Serum MMP-9 levels decreased in the qualitative but not in the quantitative protein malnutrition groups. Results suggest that neutrophils might be important in reuse of body cell proteins during fasting or malnutrition conditions and dietary manipulation might have profound effects on MMP-8 and -9 production in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametalloproteinases 3arats 3aanimal models 3akwashiorkor 3aneutrophils 3aenzyme activity 3aprotein synthesis 3anutrition physiology 3adietary protein 3agelatin 3adisease severity 2aAnimals 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aMale 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 8xbiosynthesis 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 9xbiosynthesis 2aNeutrophilsxenzymology 2aProtein Deficiencyxenzymology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0amatrix metalloproteinase 8 0amatrix metalloproteinase 9 0anitrogen free diet1 aBalkaya,  M.1 aUnsal,  C.1 aUnsal,  H.1 aKargin,  F.1 aChikanza,  I.

Efforts to satisfy ever more demanding markets appear to be associated with increased chain coordination, yet the relationship between these two factors is unclear. This research addresses the factors that affect chain coordination, focusing on the management of business processes to meet product specifications for customers. Five fresh meat New Zealand chains were the focus of multiple case study research. Results suggest that chains use different strategies and coordination mechanisms to deliver desired product specifications. More important, while product specifications are related to chain coordination as expected, the relationship is mediated by the coordination differential--the type and amount of effort that firms employ in their business processes to achieve the desired specifications. The nature and implication of the coordination differential concept are discussed.

Experimental animals (n = 32) were divided into four groups as control, exercised, supplemented, and supplemented + exercise. Four-week antioxidant supplementation (vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc) was applied to experimental animals. Following acute exercise on a motor-driven rodent treadmill, erythrocyte aggregation and deformability, erythrocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase activities of the erythrocytes were analyzed. In both supplemented and non-supplemented exercised groups, there was a significant decrease in SOD activities and erythrocyte aggregation, and an increase in adhesion to endothelial cell although there was no change on erythrocyte deformability. There were no differences in the responses to the exercise of supplemented and non-supplemented rats. The data suggested that high-dose antioxidant supplementation did not alter the effects of acute exercise on erythrocyte membrane mechanics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aenzyme activity 3aexercise 3arats 3aanimal models 3aerythrocytes 3acell adhesion 3aendothelial cells 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3adose response 3aplasma membrane 3adeformation 3azinc 3avitamin E 3aascorbic acid 3avitamin-mineral supplements 3anutrition physiology 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aCell Adhesionxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aCoculture Techniques 2aDietary Supplements 2aEndothelium, Vascularxcytologyxenzymology. 2aErythrocyte Aggregationxdrug effects 2aErythrocyte Membranexmetabolism 2aMale 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animal 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism1 aUysal,  N.1 aResmi,  H.1 aBediz,  C.

A group of rats received AIN-93G diet devoid of vitamin A (AD) and three other groups were treated with AD diet supplied with synthetic beta-carotene (beta-car) or malanga leaf powder (MP) or malanga carotenoids extract (CE). The diets’ carotenoids bioavailability was determined through carotenoids intake/liver retinol content. Lipid thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein (carbonyl) oxidation, and reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione concentrations were determined in liver, heart, and brain. Synthetic beta-carotene bioavailability was higher than that of pro-vitamin A carotenoids from MP and CE diets, and no difference was observed between the latter two groups. Liver and heart lipid peroxidation was lower in the beta-car and CE groups than the AD group, while no difference was observed for the MP group. The beta-car, MP, and CE groups showed lower liver protein oxidation than the AD group, and only the CE group had lower heart protein oxidation in relation to AD. The MP group had a lower liver GSSG concentration and higher GSH/GSSG ratio than the AD group, while no difference was observed for heart glutathione concentration among the groups. The results indicate that at physiological levels, beta-car, malanga carotenoids extract, and malanga leaf powder have antioxidant effects in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXanthosoma sagittifolium 3acarbonyl compounds 3aglutathione 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3alipid peroxidation 3abrain 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3abeta-carotene 3arats 3apowders 3aheart 3avitamin A 3aantioxidant activity 3aleaves 3aprotective effect 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aEating 2aGlutathionexanalysis 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMale 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aProteinsxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aVitamin Axanalysis 2aXanthosomaxchemistry 0acarotenoids1 aSouza,  E.

The urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentration was low in the –betaC•AsA and +AsA groups but high in the +betaC. AsA, +Ka, and +Po groups. The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in both the liver and skin were higher in the –betaC•AsA group than in the +betaC•AsA group and were low in the +Ka and +Po groups. As antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity was high in the +betaC•AsA group, low in the –betaC•AsA group in both the skin and liver, and also high in the + Ka and +Po group in the liver. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was high in the –betaC•AsA group and low in the +betaC•AsA and +Ka groups in both the skin and liver. Catalase (CAT) activity in the liver was low in the –betaC•AsA, + AsA, and +betaC groups and high in the +betaC•AsA and + Po groups. These results confirmed that the administration of betaC, AsA, and persimmons and pods increases antioxidative ability in the skin and liver of ultraviolet-b(UV-B)-irradiated ODS rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3avitamin metabolism 3aurine 3anutrition physiology 3aoxidative stress 3abeta-carotene 3apowders 3aguanosine 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avitamin supplements 3avitamin deficiencies 3arats 3aenzyme activity 3aantioxidant activity 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aascorbic acid 3apods 3aliver 3acatalase 3apersimmons 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aanimal models 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aAscorbic Acidxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDiospyros 2aFruit 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aPlant Preparationsxadministration & dosage 2aRats 2aSkinxmetabolism 2aThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substancesxmetabolism 2aUltraviolet Raysxadverse effects 2abeta Carotenexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 0askin 0a8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine1 aYoshida, M.,1 aKitagawa,  M.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2005 July 1, v. 75, no. 4 p.227-234dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.75.4.2273Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/11/14  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03843naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001700181245011100198300001800309506007600327520151600403506003701919650000901956650001201965650002301977650002202000650002302022650001702045650001602062650001802078650002002096650002002116650001002136650001402146650001702160650002802177650001602205650002002221650002002241650001202261650003402273650001802307650003302325650001602358650003402374650004402408650000902452650002802461650001402489650004102503650004202544650001202586653001402598653002302612653002502635700001902660700001802679700001202697700001702709700001502726700001702741700002102758773014302779852000902922856008302931930003303014945001303047946001303060655001203073IND2047959120221207133039.0950926e19950829dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204795912DNAL7 a76673152pmid7 aPMC411812pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.18.84832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamanaka, S.10aApolipoprotein B mRNA-editing protein induces hepatocellular carcinoma and dysplasia in transgenic animals  ap. 8483-8487.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aApolipoprotein (apo-) B mRNA editing is the deamination of cytidine that creates a new termination codon and produces a truncated version of apo-B (apo-B48). The cytidine deaminase catalytic subunit [apo-B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC-1)] of the multiprotein editing complex has been identified. We generated transgenic rabbits and mice expressing rabbit APOBEC-1 in their livers to determine whether hepatic expression would lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The apo-B mRNA from the livers of the transgenic mice and rabbit was extensively edited, and the transgenic animals had reduced concentrations of apo-B100 and low density lipoproteins compared with control animals. Unexpectedly, all of the transgenic mice and a transgenic rabbit had liver dysplasia, and many transgenic mice developed hepatocellular carcinomas. Many of the mouse livers were hyperplastic and filled with lipid. Other hepatic mRNAs with sequence motifs similar to apo-B mRNA were examined for this type of editing (i.e., cytidine deamination). One of these, tyrosine kinase, was edited in livers of transgenic mice but not of controls. This result demonstrates that other mRNAs can be edited by the overexpressed editing enzyme and suggests that aberrant editing of hepatic mRNAs involved in cell growth and regulation is the cause of the tumorigenesis. Finally, these findings compromise the potential use of APOBEC-1 for gene therapy to lower plasma levels of low density lipoproteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amice 3arabbits 3atransgenic animals 3acomplementary DNA 3aamidine hydrolases 3apolypeptides 3aRNA editing 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3aadverse effects 3aliver 3acarcinoma 3agene therapy 3alow density lipoprotein 3acholesterol 3ablood chemistry 3aapolipoproteins 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aBase Sequence 2aCytidine Deaminasexgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aLiverxmetabolismxpathology. 2aLiver Neoplasms, Experimentalxgenetics 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRabbits 0adysplasia 0acytidine deaminase 0aaberrant rna editing1 aBalestra, M.E.1 aFerrell, L.D.1 aFan, J.1 aArnold, K.S.1 aTaylor, S.1 aTaylor, J.M.1 aInnerarity, T.L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 29, v. 92, no. 18 p.8483-8487x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.18.84833Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02268naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245015800144300001600302520137300318650001901691650002201710650001701732700001401749700001701763700001501780773009301795852000901888930003301897945002501930946001101955655001201966IND4366633720221120022211.0050113e20041206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436663372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKerscher, S.10aApplication of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a model to analyse human pathogenic mutations in mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase)  ap. 197-205.  aWhile diagnosis and genetic analysis of mitochondrial disorders has made remarkable progress, we still do not understand how given molecular defects are correlated to specific patterns of symptoms and their severity. Towards resolving this dilemma for the largest and therefore most affected respiratory chain enzyme, we have established the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a eucaryotic model system to analyse respiratory chain complex I. For in vivo analysis, eYFP protein was attached to the 30-kDa subunit to visualize complex I and mitochondria. Deletions strains for nuclear coded subunits allow the reconstruction of patient alleles by site-directed mutagenesis and plasmid complementation. In most of the pathogenic mutations analysed so far, decreased catalytic activities, elevated KM values, and/or elevated I50 values for quinone-analogous inhibitors were observed, providing plausible clues on the pathogenic process at the molecular level. Leigh mutations in the 49-kDa and PSST homologous subunits are found in regions that are at the boundaries of the ubiquinone-reducing catalytic core. This supports the proposed structural model and at the same time identifies novel domains critical for catalysis. Thus, Y. lipolytica is a useful lower eucaryotic model that will help to understand how pathogenic mutations in complex I interfere with enzyme function. 3ahuman diseases 3agenetic disorders 3amitochondria1 aGrgic, L.1 aGarofano, A.1 aBrandt, U.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 Dec. 6, v. 1659, no. 2-3 p.197-205x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050204b20050301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03265naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001900191245008800210300001500298500002400313500001500337520134100352650001401693650001601707650002801723650002301751650001701774650001601791650001401807650001401821650001601835650001101851650001201862650002101874650001401895650005001909650006201959650001102021650000902032650002302041650001602064650002402080650003102104653002402135653001802159653002102177653001702198653002402215653002302239653001302262700001902275700002102294773011302315852000902428856008502437930003302522945002502555946001102580655001202591IND4415232520221117170658.0090122e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441523252DNAL7 a188095092pmid7 a10.1016/j.asd.2008.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL001 0aL4001 aRutowski, R.L.10aVisual acuity and sensitivity increase allometrically with body size in butterflies  ap. 91-100.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn insects, the surface area of the compound eye increases with body size both within and between species with only a slight negative allometry. This increase in surface area permits changes in eye structure that affect the eye's acuity and sensitivity, two features of eye performance that cannot be simultaneously maximized. Hence, as eye size varies within a lineage, so will the compromises between features that maximize acuity and those that maximize sensitivity. We examined these compromises in four species of nymphalid butterflies that varied in body mass over almost two orders of magnitude. The largest of these species was crepuscular and so additionally may indicate the potential effect of life style on eye structure. Across these species, as body size increased, facet diameters increased while interommatidial angles decreased. Finally, the eye parameter was fairly constant across species except in the crepuscular species in which some notably large values were observed in the frontal visual field. Based on our measurements, large butterflies have more acute and more sensitive vision than smaller butterflies. However, full understanding of the behavioral implications of this relationship awaits information on the temporal resolution of their eyes because typical flight velocities also increase with body size. 3aommatidia 3aNymphalidae 3ainterspecific variation 3anocturnal activity 3asurface area 3abody weight 3aallometry 3abody size 3abutterflies 3avision 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBody Size 2aButterfliesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aCompound Eye, Arthropodxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOptical Phenomena. 2aSex Factors 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVision, Ocularxphysiology 0aspecies differences 0acompound eyes 0aeye surface area 0avisual field 0acrepuscular species 0avisual sensitivity 0aeye size1 aGislén, Lars.1 aWarrant, Eric J.0 tArthropod structure & development.g2009 Mar., v. 38, no. 2 p.91-100dElsevier Science Ltd.x1467-80397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2008.08.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090128b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/01/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02941naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245006400169300001600233500002400249520159800273650001801871650001501889650001101904650002001915650001601935650001201951650001201963650001601975650001601991650001402007650002302021650001902044650001002063650001402073650001502087650001502102650001202117650000902129650001302138650002302151650002402174650001202198650000902210700002002219773013002239852000902369856005702378655001202435IND4456316920221117170657.0110408e199502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445631692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01887.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinter, A.10aSide-effects of insecticides on two erigonid spider species  ap. 151-163.  aIncludes references  aThe current rearing technique for Erigone atra (Blackwall) and Oedothorax apicatus (Blackwall) (Araneae, Erigonidae) was improved. To reduce time spent rearing on live fruit flies the spiders were kept on a culture of the Collembola species Lepidocyrtus lanuginosus (Gmelin) (Entomobryidae). Side-effects on spiders of two pyrethroid insecticides (fenvalerate and lambda-cyhalothrin) and one carbamate insecticide (pirimicarb) were tested. Sensitivity of adults of both sexes and juveniles to insecticides and their influence on the rate of emergence of spiderlings from cocoons were investigated using topical application, spraying or residual contact. LD₅₀ values for adults ranged from 0.49 to 2.52 ng a.i./spider for lambda-cyhalothrin and from 5.75 to 98.20 ng a.i./spider for fenvalerate. Topical application also resulted in up to a week's delay of web-building. A moving laboratory spraying equipment was used to spray spiders with different insecticide dosages and water volumes. Pyrethroids sprayed onto adults in webs had stronger effects than pyrethroids sprayed onto sitting or walking spiders on the soil surface. Residual contamination caused higher mortality of spiders after contact with lambda-cyhalothrin than fenvalerate. In all tests, males were more susceptible to pyrethroids than females; this difference was related to body weight. Mortality rate was higher for E. atra than for O. apicatus. Both pyrethroids were also toxic to spiderlings. Lambda-cyhalothrin inhibited emergence of E. atra spiderlings from cocoons. Pirimicarb was harmless to both spider species. 3aEntomobryidae 3aOedothorax 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3abody weight 3acocoons 3afemales 3afenvalerate 3afruit flies 3ajuveniles 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3alethal dose 50 3amales 3amortality 3apirimicarb 3apyrethrins 3arearing 3asoil 3aspraying 3aspraying equipment 3atopical application 3awalking 3awebs1 aPoehling, H.-M.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1995 Feb., v. 74, no. 2 p.151-163dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw26090x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01887.x 7aarticle03734naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001600193245009700209300001600306520175000322650001302072650003102085650002802116650005702144650003102201650002902232650002002261650002202281650004702303650001902350650001102369650002102380650004402401650003402445650003802479650004402517650002902561650006102590650002602651650004602677653001202723653000802735653001802743653003402761700002402795700001302819700001802832700001502850773013402865852000902999856009203008930003303100946001103133655001203144IND4415854720221123035821.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441585472DNAL7 a192208392pmid7 aPMC26695302pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03855.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaas, S.H.10aCpG-oligodeoxynucleotides stimulate immunoglobulin A secretion in intestinal mucosal B cells  ap. 534-540.  aBacterial DNA motifs (such as CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides: CpG-ODN) induce innate immune responses via binding to Toll-like-receptor-9 (TLR-9). In murine intestinal mucosa treatment with CpG-ODN worsens chronic intestinal inflammation, whereas it prevents or ameliorates colitis when given in a prophylactic setting. In tonsils B cells have been reported to express TLR-9, especially after activation. Whether B cells in the human intestinal mucosa also express TLR-9 and whether their function can be influenced by CpG-ODN is, so far, unknown. Mucosal B cells were isolated according to a new protocol from surgical specimens of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and from controls by collagenase digestion followed by magnetic cell sorting using anti-CD19 antibody armed magnetic beads. TLR-9 mRNA and protein expression were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after stimulation of isolated B cells with CpG-ODN, control GpC-ODN or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Flow cytometric analysis of the isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells showed a purification of 73% (±22%) CD19⁺ cells. By quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and by Western blot TLR-9 expression in this cell population was evident. IgA secretion was increased significantly by CpG-ODN incubation compared with GpC-ODN and LPS. Compared with unstimulated controls, CpG-ODN up-regulated IgA secretion to 139% (±21%). These data demonstrate that CD19⁺ mucosal B cells express TLR-9 and secrete increased levels of IgA upon stimulation with CpG-ODN, indicating an additional link between adaptive and innate intestinal immune responses. 3aimmunity 2aAntigens, CD19ximmunology 2aCD4 Antigensxanalysis. 2aB-Lymphocytesxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Westernxmethods 2aCell Separationxmethods 2aCells, Cultured 2aColonximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Innate 2aImmunoglobulin Axanalysisximmunology. 2aIntestinal Mucosaximmunology 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aStimulation, Chemical 2aToll-Like Receptor 9xanalysisxgenetics. 0aB cells 0aCpG 0aIgA secretion 0apattern recognition receptors1 aStieber-Gunckel, M.1 aFalk, W.1 aObermeier, F.1 aRogler, G.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 Mar., v. 155, no. 3 p.534-540dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03855.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02122naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245015300159300001600312520114600328650001701474650002001491650002101511653003201532700001201564700001401576700001401590700001101604773009101615852000901706930003301715945002501748946001101773655001201784IND4366173720221123025358.0041221e20041004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436617372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYoon, H.S.10aMolecular cloning of the monodehydroascorbate reductase gene from Brassica campestris and analysis of its mRNA level in response to oxidative stress  ap. 181-186.  aIn a majority of living organisms, a fundamental protection mechanism from reactive oxygen species is by the ascorbate-glutathione cycle in which an important antioxidant, ascorbate (vitamin C), is utilized to convert harmful H2O2 to H2O. Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) maintains reduced pools of ascorbate by recycling the oxidized form of ascorbate. By screening a Brassica campestris cDNA library, we identified a B. campestris MDHAR cDNA (BcMdhar) which encodes a polypeptide of 434 amino acids possessing domains characteristic of FAD- and NAD(P)H-binding proteins. The predicted amino acid sequence of the open reading frame (ORF) shows a high level of identity to the cytosolic MDHAR of rice, pea and tomato, and does not possess N-terminal leader sequence suggesting that it encodes a cytosolic form of MDHAR. Genomic Southern blot analysis indicated that a single nuclear gene encodes this enzyme. Northern hybridization analysis detected BcMdhar transcripts in all plant tissues examined. The level of BcMdhar mRNA increased in response to oxidative stress invoked by hydrogen peroxide, salicylic acid, paraquat, and ozone. 3aantioxidants 3agene expression 3aoxidative stress 0aascorbate-glutathione cycle1 aLee, H.1 aLee, I.A.1 aKim, K.Y.1 aJo, J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 Oct. 4, v. 1658, no. 3 p.181-186x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050121b20050130c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle01645naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245009200145300001600237520067400253650001900927650001900946653001600965653002400981653003201005700001901037700001501056700002101071700001601092700001801108773009101126852000901217930003301226945002501259946001101284655001201295IND4366172120221123025508.0041221e20041104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436617212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

At high light intensity, this antenna is converted to an efficient trap for chlorophyll excitations that protects system II from photo-inhibition. In contrast to the energy-dependent non-photochemical quenching' (NPQ) in chloroplasts, this photoprotective energy dissipation in cyanobacteria is triggered by blue light. The induction is proportional to light intensity. Induction and decay of the quenching exhibit the same large temperature-dependence. 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotostability 0airon stress 0achlorophyll antenna 0anon-photochemical quenching1 aDemouliere, R.1 aLavaud, J.1 aGorkom, H.J. van1 aHoumard, J.1 aEtienne, A.L.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 Nov. 4, v. 1659, no. 1 p.100-104x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050121b20050130c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02319naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245007600143300001600219520144400235650003201679650002101711700003301732700002201765700001501787700001601802700001801818773009101836852000901927930003301936945002501969946001101994655001202005IND4366175820221123025516.0041221e20041004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436617582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRexroth, S.10aDimeric H+-ATP synthase in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 202-211.  aH+-ATP synthase is the dominant ATP production site in mitochondria and chloroplasts. So far, dimerization of ATP synthase has been observed only in mitochondria by biochemical and electron microscopic investigations. Although the physiological relevance remains still enigmatic, dimerization was proposed to be a unique feature of the mitochondrion [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1555 (2002) 154]. It is hard to imagine, however, that closely related protein complexes of mitochondria and chloroplast should show such severe differences in structural organization. We present the first evidences for dimerization of chloroplast ATP synthases within the thylakoid membrane. By investigation of the thylakoid membrane of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dimerization of the chloroplast ATP synthase was detected. Chloroplast ATP synthase dimer dissociates into monomers upon incubation with vanadate or phosphate but not by incubation with molybdate, while the mitochondrial dimer is not affected by the incubation. This suggests a distinct dimerization mechanism for mitochondrial and chloroplast ATP synthase. Since vanadate and phosphate bind to the active sites, contact sites located on the hydrophilic CF1 part are suggested for the chloroplast ATP synthase dimer. As the degree of dimerization varies with phosphate concentration, dimerization might be a response to low phosphate concentrations. 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aprotein subunits1 aMeyer zu Tittingdorf, J.M.W.1 aSchwassmann, H.J.1 aKrause, F.1 aSeelert, H.1 aDencher, N.A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 Oct. 4, v. 1658, no. 3 p.202-211x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050121b20050130c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02484naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002400127245005500151300001400206520164100220650001901861650001201880650001201892650004901904700001501953700001901968700001601987773008902003852000902092930003302101945002502134946001102159655001202170IND4366168020221123025419.0041221e20041104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436616802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSigfridsson, K.G.V.10aMolecular interference of Cd2+ with photosystem II  ap. 19-31.  aMany heavy metals inhibit electron transfer reactions in Photosystem II (PSII). Cd2+ is known to exchange, with high affinity in a slow reaction, for the Ca2+ cofactor in the Ca/Mn cluster that constitutes the oxygen-evolving center. This results in inhibition of photosynthetic oxygen evolution. There are also indications that Cd2+ binds to other sites in PSII, potentially to proton channels in analogy to heavy metal binding in photosynthetic reaction centers from purple bacteria. In search for the effects of Cd2+-binding to those sites, we have studied how Cd2+ affects electron transfer reactions in PSII after short incubation times and in sites, which interact with Cd2+ with low affinity. Overall electron transfer and partial electron transfer were studied by a combination of EPR spectroscopy of individual redox components, flash-induced variable fluorescence and steady state oxygen evolution measurements. Several effects of Cd2+ were observed: (i) the amplitude of the flash-induced variable fluorescence was lost indicating that electron transfer from YZ to P680+ was inhibited; (ii) QA- to QB electron transfer was slowed down; (iii) the S2 state multiline EPR signal was not observable; (iv) steady state oxygen evolution was inhibited in both a high-affinity and a low-affinity site; (v) the spectral shape of the EPR signal from QA-Fe2+ was modified but its amplitude was not sensitive to the presence of Cd2+. In addition, the presence of both Ca2+ and DCMU abolished Cd2+-induced effects partially and in different sites. The number of sites for Cd2+ binding and the possible nature of these sites are discussed. 3aphotosynthesis 3acadmium 3acalcium 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aBernat, G.1 aMămmădov, F.1 aStyring, S.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 Nov. 4, v. 1659, no. 1 p.19-31x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20050121b20050130c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03024naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245017400174300001800348520169900366650002202065650002502087650001102112653002502123700002602148700002202174700002302196700001902219700002302238700001702261700002002278700001902298700002002317700001702337773012502354852000902479856009202488930003302580946001302613655001202626IND4413061520221123012206.0081128e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441306152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05731.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashimoto, Michio10aDocosahexaenoic acid disrupts in vitro amyloid β₁₋₄₀ fibrillation and concomitantly inhibits amyloid levels in cerebral cortex of Alzheimer's disease model rats  ap. 1634-1646.  aWe have previously reported that dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) improves and/or protects against impairment of cognition ability in amyloid beta₁₋₄₀ (Aβ₁₋₄₀)-infused Alzheimer's disease (AD)-model rats. Here, after the administration of DHA to AD model rats for 12 weeks, the levels of Aβ₁₋₄₀, cholesterol and the composition of fatty acids were investigated in the Triton X100-insoluble membrane fractions of their cerebral cortex. The effects of DHA on the in vitro formation and kinetics of fibrillation of Aβ₁₋₄₀ were also investigated by thioflavin T fluorescence spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Dietary DHA significantly decreased the levels of Aβ₁₋₄₀, cholesterol and saturated fatty acids in the detergent insoluble membrane fractions of AD rats. The formation of Aβ fibrils was also attenuated by their incubation with DHA, as demonstrated by the decreased intensity of thioflavin T-derived fluorescence and by electron micrography. DHA treatment also decreased the intensity of thioflavin fluorescence in preformed-fibril Aβ peptides, demonstrating the anti-amyloidogenic effects of DHA. We then investigated the effects of DHA on the levels of oligomeric amyloid that is generated during its in vitro transformation from monomers to fibrils, by an anti-oligomer-specific antibody and non-reducing Tris-Glycine gradient (4-20%) gel electrophoresis. DHA concentration-dependently reduced the levels of oligomeric amyloid species, suggesting that dietary DHA-induced suppression of in vivo Aβ₁₋₄₀ aggregation occurs through the inhibitory effect of DHA on oligomeric amyloid species. 3aAlzheimer disease 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3amemory 0aamyloid fibrillation1 aHossain, Md.

  1 aBumba, L.10aAntenna ring around trimeric Photosystem I in chlorophyll b containing cyanobacterium Prochlorothrix hollandica  ap. 1-5.  aProchlorothrix hollandica is one of the three known species of an unusual clade of cyanobacteria (formerly called “prochlorophytes”) that contain chlorophyll a and b molecules bound to intrinsic light-harvesting antenna proteins. Here, we report the structural characterization of supramolecular complex consisting of Photosystem I (PSI) associated with the chlorophyll a/b-binding Pcb proteins. Electron microscopy and single particle image analysis of negatively stained preparations revealed that the Pcb-PSI supercomplex consists of a central trimeric PSI surrounded by a ring of 18 Pcb subunits. We conclude that the formation of the Pcb ring around trimeric PSI represents a mechanism for increasing the light-harvesting efficiency in chlorophyll b-containing cyanobacteria. 3aphotosynthesis 3aCyanobacteria1 aPrasil, O.1 aVacha, F.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2005 June 1, v. 1708, no. 1 p.1-5x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20080515b20080606c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/08/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02967naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245012100161300001600282500002400298500001500322520164700337650002401984650002202008650002302030650001402053650000902067650001902076650001802095650001102113651001002124653001902134653001702153653002102170700001402191700001702205773014502222852000902367856007402376930003302450945002502483946001302508655001202521IND4415276220221122221144.0090123s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A reliable estimate of the design storm, typically expressed in terms of return period, is essential for the design of conservation structures and efficiently managing the water resources. This problem is generally addressed by employing appropriate probability distributions describing the events in a given location. In this study, the annual extreme daily rainfall data of four stations was collected and analyzed in a sub-humid climate. Six two-parameter probability distributions, namely extreme value I, extreme value II, log-normal, gamma, logistic, log-logistic, and four three-parameter probability distributions, namely log-normal, extreme value II, gamma and log-logistic were compared for selecting appropriate distribution(s) to adequately describe the annual maximum one-day rainfall data. Maximum likelihood estimation technique was employed for obtaining parameter estimates of these distributions. The study on suitability of additional parameter in a three-parameter distribution over the two-parameter distribution of the same family revealed that no three-parameter distribution described the present data adequately. Two-parameter extreme value I along with log-normal and log-logistic distributions was found to be the best-fit for annual extreme daily rainfall data of Sahastradhara, Mussoorie, and Fakot stations in Uttarakhand state of India. Analysis of similar data of another station. 3ameteorological data 3asimulation models 3awater conservation 3afrequency 3arain 3arain intensity 3adata analysis 3astorms 3aIndia 0arainfall depth 0adesign storm 0awater management1 aDas, P.K.1 aOjasvi, P.R.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2008, v. 24, no. 4 p.447-453dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/12  aOther US 7aarticle02892naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100002300164245009900187300001600286500002400302500001500326520109400341650002601435650001401461650001201475650004101487650001501528650001501543650002801558650002201586650003001608650001401638650002801652650001801680650002701698650001901725650002501744650002301769650001801792650002901810650001101839650002901850651001201879653002401891653002401915700002901939700003401968700002602002773009802028852000902126856008602135930003302221945002502254946001102279655001202290IND4415268220221122221042.0090123e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441526822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8001 aTorfason, Einar G.10aStudy of equid herpesviruses 2 and 5 in Iceland with a type-specific polymerase chain reaction  ap. 605-611.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe horse population in Iceland is a special breed, isolated from other horses for at least 1000 years. This provides an exceptional opportunity to investigate old and new pathogens in an inbred herd with few infectious diseases. We have developed a high sensitivity semi-nested PCR to study equid gammaherpesviruses 2 and 5 (EHV-2 and 5) in Iceland. The first PCR is group specific, the second type-specific, targeting a 113 bp sequence in the glyB gene. DNA isolated from white blood cells and 18 different organs was tested for the presence of EHV-2 and 5. This was done in adult horses and foals, healthy and with various enteric infections. Both virus types were easily detected in all types of organs tested or EHV-2 in 79% cases and EHV-5 in 63%. In DNA from PBMC or buffy-coat EHV-2 was found in 20% cases and EHV-5 in 10%, all except one positive were foals. Co-culture of PBMC on fetal horse kidney cells was efficient for detecting EHV-2 but not for EHV-5. We verify here for the first time infections with EHV-2 and 5 in horses in Iceland and show that both viruses are common. 3adiagnostic techniques 3aphylogeny 3astrains 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aleukocytes 3apathotypes 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease detection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abioassays 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3amolecular epidemiology 3ahorse diseases 3adisease surveillance 3adisease prevalence 3aanimal organs 3aEquid gammaherpesvirus 5 3ahorses 3aEquid gammaherpesvirus 2 3aIceland 0aEquid herpesvirus 2 0aEquid herpesvirus 51 aThorsteinsdóttir, Lilja1 aTorsteinsdóttir, Sigurbjörg1 aSvansson, Vilhjálmur0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 Dec., v. 85, no. 3 p.605-611dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.01.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03277naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001300174245012200187300001600309500002400325500001500349520098200364650002801346650002201374650002301396650001401419650001101433650002201444650002101466650001401487650002001501650002001521650002801541650002501569650002701594650001301621650002501634650001501659650001201674650001401686650001201700650001601712650001001728650003501738650001801773650006801791650005101859650001401910650004201924650005401966650005202020651001002072651001002082653002802092653003202120653002302152700001502175700001702190700001702207700001702224700001602241773009802257852000902355856008602364930003302450945002502483946001102508655001202519IND4415267220221122181920.0090123e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441526722DNAL7 a184869572pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aJin, Xin10aIdentification and molecular analysis of the highly pathogenic duck hepatitis virus type 1 in Hubei province of China  ap. 595-598.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDuck hepatitis virus types 1 (DHV-1) JX strain was isolated from infected ducklings with clinical symptoms from Hubei province of China.

Comparative genome analysis with other available strains in GenBank indicated that JX strain shared 94-99% similarity at the nucleotide level and 95-99% at amino acid level with other DHV-1 strains. Sequence results showed that mutations of nucleotide and amino acid were mainly distributed in VP1 genes. Our result implied that the VP1 probably was the major virulent determinant of DHV-1. In addition, 13 DHV-1 strains from different area were analyzed in phylogeny and they can be grouped into four distinct lineages. The new-identified JX strain was grouped into one lineage with A66 and C80 strains, which were also isolated from China. 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease detection 3amicrobial genetics 3aducklings 3agenome 3aemerging diseases 3apoultry diseases 3aphylogeny 3aembryo (animal) 3aviral hepatitis 3apathogen identification 3aamino acid sequences 3amolecular epidemiology 3agenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3apathotypes 3astrains 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aDNA Primers 2aDucks 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxvirology 2aGenome, Viral 2aHepatitis Virus, Duckxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aHepatitis, Viral, Animalxprevention & control 2aPhylogeny 2aPicornaviridae Infectionsxveterinary 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 3aChina 0aChina 0amolecular sequence data 0aDuck hepatitis virus type 1 0amolecular genetics1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Wanpo1 aGu, Changqin1 aCheng, Guofu1 aHu, Xueying0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 Dec., v. 85, no. 3 p.595-598dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.01.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02357naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008700129300001600216520142800232650002001660650001001680650001301690650002501703650001601728650001801744650002601762650001401788650002201802650003601824653001901860700001701879773008101896939003301977852000902010655001202019IND9205135620221122181939.0920815e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920513562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubbaiah, T.K.10aAbscisic acid relationships in the chill-related dormancy mechanism in apple seeds  ap. 115-123.  aAbscisic acid (ABA) levels in seeds from three cultivars of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) which have substantially different chilling requirements were investigated by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry selected ion monitoring (GCMS-SIM) during stratification. The ABA content of dormant unchilled seeds was similar in the three cultivars, suggesting no relationship between the chilling requirement of those seeds and their ABA status. That chilling is not related to ABA changes during stratification was confirmed by warm (20 degrees C) and cold (5 degrees C) stratification experiments. ABA content dropped rapidly and nearly identically under both temperature regimes, but only cold stratification promoted germination. The decline in ABA during stratification was due in large part to leaching from the seed coat and nucellar membrane; the ABA content of the embryo remained nearly constant. The radicle in intact seeds stratified at 5 degrees C began growing 20-30 days after the ABA in the seed coat and nucellar membrane had nearly disappeared. Radicle growth did not occur in unchilled seeds, even though ABA had leached from them as well. It is possible that the leaching of ABA from the seed allows certain promotive forces to develop, but if so, these can develop only at chilling temperatures. Studies were also conducted on 2-trans ABA relationships to apple seed dormancy, but no association was evident. 3aMalus domestica 3aseeds 3adormancy 3achilling requirement 3atemperature 3aabscisic acid 3aquantitative analysis 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3achemical constituents of plants 0astratification1 aPowell, L.E.0 tPlant growth regulation.g1992 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.115-123x0167-69037nnas  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245017300127300001600300500001500316520152800331650002101859650001801880650001401898650001801912650002401930650001601954650004101970650001902011650002702030650001302057650001102070653003102081653002202112653002402134653001702158653001302175653001302188653001102201653001102212700001802223773008102241939003302322852000902355655001202364IND9205135920221122181907.0920815e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920513592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLownds, N.K.10aStudies on octylphenoxy surfactants.

Walp. subsp. unguiculata 'Dixielee') seedlings. OP surfactant-induced ethylene production was concentration dependent and decreased log linearly with increasing EO content. C(12-15) LA-induced ethylene production decreased log linearly with increasing EO content at 0.1%; however, at 1.0% the relationship was curvilinear with maximum response at 7 EO. Relationships for the C(9-11) and C(9) LA series were nonlinear with greatest biological activity at intermediate (8-12) EO content. Short EO chain length OP surfactants were only slightly water soluble, and induced low levels of ethylene production and phytotoxicity. Addition of OP + 1EO to a long chain, water soluble, non-ethylene inducing surfactant (OP + 40EO) solution significantly increased ethylene production by OP + 1EO in cowpea. A similar response was found for surfactant-induced phytotoxicity and EO chain length as between ethylene production and EO content. Similar EO chain length and ethylene production relationships were found for germinating mung bean (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilcz) seeds as for ethylene production and phytotoxicity in cowpea. Radicle growth was markedly inhibited by OP surfactants with an EO chain length of 10 or less and, in some cases, radicles were irreversibly damaged by ethylene inducing surfactants. 3aseed germination 3aphytotoxicity 3aseedlings 3aVigna radiata 3aethylene production 3asurfactants 3aVigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular conformation 3aalcohols 3aleaves 0alinear alcohol surfactants 0aVigna unguiculata 0aethoxy chain length 0aethoxylation 0atriton x 0aradicles 0agrowth 0aneodol1 aBukovac, M.J.0 tPlant growth regulation.g1992 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.139-145x0167-69037nnas  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001200146245012200158300001500280520145800295650001901753650002901772650002601801650001501827650003501842650003201877650004301909650001001952650004901962650002402011650003102035650006402066650004602130650004702176650001702223700001602240700001702256773008802273852000902361930003302370945002502403946001102428655001202439IND4383460520221122144006.0060908e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438346052DNAL7 a164577742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNoy, D.10aDesign and engineering of photosynthetic light-harvesting and electron transfer using length, time, and energy scales  ap. 90-105.  aDecades of research on the physical processes and chemical reaction-pathways in photosynthetic enzymes have resulted in an extensive database of kinetic information. Recently, this database has been augmented by a variety of high and medium resolution crystal structures of key photosynthetic enzymes that now include the two photosystems (PSI and PSII) of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Here, we examine the currently available structural and functional information from an engineer's point of view with the long-term goal of reproducing the key features of natural photosystems in de novo designed and custom-built molecular solar energy conversion devices. We find that the basic physics of the transfer processes, namely, the time constraints imposed by the rates of incoming photon flux and the various decay processes allow for a large degree of tolerance in the engineering parameters. Moreover, we find that the requirements to guarantee energy and electron transfer rates that yield high efficiency in natural photosystems are largely met by control of distance between chromophores and redox cofactors. Thus, for projected de novo designed constructions, the control of spatial organization of cofactor molecules within a dense array is initially given priority. Nevertheless, constructions accommodating dense arrays of different cofactors, some well within 1 nm from each other, still presents a significant challenge for protein design. 3aphotosynthesis 3alight harvesting complex 2aBiophysical Phenomena 2aBiophysics 2aElectron Transportxphysiology 2aEnergy Transferxphysiology 2aFluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer 2aLight 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexesxgenetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxphysiology 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complexxphysiology 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aMoser, C.C.1 aDutton, P.L.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2006 Feb., v. 1757, no. 2 p.90-105x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20061227b20070102c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/12/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02824naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001600146245007600162300001300238520151000251650001801761650001901779650001701798650002401815650005601839650004001895650001801935650002401953650006701977650005402044650004102098650002702139700001802166700001502184700001302199700001402212773008602226852000902312930003302321945002502354946001102379655001202390IND4378162920221122143927.0060227e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437816292DNAL7 a163642352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDuhring, U.10aAnalysis of photosynthetic complexes from a cyanobacterial ycf37 mutant  ap. 3-11.  aThe Ycf37 protein has been suggested to be involved in the biogenesis and/or stability of the cyanobacterial photosystem I (PSI) [A. Wilde, K. Lunser, F. Ossenbuhl, J. Nickelsen, T. Borner, Characterization of the cyanobacterial ycf37: mutation decreases the photosystem I content, Biochem. J. 357 (2001) 211-216]. With Ycf37 specific antibodies, we analyzed the localization of Ycf37 within the thylakoid membranes of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Inspection of a sucrose gradient profile indicated that small amounts of Ycf37 co-fractionated with monomeric photosynthetic complexes, but not with trimeric PSI. Isolating 3xFLAG epitope-tagged Ycf37 by affinity-tag purification rendered several PSI subunits that specifically co-precipitated with this protein. Blue-native PAGE newly revealed two monomeric PSI complexes (PSI and PSI*) in wild-type thylakoids. The lower amount of PsaK present in PSI* may explain its higher electrophoretic mobility. PSI* was more prominent in high-light grown cells and interestingly proved absent in the deltaycf37 mutant. PSI* appeared again when the mutant was complemented in trans with the wild-type ycf37 gene. In the deltaycf37 mutant the amount of trimeric PSI complexes was reduced to about 70% of the wild-type level with no significant changes in photochemical activity and subunit composition of the remaining photosystems. Our results indicate that Ycf37 plays a specific role in the preservation of PSI* and the biogenesis of PSI trimers. 3aCyanobacteria 3aphotosynthesis 3achloroplasts 3aopen reading frames 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGene Deletion 2aImmunoprecipitation 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complexxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Subunitsxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSynechocystisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aThylakoidsxenzymology1 aIrrgang, K.D.1 aLunser, K.1 aKehr, J.1 aWilde, A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2006 Jan., v. 1757, no. 1 p.3-11x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20060331b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03119naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100003100161245007900192300001600271500001500287520168400302592002801986650002302014650001402037650001102051650001102062650002402073650001002097650002602107650001502133650002202148650001802170650002002188650001102208650002502219653001402244653001802258653000902276700001802285700001702303700001602320773012002336852000902456856010102465930003302566945001302599946001302612655001202625IND2123734120221122143930.0980629e199705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212373412DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1997.0011183X003700030032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtiz-Monasterio R., J.

This study examined changes in CIMMYT's wheat germplasm with respect to grain protein concentration (GPC)- and grain protein quality (GPQ)-related parameters and assessed the importance of these parameters in determining bread-making quality, when wheat cultivars were grown with 0, 75, 150, or 300 kg N ha. A 3-yr field study was established with 10 cultivars representing breeding progress from 1950 to 1985. Flour protein concentration (FPC), sodium dodecyl sulfate-sedimentation (SDS-S), alveogram W (ALVW), alveogram P/G (ALVPG), bread loaf volume (LV), and GPC were evaluated. At low N (0 and 75 kg ha), there was no difference in GPC among cultivars. In contrast, at higher N (150 and 300 kg ha), there was a linear reduction GPC with respect to the year of release. However, when the two tall, older cultivars and cv. Siete Cerros 66, an outlier, were removed from the analysis, there was a negative trend between GPC and year of release but only at the 300 kg N ha level. There was no linear trend in year of release for GPQ parameters or LV. Loaf volume was most consistently correlated with SDS-S across the different levels of N compared with GPC, FPC, ALVW, or ALVPG. However, GPC and LV showed a highly significant correlation only when the two soft wheat cultivars were removed from analysis. Use of semidwarf germplasm in CIMMYT's wheat breeding program initially resulted in increased grain yield and reduced GPC. However, during the period of semidwarf improvement, increasing grain yield was possible while maintaining GPC, except under high levels of N application.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm releases 3acultivars 3avolume 3agluten 3agenetic improvement 3awheat 3amechanical properties 3acrop yield 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat protein 3aprotein content 3abreads 3anitrogen fertilizers 0agermplasm 0asedimentation 0adate1 aPeñna, R.

  1 aHarries, Phillip A.10aTobacco mosaic virus 126-kDa Protein Increases the Susceptibility of Nicotiana tabacum to Other Viruses and Its Dosage Affects Virus-Induced Gene Silencing  ap. 1539-1548.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 126-kDa protein is a suppressor of RNA silencing previously shown to delay the silencing of transgenes in Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana. Here, we demonstrate that expression of a 126-kDa protein-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion (126-GFP) in N. tabacum increases susceptibility to a broad assortment of viruses, including Alfalfa mosaic virus, Brome mosaic virus, Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), and Potato virus X. Given its ability to enhance TRV infection in tobacco, we tested the effect of 126-GFP expression on TRV-mediated virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and demonstrate that this protein can enhance silencing phenotypes. To explain these results, we examined the poorly understood effect of suppressor dosage on the VIGS response and demonstrated that enhanced VIGS corresponds to the presence of low levels of suppressor protein. A mutant version of the 126-kDa protein, inhibited in its ability to suppress silencing, had a minimal effect on VIGS, suggesting that the suppressor activity of the 126-kDa protein is indeed responsible for the observed dosage effects. These findings illustrate the sensitivity of host plants to relatively small changes in suppressor dosage and have implications for those interested in enhancing silencing phenotypes in tobacco and other species through VIGS. 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aRNA interference 3adose response 3aphenotype 3adosage 3agene expression 3aviral proteins 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3amolecular weight 3atobacco 2aAlfalfa mosaic virusxpathogenicity 2aBromovirusxpathogenicity 2aDisease Susceptibilityxvirology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Suppressor 2aGenes, Viral 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxvirology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aPotexvirusxpathogenicity 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0avirus-induced gene silencing 0agene silencing1 aPalanichelvam, Karuppaiah1 aBhat, Sumana1 aNelson, Richard S.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2008 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1539-1548dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-21-12-15393Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-21-12-1539  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle03384naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001700137245006700154300001600221500002400237500001500261520180800276650001102084650001202095650001202107650001702119650002102136650001902157650001502176650002102191650001902212650002002231650002102251650001702272650001402289650002102303650001802324650000702342650002202349651001302371653002002384653002402404653001402428653001302442700002002455700001902475700001502494773013102509852000902640856007402649930003302723945002502756946001302781655001202794IND4415279220221122114851.0090123s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ500 0aE2001 aDeBusk, J.A.10aChemical Phosphorus Removal for Separated Flushed Dairy Manure  ap. 499-506.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to determine effective and economical dosages of chemicals to remove phosphorus (P) from liquid dairy manure, the corresponding chemical and polymer dosages to treat manure in a full-scale case study at the Virginia Tech dairy, and the cost of manure treatment and land application of P-rich sludge produced. Ferric chloride (FeCl 3 x 6H 2 O), ferric sulfate (Fe 2 [SO 4 ] 3 x 5H 2 O), aluminum chloride (AlCl 3 x 6H 2 O), aluminum sulfate (Al 2 [SO 4 ] 3 x 13H 2 O, alum), and five cationic polyacrylamides were evaluated at varying dosages using jar tests on liquid manure of approximately 0.87% and 1.5% total solids (TS) concentration. Treated manure settled in Imhoff cones and sludge volume was measured; supernatant was analyzed for total P, solids, and pH. FeCl 3 x 6H 2 O, alum, and Superfloc 4512 (an ultra-high molecular weight polyacrylamide) were selected for further testing. Polymer addition enhanced floc size and settleability of sludge and improved P removal. Jar tests using a combination of chemical and polymer provided more than 97% P removal from liquid dairy manure obtained from one of Virginia Tech's storage tanks showing the potential for high P removal. As a case study, a storage tank containing 1,860 m 3 of manure with 1.2% TS and 157 mg P/L was treated in batch using 200 mg/L AlCl 3 as Al and 100 mg/L of Superfloc 4512 polymer. Approximately 84% of the total P was sequestered in a P-rich sludge. A portion of the sludge (600 m 3 ) was transported off the farm for land application. The total cost of treating manure and transporting the P rich sludge was $4.09/m 3 ($0.02/gal). This study demonstrated the feasibility of using chemicals and polymer to treat large volumes of manure in batch for P-based nutrient management for a dairy. 3asolids 3acations 3aliquids 3adairy manure 3aaluminum sulfate 3aferric sulfate 3aphosphorus 3aapplication rate 3apolyacrylamide 3awaste treatment 3amolecular weight 3acase studies 3aeffluents 3aland application 3acost analysis 3apH 3aaluminum chloride 3aVirginia 0aferric chloride 0atechnical chemicals 0achlorides 0apolymers1 aArogo Ogejo, J.1 aKnowlton, K.F.1 aLove, N.G.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2008, v. 24, no. 4 p.499-506dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/12  aOther US 7aarticle01483naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245012300157300001600280520070900296650002501005700001601030773009301046852000901139930003301148945002501181946001101206655001201217IND4376696320221122114837.0051213e20050930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437669632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Aconitase inactivation was calibrated using the known rate of matrix superoxide production from complex I. Glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase generated superoxide about equally to each side of the membrane, whereas centre o of complex III in the presence of antimycin A generated superoxide about 30% on the cytosolic side and 70% on the matrix side. 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aBrand, M.D.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2005 Sept. 30, v. 1709, no. 3 p.214-219x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20051230b20060102c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/12/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02509naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245009200148300001800240520134900258650002901607650002701636650001901663650001301682650002001695650001201715650001401727650002501741650002701766650005801793650003201851650002301883650001001906650002601916700001501942773009901957852000902056939003302065946001302098655001202111IND9205148520221122092026.0920817e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920514852DNAL7 a13232252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZielinski, G.C.10aMorphologic features and hydrophobicity of the cell surface of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  ap. 1119-1124.  aCell surface hydrophobicity of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae was evaluated by phase partitioning in a hydro-carbon-aqueous mixture, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and by salting out with ammonium sulfate. Results obtained by use of these techniques gave evidence that the cell surface of M hyopneumoniae is weakly hydrophobic, compared with strongly hydrophobic Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and hydrophilic Klebsiella pneumoniae. After treatment of the organisms with trypsin, M hyopneumoniae became less hydrophobic as measured by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Significant changes in hydrophobicity were not seen after periodate treatment. Electron microscopy of M hyopneumoniae treated with polycationic ferritin revealed an intermediate, compact, unlabeled layer between the cytoplasmic membrane and an external, heavily labeled layer. Electron microscopy of ferritin-labeled M hyopneumoniae after treatment with trypsin or periodate revealed the intermediate layer to be composed of a trypsin-sensitive protein(s). The outer layer was made of periodate-sensitive carbohydrate(s). Therefore, it appears that proteins in the intermediate layer confer at least part of the total hydrophobicity of the mycoplasmal cell and may contribute to adherence of M hyopneumoniae to target respiratory cells by hydrophobic interactions. 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aanatomy and morphology 3ahydrophobicity 3asurfaces 3acell structures 2aAnimals 2aFerritins 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMitogensxpharmacology 2aMycoplasmaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPeriodic Acidxpharmacology 2aSurface Properties 2aSwine 2aTrypsinxpharmacology1 aRoss, R.F.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1992 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.1119-1124x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02553naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006200124300001800186520165200204650000901856650000901865650001301874650001601887650001501903650001701918650001501935650002201950650002901972650001602001653001702017700001502034773009902049852000902148939003302157946001302190655001202203IND9205147820221122060611.0920817e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920514782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun, U.10aPercutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis in cows  ap. 1070-1084.  aA method was developed for percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis in cattle. The procedure was performed on the right side in the 9th, 10th, or 11th intercostal space of 30 cows. Of the 30 cows, 20 were slaughtered 24 hours after cholecystocentesis and the remaining 10 cows were slaughtered after a 10-day observation period. Changes in the peritoneum and gallbladder wall, observed at slaughter, were minimal. During the 10-day observation period, general behavior, attitude, and appetite of the 10 cows were normal. A transient, slight increase in rectal temperature was observed in 6 cows at 4, 5, or 8 days after cholecystocentesis. Total and differential WBC counts and total protein and fibrinogen concentrations, determined daily, were all within normal ranges. Bile samples from 20 cows were examined microscopically and biochemically. Fasciola hepatica and Dicrocoelium dendriticum eggs were observed in bile from 7 and 12 cows, respectively. Fecal examination revealed F hepatica eggs in 4 cows; D dendriticum eggs were not identified in any of the fecal samples. In 1 cow, F hepatica eggs were observed in the feces, but not in the bile. Bile acids concentration in bile varied from 12.5 to 68.5 mmol/L (mean +/- SD, 45.3 +/- 3.05 mmol/l) and in serum from 3.8 to 281.0 micromol/l (41.6 +/- 17.24 micromol/L). Negative correlation was obtained between bile acids concentration in bile and that in serum (r = - 0.60, P < 0.01). It was concluded that percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis in cows is a safe procedure and that microscopic and biochemical examinations of obtained bile can be useful diagnostic aids. 3acows 3abile 3asampling 3aultrasonics 3aperitoneum 3agall bladder 3abile acids 3aFasciola hepatica 3aDicrocoelium dendriticum 3aperitonitis 0ahelminth ova1 aGerber, D.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1992 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.1070-1084x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01710naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009000130300001600220520074800236650000800984650001000992650001701002650001001019650001401029650001001043650002801053650001001081650001901091650001601110700001901126773007401145852000901219856008801228939003301316946001101349655001201360IND4482171420221122060805.0140617e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448217142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Magnus K.10aEffect of air space in storage vials on motility of spermatozoa in chilled buck semen  ap. 422-423.  aThis study was conducted in order to find out the effect of air space on the top of glass vial in which semen is stored, on the motility of spermatozoa. 45 samples collected from two bucks over a span of 6 months were used for experiment. Goat milk extender was the diluent used. Two ml each of diluted semen after noting their initial motility was stored in 2 ml and 5 ml vials. Samples were stored at 5°C and motility of spermatozoa noted at 24 and 48 hours. Semen without air space was found to preserve the motility better than semen with air space on 24 and 48 hours of incubation. This could be better attributed to reactive oxygen species production by the spermatozoa, but further investigation is needed in this aspect to confirm it. 3aair 3abucks 3acold storage 3aglass 3agoat milk 3agoats 3areactive oxygen species 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa1 aAnand, Lali F.0 tVeterinary world.g2010 Sept., v. 3, no. 9 p.422-423x0972-89887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.3/No.9.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140617  aNon-US 7aarticle02435naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011700130300001600247520134100263650001301604650001601617650001601633650001001649650002001659650002301679650001001702650000901712650002101721650002801742700001601770700001801786700001401804700001601818773007401834852000901908856008801917939003302005946001102038655001202049IND4482171320221122051212.0140617e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448217132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijayakumar, R.10aInfluence of different types of bedding materials on immune response and serum biochemical profile of caged mice  ap. 418-421.  aContact bedding material is an important environmental factor and welfare creator for laboratory mice. It can alter important physiological process and create potential chance for experimental variation which puts hurdle for comparability. The present experiment was conducted to assess the possible impact of different types of bedding material viz CPS, NWS and PH with fifty one albino mice for a period of fifteen weeks in Laboratory Animal Facility. It was observed that local immunity in mice was enhanced in NWS. During in vitro immune assays, mice from NWS showed higher OD value for reactive oxygen radical, produced more NO2 and higher stimulation index i.e. 0.71 ± 0.01, 30.67 ± 0.88 µM and 7.90 ± 0.17, respectively than PH (0.23 ± 0.01, 17.0 ± 1.15 µM and 6.33 ± 0.21) and CPS (0.33 ± 0.03, 15.67 ± 1.20 µM and 6.46 ± 0.27). There was no influence of bedding type on systemic response. Reduced glutathione value in liver was higher in NWS than PH and CPS i.e. 8.54 ± 0.2, 7.09 ± 0.18 and 6.96 ± 0.14 µmole/ gm of tissue. But heart reduced glutathione showed no variation among different types of bedding materials. Serum analysis showed significantly (p<0.05) higher total protein and albumin value for enriched groups. But globulin value was not significantly differing for enriched and non-enriched groups. 3aalbumins 3ablood serum 3aglutathione 3aheart 3aimmune response 3alaboratory animals 3aliver 3amice 3anitrogen dioxide 3areactive oxygen species1 aSamanta, R.1 aSamanta, A.K.1 aGuria, R.1 aJoardar, S.0 tVeterinary world.g2010 Sept., v. 3, no. 9 p.418-421x0972-89887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.3/No.9.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140617  aNon-US 7aarticle02058naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008500146300001800231520068500249650001500934650001700949650001000966650001700976650003100993650001201024650003101036650002201067650002701089650002601116650002101142650001101163650002601174650003201200650002601232650000901258650002501267650002601292650002201318653002201340653001401362700001701376700001701393773009901410852000901509939003301518946001301551655001201564IND9205149520221122051346.0920817e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920514952DNAL7 a14971882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweeney, C.R.10aCytologic findings of tracheobronchial aspirates from 66 thoroughbred racehorses  ap. 1172-1175.  aTracheobronchial aspirates obtained from 66 healthy Thoroughbred racehorses in training at the same track were examined.

Eight cats were anesthetized with isoflurane and 8 were anesthetized with halothane. Anesthetic depth and mode of ventilation were varied to obtain a wide range of arterial blood pressure. A Doppler transducer was placed on the palmer surface of the left fore-limb over the common digital branch of the radial artery to detect blood flow, and a blood pressure monitoring cuff with a width 37% the limb circumference was placed half way between the elbow and the carpus. To enable direct arterial pressure measurements, the left femoral artery was catheterized and the blood pressure waveforms recorded simultaneously. Systolic blood pressure measured by use of the Doppler ultrasonic technique was significantly lower than that obtained from the femoral artery catheter. Using linear regression, we determined a clinically useful calibration adjustment for Doppler indirect blood pressure measurement in cats: femoral systolic pressure = Doppler systolic pressure + 14 mm of Hg. 3acats 3ablood pressure 3aultrasonics 3aarteries 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressure 2aBlood Pressure Determinationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCatsxphysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aTransducersxveterinary 2aUltrasonics 0aultrasonic devices1 aDunlop, C.I.1 aHodgson, D.S.1 aCurtis, C.R.1 aChapman, P.L.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1992 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.1166-1169x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02928naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002100155245012600176300001600302500002400318520153100342650002001873650000901893650001601902650002201918650001701940650002001957650001401977650001601991650002002007650001202027650001002039650002702049650001602076650000902092700002002101700001902121700002202140773012902162852000902291856007702300930003302377945002502410946001102435655001202446IND4415194120221122051211.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441519412DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.34892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aChen, Hsiao-ling14aThe bone-protective effect of a Taiwanese yam (Dioscorea alata L. cv.

This study investigated the effects of Dioscorea alata L. cv. Tainung No. 2 (TNG yam) on the bone density of ovariectomised (OVX) female BALB/c mice and the mechanism whereby TNG yam exerted this effect. Sham and OVX control groups were fed a control diet while remaining OVX mice were randomly allocated into experimental diets, i.e. yam (630 g TNG powder kg⁻¹), E2 (20 mg 17β-oestradiol kg⁻¹), or genistein (2 g genistein kg⁻¹) diet. After 12 weeks of feeding, the uterine weight, indices of bone mass and caecal short chain fatty acids were determined.RESULTS: Neither a yam nor genistein diet restored the OVX-induced uterine atrophy as did the E2 diet. The femoral and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) of mice fed the yam diet was greater than those of the sham group, respectively (P < 0.05 vs OVX control), while the lumbar BMD of yam and sham groups were similar (P > 0.05 vs sham). The femoral ash and calcium content in the yam group was significantly greater than that in the OVX control group, respectively (P < 0.05 vs OVX control). The total short chain fatty acid content in the caecum, only enhanced in the yam group, was not correlated with the calcium content of either bone or the plasma calcium level.CONCLUSION: TNG yam prevented loss of BMD and improved bone calcium status without stimulating uterine hypertrophy in OVX BALB/c mice. TNG yam may be beneficial for postmenopausal women for preventing bone loss. 3aDioscorea alata 3ayams 3afood intake 3aprotective effect 3abone density 3abone resorption 3agenistein 3aash content 3amineral content 3acalcium 3acecum 3afatty acid composition 3aovariectomy 3amice1 aHong, Ling-tiao1 aKang Lee, Jong1 aHuang, Ching-jang0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2009 Feb., v. 89, no. 3 p.517-522dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.34893Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03497naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002100198245008900219300001400308520136000322592002801682650000901710650001801719650002001737650001401757650001901771650001101790650001501801650002301816650002601839650001401865650001701879650001601896650001201912650001401924650001001938650002001948650002001968650001901988650001202007650003102019650002302050650002102073650000902094650002602103650004702129650002302176650002302199650003002222650000902252650001702261650002802278650003502306650001602341653005202357700001702409700001802426773013302444852000902577856008502586930003302671945002502704946001102729990002302740655001202763IND4380546920221122051249.0060601e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438054692DNAL7 a167116542pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aEgashira, Yukari10aTryptophan-Niacin Metabolism in Rat with Puromycin Aminonucleoside-Induced Nephrosis  ap. 28-33.  aWe investigated the change of tryptophan-niacin metabolism in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside PAN-induced nephrosis, the mechanisms responsible for their change of urinary excretion of nicotinamide and its metabolites, and the role of the kidney in tryptophan-niacin conversion. PAN-treated rats were intraperitoneally injected once with a 1.0% (w/v) solution of PAN at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight. The collection of 24-hour urine was conducted 8 days after PAN injection. Daily urinary excretion of nicotinamide and its metabolites, liver and blood NAD, and key enzyme activities of tryptophan-niacin metabolism were determined. In PAN-treated rats, the sum of urinary excretion of nicotinamide and its metabolites was significantly lower compared with controls. The kidneyα-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) activity in the PAN-treated group was significantly decreased by 50%, compared with the control group. Although kidney ACMSD activity was reduced, the conversion of tryptophan to niacin tended to be lower in the PAN-treated rats. A decrease in urinary excretion of niacin and the conversion of tryptophan to niacin in nephrotic rats may contribute to a low level of blood tryptophan. The role of kidney ACMSD activity may be minimal concerning tryptophan-niacin conversion under this experimental condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3arats 3aanimal models 3ahuman nutrition 3anephrosis 3ahuman diseases 3aniacin 3atryptophan 3avitamin metabolism 3aamino acid metabolism 3apuromycin 3anicotinamide 3ametabolites 3akidneys 3aurination 3aliver 3aenzyme activity 3ablood chemistry 3acarboxy-lyases 2aAnimals 2aCarboxy-Lyasesxmetabolism 2aKidneyxenzymology 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMale 2aNADxanalysisxblood. 2aNephrosisxchemically inducedxmetabolism. 2aNiacinxmetabolism 2aNiacinamidexurine 2aPuromycin Aminonucleoside 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSerum Albuminxanalysis 2aTryptophanxbloodxmetabolism. 2aWeight Gain 0aaminocarboxymuconate-semialdehyde decarboxylase1 aNagaki, Shin1 aSanada, Hiroo0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 76, no. 1 p.28-33dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.283Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02948naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072001700144072001700161100002100178245009100199300001300290520125200303592002801555650001001583650002201593650001801615650001501633650002001648650002001668650002201688650001801710650002501728650002501753650002201778650001701800650000901817650001701826650001801843653003901861653002801900700002101928700002401949700002201973700003201995700002102027700001702048773013202065852000902197856008402206930003302290945002502323946001102348990002302359655001202382IND4380546620221122042156.0060601e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438054662DNAL7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMorales, Adriana10aCloning of the Bovine β-Carotene-15,15’-Oxygenase and Expression in Gonadal Tissues  ap. 9-17.  aβ-carotene-15,15’-oxygenase (βCO), found mainly in intestinal mucosa and liver, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving β-carotene into retinal, which can be used or stored at these sites or carried by the bloodstream to different target cells within the body. We isolated the cDNA for bovine βCO and demonstrated its expression in gonadal tissues. A cDNA of 2130 base pairs (bp) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), using degenerate oligonucleotides; the deduced protein shared an identity of 75% with its homologues from other mammalian species. In order to evaluate the expression of this enzyme, we performed RT-PCR and in situ hybridizations in the ovary and testis of bovines. RT-PCR showed the expression of βCO in testis, ovary, and cultured granulosa cells. In situ hybridization of complete ovary and testis revealed expression in granulosa cells and the corpus luteum in the ovary and in germinal and interstitial cells in the testis. These results suggest that beta-carotene could act as a local source of retinoids, which have been shown to be important during proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of both female and male germinal cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulls 3amolecular cloning 3abeta-carotene 3aoxygenases 3agene expression 3agranulosa cells 3acomplementary DNA 3aretinaldehyde 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence homology 3aLeydig cells 3acows 3acell culture 3acorpus luteum 0abeta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase 0amolecular sequence data1 aRosas, António,1 aGonzález, Adriana,1 aAntaramian, Anaid1 aVarela-Echavarría, Alfredo1 aShimada, Armando1 aMora, Ofelia0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 76, no. 1 p.9-17dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.93Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03217naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002700155245011200182300001600294500002400310520172700334650002002061650001802081650002702099650000902126650002002135650002602155650001302181650002102194650002602215650001702241650001702258650001002275650001702285650002102302650001302323650002502336700002502361700002002386700002102406773012902427852000902556856007702565930003302642945002502675946001102700655001202711IND4415193920140725000000.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441519392DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.34852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aQ5051 adel Amor, Francisco M.10aInfluence of foliar urea on the antioxidant response and fruit color of sweet pepper under limited N supply  ap. 504-510.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Foliar fertilizer methods could provide a rapid and efficient response when uptake by plant roots is limited. This work studies the effect of foliar urea sprays (15 g L⁻¹) at different frequencies on the antioxidant metabolism and fruit quality of sweet pepper fruits under N-limited nutrient solution (3.5 mmol L⁻¹ NO₃ ⁻) and fully N-supplied (12.5 mmol L⁻¹ NO₃ ⁻) plants.RESULTS: Foliar applications of urea in root N-limited plants increased the total N concentration in the fruits and no significant differences were found with respect to control fruits (plants fully supplied with N by the roots). Fruit color was significantly affected by the urea sprays, and at the highest frequency (twice a week) the largest overall color difference (ΔE) with respect the non-sprayed fruits was obtained. Foliar urea increased anthocyanin concentration to control values but flavonoids were only affected at the highest application frequency. N deficiency induced oxidative stress but foliar application of urea altered this response, significantly diminishing catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activity.CONCLUSION: Sweet pepper fruits showed a significant and positive response to foliar fertilization on the studied parameters, compensating to a major extent the reduction of N by the roots. In addition to the environmental issues in reducing N contamination, fully monitored automatically sprayed foliar fertilizer could utilize N more efficiently and at lower cost than applying the full recommended rate of other N fertilizers to the nutrient solution, providing flexibility in correcting N nutrition in the plant, and especially the control of nutrient supply independent of the water supply. 3aCapsicum annuum 3asweet peppers 3afertilizer application 3aurea 3afoliar spraying 3anutrient availability 3anitrogen 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3acrop quality 3afood quality 3acolor 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase1 aCuadra-Crespo, Paula1 aVaró, Plácido1 aGómez, Maria C.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2009 Feb., v. 89, no. 3 p.504-510dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.34853Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03528naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002100198245013700219300001400356500001500370520128700385592002801672650000901700650001701709650003001726650001801756650001301774650002501787650001001812650002801822650001801850650002001868650002001888650002501908650002501933650001001958650001201968650003001980650005102010650002602061650002702087650002302114650003202137650002502169650003802194650002102232650003002253650003102283650003402314650000902348650003802357650000902395650002502404650002502429653001102454700002202465773013302487852000902620856008502629930003302714945002502747946001102772990002302783655001202806IND4383893220221122042222.0060926e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438389322DNAL7 a169414162pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.2.572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study was designed to investigate the effect of chitosan on colonic bacterial fermentation and fecal bacterial enzyme activity in rats fed a diet enriched in cholesterol. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 5% cellulose (CE) or 5% chitosan (CS) for 15 days. Significantly increased fecal cholesterol and triacylglycerols contents were observed in rats fed the chitosan diet. In addition, lower cecal acetate and butyrate concentrations and higher fecal acetate, propionate, and butyrate concentrations were observed in rats fed the CS diet when compared to those fed the CE diet. Although rats fed with the CS diet exhibited an elevated cecal (cecum with contents) weight and higher pH value, no significant difference in fecal pH value was observed between the CE group and the CS group. Chitosan significantly decreased fecal mucinase and beta-glucuronidase activities. Results from this study show that chitosan may alter fecal bacterial enzyme activities and SCFA concentrations and the beneficial effects of chitosan on the colonic environment may occur in the distal colon in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3arats 3afermentation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3adietary fiber 3achitosan 3adigestive physiology 3afeces 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aanimal models 3ahuman nutrition 3aenzyme activity 3acholesteremic effect 3anutrition physiology 3acolon 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCecumxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aChitosanxpharmacology 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDietary Fiberxpharmacology 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aFecesxchemistry 2aGlucuronidasexmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLiverxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0alipids1 aChiang, Meng-Tsan0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 Mar. 1, v. 76, no. 2 p.57-64dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.2.573Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/17  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02917naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001600181245008200197300001800279500001500297506007600312520117200388506003701560650002501597650001901622650002901641650001601670650002101686650001101707650001201718650001401730650002401744650001201768650002801780650002001808650002801828650001301856650003501869650001401904650002001918653001801938653001801956700002101974700001701995700001402012700001902026773014302045852000902188856008302197930003302280945001302313946001302326655001202339IND2047950520221207122344.0950926e19950829dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204795052DNAL7 a76672762pmid7 aPMC411332pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.18.82442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurns, C.G.10aSingle-headed myosin II acts as a dominant negative mutation in Dictyostelium  ap. 8244-8248.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConventional myosin II is an essential protein for cytokinesis, capping of cell surface receptors, and development of Dictyostelium cells. Myosin II also plays an important role in the polarization and movement of cells. All conventional myosins are double-headed molecules but the significance of this structure is not understood since single-headed myosin II can produce movement and force in vitro. We found that expression of the tail portion of myosin II in Dictyostelium led to the formation of single-headed myosin II in vivo. The resultant cells contain an approximately equal ratio of double- and single-headed myosin II molecules. Surprisingly, these cells were completely blocked in cytokinesis and capping of concanavalin A receptors although development into fruiting bodies was not impaired. We found that this phenotype is not due to defects in myosin light chain phosphorylation. These results show that single-headed myosin II cannot function properly in vivo and that it acts as a dominant negative mutation for myosin II function. These results suggest the possibility that cooperativity of myosin II heads is critical for force production in vivo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell differentiation 3aconcanavalin A 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3acytokinesis 3abinding proteins 3amyosin 3amutants 3areceptors 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aDictyosteliumxgenetics 2aGenes, Dominant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aMyosinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPhosphorylation 0acell division 0aDictyostelium1 aLarochelle, D.A.1 aErickson, H.1 aReddy, M.1 aDe Lozanne, A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 29, v. 92, no. 18 p.8244-8248x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.18.82443Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03284naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072000900157072000900166072000900175100003700184245010600221300001600327500002400343500001500367520161300382650002201995650001402017650002002031650001502051650001902066650002002085650001202105650004102117650003302158650002102191650002802212650006102240650003202301653001702333653002702350700001902377700002102396700002302417773015602440852000902596856007802605930003302683945002502716946001302741655001202754IND4415201520221122042011.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441520152DNAL7 a190859472pmid7 a10.1002/arch.202822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aCelorio-Mancera, Maria de la Paz10aIdentification of endo- and exo-polygalacturonase activity in Lygus hesperus (Knight) salivary glands  ap. 122-135.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPolygalacturonase (PG) activity found in the salivary gland apparatus of the western tarnished plant bug (WTPB, Lygus hesperus Knight) has been thought to be the main chemical cause of the damage inflicted by this mirid when feeding on its plant hosts. Early viscosity and thermal stability studies of the PG activity in L. hesperus protein extracts were difficult to interpret. Thus, it has been suggested that one or more PG protein(s) with different hydrolytic modes of action are produced by this mirid. In order to understand the quantitative complexity of the WTPB salivary PG activity, PG purification from a protein extract from salivary glands excised from L. hesperus insects was performed using affinity and ion exchange chromatography. To elucidate the qualitative complexity of the purified PGs, the digestion products generated by the PGs were separated using high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. At least five PG proteins were detected; these differing in terms of their glycosylation, mass-to-charge ratios, and/or molecular mass. The characterization of the products generated by these PGs showed that endo- and exo-acting PGs are produced by WTPB. Although none of the PGs was purified to homogeneity, the present work provides biochemical evidence of a multiplicity of PGs that degrade the pectin component of the plant tissue in different fashions. The implications of these findings affect the understanding of WTPB feeding damage and, potentially, help identify ways to control this important crop pest. Arch. Insect Biochem.

Here, we report the isolation of a yeast TBP-TAFII complex which can mediate transcriptional activation by GAL4-VP16 in a highly purified yeast in vitro transcription system. We have cloned and sequenced the genes encoding four of the multiple yeast TAFII proteins comprising the TBP-TAFII multisubunit complex and find that they are similar at the amino acid level to both human and Drosophila TFIID subunits. Using epitope-tagging and immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate that these genes encode bona fide TAF proteins and show that the yeast TBP-TAFII complex is minimally composed of TBP and seven distinct yTAFII proteins ranging in size from Mr = 150,000 to Mr = 25,000. In addition, by constructing null alleles of the cloned TAF-encoding genes, we show that normal function of the TAF-encoding genes is essential for yeast cell viability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aDNA-binding proteins 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription Factor TFIID 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenetic regulation 0ataf150 gene 0ataf130 gene 0ataf90 gene 0ataf60 gene 0atata binding protein associated factors 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l401451 aBai, Y.1 aCampbell, A.M.1 aBjorklund, S.1 aKim, Y.J.1 aZhou, S.1 aKornberg, R.D.1 aWeil, P.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 29, v. 92, no. 18 p.8224-8228x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.18.82243Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04287naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001500181245012000196300001800316500001500334506007600349520172700425506003702152650004502189650000902234650002102243650002002264650002202284650002502306650001902331650002002350650002102370650001102391650001302402650001702415650001802432650002902450650002302479650001902502650001702521650002202538650002502560650001802585650002802603650006202631650003502693650003002728650002602758650003902784650003602823650002402859650002002883653001002903653000802913653002802921653001902949653002502968653001902993653001903012653002203031653002503053653002403078700001703102700001703119700002003136700001903156773014303175852000903318856008303327930003303410945001303443946001303456655001203469IND2047649020221207122448.0950908e19950815dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204764902DNAL7 a76444912pmid7 aPMC412252pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.17.77592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowell, W.10aPolymorphic simple sequence repeat regions in chloroplast genomes: applications to the population genetics of pines  ap. 7759-7763.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSimple sequence repeats (SSRs), consisting of tandemly repeated multiple copies of mono-, di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide motifs, are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes and are frequently used as genetic markers, taking advantage of their length polymorphism. We have examined the polymorphism of such sequences in the chloroplast genomes of plants, by using a PCR-based assay. GenBank searches identified the presence of several (dA)n.(dT)n mononucleotide stretches in chloroplast genomes. A chloroplast (cp) SSR was identified in three pine species (Pinus contorta, Pinus sylvestris, and Pinus thunbergii) 312 bp upstream of the psbA gene. DNA amplification of this repeated region from 11 pine species identified nine length variants. The polymorphic amplified fragments were isolated and the DNA sequence was determined, confirming that the length polymorphism was caused by variation in the length of the repeated region. In the pines, the chloroplast genome is transmitted through pollen and this PCR assay may be used to monitor gene flow in this genus. Analysis of 305 individuals from seven populations of Pinus leucodermis Ant. revealed the presence of four variants with intrapopulational diversities ranging from 0.000 to 0.629 and an average of 0320. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of cpDNA on the same populations previously failed to detect any variation. Population subdivision based on cpSSR was higher (Gst = 0.22, where Cs, is coefficient of gene differentiation) than that revealed in a previous isozyme study (Gst = 0.05). We anticipate that SSR loci within the chloroplast genome should provide a highly informative assay for the analysis of the genetic structure of plant populations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aloci 3aPinus thunbergii 3achloroplast DNA 3aPinus heldreichii 3arepetitive sequences 3aPinus contorta 3agenetic markers 3aPinus sylvestris 3alength 3agenomics 3achloroplasts 2aBase Sequence 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aDatabases, Factual 2aGene Frequency 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenome, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxgenetics 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTreesxgenetics 0aPinus 0aDNA 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x57097 0agenetic polymorphism 0agenbank/x57098 0agenbank/d11467 0aPinus leucodermis 0anucleotide sequences 0apopulation genetics1 aMorgante, M.1 aMcDevitt, R.1 aVendramin, G.G.1 aRafalski, J.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 15, v. 92, no. 17 p.7759-7763x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.17.77593Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02835naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146100002400163245007700187300001600264500014000280500001500420520132800435592002801763650000901791650003501800650002601835650002001861650000901881650001701890650002301907650002201930650002001952650002101972650001301993653002302006653002602029773013502055852000902190856008602199930003302285945002502318946001102343990002302354655001202377IND4380540320221122025644.0060601e20051101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438054032DNAL7 a10.1024/0300-9831.75.6.3952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fairweather-Tait and B. Lonnerdal.  a2019-12-04  aIn vitro dialyzability methods involve a two-step digestion process simulating the gastric and intestinal phase, and dialysis through a semi-permeable membrane with a selected molecular weight cut-off. Dialyzable iron/zinc is used as an estimation of available mineral. Final pH adjustment and use of a strict time schedule were found to be critical factors for standardization. In addition the selected cut-off of the dialysis membrane and the method used for iron and zinc determination influence the results. For screening purposes, simple solubility or dialyzability methods seem preferable to the more sophisticated computer-controlled gastrointestinal model. This is likely more valuable in studies of different transit times and sites of dialyzability. In vitro solubility/dialyzability methods correlate in most cases with human absorption studies in ranking iron and zinc availability from different meals. Exceptions may be that effects of milk, certain proteins, tea, and organic acids cannot be predicted. The dialyzability methods exclude iron bound to large molecules, which in some cases is available and include iron bound to small molecules, which is not always available. In vitro experiments based on solubility/dialyzability are tools to understand factors that may affect subsequent mineral absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3azinc 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3anutrient availability 3airon absorption 3airon 3acell culture 3abinding properties 3aintestinal mucosa 3ahuman nutrition 3adietary minerals 3adialysis 0aliterature reviews 0aintestinal absorption0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2005 Nov. 1, v. 75, no. 6 p.395-404dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.75.6.3953Available from publisher's Web site  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle05459naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182072001700199072001700216100001800233245015300251300001600404520258200420592002803002650001103030650001303041650001703054650002003071650002703091650001403118650001603132650001803148650002003166650002703186650001803213650003103231650002803262650001603290650002403306650002003330650001803350650001803368650003103386650001803417650001803435650003703453650003203490650001603522650001203538650006303550650003003613650002803643650005303671650000903724650004603733650001803779650003003797650003503827650002003862650004003882650002103922650000903943650003103952650003003983650002804013700002404041700001904065700001904084700001804103700001904121700001904140700002004159700001804179773013604197852000904333856008604342930003304428945002504461946001104486961001304497990002304510655001204533IND4378824420221122025409.0060315e20050901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437882442DNAL7 a164777682pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.75.5.3572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

R.10aEffects of Increased Dietary Protein and Energy on Composition and Functional Capacities of Blood Mononuclear Cells from Vaccinated, Neonatal Calves  ap. 357-368.  aEffects of increased protein and energy provided by an intensified milk replacer on the antigen-specific, cell-mediated immune response of the neonatal calf were examined. Calves were fed a standard (0.45 kg/day of a 20% crude protein, 20% fat milk replacer; n = 11) or intensified (1.14 kg/day of a 28% crude protein, 20% fat milk replacer; n = 11) diet from 0 to 6 weeks of age. All calves were vaccinated with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) at 1 week of age. The daily weight gain of intensified-diet calves (0.62 kg/day) was greater than the weight gain of standard-diet calves (0.29 kg/day). Liver, kidney, heart, thymus, and subcervical lymph nodes from intensified-diet calves were heavier than the same organs from standard-diet calves. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations indicated that CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, gamma delta TCR<sup>+</sup> cells, and monocyte percentages, although unaffected by diet during the first 5 weeks of the study, were higher in intensified-diet calves at week 6. The decline in gamma deltad TCR<sup>+</sup> cell percentages and increase in B cell percentages with increasing age seen in all calves are characteristic of the maturing immune system of the calf. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell or B cell percentages were not affected by diet. In intensified-diet calves, percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> expressing interleukin-2 receptor increased and percentages of gamma delta TCR<sup>+</sup> cells expressing interleukin-2 receptor decreased with time. The same populations in standard-diet calves did not change with time. Percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and B cells expressing MHC class II antigen, were unaffected by diet or age. Although mitogen-induced interferon (IFN)-gamma and nitric oxide (NO) secretion increased with age for all calves, PBMC from intensified-diet calves produced less IFN-gamma and more NO than did cells from standard-diet calves at week 6 of the study. Antigen-induced secretion of IFN-gamma and NO also increased with age but was unaffected by diet. Antigen-elicited delayed-type hypersensitivity was unaffected by diet, suggesting increased dietary protein and energy did not alter adaptive immunity in vivo. Overall, these results suggest that feeding calves a commercially available, intensified milk replacer affects minimally the composition and functional capacities of PBMC populations. Additional research is necessary to determine whether these subtle effects influence the calf’s susceptibility to infectious disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalves 3aneonates 3acalf feeding 3adietary protein 3adietary energy sources 3amonocytes 3avaccination 3amilk replacer 3aimmune response 3acell-mediated immunity 3acrude protein 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3aBCG vaccine 3abovine tuberculosis 3aliveweight gain 3aanimal organs 3atissue weight 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aB-lymphocytes 3ainterleukin-2 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3ahistocompatibility antigens 3ainterferons 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxbloodxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aB-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aBCG Vaccineximmunology 2aCattlexbloodxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aHypersensitivity, Delayed 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunology 2aLymphocyte Count 2aMale 2aNitric Oxidexbiosynthesis 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aVaccinationxveterinary1 aNonnecke†,  B.

Historically Willamette and Meeker are the primary cultivars to be harvested by machine, but new clones are becoming accepted. No single attribute has been found to determine successful machine harvest ability but a range of interacting traits governs harvest performance. It is important that a high percentage of uniform, ripe fruit with acceptable process quality and minimal green fruit is harvested throughout the harvest season. Fruit from plants in a replicated ‘Haida’ test-cross experiment were scored for nine fruit attributes as were cultivars of known machine harvestability in a guard row. Canonical correlation was used on guard row data to relate known machine harvest performance to fruit attributes. Coefficients from the first canonical variate were applied to the test-cross data to investigate its variation. Although the difference in the canonical variate among families was relatively low, some of its components (notably plug length, curvature and hairiness, and fruit firmness) showed considerable among-family variance. It is concluded that canonical correlation has potential. However, to better estimate the canonical variate would require more clones with a range of machine harvest performance, more fruit and plant attributes assessed on these clones, and a refined scoring system. 3aclones 3acultivars 3afirmness 3amechanical harvesting 3araspberries 3avariance1 aStephens, M.J.1 aAlspach, P.1 aStanley, C.J.1 aKempler, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Sept., , no. 585 p.607-610dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.585.983Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04134naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001900193245009000212300001600302520208500318650002802403650001002431650003602441650002502477650002002502650002702522650001102549650004002560650004302600650006502643650001102708650003602719650000902755650001602764650003802780650002802818650001302846650003002859650004502889650004002934650003102974650006103005653002603066653001803092653001103110653002903121653002503150700001703175700001603192700001703208700002003225773013403245852000903379856007603388930003303464946001103497655001203508IND4386909720221116170453.0070116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438690972DNAL7 a172239662pmid7 aPMC18104782pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03276.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, J.B.10aHyperactivity and reactivity of peripheral blood neutrophils in chronic periodontitis  ap. 255-264.  aSome evidence exists that peripheral neutrophils from patients with chronic periodontitis generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after Fcγ-receptor stimulation than those from healthy controls. We hypothesized that peripheral neutrophils in periodontitis also show both hyper-reactivity to plaque organisms and hyperactivity in terms of baseline, unstimulated generation and release of ROS. Peripheral neutrophils from chronic periodontitis patients and age/sex/smoking-matched healthy controls (18 pairs) were assayed for total ROS generation and extracellular ROS release, with and without stimulation (Fcγ-receptor and Fusobacterium nucleatum), using luminol and isoluminol chemiluminescence. Assays were performed with and without priming with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Phox gene expression (p22, p47, p67, gp91) was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Neutrophils from patients produced higher mean levels of ROS in all assays. Total generation and extracellular release of ROS by patients' cells were significantly greater than those from controls after FcγR-stimulation, with (P = 0·023) and without (P <= 0·023) priming with GM-CSF. Differences in unstimulated total ROS generation were not significant. By contrast, patients' cells demonstrated greater baseline, extracellular ROS release than those from controls (P = 0·004). This difference was maintained after priming with LPS (P = 0·028) but not GM-CSF (P = 0·217). Phox gene expression was similar in patient and control cells at baseline and stimulation with F. nucleatum (3 h) consistently reduced gp91PHOX transcripts. Our data demonstrate that peripheral neutrophils from periodontitis patients exhibit hyper-reactivity following stimulation (Fcγ-receptor and F. nucleatum) and hyperactivity in terms of excess ROS release in the absence of exogenous stimulation. This hyperactive/-reactive neutrophil phenotype is not associated with elevated phox gene expression. 3aFusobacterium nucleatum 2aAdult 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChronic Disease 2aEndotoxinsximmunology 2aFemale 2aFusobacterium nucleatumximmunology 2aGene Expression Regulationximmunology 2aGranulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factorximmunology 2aHumans 2aLipopolysaccharidesximmunology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeutrophil Activationximmunology 2aNeutrophilsximmunology 2aOxazoles 2aPeriodontitisximmunology 2aPhosphoproteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aReceptors, IgGximmunology 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 0achronic periodontitis 0aFcγ-receptor 0aGM-CSF 0aneutrophil hyperactivity 0aphox gene expression1 aWright, H.J.1 aRoberts, A.1 aCooper, P.R.1 aChapple, I.L.C.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Feb., v. 147, no. 2 p.255-264dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03276.x3electronic resource  a20070116b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03334naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001900193245009400212300001600306500001500322520147400337650002701811650002101838650001501859650001001874650003601884650004101920650002001961650001001981650002401991650001102015650003802026650001102064650003502075650003302110650000902143650003602152650002602188650002702214650003002241653000802271653001502279653001702294700001602311700001802327700001802345700002202363700001802385700001502403700002302418773013402441852000902575856009202584930003302676946001102709655001202720IND4397714020221116170459.0071111e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439771402DNAL7 a179003022pmid7 aPMC22193682pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03506.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchipper, H.S.10aSystemic and local interferon-gamma production following Mycobacterium ulcerans infection  ap. 451-459.  a2019-12-05  aBuruli ulcer disease (BUD) is an emerging predominantly tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The initial pre-ulcerative skin lesion often breaks down into an ulcer with undermined edges. Healing is common but may require considerable time, and scarring often results in functional limitations. Considerable evidence has now emerged that patients with early BUD cannot mount a sufficient protective T helper 1 (Th1) cell response to M. ulcerans, but uncertainty remains as to whether immune protection is restored over time. This study investigates the Th1 cell response of patients with various stages of BUD on mycobacterial antigens. We measured interferon (IFN)-γ levels after ex vivo whole blood stimulation with tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD), and compared the Th1 cell response of individuals with pre-ulcerative, ulcerative and healed BUD as well as healthy controls. Moreover, the systemic Th1 cell response was related to histopathological features in the various stages of surgically resected BUD lesions. We show that patients with ulcerative and healed BUD produce significantly higher IFN-γ levels after mycobacterial ex vivo whole blood stimulation than healthy controls, and that patients with a granulomatous tissue response produce higher IFN-γ levels than individuals without. We therefore suggest that the mounted Th1 cell response in ulcerative BUD patients might be related to their histopathological tissue response. 3aMycobacterium ulcerans 3ainterferon-gamma 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aBuruli Ulcerximmunologyxpathology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aChild 2aDisease Progression 2aFemale 2aGranulomaximmunologyxpathology. 2aHumans 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aInterleukin-10xbiosynthesis 2aMale 2aPhytohemagglutininsximmunology 2aTh1 Cellsximmunology 2aTuberculinximmunology 2aWound Healingximmunology 0aTh1 0aimmunology 0aBuruli ulcer1 aRutgers, B.1 aHuitema, M.G.1 aEtuaful, S.N.1 aWestenbrink, B.D.1 aLimburg, P.C.1 aTimens, W.1 avan der Werf, T.S.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Dec., v. 150, no. 3 p.451-459dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03506.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02558naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003400143245013500177300001600312520157600328650001101904650001101915650001301926650001901939650002401958700002201982773015202004856004402156856003802200961000902238852000902247655001202256IND60753310420221116170451.0211014e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075331042DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.82.3.2252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlaughter-Mehfoud, Kathryn M.10aComparison of basilar sesamoidean and distal approaches for synoviocentesis of the forelimb digital flexor tendon sheath in horses  ap. 225-229.  aOBJECTIVE To evaluate synoviocentesis of the equine forelimb digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) via a basilar sesamoidean approach (BSA) or distal approach (DA). ANIMALS 21 healthy adult horses without DFTS-related lameness. PROCEDURES The forelimbs of each horse underwent the BSA or DA (21 limbs/approach) performed by 1 individual. The volume of synovial fluid (SF) aspirated, time from skin puncture to collection of SF, and number of attempts to place a needle in the DFTS were compared between approaches. RESULTS An SF sample was successfully aspirated from 16 of 21 (76%) limbs with the BSA and 20 of 21 (95%) limbs with the DA. For the BSA and DA, the number of attempts to obtain SF was 2 and 1, respectively; the median volume of SF obtained was 0.4 and 0.7 mL, respectively; and the median time to SF collection was 17.91 and 18.48 seconds, respectively. Between the approaches, the number of limbs with SF successfully aspirated and number of attempts to collect SF differed significantly, whereas the volume of SF aspirated and time to SF collection did not. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Regarding SF collection from forelimb DFTSs in horses without DFTS-related disease, use of the DA had a greater success rate with fewer attempts, compared with findings for the BSA, which may reflect the relative ease of identifying anatomic landmarks for the DA. Results suggested that a DA for DFTS synoviocentesis in horses appears efficient and effective and may minimize limb trauma by requiring fewer attempts for SF sample collection, compared with a BSA. 3aadults 3ahorses 3alameness 3asynovial fluid 3aveterinary medicine1 aMcCoy, Annette M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2021 Mar., v. 82, no. 3 p.225-229dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.82.3.22540uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03844naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001500193245010000208300001600308520178400324650001502108650001502123650004002138650001502178650001002193650001602203650002602219650002302245650001002268650002102278650005302299650002402352650002602376650001102402650003802413650003002451650001102481650003702492650000902529650005602538650001402594653001102608653002602619700001802645700001402663700002202677700001802699700001402717700001702731700001802748700001802766700001802784700002402802700001702826700002002843700001602863773013402879852000903013856009203022930003303114946001103147655001203158IND4393086420221116170415.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439308642DNAL7 a175213242pmid7 aPMC19419422pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03416.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruyen, I.10aIdentification of prediabetes in first-degree relatives at intermediate risk of type I diabetes  ap. 243-250.  aPrevention trials of type I diabetes are limited by recruitment of individuals at high risk of the disease. We investigated whether demographic and biological characteristics can identify rapid progressors among first-degree relatives of known patients at intermediate (< 10%) 5-year risk. Diabetes-associated antibodies, random proinsulin : C-peptide (PI/C) ratio and HLA DQ genotype were determined (repeatedly) in 258 islet antibody-positive IA-2Antibody-negative (Abpos/IA-2Aneg) normoglycaemic first-degree relatives. During follow-up (median 81 months), 14 of 258 Abpos/IA-2Aneg relatives developed type I diabetes; 13 (93%) of them had persistent antibodies conferring a 12% [95% confidence interval (CI): 5-19%] 5-year risk of diabetes. In Abpos/IA-2Aneg relatives with persistent antibodies (n = 126), the presence of >= 1 HLA DQ susceptibility haplotype in the absence of a protective haplotype (P = 0·033) and appearance on follow-up of a high PI/C ratio (P = 0·007) or IA-2A-positivity (P = 0·009) were identified as independent predictors of diabetes. In persistently antibody-positive relatives with HLA DQ risk a recurrently high PI/C ratio or development of IA-2A identified a subgroup (n = 32) comprising 10 of 13 (77%) prediabetic relatives and conferred a 35% (95% CI: 18-53%) 5-year risk. Under age 15 years, 5-year progression (95% CI) was 57% (30-84%) and sensitivity 62%. In the absence of IA-2A, the combination of antibody persistence, HLA DQ risk and elevated PI/C ratio or later development of IA-2A and young age defines a subgroup of relatives with a high risk of type I diabetes (>= 35% in 5 years). Together with initially IA-2A-positive relatives these individuals qualify for standardized beta cell function tests in view of prevention trials. 3aprediction 3aproinsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAutoantibodiesxblood 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xgeneticsximmunology. 2aDisease Progression 2aEpidemiologic Methods 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHLA-DQ Antigensxgenetics 2aHumans 2aIslets of Langerhansximmunology 2aMale 2aPrediabetic Statexdiagnosisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPrognosis 0aHLA DQ 0aislet cell antibodies1 aDe Grijse, J.1 aWeets, I.1 aḲoyfman, Tsevi.1 aPipeleers, L.1 aNanos, N.1 aDecochez, K.1 aHilbrands, R.1 aKaufman, J-M.1 aKeymeulen, B.1 aMathieu, Charlotte.1 aVan Gaal, L.1 aPipeleers, D.G.1 aGorus, F.K.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Aug., v. 149, no. 2 p.243-250dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03416.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03135naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245013200167300001600299520173700315650002602052650001502078650001802093650001602111650001302127650001002140650001202150650002102162650001802183650001502201650001602216650000902232650002402241650001202265650001602277650003002293650002402323700001702347700002102364700002102385773015202406856004402558856004502602961000902647852000902656655001202665IND60753310620221116170518.0211014e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075331062DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.82.3.2372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabakchiev, Claudia10aComparison of intra− and postoperative variables between laparoscopic and open ovariectomy in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)  ap. 237-248.  aOBJECTIVE To compare intraoperative and short-term postoperative variables pertaining to laparoscopic ovariectomy (LapOVE) and open ovariectomy (OVE) in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). ANIMALS Twelve 4− to 5-month-old female New Zealand White rabbits. PROCEDURES Rabbits were randomly assigned to undergo LapOVE (n = 6) or OVE (6), with a vessel-sealing device used to seal and transect the ovarian pedicles. Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed with a 3-port approach. Variables were measured during surgery (surgery and anesthesia times and incision lengths) and for up to 7 days after surgery (food consumption, feces production, body weight, vital parameters, blood glucose and cortisol concentrations, abdominal palpation findings, facial grimace scale scores, and ethograms). RESULTS Mean surgery (43.2 vs 21.7 minutes) and anesthesia (76.2 vs 48.8 minutes) times were longer and mean incision length was shorter (24.0 vs 41.5 mm) for LapOVE versus OVE. No significant differences in postoperative variables were identified between groups. During LapOVE, small intestinal perforation occurred in 1 rabbit, which was then euthanized. Postoperative complications for the remaining rabbits included superficial incisional dehiscence (LapOVE, 1/5; OVE, 2/6), subcutaneous emphysema (LapOVE, 1/5; OVE, 0/6), and seroma formation (LapOVE, 1/5; OVE, 0/6). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Surgery time for LapOVE was twice that of OVE, and LapOVE resulted in unique complications in rabbits. No evidence of a reduction in pain or faster return to baseline physiologic status was found for LapOVE. Further evaluation of LapOVE in rabbits is warranted, with modification to techniques used in this study or a larger sample size. 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aanesthesia 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acortisol 3afeces 3afemales 3afood consumption 3agrimace scale 3aintestines 3aovariectomy 3apain 3apulmonary emphysema 3arabbits 3asample size 3asurgical wound dehiscence 3aveterinary medicine1 aSingh, Ameet1 aDobson, Samantha1 aBeaufrere, Huges0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2021 Mar., v. 82, no. 3 p.237-248dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.82.3.23740uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7533106  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001500193245009800208300001600306520152400322650003101846650001001877650004301887650006301930650002801993650002402021650001102045650002202056650004202078650005402120650001102174650002202185650001602207650004102223650003102264650004202295650003502337650004202372650006302414653001802477653001802495653000802513653002302521700001702544700002202561700001402583700001902597700001802616700001802634700001602652700002202668700001502690773013402705852000902839856009202848930003302940946001102973655001202984IND4396213820221116170431.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439621382DNAL7 a179376752pmid7 aPMC22193592pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03468.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisser, J.10aFrequencies and role of regulatory T cells in patients with (pre)malignant cervical neoplasia  ap. 199-209.  aOncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)-infection is crucial for developing cervical cancer and its precursor lesions [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)]. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) might be involved in the failure of the immune system to control the development of HPV-induced cancer. We investigated frequencies, phenotype and activity of Tregs in patients with cervical neoplasia. CIN and cervical cancer patients showed increased CD4⁺/CD25high T cell frequencies in peripheral blood and CD4⁺ T cell fraction. These CD4⁺/CD25high T cells represent Tregs as demonstrated by their low proliferation rate, low interferon (IFN)-γ/interleukin (IL)-10 ratio, high expression of CD45RO, GITR, CTLA-4, forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) and low CD45RA expression. Moreover, in HPV16⁺ cervical cancer patients, in-vitro depletion of CD25⁺ T cells resulted in increased IFN-γ T cell responses against HPV16 E6- and E7 peptides. Thus, increased frequencies of Tregs in cervical cancer patients may indeed suppress HPV-specific immunity. Longitudinal analysis of CD4⁺/CD25high T cell frequencies in patients showed a modest decline 1 year after curative surgery or chemoradiation. This study demonstrates increased frequencies and suppressive activity of Tregs in cervical cancer. These results imply that Tregs may suppress the immune control of cervical neoplasia and furthermore that suppression of immunity by Tregs will be another hurdle to overcome in therapeutic immunization strategies against cervical neoplasia. 3auterine cervical neoplasms 2aAdult 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aUterine Cervical Dysplasiaximmunologyxtherapyxvirology. 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aDisease Progression 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aForkhead Transcription Factorsxblood 2aHuman papillomavirus 16xisolation & purification 2aHumans 2aImmunophenotyping 2aMiddle Aged 2aOncogene Proteins, Viralximmunology 2aPapillomavirus E7 Proteins 2aPapillomavirus Infectionsximmunology 2aRepressor Proteinsximmunology 2aT-Lymphocytes, Regulatoryximmunology 2aUterine Cervical Neoplasmsximmunologyxtherapyxvirology. 0aCD4⁺ T cell 0aCD8⁺ T cell 0aHPV 0aregulatory T cells1 aNijman, H.W.1 aHoogenboom, B.-N.1 aJager, P.1 avan Baarle, D.1 aSchuuring, E.1 aAbdulahad, W.1 aMiedema, F.1 avan der Zee, A.G.1 aDaemen, T.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Nov., v. 150, no. 2 p.199-209dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03468.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02529naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100002000161245011900181300001600300500002400316500001500340520084300355650001801198650002601216650003301242650002201275650002201297650002601319650002501345650002601370650001601396650002201412650002101434650002001455650001901475650001001494650001301504650002801517650003801545650002201583653001601605653001601621653002701637700002001664700002001684773011701704852000901821856007601830930003301906945002501939946001101964655001201975IND4382186320221116164012.0060723e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438218632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01121.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8331 aČeřovská, N.10aProduction of Polyclonal Antibodies to a Recombinant Potato Mop-top Virus Non-structural Triple Gene Block Protein  ap. 422-427.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe gene encoding the triple gene block protein 1 (TGBp1) of Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) was cloned into expression vector pQE32 tagging the protein with 6xHis on the N-terminus.

Abnormalities in factor H have been associated with renal disease, namely glomerulonephritis with C3 deposition including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and the atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS). Furthermore, a common factor H polymorphism has been identified as a risk factor for the development of age-related macular degeneration. These associations suggest that alternative pathway dysregulation is a common feature in the pathogenesis of these conditions. However, with respect to factor H-associated renal disease, it is now clear that distinct molecular defects in the protein underlie the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis and HUS. In this paper we review the associations between human factor H dysfunction and renal disease and explore how observations in both spontaneous and engineered animal models of factor H dysfunction have contributed to our understanding of the pathogenesis of factor H-related renal disease. 3acomplement 3aglomerulonephritis 3athrombosis 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aAutoantibodiesxanalysis 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aComplement Factor Hxdeficiencyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aComplement Pathway, Alternative 2aFemale 2aGlomerulonephritis, Membranoproliferativexgeneticsximmunologyxpathology. 2aHemolytic-Uremic Syndromexgeneticsximmunologyxpathology. 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 0aFactor H1 aCook, H.T.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 Feb., v. 151, no. 2 p.210-230dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03574.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02952naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175072000900193072000900202100001600211245005300227300001600280500002400296506007600320520095300396506003701349650000901386650000901395650002301404650001501427650001001442650001301452650002101465650002301486650002001509650001201529650001901541650002301560650002701583650001001610650002001620650003001640650002501670650001401695650001301709700001701722700001701739700001401756700001701770700001701787700001801804700001701822700001601839700001601855700001601871700001701887700001901904700001201923700001501935700001501950773009901965852000902064856007602073930003302149945002502182946001102207655001202218IND4382181420221207051111.0060723e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438218142DNAL7 a168793522pmid7 aPMC16191492pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2006.01458.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL4001 aLyons, L.A.14aThe Tabby cat locus maps to feline chromosome B1  ap. 383-386.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Tabby markings of the domestic cat are unique coat patterns for which no causative candidate gene has been inferred from other mammals. In this study, a genome scan was performed on a large pedigree of cats that segregated for Tabby coat markings, specifically for the Abyssinian (T a-) and blotched (tbtb) phenotypes. There was linkage between the Tabby locus and eight markers on cat chromosome B1. The most significant linkage was between marker FCA700 and Tabby (Z = 7.56, θ = 0.03). Two additional markers in the region supported linkage, although not with significant LOD scores. Pairwise analysis of the markers supported the published genetic map of the cat, although additional meioses are required to refine the region. The linked markers cover a 17-cM region and flank an evolutionary breakpoint, suggesting that the Tabby gene has a homologue on either human chromosome 4 or 8. Alternatively, Tabby could be a unique locus in cats.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acats 3aloci 3achromosome mapping 3aintegument 3acolor 3agenotype 3agene segregation 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic markers 2aAnimals 2aCatsxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Mammalian 2aColor 2aGenetic Markers 2aHairxanatomy & histology 2aHair Colorxgenetics 2aLod Score 2aPedigree1 aBailey, S.J.1 aBaysac, K.C.1 aByrns, G.1 aErdman, C.A.1 aFretwell, N.1 aFroenicke, L.1 aGazlay, K.W.1 aGeary, L.A.1 aGrahn, J.C.1 aGrahn, R.A.1 aKarere, G.M.1 aLipinski, M.J.1 aRah, H.1 aRuhe, M.T.1 aBach, L.H.0 tAnimal genetics.g2006 Aug., v. 37, no. 4 p.383-386dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2006.01458.x3electronic resource  a20061018b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02596naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100002200161245012200183300001600305500002400321520112100345650001301466650003701479650001501516650002301531650002301554650002501577650001301602650002501615650001801640650002001658650001201678650001401690650002701704650002701731650001801758653002801776700001501804700001701819700001301836773009901849852000901948856007601957930003302033945002502066946001102091655001202102IND4382181720221116164056.0060723e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438218172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2006.01459.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2001 aCumberbatch, J.A.10aChicken major histocompatibility complex class II molecules of the B¹⁹ haplotype present self and foreign peptides  ap. 393-396.  aIncludes references  aThe chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC), or B-complex, mediates genetic resistance and susceptibility to infectious disease. For example, the B¹⁹ haplotype is associated with susceptibility to Marek's disease. Here, we describe the sequencing and analysis of peptides presented by B¹⁹ MHC class II molecules. A B¹⁹/B¹⁹ B-cell line was used for the immunoaffinity purification of MHC class II molecules, which was followed by acid elution of the bound peptides. The eluted peptides were then analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. Thirty peptide sequences were obtained, ranging from 11 to 25 amino acids in length. Source protein cellular localization included the plasma membrane, cytosol and endosomal pathway. In addition, five peptides from the envelope glycoprotein of chicken syncytial virus (CSV) were identified. Chicken syncytial virus had been used as a helper virus along with reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T for transformation of B¹⁹/B¹⁹B cells. Alignment and analysis of the peptide sequence pool provided a putative peptide-binding motif for the B¹⁹ MHC class II. 3achickens 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3ahaplotypes 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3acytochemistry 3aplasma membrane 3acytosol 3aendosomes 3amembrane glycoproteins 3agenetic transformation 3abinding sites 0amolecular sequence data1 aBrewer, D.1 aVidavsky, I.1 aSharīf.0 tAnimal genetics.g2006 Aug., v. 37, no. 4 p.393-396dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2006.01459.x3electronic resource  a20061018b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03300naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010000183300001600283520133500299650001501634650002501649650002401674650002201698650001401720650003101734650001001765650002001775650001501795650002601810650002101836650001901857650001801876650001701894650001701911650002201928650001101950650001801961650002001979650003101999650003102030650003802061650005302099650004202152650003102194650001802225653002002243653001502263653002302278653002202301700001802323700001902341700002302360700002102383773010602404852000902510856008502519930003302604946001302637655001202650IND4421226020221116164024.0090529e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442122602DNAL7 a190436582pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-008-9166-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Chai-Ling 10aProfiling the Transcriptome of Gracilaria changii (Rhodophyta) in Response to Light Deprivation  ap. 513-519.  aLight regulates photosynthesis, growth and reproduction, yield and properties of phycocolloids, and starch contents in seaweeds. Despite its importance as an environmental cue that regulates many developmental, physiological, and biochemical processes, the network of genes involved during light deprivation are obscure. In this study, we profiled the transcriptome of Gracilaria changii at two different irradiance levels using a cDNA microarray containing more than 3,000 cDNA probes. Microarray analysis revealed that 93 and 105 genes were up- and down-regulated more than 3-fold under light deprivation, respectively. However, only 50% of the transcripts have significant matches to the nonredundant peptide sequences in the database. The transcripts that accumulated under light deprivation include vanadium chloroperoxidase, thioredoxin, ferredoxin component, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase. Among the genes that were down-regulated under light deprivation were genes encoding light harvesting protein, light harvesting complex I, phycobilisome 7.8 kDa linker polypeptide, low molecular weight early light-inducible protein, and vanadium bromoperoxidase. Our findings also provided important clues to the functions of many unknown sequences that could not be annotated using sequence comparison. 3aGracilaria 3abiochemical pathways 3achloride peroxidase 3acomplementary DNA 3adatabases 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alight intensity 3amacroalgae 3amicroarray technology 3amolecular weight 3aphotosynthesis 3aphycobilisome 3apolypeptides 3areproduction 3asequence analysis 3astarch 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGracilariaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysisxmethods 2aPhotosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aUp-Regulation 0acDNA microarray 0aIrradiance 0aGracilaria changii 0aLight deprivation1 aTeoh, Seddon 1 aTeo, Swee-Sen 1 aRahim, Raha Abdul 1 aPhang, Siew Moi.0 tMarine biotechnology.g2009 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.513-519dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-008-9166-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090529b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03000naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168100002200177245014400199300001600343500002400359500001500383520142000398650002201818650001501840650001701855650002501872650002501897650001201922650001701934650001701951650002501968650002301993650001902016650002202035650002402057653001702081653002102098700001802119700002302137773011402160852000902274856008002283856004802363930003302411945002502444946001302469655001202482IND4382011120221116163644.0060717e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438201112DNAL7 a216421622pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.93.7.9782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF8411 aCasper, Brenda B.12aA stage-based study of drought response in Cryptantha flava (Boraginaceae): gas exchange, water use efficiency, and whole plant performance  ap. 978-987.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aModels of global climate change predict an increase in the frequency of major droughts, yet we know little about the consequences of drought for the demography of natural populations. This study examined a population of the semi-desert perennial Cryptantha flava (Boraginaceae) to determine how plants of different developmental stages respond to drought through changes in leaf gas exchange, leaf water potential, water use efficiency, growth, and reproduction. In two of the four years, drought was applied using rainout shelters, and a severe natural drought occurred in another. Small, presumably younger, plants sometimes had lower rates of maximum photosynthesis, lower leaf water potentials, and lower instantaneous or integrated water-use efficiency than large plants. Small plants also had higher relative growth rates and lower reproductive effort. Large plants with evidence of shrinkage from a previously larger size often produced less growth and reproduction than large healthy plants, suggesting a decline in plant vigor with age. Drought depressed gas exchange and leaf water potentials equally in all plant stages. Thus, leaf-level physiological attributes provide no clues for why drought reduces growth more strongly in large plants. The results point to several additional avenues of research relevant to understanding stage-dependent or age-dependent plant performance under drought conditions. 3aplant development 3aperennials 3agas exchange 3awater use efficiency 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3awater stress 3aBoraginaceae 3aleaf water potential 3aplant reproduction 3aphotosynthesis 3aseed productivity 3apopulation dynamics 0aplant growth 0aCryptantha flava1 aForseth, I.N.1 aWait, D.

Experimental bottom trawling was conducted from MFV Sagarkripa at five transects of water depths 15-20 m, 21-25 m, 26-30 m, 31-35 m and 36-40 m in commercial trawling grounds. Trawling was conducted for 12 months in a span of 15 months (September 2005-November 2006) excluding the trawl ban period (June to August). The sediment texture was analysed by pipette analysis and organic matter by wet oxidation method. The variations in organic matter and sediment texture were prominent between the stations selected at different depths. The sedimentary organic matter exhibited variations with different water depths and seasons. The organic matter content decreased with depth. Experimental trawling considerably reduced the organic matter content at all depths. Continued and incessant trawling operation can cause even more drastic reductions, where organic matter (OM) content is already very small. The sand proportion showed depth-wise variation; but seasonal and trawling effect was not significant showing highest values at 36-40 m depth. The silt proportion did not exhibit significant depth-wise variation. The seasonal variation of silt was significant whereas trawling effect imparted to silt was not evident. Trawling has no significant effect on clay concentration. But seasonal variation had great influence on the clay distribution and indicated significantly high depth-season interaction. The sediment of the study area was predominant in silt proportion.

We investigated plasma concentrations and ex vivo production of cytokines and chemokines, and intracellular signalling molecules, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in T helper (Th) cells and monocytes in 94 type 2 diabetic patients with or without nephropathy and 20 healthy controls. Plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18 and chemokine CCL2 in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) were significantly higher than control subjects, while IL-10, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10 and adiponectin concentrations of DN were significantly higher than patients without diabetic nephropathy (NDN) and control subjects (all P < 0·05). Plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10 and adiponectin exhibited significant positive correlation with urine albumin : creatinine ratio in DN patients. The percentage increases of ex vivo production of IL-6, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL5 upon TNF-α activation were significantly higher in both NDN and DN patients than controls (all P < 0·05). The percentage increases in IL-18-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Th cells of NDN and DN were significantly higher than controls (P < 0·05), while the percentage increase in TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in monocytes and IL-18-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in Th cells and monocytes were significantly higher in NDN patients than controls. These results confirmed that the aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and differential activation of MAPK in different leucocytes are the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of type 2 DM patients with DN. 3adiabetes 2aAdiponectinxblood 2aAdult 2aCells, Cultured 2aChemokinesxbiosynthesisxblood. 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesisxblood. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2ximmunology 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesximmunology 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-18ximmunology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxblood 2aMonocytesxenzymology 2aPhosphorylation 2aT-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducerxenzymology 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaximmunology 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxblood 0achemokines/monokines 0acytokines/interleukins 0akinases/phosphatases 0arenal immunology/disease1 aHo, A.W.Y.1 aTong, P.C.Y.1 aYeung, C.Y.1 aKong, A.P.S.1 aLun, S.W.M.1 aChan, J.C.N.1 aLam, C.W.K.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 July, v. 149, no. 1 p.123-131dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03389.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070610b20070702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02984naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168072000900177100002200186245012700208300001600335500002400351500001500375520132000390650001801710650001001728650001701738650001301755650002301768650001101791650001001802650002101812650001101833650002801844650002301872650002301895650002101918650002001939650001401959650001401973650001601987650001502003653002602018653001402044700002602058773011402084852000902198856008002207856004802287930003302335945002502368946001302393655001202406IND4382011020221116163507.0060717e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438201102DNAL7 a216421612pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.93.7.9722doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF400 0aF9001 aLeicht, Stacey A.10aDifferential responses of invasive Celastrus orbiculatus (Celastraceae) and native C. scandens to changes in light quality  ap. 972-977.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWhen plants are subjected to leaf canopy shade in forest understories or from neighboring plants, they not only experience reduced light quantity, but light quality in lowered red : far red light (R : FR). Growth and other developmental responses of plants in reduced R : FR can vary and are not consistent across species. We compared how an invasive liana, Celastrus orbiculatus, and its closely related native congener, C. scandens, responded to changes in the R : FR under controlled, simulated understory conditions. We measured a suite of morphological and growth attributes under control, neutral shading, and low R : FR light treatments. Celastrus orbiculatus showed an increase in height, aboveground biomass, and total leaf mass in reduced R : FR treatments as compared to the neutral shade, while C. scandens had increased stem diameter, single leaf area, and leaf mass to stem mass ratio. These differences provide a mechanistic understanding of the ability of C. orbiculatus to increase height and actively forage for light resources in forest understories, while C. scandens appears unable to forage for light and instead depends upon a light gap forming. The plastic growth response of C. orbiculatus in shaded conditions points to its success in forested habitats where C. scandens is largely absent. 3afar-red light 3avines 3aplant growth 3adiameter 3aintroduced species 3aheight 3ashade 3aplant morphology 3aleaves 3adry matter partitioning 3aCelastrus scandens 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aforest habitats 3ared light 3aoverstory 3acanopy gaps 3aunderstory 0aCelastrus orbiculatus 0aCelastrus1 aSilander, John A.

A species' floral display can strongly influence the behavior of its pollinators and thereby affect its evolutionary pathway. We used paternity analysis to directly measure and describe mating patterns within 15 populations of the epiphytic orchid, Laelia rubescens, in Costa Rican dry forest. Strict correlated mating by orchids allows inference of the precise multilocus diploid genotype of the pollen parents. Our data show that mean effective population sizes were small (11.2 in 1999 and 11.8 in 2000) relative to the number of flowering genets (63 and 56, respectively). Fewer genets were reproductively successful as females than males. The relationship between reproductive success (RS) and floral display within three cluster size classes was consistent between years, with large (>30 inflorescences) and small (<=10 inflorescences) clusters often having significantly lower RS than expected, while the RS of medium-sized clusters (11-30 inflorescences) often significantly exceeded expectations. Paternity analysis allowed us to take advantage of the pollination biology of L. rubescens to provide unusually detailed insights into mating patterns, pollen-mediated gene movement and RS for populations of this epiphytic orchid, an herbaceous perennial, distributed in three-dimensional space. 3aanimal behavior 3apaternity 3aevolution 3apollinators 3atropics 3apollen flow 3aepiphytes 3aflowers 3agene flow 3agenotype 3amating systems 3aseed productivity 3aLaelia 3aCosta Rica 0areproductive success 0ainflorescences 0aLaelia rubescens 0aplant reproduction1 aHamrick, J.L.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2006 July, v. 93, no. 7 p.1010-1018dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.93.7.10103Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20061007b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/22  aOther US 7aarticle03098naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178100001500187245016500202300001800367500002400385520130100409650002301710650002901733650001501762650003001777650001301807650002101820650002501841650002301866650001301889650002701902650001401929650001401943650001001957650001001967650002301977650002202000650002102022650001902043650001902062651001102081651001902092700002102111700001802132700002102150773011602171852000902287856008102296856004802377930003302425945002502458946001302483655001202496IND4382010120140723000000.0060717e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438201012DNAL7 a216421672pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.93.7.10182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF900 0aF3001 aPergl, Jan10aPopulation age structure and reproductive behavior of the monocarpic perennial Heracleum mantegazzianum (Apiaceae) in its native and invaded distribution ranges  ap. 1018-1028.  aIncludes references  aMany invasive species are benign in their native region--are there interactions between their key traits and the new habitats that explain invasion success? The giant perennial herb Heracleum mantegazzianum is a problematic invader in Europe and is also naturalized in North America. We compared its population structure and reproductive behavior in the native (W. Caucasus) and invaded (Czech Republic) areas in managed (pastures) and unmanaged sites. The age structure of the populations and age at flowering were analyzed using herb-chronology, a method based on counting annual rings in the secondary xylem of roots. The species was strictly monocarpic; most plants in unmanaged sites in the invaded range flowered in the third and fourth yr (maximum 12 yr). In unmanaged habitats, plants from the native range flowered later than those from the invaded range. In both ranges, flowering was delayed in managed sites where the population density was higher and most plants flowered around the fifth year. Reproductive output of individual plants was neither related to population density nor to age at flowering. More favorable climatic conditions in the invaded region, together with increased chances for dispersal in a densely colonized central Europe, seemed to allow the massive invasion. 3aindigenous species 3aHeracleum mantegazzianum 3aperennials 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3apopulation structure 3aplant reproduction 3apastures 3ageographical variation 3aflowering 3aphenology 3aroots 3axylem 3apopulation density 3aseed productivity 3aclimatic factors 3aseed dispersal 3aphytogeography 3aRussia 3aCzech Republic1 aPerglová, Irena1 aPyšek, Petr.1 aDietz, Hansjörg0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2006 July, v. 93, no. 7 p.1018-1028dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.93.7.10183Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20061010b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/22  aOther US 7aarticle03006naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001800180245008700198300001600285500002400301500001500325520116000340650002101500650002001521650001101541650002001552650002201572650001901594650003201613650002101645650002601666650001201692650001801704650003401722650002001756650002801776650003101804650002101835650003501856650006101891650003301952650002301985653002802008653002502036653000802061700001502069700001602084700002302100700001602123773009902139852000902238856007602247930003302323945002502356946001102381655001202392IND4382181020221116163742.0060723e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438218102DNAL7 a168793482pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2006.01468.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2001 aLambeth, L.S.10aComparison of bovine RNA polymerase III promoters for short hairpin RNA expression  ap. 369-372.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRNA interference (RNAi) mediated by DNA-based expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is a powerful method of sequence-specific gene knockdown. A number of vectors for expression of shRNA have been developed that feature promoters from RNA polymerase III (pol III)-transcribed genes of mouse or human origin. To advance the use of RNAi as a tool for functional genomic research and for future development of specific therapeutics in the bovine species, we have developed shRNA expression vectors that feature novel bovine RNA pol III promoters. We characterized two bovine U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) promoters (bU6-2 and bU6-3) and a bovine 7SK snRNA promoter (b7SK). We compared the efficiency of each of these promoters to express shRNA molecules. Promoter activity was measured in the context of RNAi by targeting and suppressing the reporter gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein. Results show that the b7SK promoter induced the greatest level of suppression in a range of cell lines. The comparison of these bovine promoters in shRNA expression is an important component for the future development of bovine-specific RNAi-based research. 3aRNA interference 3agenetic vectors 3acattle 3agene expression 3asmall nuclear RNA 3areporter genes 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3apromoter regions 3asmall interfering RNA 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattlexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Reporter 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA Polymerase IIIxmetabolism 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRNA, Small Nuclearxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aRNA1 aWise, T.G.1 aMoore, R.J.1 aMuralitharan, M.S.1 aDoran, T.J.0 tAnimal genetics.g2006 Aug., v. 37, no. 4 p.369-372dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2006.01468.x3electronic resource  a20061018b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02299naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245012100170300001400291500018400305500002400489520094600513650003001459650000801489650002101497650001401518650001401532650001001546650002001556650001001576650001101586650001001597650003001607650002201637700001701659773013801676852000901814856009001823655001201913IND4463258620221116163721.0120521s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446325862DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.941.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikhailov, R.V.10aAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of plum cultivar 'Startovaya' by self-complementary hairpin RNA of PPV-CP gene  ap. 85-90.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Genetic Modifications, Challenges and Opportunities for Horticulture in the World, held September 16-20, 2007, Ski, Norway.  aIncludes references  a‘RNA silencing’ refers to related processes of post-transcriptional control of gene expression found in plants, animals and fungi. In higher plants, RNA silencing serves as an adaptive, antiviral defense system, which is transmitted systemically in response to localized virus challenge. This mechanism is remarkably efficient because, once activated by aberrant or foreign RNA molecules, it is primed against any cytoplasm RNA species sharing sequence homology with the triggering molecules. Plum (P. domestica L.) leaves of the cultivar ‘Startovaya’ were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL0:pCamPPVRNAi carrying the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt), the gus gene and self-complementary sequences of fragment of PPV-CP gene separated by an intron to produce a “hairpin” RNA (hp-RNA) structure. Regenerated plums on hygromycin media were analyzed by GUS assays and by PCR detection of the PPV CP gene. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3acultivars 3acytoplasm 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3aplums 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology1 aDolgov, S.V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Dec., , no. 941 p.85-90dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.941.53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02339naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245006100176300001600237500011900253500002400372520114400396650001001540650001701550650001301567650000901580650001001589650001401599650001601613650001301629650000901642650001601651650000901667651001301676700002201689773014101711852000901852856009201861655001201953IND4463205920221116163613.0120514s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446320592DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.585.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarmund, Michele R.10aRest completion in seven blackberry (Rubus sp) cultivars  ap. 693-696.  aPaper presented at the Eighth International Rubus and Ribes Symposium, Volume 2, held July 2001, Dundee, Scotland.  aIncludes references  aTissue samples of 'Apache', 'Arapaho', 'Chickasaw', 'Illini Hardy', 'Kiowa', 'Navaho' and 'Shawnee' were obtained from a field planting located in Mountain Grove, Missouri to compare the time of rest completion and percentage of bud break among these blackberry cultivars. Blackberry tissue was collected at monthly intervals from December 2000 to March 2001. Twelve, eight-node sections of wood were removed from the middle portion of lateral canes located 60 cm from the soil surface and placed under mist in a greenhouse at =21oC. In December, the only cultivar that had completed rest was 'Kiowa'. Thirteen percent of the buds on ‘Kiowa’ cuttings grew within 29 days of exposure to warm temperatures. In January, all cultivars grew within an average of 18 to 24 days, except 'Illini Hardy'. By February, average days to bud break for 'Kiowa', 'Arapaho', 'Shawnee', Chickasaw', 'Navaho', 'Apache' and 'Illini Hardy' cuttings under mist were 5.3, 7.9, 8.2, 8.9, 9.2, 10.7, and 12.4, respectively.

This area has the lowest precipitation rate in Poland, the annual rainfall does not exceed 500 mm and from April to September is 324 mm. This region of Poland has the highest irrigation requirement for cultivated plants. The main purpose of the study was to recognize the influence of drip and micro-sprinkler methods of irrigation on the growth and yield of black currant grown in the very light soil during the initial harvesting seasons. Experiments were established as one-factorial trial, in randomized block design in four replications. The examined factor was irrigation. Three variants of irrigation have been examined: I - control (without irrigation), II - drip irrigation, III - micro-sprinkler irrigation at a soil moisture tension of up to - 0.03 MPa. Experimental periods should be recognized as dry, because the average rainfall amount for the growing season (April-September) was 64 mm lower than the mean long-term precipitation (324 mm) of the period. Average seasonal water rates amounted 197 mm in case of micro-sprinkler irrigation and 116 mm in case of drip irrigation. The experiment was located on a soil classified to Typic Hapludolls. The clay content was 7 % in the top soil and from 3 to 5 % in the sub-soil. The average organic matter content was 1.19 %. The water reserve to 1 m depth of soil at field capacity was 88 mm and the available water 68 mm. Black currants were planted in autumn 1991. The cultivar used was ‘Titania’. The plot area was 25 m2 (2.5 x 10 m) and included 10 bushes. The results indicated the decisive role of water on the outcome of yield and quality of black currant cultivated on a soil of limited water holding capability. The experiment proved that black currant production in such climatic-soil conditions was only possible with the use of irrigation. The irrigation factor significantly increased the growth, the fruit weight and yields of berries. Vitamin A and C content was differentiated more strongly by micro-sprinkler irrigation than by drip irrigation. In most cases under irrigation, the content of both vitamins in fruits decreased. 3aHapludolls 3aRibes nigrum 3aautumn 3ablack currants 3aclay 3acultivars 3afield capacity 3afield experimentation 3afruits 3agrowing season 3airrigation requirement 3amicroirrigation 3aorganic matter 3aplanting 3arain 3asandy soils 3asoil depth 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3atopsoil 3avitamin A 3aPoland1 aRolbiecki, R.1 aRzekanowski, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Sept., , no. 585 p.649-652dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.585.1073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01833naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245008400166300001600250500011900266500002400385520074100409650001001150650001501160650001201175650002401187650000901211650001601220651001301236700001601249773014101265852000901406856009201415655001201507IND4463205720221116163903.0120514s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446320572DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.585.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, M.13aAn investigation of factors affecting yield of red raspberry (Rubus) in Tayside  ap. 683-687.  aPaper presented at the Eighth International Rubus and Ribes Symposium, Volume 2, held July 2001, Dundee, Scotland.  aIncludes references  aThis paper presents the results of a statistical study of factors that affect the yield of red raspberry in the Tayside region of Scotland. The main objective was to determine the causes of the apparent recent decline in raspberry yields in the region. The data were largely obtained from grower members of the Scottish Soft Fruit Growers Cooperative, and were supplemented by some national harvest records and meteorological data from the UK Meteorological Office. The correlation analysis failed to show any association of yield with rainfall variation, but variation in temperature had a major effect on yields. An important factor related to differences in yields of different holdings was the average root-rot score on the holding. 3aRubus 3acrop yield 3agrowers 3ameteorological data 3arain 3atemperature 3aScotland1 aJones, H.G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Sept., , no. 585 p.683-687dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.585.1133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03068naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001500156245012800171300001800299500002400317520106600341650001501407650001801422650001401440650001701454650001901471650002401490650002001514650001801534650002301552650001101575650002701586650002101613650001301634650001201647650001301659650001101672650004501683650001901728650001101747650004101758650003801799650002201837650001801859650004701877650002401924650000901948650002301957650002001980650002802000650003402028650002402062651001202086651001202098700001802110700001702128700001302145773012002158852000902278930003302287945002502320946001302345655001202358IND4382025220221116163712.0060717e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438202522DNAL7 a168406382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL840 0aL1001 aHarder, B.10aGenetic Parameters for Health Traits and Their Relationship to Different Persistency Traits in German Holstein Dairy Cattle  ap. 3202-3212.  aIncludes references  aData from 3,200 Holstein cows from 3 commercial dairy farms in Germany were used to estimate heritabilities and breeding values for liability to udder diseases (UD), fertility diseases (FD), metabolic diseases (MD), and claw and leg diseases (CLD) using single-trait threshold sire models. A total of 92,722 medical treatments recorded from 1998 to 2003 were included in the analysis. Approximate genetic correlations between persistency of milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, and persistency of milk energy yield and liability to the health traits were calculated based on correlations between EBV. Posterior means of heritability of liability ranged from 0.05 to 0.08 for UD, from 0.04 to 0.07 for FD, from 0.08 to 0.12 for MD, and from 0.04 to 0.07 for CLD. Approximate genetic correlations of the disease traits with the persistency traits were favorable, except for MD in all lactations, which were unfavorable, and UD, which were around zero. Highest correlations in the range of 0.13 to 0.46 were found between the different persistency traits and CLD. 3adairy cows 3aanimal health 3alongevity 3aheritability 3abreeding value 3agenetic correlation 3acattle diseases 3afoot diseases 3ametabolic diseases 3ahooves 3amammary gland diseases 3afemale fertility 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFoot Diseasesxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenetic Variation 2aHoof and Claw 2aInfertility, Femalexgeneticsxveterinary. 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMale 2aMastitisxgenetics 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aRegression Analysis 3aGermany 0aGermany1 aBennewitz, J.1 aHinrichs, D.1 aKalm, E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Aug., v. 89, no. 8 p.3202-3212dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle02262naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012300175300001600298520083700314650001401151650000901165650001101174650002001185650002401205650001401229650001201243650001601255650002201271650001801293650001201311650001101323650001101334650002601345650001601371650002201387650002401409651000901433653002001442653001301462700002001475700002101495773010701516852000901623856009201632930003301724946001101757655001201768IND4424771620221116163707.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442477162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2009.00395.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitale, Jeffrey D.10aEstimating the supply response of cotton and cereal crops in smallholder production systems: recent evidence from Mali  ap. 519-533.  aCotton is one of the most important crops in West Africa and is a major catalyst of economic development in rural areas, but the sector has suffered from a decline in the world cotton price after 1999. This article exploits an unusual data set following 82 farmers over 14 years, from 1994 through 2007, to estimate a Nerlovian supply response model for cotton, maize, sorghum, and millet in long-term rotation. The resulting system of equations is estimated with two-stage least squares (2SLS), showing that this sample of Malian cotton producers have responded to prices in a relatively inelastic manner, with supply elasticities only about one-half of those estimated for producers in developed countries. Policy reforms could help producers respond more easily to prices changes, as well as to raise average productivity levels. 3acatalysts 3acorn 3acotton 3adata collection 3adeveloped countries 3aequations 3afarmers 3agrain crops 3aissues and policy 3aleast squares 3amillets 3amodels 3aprices 3aproduction technology 3arural areas 3arural development 3asupply elasticities 3aMali 0aSupply response 0aRotation1 aDjourra, Hamady1 aSidibé, Aminata0 tAgricultural economics.g2009 Sept., v. 40, no. 5 p.519-533dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2009.00395.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03815naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001600147245011300163300001800276500002400294500001500318520156800333650002801901650001901929650001201948650001201960650001701972650001301989650001902002650002802021650001902049650001902068650002402087650003102111650002102142650002102163650001202184650001202196650001302208650002202221650002102243650001502264650004702279650001902326650001102345650001902356650001302375650002202388650000902410650003102419650002802450650002602478650002302504650001302527650004002540650002802580650002402608651001202632653002102644653004402665700001802709700001602727700001602743700002302759700001402782700001302796773012002809852000902929930003302938945002502971946001302996655001203009IND4382024720221116163530.0060717e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438202472DNAL7 a168406332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL1001 aSanders, K.10aCharacterization of the DGAT1 Mutations and the CSN1S1 Promoter in the German Angeln Dairy Cattle Population  ap. 3164-3174.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genes with influence on milk production traits has been the objective of various mapping studies in the last decade. In the centromeric region of Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 14, the acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase1 gene (DGAT1) has been identified as the most likely causative gene underlying a QTL for milk fat yield and content. Recently, a second polymorphism in the promoter of DGAT1 emerged as an additional source of variation. In this study, the frequencies and the effects of alleles at the DGAT1 K232A and at the DGAT1 promoter variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus on BTA14, and of alleles at the CSN1S1 (αS₁-casein-encoding gene) promoter on BTA6 in the German Angeln dairy cattle population were investigated. Analyzed traits were milk, fat, protein, lactose, and milk energy yield, fat, protein, lactose, and milk energy content and somatic cell score. The lysine variant of the DGAT1 K232A mutation showed significant effects for most of the milk production traits. A specific allele of the DGAT1 promoter VNTR showed significant effects on the traits lactose yield and content, milk energy content, and SCS compared with the other alleles. Additionally, a regulation mechanism between the DGAT1 K232A mutation and the DGAT1 promoter VNTR was found for fat yield and content, which could be caused by an upper physiological bound for the effects of the DGAT1 gene. At the CSN1S1 promoter, 2 of 4 alleles showed significant allele substitution effects on the milk yield traits. 3aquantitative trait loci 3aenergy content 3alactose 3aalleles 3adairy breeds 3amutation 3aalphaS1-casein 3atandem repeat sequences 3agene frequency 3amilk fat yield 3amilk fat percentage 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 3aacyltransferases 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCaseinsxgenetics 2aCattlexgenetics 2aCell Count 2aDiacylglycerol O-Acyltransferasexgenetics 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenotype 2aLactosexanalysis 2aMale 2aMilkxchemistryxcytology. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aMinisatellite Repeats 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPedigree 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aRegression Analysis 3aGermany 0amilk composition 0aacyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase1 aBennewitz, J.1 aReinsch, N.1 aThaller, G.1 aPrinzenberg, E.-M.1 aKühn, C.1 aKalm, E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Aug., v. 89, no. 8 p.3164-3174dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle02688naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001600147245013300163300001800296500002400314520105900338650001501397650002301412650002701435650001901462650002001481650001401501650001201515650001301527650002101540650001501561650003501576650003701611650001101648650002001659650002001679650001301699650000901712650002701721650001901748650001401767650002801781651001001809651001001819700001401829700002101843700001801864700001601882773012001898852000902018930003302027945002502060946001302085655001202098IND4382024820221116163631.0060717e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438202482DNAL7 a168406342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL1001 aLongeri, M.10aShort Communication: Quantitative Trait Loci Affecting the Somatic Cell Score on Chromosomes 4 and 26 in Italian Holstein Cattle  ap. 3175-3177.  aIncludes references  aThis work aimed to confirm previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting the somatic cell score (SCS) in dairy cattle on Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) 4 and 26. A granddaughter design with selective genotyping was implemented that included half-sib families from 12 male lines of Italian Holstein cattle. The animals were genotyped for 5 microsatellite markers each on regions of BTA 4 (average marker spacing 9.42 cM) and BTA 26 (average marker spacing 5.26 cM), previously reported by other authors as carrying QTL for somatic cell count. Quantitative trait loci analyses were performed using interval mapping by regressing sire breeding values for SCS onto genotype probabilities at 1-cM intervals along the 2 chromosome regions. Breeding values for SCS were estimated for the whole population using a test-day repeatability animal model. Results were not significant on a chromosome basis, but a possible QTL was found at BM4505 on BTA 26, confirming this region for further studies of QTL affecting SCS in the Italian Holstein population. 3adairy cows 3asomatic cell count 3amicrosatellite repeats 3abreeding value 3asire evaluation 3aautosomes 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aCell Count 2aChromosome Mappingxveterinary 2aChromosomes, Mammalianxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMilkxcytology 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 3aItaly 0aItaly1 aPolli, M.1 aStrillacci, M.G.1 aSamorè, A.B.1 aZanotti, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Aug., v. 89, no. 8 p.3175-3177dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle03832naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001800147245009200165300001800257500002400275500001500299520181100314650001502125650001802140650001602158650001702174650002002191650002002211650001802231650001802249650002602267650002502293650001202318650003302330650006902363650001102432650007102443650004402514650002602558650003402584650003102618650001102649650002102660650004202681650005802723650002102781650004502802650004102847650003202888651001502920651001502935700001702950700001502967773012002982852000903102930003303111945002503144946001303169655001203182IND4382025520221116163605.0060717e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438202552DNAL7 a168406412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL1001 aRaymond, M.J.10aAssessment and Promotion of Judicious Antibiotic Use on Dairy Farms in Washington State  ap. 3228-3240.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aims of this study were to describe antibiotic use and biosecurity practices among Washington State dairy producers and to evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative approach to promoting judicious antibiotic use on dairy farms. In collaboration with a statewide industry group, Washington State dairy producers participated in a written, self-administered survey in 2003. They were then provided several educational interventions followed by a second written survey in 2005. Sixty-five percent (381) of dairy producers completed the 2003 survey. The most commonly cited drugs used for disease treatment were penicillin, ceftiofur, and oxytetracycline. Participants also indicated significant preventive uses with 28% using medicated milk replacer. Most producers appeared to consider intramammary infusion at dry-off to be a treatment rather than a preventative practice. Twenty-three percent of initial respondents indicated at least one extra-label use of antibiotics, yet only half routinely consulted with a veterinarian when doing so. Most agreed that using written protocols for disease treatment could reduce errors, but less than one-third had protocols. After the educational intervention there was a tendency toward reduced use of antibiotic medicated milk replacer: 51% of producers who originally reported using medicated milk replacer discontinued this practice, whereas 12% of producers began using medicated milk replacer between the 2003 and 2005 surveys. Most reported that the resources and educational materials were useful. Areas where additional work is needed include reducing the use of medicated milk replacer, increasing veterinary involvement in antibiotic use decisions, implementing treatment protocols, enhancing biosecurity, and ensuring optimal cow and calf immunity. 3adairy cows 3amilk replacer 3aantibiotics 3acalf feeding 3amedicated feeds 3adisease control 3adairy farming 3aveterinarians 3alivestock biosecurity 3abacterial infections 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornximmunology 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aCephalosporinsxadministration & dosage 2aColostrumximmunology 2aDairyingxeducationxmethods. 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aFemale 2aHealth Education 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aMastitis, Bovinexdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aMilk Substitutes 2aOxytetracyclinexadministration & dosage 2aPenicillinsxadministration & dosage 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 0aWashington 0aWashington1 aWohrle, R.D.1 aCall, D.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Aug., v. 89, no. 8 p.3228-3240dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle02085naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245019200164300001600356520094800372650001601320650002501336650002301361650001101384653002901395653001201424653002301436700001701459773013801476852000901614856009201623930003301715946001101748655001201759IND4422049520221116163719.0090619e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442204952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1470-6431.2009.00784.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jay10a'Hello, Mrs. Sarah Jones!

Consumers' perceptions about personalized advertising: comparisons across advertisements delivered via three different types of media  ap. 503-514.  aAs new technologies (e.g. online, mobile and interactive TV) develop worldwide, numerous types of personalized advertising, in which companies use an individual's name and/or other types of personal information, have become more popular in many countries. Using many types of information about specific individuals, personalized advertising is designed to convey a customized message at the right time to the right person using diverse media. However, despite its universally increased use, few academic studies have explored the effectiveness of personalized advertising and consumers' response to it. This exploratory study focused on consumers' perceptions of personalized advertising delivered online (e-mail) and offline (letter and telephone call). The results show that consumers generally have negative perceptions of personalized advertising, regardless of how it is delivered, with the strongest negative reaction to telephone calls. 3aadvertising 3abusiness enterprises 3aconsumer attitudes 3ae-mail 0aPersonalized advertising 0aprivacy 0aadvertising effect1 aCude, Brenda0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2009 July, v. 33, no. 4 p.503-514dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1470-64237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2009.00784.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03750naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245014700193300001800340520138800358650001301746650001201759650002301771650001101794650001901805650001201824650001201836650001301848650001701861650002701878650001401905650001101919650001401930650001201944650001301956650001501969650002301984650001002007650002502017650001002042650001202052650001702064650002302081650003102104650002502135650002902160650002802189650003002217650003602247650002202283650002202305650002102327651001102348651001102359653001902370653001702389653002102406700003502427700001902462700002202481700002102503700003002524700002802554700002102582700001902603700002502622700002502647773012702672852000902799856009202808930003302900946001102933655001202944IND4425777620221116163704.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442577762DNAL7 a195584072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02012.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHANG, YONG-JIANG10aSize-dependent mortality in a Neotropical savanna tree: the role of height-related adjustments in hydraulic architecture and carbon allocation  ap. 1456-1466.  aSize-related changes in hydraulic architecture, carbon allocation and gas exchange of Sclerolobium paniculatum (Leguminosae), a dominant tree species in Neotropical savannas of central Brazil (Cerrado), were investigated to assess their potential role in the dieback of tall individuals. Trees greater than ~6-m-tall exhibited more branch damage, larger numbers of dead individuals, higher wood density, greater leaf mass per area, lower leaf area to sapwood area ratio (LA/SA), lower stomatal conductance and lower net CO₂ assimilation than small trees. Stem-specific hydraulic conductivity decreased, while leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity remained nearly constant, with increasing tree size because of lower LA/SA in larger trees. Leaves were substantially more vulnerable to embolism than stems. Large trees had lower maximum leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) than small trees and all tree sizes exhibited lower Kleaf at midday than at dawn. These size-related adjustments in hydraulic architecture and carbon allocation apparently incurred a large physiological cost: large trees received a lower return in carbon gain from their investment in stem and leaf biomass compared with small trees. Additionally, large trees may experience more severe water deficits in dry years due to lower capacity for buffering the effects of hydraulic path-length and soil water deficits. 3aFabaceae 3abiomass 3abuffering capacity 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acerrado 3adieback 3aembolism 3agas exchange 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amortality 3asapwood 3asavannas 3asoil water 3asoil water deficit 3astems 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 3atropics 3awood density 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aFabaceaexphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aPlant Stemsxphysiology 2aPlant Stomataxphysiology 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 2aWaterxphysiology 2aWoodxphysiology 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0acarbon balance 0atree dieback 0axylem cavitation1 aMeinzer, F.

Anti-TNF-α therapies have been established successfully in the clinic for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. TNF-α-blocking strategies are now being trialled in asthma; however, their mode of action is poorly understood. Based on the observation that TNF-α induces lymph node hypertrophy we have attempted to investigate this as a mechanism of action of TNF-α in airway inflammation by employing two models of murine airway inflammation, that we have termed short and long models, representing severe and mild/moderate asthma, respectively. The models differ by their immunization schedules. In the short model, characterized by eosinophilic and neutrophilic airway inflammation the effect of TNF-α blockade was a reduction in draining lymph node (DLN) hypertrophy, eosinophilia, interleukin (IL)-5 production and immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. In the long model, characterized by eosinophilic inflammation, TNF-α blockade produced a reduction in DLN hypertrophy and IL-5 production but had limited effects on eosinophilia and IgE production. These results indicate that anti-TNF-α can suppress DLN hypertrophy and decrease airway inflammation. Further investigations showed that anti-TNF-α-induced inhibition of DLN hypertrophy cannot be explained by preventing l-selectin-dependent capture of lymphocytes into the DLN. Given that overall TNF blockade was able to suppress the short model (severe) more effectively than the long model (mild/moderate), the results suggest that TNF-α blocking therapies may be more effective in the treatment of severe asthma. 3aT-lymphocytes 0aairway hypersensitivity 0aairway inflammation 0aIgE 0aTNF-α1 aChoo-Kang, B.S.W.1 aBundick, R.V.1 aLeishman, A.J.1 aBrewer, J.M.1 aMcInnes, I.B.1 aGarside, P.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 Jan., v. 151, no. 1 p.114-122dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03509.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02976naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001800185245012600203300001600329500022800345500002400573500001500597520138800612650002002000650001602020650001502036650001102051650001702062650002502079650001702104650001702121653001802138700001602156700001702172700001902189700001602208773011902224852000902343856007302352930003302425945002502458946001102483655001202494IND4382005820221116163819.0060717e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438200582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL400 0aM0011 aBolognesi, C.10aAssessment of micronuclei induction in peripheral erythrocytes of fish exposed to xenobiotics under controlled conditions  ap.

MN frequency baseline in erythrocytes was evaluated in a number of fish species from a reference area (S. Teresa, La Spezia Gulf) and genotoxic potential of a number of common chemical contaminants and mixtures was determined in fish experimentally exposed in aquarium under controlled conditions. Fish (Scophthalmus maximus) were exposed for 3 weeks to 50 ppb of single chemicals (dialkyl phthalate, bisphenol A, tetrabromodiphenyl ether), 30 ppb nonylphenol and mixtures (North Sea oil and North Sea oil with alkylated phenols). Chromosomal damage was determined as micronuclei (MN) frequency in fish erythrocytes. Nuclear anomalies such as blebbed, notched and lobed nuclei were also recorded. Significant increase in MN frequency was observed in erythrocytes of fish exposed to bisphenol A and tetrabromodiphenylether. Chemical mixture North Sea oil + alkylated phenols induced the highest MN frequency (2.95 micronucleated cells/1000 cells compared to 1 MNcell/1000 cells in control animals). The study results revealed that micronucleus test, as an index of cumulative exposure, appears to be a sensitive model to evaluate genotoxic compounds in fish under controlled conditions. 3awater pollution 3axenobiotics 3abiomarkers 3aturbot 3aerythrocytes 3aScophthalmus maximus 3acell nucleus 3agenotoxicity 0aPsetta maxima1 aPerrone, E.1 aRoggieri, P.1 aPampanin, D.M.1 aSciutto, A.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2006 June 1, v. 78, no. 1 p.S93-S98dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.02.0153electronic resource  a20070108b20070202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/01/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02662naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007800167300001600245520169500261650001701956653000901973653004401982700002002026700002102046700001502067700002102082773010702103852000902210856008502219930003302304946001102337655001202348IND4426853320221116163829.0091002e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442685332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-008-9246-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebley, Peter W. 10aAutomated forecasting of volcanic ash dispersion utilizing Virtual Globes  ap. 345-361.  aThere are over 100 active volcanoes in the North Pacific (NOPAC) region, most of which are located in sparsely populated areas. Dispersion models play an important role in forecasting the movement of volcanic ash clouds by complementing both remote sensing data and visual observations from the ground and aircraft. Puff is a three-dimensional dispersion model, primarily designed for forecasting volcanic ash dispersion, used by the Alaska Volcano Observatory and other agencies. Since early 2007, the model is in an automated mode to predict the movement of airborne volcanic ash at multiple elevated alert status volcanoes worldwide to provide immediate information when an eruption occurs. Twelve of the predictions are within the NOPAC region, nine more within the southern section of the Pacific ring of fire and the others are in Europe and the Caribbean. Model forecasts are made for initial ash plumes ranging from 4 to 20 km altitude above sea level and for a 24-h forecast period. This information is made available via the Puff model website. Model results can be displayed in Virtual Globes for three-dimensional visualization. Here, we show operational Puff predictions in two and three-dimensions in Google Earth®, both as iso-surfaces and particles, and study past eruptions to illustrate the capabilities that the Virtual Globes can provide. In addition, we show the opportunity that Google Maps® provides in displaying Puff operational predictions via an application programming web interface and how radiosonde data (vertical soundings) and numerical weather prediction vertical profiles can be displayed in Virtual Globes for assisting in estimating ash cloud heights. 3avolcanic ash 0aPuff 0aDispersion modelling and Virtual Globes1 aDean, Kenneson 1 aBailey, John E. 1 aDehn, Jon 1 aPeterson, Rorik 0 tNatural hazards.g2009 Nov., v. 51, no. 2 p.345-361dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-008-9246-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03075naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001600193245018300209300001600392520101000408650001701418650008601435650001001521650003201531650002601563650005401589650005401643650002001697650002301717650001101740650002801751650001101779650005101790650000901841650004101850650002401891650002901915650004001944653003001984653002502014700001902039700001702058700001702075700001602092700001502108700002002123700001702143700001602160700001802176773013402194852000902328856009202337930003302429946001102462655001202473IND4397711020221116163736.0071111e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439771102DNAL7 a111222422pmid7 aPMC19058142pmcid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2249.2000.01375.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoretti, S.10aApoptosis and apoptosis-associated perturbations of peripheral blood lymphocytes during HIV infection: comparison between AIDS patients and asymptomatic long-term non-progressors  ap. 364-373.  aThis study was designed to compare the degree of lymphocyte apoptosis and Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) expression in AIDS patients and long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) and correlate these parameters with apoptosis-associated perturbations in lymphocyte function. LTNPs had a lower frequency of apoptotic CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells compared with subjects with AIDS. This correlated with a lower frequency of cells expressing Fas and FasL. The frequency of selected lymphocyte populations exhibiting a disrupted mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and increased superoxide generation was lower in LTNPs than in patients with AIDS; these abnormalities were associated with lower levels of caspase-1 activation in LTNPs. The results indicate a significantly reduced level of apoptosis and apoptosis-associated parameters in LTNPs than in patients developing AIDS. Based on these findings, a crucial role for mitochondria can be predicted in the process of lymphocyte apoptosis during the evolution of AIDS. 3amitochondria 2aAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndromexbloodximmunologyxphysiopathologyxvirology. 2aAdult 2afas Receptorxbiosynthesis. 2aApoptosisximmunology 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesxcytologyximmunology. 2aCD8-Positive T-Lymphocytesxcytologyximmunology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aFas Ligand Protein 2aFemale 2aHIV Long-Term Survivors 2aHumans 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxcytologyximmunology. 2aMale 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxbiosynthesis 2aMembrane Potentials 2aMitochondriaxphysiology 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0along-term non-progressors 0alymphocyte apoptosis1 aMarcellini, S.1 aBoschini, A.1 aFamularo, G.1 aSantini, G.1 aAlesse, E.1 aSteinberg, S.M.1 aCifone, M.G.1 aKroemer, G.1 aDe Simone, C.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2000 Dec., v. 122, no. 3 p.364-373dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2249.2000.01375.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02760naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245011800156300001600274520114000290650004401430650001901474650001201493650001101505650001801516650001101534650002601545650003901571650001601610650002101626650004401647650001801691650000901709650002201718650001001740653000901750653001001759653002601769653003001795700002101825700001901846700002701865700002001892700002201912700002501934700002401959773010701983852000902090856007502099930003302174946001102207655001202218IND4424796820221116163832.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442479682DNAL7 a10.1071/SR082312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatzber, Michael10aSpectroscopic behaviour of ¹⁴C-labeled humic acids in a long-term field experiment with three cropping systems  ap. 459-469.  aThe stabilisation of ¹⁴C-labelled farmyard manure was investigated under different cropping systems (crop rotation, monoculture, and bare fallow) in a long-term field experiment established in 1967. Solid-state ¹³C-NMR of bulk soils yielded a gradient of increasing aromatic properties in the order: straw manure-crop rotation<straw manure-monoculture<straw and farmyard manure-bare fallow. The opposite trend was observed for O-alkyl groups. The farmyard manure-bare fallow treatment was used to investigate changes of humic acids (HAs) with time. The FT-IR bands of aromatics, carbonyl groups, and a band of methyls and benzene rings increased over the 36 years of the experiment, whereas 2 amide bands and a band of sulfone and/or ester groups decreased. Fluorescence spectroscopy verified the increase in aromatic properties with age. Consequently, during soil organic matter stabilisation, HAs showed increasing properties of carbonyl and aromatic groups, whereas amidic groups decreased. The dynamic character of HAs, as shown by ¹⁴C, was also reflected by distinct spectroscopic changes over the period of investigation. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanimal manures 3abenzene 3acarbon 3acrop rotation 3afallow 3afield experimentation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahumic acids 3aisotope labeling 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aradionuclides 3asoil 3aspectral analysis 3astraw 0acrop 0aFT-IR 0asolid-state ¹³C-NMR 0afluorescence spectroscopy1 aStemmer, Michael1 aSpiegel, Heide1 aKatzlberger, Christian1 aZehetner, Franz1 aHaberhauer, Georg1 aGarcia-Garcia, Elena1 aGerzabek, Martin H.0 tSoil research.g2009, v. 47, no. 5 p.459-469dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-95737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR082313Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03660naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001200193245010700205300001600312520175200328650001602080650001402096650001202110650002902122650002802151650002702179650004202206650001102248650003402259650004102293650002002334650003602354650000902390650002302399650001602422650004002438650004402478650006902522650007102591650002202662653002002684653002002704653001702724700001802741700001502759700001302774700001602787773013402803852000902937856009202946930003303038946001103071655001203082IND4396216820221116163910.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439621682DNAL7 a178224442pmid7 aPMC22193412pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03491.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, A.10aLeptin improves pulmonary bacterial clearance and survival in ob/ob mice during pneumococcal pneumonia  ap. 332-339.  aThe adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is an important regulator of appetite and energy expenditure and is now appreciated for its ability to control innate and adaptive immune responses. We have reported previously that the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse exhibited increased susceptibility to the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this report we assessed the impact of chronic leptin deficiency, using ob/ob mice, on pneumococcal pneumonia and examined whether restoring circulating leptin to physiological levels in vivo could improve host defences against this pathogen. We observed that ob/ob mice, compared with wild-type (WT) animals, exhibited enhanced lethality and reduced pulmonary bacterial clearance following Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge. These impairments in host defence in ob/ob mice were associated with elevated levels of lung tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, macrophage inflammatory peptide (MIP)-2 [correction added after online publication 28 September 2007: definition of MIP corrected], prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), lung neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) counts, defective alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytosis and PMN killing of S. pneumoniae in vitro. Exogenous leptin administration to ob/ob mice in vivo improved survival and greatly improved pulmonary bacterial clearance, reduced bacteraemia, reconstituted AM phagocytosis and PMN H₂O₂ production and killing of S. pneumoniae in vitro. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that leptin improves pulmonary bacterial clearance and survival in ob/ob mice during pneumococcal pneumonia. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether there is a potential therapeutic role for this adipokine in immunocompromised patients. 3aneutrophils 3anutrition 2aAnimals 2aBacteremiaxdrug therapy 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aDrug Evaluation, Preclinicalxmethods 2aFemale 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLeptinxdeficiencyxtherapeutic use. 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLungximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Obese 2aNeutrophil Infiltrationximmunology 2aPhagocytosisxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aPneumonia, Pneumococcalxdrug therapyximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aStreptococcus pneumoniaexisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aSurvival Analysis 0alipid mediators 0alung immunology 0apneumococcus1 aAronoff, D.M.1 aPhipps, J.1 aGoel, D.1 aMancuso, P.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Nov., v. 150, no. 2 p.332-339dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03491.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03074naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245016500169300001800334500002400352520171800376650001702094650002502111650001502136650001602151650001702167650001902184650002002203650001802223650001302241650003702254650001302291650003302304650001002337650001602347650001202363700002302375700002702398700002102425773010002446852000902546856008502555655001202640IND4463303320221116163754.0120524s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330332DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.15492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Brendan F.10aEvaluation of serum concentrations of biochemical markers of bone metabolism and insulin-like growth factor I associated with treadmill exercise in young horses  ap. 1549-1556.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To evaluate changes in serum concentrations of biochemical markers of bone metabolism and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) associated with treadmill exercise in young horses. Animals-12 two-year-old Thoroughbred mares. Procedure-During a 20-week study period, 6 horses were exercised on a treadmill 3 times a week (exercise group) and 6 horses received walking exercise 6 days a week (controls). Serum concentrations or activity of biochemical markers and IGF-I were assessed biweekly. Bone mineral density and content of the first phalanx were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorbiometry (DEXA) on completion of the study. Results-Compared with values in controls, bone mineral density and content were higher and serum concentrations of osteocalcin (a marker of bone formation) and the carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (a marker of bone resorption; ICTP) were lower in exercised horses. Serum concentration and activity of the bone formation markers carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I collagen and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were not different between the 2 groups. Serum IGF-I concentration was lower in the exercise group, compared with control values; there was a significant correlation between change in IGF-I values and changes in osteocalcin, ICTP, and BAP values at the end of the study. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Treadmill exercise over 20 weeks induced adaptive changes in bones of 2-year-old Thoroughbreds; training appears to increase bone mineral density, thereby enhancing mechanical strength of bone, but decreases bone turnover. Results indicated an association between changes in serum IGF-I concentration and bone cell activity in horses. 3aThoroughbred 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3abone strength 3acollagen 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aexercise 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amares 3aosteocalcin 3awalking1 aGoodship, Allen E.1 aEastell, R.q(Richard)1 aPrice, Joanna S.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2003 Dec., v. 64, no. 12 p.1549-1556x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.15493Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03892naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245008800192300001400280500001500294520165800309650002101967650001201988650001002000650001102010650002302021650001002044650002302054650001802077650001202095650001102107650001102118650002602129650001602155650001602171650001402187650001002201650002202211650001402233650001502247650001202262650001702274650003802291650001902329650001702348650001502365650005902380650005302439650004202492650007802534650002702612650005502639650004902694653001702743653003602760653001502796653001202811700001502823700001802838700002402856700002502880773010802905852000903013856009203022930003303114946001103147655001203158IND4422336320221116163805.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442233632DNAL7 a193094622pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03847.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Adriane14aThe MYB transcription factor GhMYB25 regulates early fibre and trichome development  ap. 52-62.  a2019-12-04  aLittle is still known about the developmental control of the long seed coat trichomes of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). In Arabidopsis, leaf trichome initiation is regulated by a group of well-defined transcription factors that includes MYB and homeodomain types. Many MYBs are expressed in fibres, but their roles in fibre development remain unclear. We analysed the function of one MYB transcription factor, GhMYB25, identified from transcriptome comparisons between wild-type and fibreless cotton mutants. A GhMYB25 promoter-GUS construct in transgenic cotton was expressed in the epidermis of ovules, developing fibre initials and fibres, in the trichomes of a number of tissues including leaves, stems and petals, as well as in the anthers, pollen and the epidermal layers of roots and root initials, but not in root hairs. Cotton is an allotetraploid with two very similar GhMYB25 genes that were silenced by a single RNAi construct. GhMYB25-silenced cotton showed alterations in the timing of rapid fibre elongation, resulting in short fibres, dramatic reductions in trichomes on other parts of the plant, and reductions in seed production. Reciprocal crosses between transgenic and non-transgenic plants indicated that pollen and ovule viability per se were not disrupted. Ectopic over-expression of GhMYB25 had more subtle impacts, with increases in cotton fibre initiation and leaf trichome number. High expression appeared to adversely affect fertility. Our results provide convincing evidence for a role of GhMYB25, like other MIXTA-like MYBS, in regulating specialized outgrowths of epidermal cells, including, in this case, cotton fibres. 3aRNA interference 3acorolla 3agenes 3apollen 3areciprocal crosses 3astems 3aGossypium hirsutum 3atranscriptome 3atissues 3aleaves 3aovules 3atranscription factors 3aArabidopsis 3alint cotton 3aviability 3atesta 3atransgenic plants 3atrichomes 3aroot hairs 3amutants 2aCotton Fiber 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Silencing 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenes, myb 2aGossypiumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acotton fibre 0aMYB class transcription factors 0atransgenic 0aanthers1 aWu, Yingru1 aYang, Youming1 aLlewellyn, Danny J.1 aDennis, Elizabeth S.0 tPlant journal.g2009 July, v. 59, no. 1 p.52-62dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03847.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03298naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245007700175300001600252520187300268650001702141650001102158650001402169650002602183650001302209650001502222650001502237650001402252650002002266650000902286650001402295650001702309650001002326650001402336653001602350653001302366700002002379700001802399700002102417700002602438700002502464700001802489700002502507773011502532852000902647856009202656930003302748946001102781655001202792IND4420451620221116163553.0090515e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442045162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01532.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundt-Hansen, Line10aGrowth enhanced brown trout show increased movement activity in the wild  ap. 551-558.  a1. Rapid growth is often associated with several fitness-related benefits. However, in most organisms growth rates are rarely maximized, suggesting that trade-offs limit the benefits of rapid growth. To enable sustained high growth, behavioural modifications incurring costs may be required, and these may be responsible for evolution of sub-maximal growth rates. 2. In a field experiment it was tested whether rapid growth in brown trout is achieved by increasing potentially costly movement activity. Causal relations were obtained by manipulating the growth rate using bovine growth hormone (GH) implants and monitoring movement activity of stream-dwelling brown trout for two months using radiotelemetry. 3. GH-treated trout grew significantly faster than sham-treated trout both in terms of body mass and length. The GH-treated trout also had a significantly larger absolute movement during the experiment, moving about 68% more than the sham-treated trout. There were no GH effects on diel movement or home range between the two treatments. Plasma GH levels were lower in the GH-treated fish, indicating negative feedback inhibition of native GH secretion, and that the bovine GH implant was still functioning at the end of the study. 4. This is the first study to show increased movement activity in GH-enhanced fish in the wild. Because increased movement is expected to lead to increased metabolic costs, the higher movement activity in the GH-treated trout was likely associated with increased foraging activity. The results demonstrate that increased movement activity is associated with rapid growth in brown trout. Such movement activity may be unfavourable under certain ecological conditions or life stages (i.e. high risk of predation or low resource levels), and may thus represent one component of the cost limiting evolution of maximum growth rates. 3aSalmo trutta 3acattle 3aevolution 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3ahome range 3amonitoring 3apredation 3aradio telemetry 3arisk 3asecretion 3asomatotropin 3atrout 3awild fish 0agrowth rate 0amovement1 aNeregård, Lena1 aEinum, Sigurd1 aHöjesjö, Johan1 aBjörnsson, Björn T.1 aHindar, K.q(Kjetil)1 aØkland, Finn1 aJohnsson, Jörgen I.0 tFunctional ecology.g2009 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.551-558dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01532.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03034naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008500169300001600254520197300270650002802243650002602271650001102297650001102308650001202319650001102331650002102342650001102363650001102374653002002385653001502405773011402420852000902534856008502543930003302628946001102661655001202672IND4420589120221116163720.0090515e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442058912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-009-0509-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleidon, A.q(Axel)10aNonequilibrium thermodynamics and maximum entropy production in the Earth system  ap. 653-677.  aThe Earth system is maintained in a unique state far from thermodynamic equilibrium, as, for instance, reflected in the high concentration of reactive oxygen in the atmosphere. The myriad of processes that transform energy, that result in the motion of mass in the atmosphere, in oceans, and on land, processes that drive the global water, carbon, and other biogeochemical cycles, all have in common that they are irreversible in their nature. Entropy production is a general consequence of these processes and measures their degree of irreversibility. The proposed principle of maximum entropy production (MEP) states that systems are driven to steady states in which they produce entropy at the maximum possible rate given the prevailing constraints. In this review, the basics of nonequilibrium thermodynamics are described, as well as how these apply to Earth system processes. Applications of the MEP principle are discussed, ranging from the strength of the atmospheric circulation, the hydrological cycle, and biogeochemical cycles to the role that life plays in these processes. Nonequilibrium thermodynamics and the MEP principle have potentially wide-ranging implications for our understanding of Earth system functioning, how it has evolved in the past, and why it is habitable. Entropy production allows us to quantify an objective direction of Earth system change (closer to vs further away from thermodynamic equilibrium, or, equivalently, towards a state of MEP). When a maximum in entropy production is reached, MEP implies that the Earth system reacts to perturbations primarily with negative feedbacks. In conclusion, this nonequilibrium thermodynamic view of the Earth system shows great promise to establish a holistic description of the Earth as one system. This perspective is likely to allow us to better understand and predict its function as one entity, how it has evolved in the past, and how it is modified by human activities in the future. 3aatmospheric circulation 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aentropy 3ahumans 3ahydrologic cycle 3aoceans 3aoxygen 0aGaia hypothesis 0aOptimality0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2009 June, v. 96, no. 6 p.653-677dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0509-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03058naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011700182300001800299520127100317650001101588650000901599650001201608650001001620650001501630650001501645650002101660650001501681650001901696650001501715650001201730650002201742650001001764650001401774650003001788650001201818650002301830650003401853650001101887650002401898650001801922650003801940650001601978650003201994651001702026651001702043653001902060653002202079653001402101700001702115700001602132700001502148773013102163852000902294856008502303930003302388946001102421655001202432IND4426830420221116163817.0091002e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442683042DNAL7 a193476652pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-009-9336-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMapekula, M. 10aMilk production and calf rearing practices in the smallholder areas in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa  ap. 1475-1485.  aFarmer perceptions on milk production and calf rearing practices on communal rangelands in the smallholder areas of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa were evaluated on a total of 218 cattle farmers using structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews with key informants and personal observations. Nearly 70% of the households in the small-scale areas milked twice a day compared to 60% in the communal areas. About 62% of the interviewees weaned calves between 6 and 12 months of age. Milk yield/cow/day (7.5 ± 0.5 litres), fresh milk consumption/household/day (3.2 ± 0.5 litres) and sales/household/day (3.1 ± 1.1 litres) were highest in the sour-veld, small-scale farms (P < 0.05). Sour milk consumption/household/day (2.6 ± 0.2 litres) and sales/household/day (0.8 ± 0.2 litres) were significantly high in communal farms with a sour-veld. It was concluded that, calf rearing practices were poor and milk yield, consumption and sales were generally low and varied with production system and rangeland type. Further research is required to improve calf management practices, cow nutrition, milk yield and quality and how milk production can be used as a toll for rural development in the smallholder areas of South Africa. 3acalves 3acows 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3amilk consumption 3amilk yield 3aquestionnaires 3arangelands 3arearing 3arural development 3asales 3asour milk 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairyingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aFemale 2aInterviews as Topic 2aLinear Models 2aMilkxstatistics & numerical data 2aObservation 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 3aSouth Africa 0aSouth Africa 0aCommunal areas 0aIndigenous cattle 0aVeld type1 aChimonyo, M 1 aMapiye, C. 1 aDzama, K. 0 tTropical animal health and production.g2009 Oct., v. 41, no. 7 p.1475-1485dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-009-9336-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03687naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245012800186300001800314520134400332650003401676650002801710650002501738650001601763650001301779650001501792650000901807650001801816650001401834650002801848650002701876650002201903650002001925650001701945650001201962650002101974650002501995650001002020650001202030650004402042650003502086650002502121650002402146650002802170650003902198650003602237650003302273650006902306650003502375650003202410650003702442650002502479650003702504650002802541650001002569653002702579653001702606700001302623700001302636700001302649700001502662773013102677852000902808856009202817930003302909946001102942655001202953IND4425796420221116163858.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579642DNAL7 a194864232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04294.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, A.N.10aFree radical scavenging activity of Lactobacillus fermentum in vitro and its antioxidative effect on growing-finishing pigs  ap. 1140-1148.  aTo evaluate the free radical-scavenging capacity of Lactobacillus fermentum and its effects on antioxidant enzyme levels in finishing pigs. The free radical-scavenging activity of Lact. fermentum was analysed in vitro. The tested Lactobacillus showed a high scavenging ability against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which was dose dependent. Subsequently, 108 crossbred pigs weighing 20·67 BW, were allotted to dietary treatments including a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with either aureomycin or 10·2 x 10⁷ Lact. fermentum CFU g⁻¹ diet. Supplementation of Lact. fermentum increased total antioxidant capacity (P < 0·01) in serum from 50 kg pigs, while serum superoxide dismutase (P = 0·01) and glutathione peroxidase (P < 0·01) increased, and malondialdehyde levels decreased (P < 0·01) in 90 kg pigs. Hepatic catalase (P = 0·04), muscle superoxide dismutase (P < 0·01) and copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase were enhanced (P = 0·01), whereas malondialdehyde levels were reduced (P = 0·05) by Lact. fermentum. The free radical-scavenging capacity of Lact. fermentum was dose dependent and its supplementation improved the antioxidant status of pigs. Lactobacillus fermentum could be used to alleviate oxidative stress and increase pig performance and improve pork quality. 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3adose response 3afinishing 3afree radical scavengers 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amalondialdehyde 3ameat quality 3amuscles 3aoxidative stress 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxmetabolism 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aDietary Supplements 2aFree Radical Scavengers 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aHydroxyl Radicalxmetabolism 2aLimosilactobacillus fermentumxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aLiverxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aMusclesxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPicratesxmetabolism 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 2aSwine 0aantioxidative capacity 0afree radical1 aYi, X.W.1 aYu, H.F.1 aDong, B.1 aQiao, S.Y.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 107, no. 4 p.1140-1148dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04294.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03503naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002600147245008800173300001800261500002400279500001500303520165500318650001501973650001701988650001102005650002102016650001502037650002002052650002902072650002302101650001502124650002502139650001202164650002702176650002602203650002002229650002302249650002802272650006702300650001102367650003102378650002102409650001302430650001402443650001802457650002902475650002802504650002202532650002602554653002402580700001802604700001402622700001702636773012002653852000902773930003302782945002502815946001302840655001202853IND4382024120221116163227.0060717e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438202412DNAL7 a168406272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL8001 aResende Júnior, J.C.10aComparison of Techniques to Determine the Clearance of Ruminal Volatile Fatty Acids  ap. 3096-3106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this experiment was to compare measurements of fractional clearance rates obtained by using an unlabeled valerate-CoEDTA technique with measurements obtained by using a ¹³C-labeled volatile fatty acids (VFA) technique. The exponential decay rate of the ¹³C/¹²C ratio after pulse-dosing ¹³C-acetate, ¹³C-propionate, or ¹³C-butyrate into the rumen was compared with the decay rate of rumen valerate concentration following a simultaneous pulse dose. The unlabeled valerate, CoEDTA, and each labeled VFA, one at a time, were concurrently mixed with the evacuated ruminal content of 6 lactating cows in two 3 x 3 Latin squares. The clearance of VFA by passage to the omasum was assumed to be equivalent to the decay in ruminal Co concentration and was around 50% of the total clearance. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate had similar fractional clearance rates (31.2, 33.4, 30.4%/h, respectively), but propionate had a higher absorption rate (19.2%/h) than butyrate (14.2%/h). Linear regression determination coefficients using the valerate clearance rate as an estimator for acetate, propionate, and butyrate rumen clearance were 0.51, 0.56, and 0.99, respectively. In a second experiment, the ¹³C-valerate fractional clearance rate estimate (33.7%/h) was similar to the estimate obtained with unlabeled valerate (35.0%/h) by the valerate-Co technique. No ¹³C enrichment of rumen microbes was noted 4 h after the intraruminal infusion of ¹³C-valerate. Fractional VFA absorption rate estimates obtained in both techniques were similar, although both were lower than estimates reported in the literature by other methods. 3adairy cows 3avaleric acid 3acobalt 3aisotope labeling 3aabsorption 3anutrient uptake 3agastrointestinal transit 3arumen fermentation 2aAbsorption 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBody Fluidsxchemistry 2aButyratesxmetabolism 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aEdetic Acidxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysisxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIsotope Labeling 2aKinetics 2aLactation 2aLinear Models 2aMetabolic Clearance Rate 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aValeratesxmetabolism 0alabeling techniques1 aPereira, M.N.1 aBôer, H.1 aTamminga, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Aug., v. 89, no. 8 p.3096-3106dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle03240naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001700147245011200164300001800276500002400294520145200318650001501770650002401785650001901809650002401828650001401852650001101866650003301877650001701910650002101927650001201948650002101960650002301981650001802004650002202022650003802044650001102082650002602093650002902119650004302148650002602191650001802217650004302235650002002278650001402298650001602312650003202328650003402360700001502394700001702409773012002426852000902546930003302555945002502588946001302613655001202626IND4382023120221116163311.0060717e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438202312DNAL7 a168406182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL6001 aKadokawa, H.10aPlasma Leptin Concentrations Correlate with Luteinizing Hormone Secretion in Early Postpartum Holstein Cows  ap. 3020-3027.  aIncludes references  aWe tested the hypothesis that hypothalamic-pituitary activity, bioassayed by LH pulse frequency, in dairy cattle during early lactation is related to measures of energy status and to circulating profiles of free fatty acids (FFA), insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), leptin, and growth hormone (GH). On d 14 postpartum, before first ovulation and during the period of negative energy balance (-23.4 ± 2.4 Mcal/d of metabolizable energy), blood plasma was sampled from 18 multiparous cows at 10-min intervals for 8 h. All samples were assayed for LH and GH and hourly samples were assayed for FFA, insulin, IGF-I, and leptin. Milk yield and composition, body condition score, and energy balance were also measured. Frequency of LH pulses was correlated positively with energy balance (r = 0.51) and plasma leptin concentrations (r = 0.73), and negatively with milk fat content (r = -0.52). Amplitude of the LH pulses was correlated only with leptin (r = 0.53). Frequency of GH pulses was not correlated with any measure of LH secretion, but was correlated negatively with plasma concentrations of insulin (r = -0.62) and IGF-I (r = -0.61). First ovulation was observed 34 ± 4 d after parturition. These observations reveal an important linkage between pulsatile LH secretion and blood leptin concentrations during the early postpartum period in dairy cows, when their energy balance is negative, and may explain the delay in ovulation. 3adairy cows 3apostpartum interval 3aenergy balance 3amilk fat percentage 3aovulation 3aleptin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ablood lipids 3afree fatty acids 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexblood 2aHypothalamusxphysiology 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLeptinxblood 2aLuteinizing Hormonexbloodxsecretion. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aOvulation 2aPeriodicity 2aPituitary Glandxphysiology 2aPostpartum Periodxphysiology1 aBlache, D.1 aMartin, G.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Aug., v. 89, no. 8 p.3020-3027dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/08/22  aOther US 7aarticle01882naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008400164300001600248520084200264650001901106650002001125650001801145650001301163650002001176650001501196650001401211700002201225700002201247700002201269773010301291852000901394856008501403930003301488946001101521655001201532IND4426158720221116164311.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442615872DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1243-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYogo, Kentaro 10aPrediction of Chromatographic Retention of Pyrazine and Alkylpyrazines in RP-LC  ap. 677-684.  aRetention prediction models for a group of pyrazines chromatographed under reversed-phase mode were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Using MLR, the retention of the analytes were satisfactorily described by a two-predictor model based on the logarithm of the partition coefficient of the analytes (log P) and the percentage of the organic modifier in the mobile phase (ACN or MeOH). ANN prediction models were also derived using the predictors derived from MLR as inputs and log k as outputs. The best network architecture was found to be 2-2-1 for both ACN and MeOH data sets. The optimized ANNs showed better predictive properties than the MLR models especially for the ACN data set. In the case of the MeOH data set, the MLR and ANN models have comparable predictive performance. 3achromatography 3adata collection 3alinear models 3amethanol 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3apyrazines1 aQuiming, Noel S. 1 aSaito, Yoshihiro 1 aJinno, Kiyokatsu 0 tChromatographia.g2009 Sept., v. 70, no. 5-6 p.677-684dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-009-1243-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02628naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245013000166300001400296500014100310500002400451520128700475650002001762650001901782650002501801650002001826650001701846650001201863650001101875650002601886650002701912650001701939650001901956650001501975700001501990773013802005852000902143856009002152655001202242IND4463308420221116164500.0120525s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330842DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.943.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayyari, M.10aPre-storage salicylic acid treatment affects functional properties and chilling resistance of pomegranate during cold storage  ap. 87-94.  aPaper presented at the Asia Pacific Symposium on Postharvest Research Education and Extension, held August 2-4, 2010, Bangkok, Thailand.  aIncludes references  aSalicylic acid (SA) is a phenolic compound which affects growth and development and protects the plants against environmental stresses, although no information is available about its effect on functional properties in pomegranate during cold storage, which was the objective of this research. Thus, pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruits were dipped in 2 mM solution of SA and stored at 2°C for 90 days. Every month, samples were taken and further stored 3 days at 20°C for shelf life study. Treated and chilled fruits were compared with chilled and non-chilled fruits (stored at 2 and 10°C, respectively). Arils from treated fruits exhibited higher antioxidant activity (both in hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions) than chilled and non-chilled fruits, which was correlated to high levels of total phenolics and anthocyanin contents. Additionally, the chilling index, ion leakage and respiration rate of treated fruits were lower than chilled fruits but higher than non-chilled fruits.

This vegetative plant is hard to distinguish between their wide cultivars during the harvesting period. We sought a general comparison of cultivars across different varieties of sweet potato leaves. A total of 6 different local varieties of sweet potato leaves were characterised for leaf width, length, thickness, area, shape, arrangement, margin, venation and the colour index (in L*a*/b*). The morphological characteristics of the storage roots were also found to be different for the different cultivars. Hence, the leaf morphology can be used to distinguish the different cultivars of sweet potato plant in Malaysia. 3acultivars 3asweet potatoes 3aIpomoea batatas 3acolor 3aplanting 3aroots 3aleaves 3aMalaysia 0acrops1 aCantiran̲, Cu.,1 aBoyce, A.N.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Feb., , no. 943 p.73-79dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.943.63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01853naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010900161300001600270520078000286650002101066650001701087650001401104650002001118650004101138650000901179650002301188700001701211700001801228700001601246773010301262852000901365856008501374930003301459946001101492655001201503IND4426161620221116164107.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442616162DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1211-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Liping 10aDetermination of the Volatile Oil of Magnolia biondii Pamp by GC-MS Combined with Chemometric Techniques  ap. 905-914.  aAn optimized temperature-programmed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system combined with chemometric methods was firstly applied to analyze the volatile components of M. biondii Pamp.

Floret samples dipped in tap water served as control. Microbial population (Salmonella spp., total bacteria, and yeast and mold) and floret quality changes were determined. On initial day of storage, SC regardless of concentration significantly reduced Salmonella spp. population by approximately 3 log CFU/g. During storage, 750 and 1,000 ppm SC decreased Salmonella spp. load more effectively than 500 ppm SC; however, higher SC levels caused tissue damage and browning evident after 9 days of storage. SC at 500 ppm was often more effective than higher SC levels in reducing total bacterial and yeast and mold counts. SC did not affect weight loss, floret color, sensory attributes and chlorophyll content. Our results suggest that 500 ppm SC could be used to reduce microbial population and maintain quality of fresh-cut broccoli florets. 3aSalmonella 3abacteria 3abroccoli 3achlorophyll 3aflorets 3asensory properties 3atap water 3aweight loss 3ayeasts1 aJitareerat, P.1 aSrilaong, V.1 aUthairatanakij, A.1 aKanlayanarat, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Feb., , no. 943 p.223-229dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.943.293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01851naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010800160300001600268520083900284650002701123650001201150650002101162650002601183700002101209700001401230700001901244700002101263773010301284852000901387856008501396930003301481946001101514655001201525IND4426160520221116164152.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442616052DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1230-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bin 10aFingerprint Chromatogram Analysis of Radix Glehniae by LC Coupled with Hierarchical Clustering Analysis  ap. 811-816.  aFor the first time a validated liquid chromatography method coupled with hierarchical clustering analysis has been developed for the study of fingerprint chromatograms of extracts from the Radix Glehniae of Glehnia littorali. Liquid chromatography with gradient elution was performed on extracts from 23 plant samples collected from different geographical locations. Ten of twenty-three plant samples were selected using hierarchical clustering analysis and employed to establish the fingerprint. The fingerprint was established and ten chromatographic peaks were selected as characteristic peaks and panaxynol was used as reference standard compounds. The fingerprint chromatograms had a good stability, precision, and reproducibility. This method is a very reliable and useful method for assessment of the quality of Radix Glehniae. 3aGeographical Locations 3aGlehnia 3acluster analysis 3aliquid chromatography1 aZhang, Yang-Bai 1 aLi, G.

'koroneiki', 'Meski') was studied. Two-year-old olive trees, grown in pots in greenhouse, were subjected to one of three drought treatments (i.e., mild, moderate and severe drought stress) and compared to control trees. Both the leaf water potential (Ψ w) and the relative water content (RWC) of the two varieties decreased with increasing levels of drought stress. Koroneiki showed higher (less negative) values of Ψ w and lower values of RWC than the Meski, particularly during severe drought stress. Net photosynthetic assimilation and stomatal conductance declined with drought. This inactivation of photosynthetic activity was accompanied by changes in the fluorescence characteristics. The PSII maximal photochemical efficiency (F v/F m), the intrinsic efficiency of open PSII reaction centres (F v'/F m'), the photochemical efficiency of PSII (Φ PSII) and the total electron flow (J t) decreased during the development of drought stress. The non-quenching photochimique (q N) showed an increase in the response to water deficit. These observations are discussed in relation to the strategies developed to grow drought-resistant olive trees in arid areas. 3acultivars 3agas exchange 3aelectron transfer 3adrought 3awater stress 3aolives 3aleaf water potential 3awater content 3aphotosystem II 3aOlea europaea 0aplant-water relations 0aphotosynthesis1 aMariem, Fethi Ben1 aMechri, Beligh1 aBoussetta, Wafa1 aBraham, Mohamed1 aHadj, Salem Ben El0 tScientia horticulturae.g2008 May 20, v. 116, no. 4 p.388-393dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2008.02.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20080902b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/08/07  aNon-US 7aarticle01647naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002700151245007500178300001600253500014100269500002400410520045900434650002300893650000800916650001900924650001000943650002400953650001300977650001100990650002001001650001501021700002101036773014001057852000901197856009101206655001201297IND4463310320221116164006.0120525s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446331032DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.943.272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoonyaritthongchai, P.10aEffects of high CO2 storage on postharvest quality of carambola fruits  ap. 213-216.  aPaper presented at the Asia Pacific Symposium on Postharvest Research Education and Extension, held August 2-4, 2010, Bangkok, Thailand.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of high carbon dioxide atmosphere (5 and 10% CO2) on physiological changes and quality of carambola during storage at 10oC was investigated.

Sample Population-157 formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded MCTs from dogs in the pathology database of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis. Procedure-Genomic DNA was isolated from tumor specimens and a polymerase chain reaction procedure was performed to determine whether there were ITDs in exons 11 and 12. Results-We identified ITDs in 1 of 12 (8%) grade-I, 42 of 119 (35%) grade-II, and 9 of 26 (35%) grade-III tumors (overall prevalence, 52 of 157 [33%]). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of grade-II and -III tumors possessing an ITD were approximately 5 times greater than that for grade-I tumors, although these odds did not differ significantly. Although MCTs possessing an ITD were twice as likely to recur after excision and twice as likely to result in metastasis as those without an ITD, these values also did not differ significantly. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-These results provide evidence that ITDs in c-kit occur frequently in MCTs of dogs. The high prevalence of c-kit activating mutations in MCTs of dogs combined with the relative abundance of mast cell disease in dogs provide an ideal naturally developing tumor in which to test the safety and efficacy of novel small-molecule kinase inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate. 3aDNA 3adatabases 3adogs 3aexcision 3aexons 3amedical education 3ametastasis 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprognosis 3aregression analysis 3aCalifornia1 aChien, May B.1 aKass, Philip H.1 aMoore, Peter F.1 aLondon, Cheryl A.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2002 Dec., v. 63, no. 12 p.1718-1723x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.17183Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03823naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245016800191300001800359520175900377650001102136650002202147650001202169650003902181650003302220650001502253650002702268650002502295650005902320650004502379650002802424650002702452650000902479650000902488650002302497650002602520650008102546650004802627650003802675650003002713650003102743650004102774650004302815653000902858653002002867653001502887700002102902700002002923700001802943773012502961852000903086856009203095930003303187946001303220655001203233IND4427402620221116164207.0091016e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442740262DNAL7 a197651872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06381.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Jin Young10aNeuroprotective effect of l-dopa on dopaminergic neurons is comparable to pramipexol in MPTP-treated animal model of Parkinson's disease: a direct comparison study  ap. 1042-1050.  aParkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Levodopa ( l-dopa) and dopamine agonists have been most commonly used for symptomatic treatment. However, there are discrepancies between clinical and experimental data with respect to the neuroprotective effects of these drugs on dopaminergic neurons. In this study, to determine whether l-dopa is toxic or dopamine agonist is neuroprotective to dopaminergic neurons, we evaluated the neuroprotective properties of l-dopa and the pramipexol (PPX), one of dopamine agonists, with a focus on the regulatory effects of the anti-oxidant properties and cell survival or apoptotic signal pathways in the same experimental design, using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated PD animals. The glutathione level in MPTP-treated mice was significantly increased by PPX administration but not by L-dopa treatment. The expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase in MPTP-treated mice was significantly increased only with l-dopa treatment. Treatment with either l-dopa or PPX in MPTP-treated mice led to significantly decreased expressions of JNK phosphorylation, Bax, and cytochrome c and to an increased level of Bcl-2 expression with a similar degree, compared with the levels in MPTP-only treated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that both l-dopa and PPX increased significantly survival of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-treated mice. Our study demonstrated that both l-dopa and PPX had comparable neuroprotective properties for dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-treated PD animal models, through modulation of cell survival and apoptotic pathways. 3aL-dopa 3aParkinson disease 2aAnimals 2aAntiparkinson Agentsxpharmacology 2aBenzothiazolesxpharmacology 2aCell Count 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDopaminexmetabolism 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aLevodopaxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNeuronsxdrug effects 2aParkinsonian Disordersxchemically inducedxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2xmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aSubstantia Nigraxcytology 2aTyrosine 3-Monooxygenasexmetabolism 2abcl-2-Associated X Proteinxmetabolism 0aMPTP 0aneuroprotection 0apramipexol1 aPark, Hyun Jung.1 aAhn, Young Hwan1 aLee, Phil Hyu0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Nov., v. 111, no. 4 p.1042-1050dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06381.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091016b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03449naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245020400167300001800371500002400389520179100413650002102204650002102225650002502246650001102271650001502282650002502297650000902322650001702331650001902348650002102367650002402388650001002412650001802422650001102440650002102451650001302472650001802485650001402503650001702517700001902534700002602553700002502579700001802604700002002622700002202642700002302664700002602687773010002713852000902813856008502822655001202907IND4463298620221116164147.0120524s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446329862DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.14652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldwin, Susan L.10aTransient and stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with the recombinant feline erythropoietin gene and expression, purification, and biological activity of feline erythropoietin protein  ap. 1465-1471.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To use transient and stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells to clone the gene encoding feline erythropoietin (feEPO) protein, characterize the expressed protein, and assess its biological activity. Sample Population-Cultures of Chinese hamster ovary or TF-1 cells. Procedure-The gene encoding feEPO was cloned into a eukaryotic expression plasmid. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transiently or stably transfected with the plasmid. Expressed recombinant feEPO (rfeEPO) protein was purified from transiently transfected cells. The protein was characterized by use of SDS gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis. Biological activity was assessed by measuring thymidine incorporation by TF-1 erythroleukemic cells. Results-Purified rfeEPO from supernatants of transiently transfected cells was determined to be 34 to 40 kilodaltons (kd) by use of SDS gel electrophoresis, whereas the molecular weight predicted from the amino acid sequence was 21.5 kd. The banding pattern and high molecular weight suggested the protein was glycosylated. The rfeEPO proteins derived from transient or stable transfections subsequently were determined to be biologically active in vitro. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The gene encoding feEPO can be transfected into eukaryotic cells, and the expressed rfeEPO protein is biologically active in vitro. Cats with chronic renal failure often are anemic as a result of reduced expression of erythropoietin (EPO). Treatment with human-derived EPO stimulates RBCs in anemic cats; however, treatment is often limited by the development of antibodies directed against the recombinant human protein, which can then cross-react with endogenous feEPO. Recombinant feEPO may prove beneficial for use in cats with chronic renal failure. 3aChinese hamsters 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acid sequences 3aanemia 3aantibodies 3abioactive properties 3acats 3aerythrocytes 3aerythropoietin 3aeukaryotic cells 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3aplasmids 3arenal failure 3athymidine 3atransfection1 aPowell, Tim D.1 aWonderling, Ramani S.1 aKeiser, Katherine C.1 aMorales, Tony1 aHunter, Shirley1 aMcDermott, Martin1 aRadecki, Steven V.1 aMilhausen, Michael J.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2003 Dec., v. 64, no. 12 p.1465-1471x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.14653Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03151naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002900193245011100222300001800333506007600351520171100427506003702138650001802175650002202193650002402215650001202239650003402251650003302285650001302318653002402331653001602355653002302371653001702394653002302411700002502434773011302459852000902572856009202581930003302673946001102706655001202717IND4423201920221207053511.0090714e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442320192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07117.x2doi7 aPMC29241942pmcid7 a196273642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaimachnikov, Nikolai P.10aToggle switches, pulses and oscillations are intrinsic properties of the Src activation/deactivation cycle  ap. 4102-4118.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSrc-family kinases (SFKs) play a pivotal role in growth factor signaling, mitosis, cell motility and invasiveness. In their basal state, SFKs maintain a closed autoinhibited conformation, where the Src homology 2 domain interacts with an inhibitory phosphotyrosine in the C-terminus. Activation involves dephosphorylation of this inhibitory phosphotyrosine, followed by intermolecular autophosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in the activation loop. The spatiotemporal dynamics of SFK activation controls cell behavior, yet these dynamics remain largely uninvestigated. In the present study, we show that the basic properties of the Src activation/deactivation cycle can bring about complex signaling dynamics, including oscillations, toggle switches and excitable behavior. These intricate dynamics do not require imposed external feedback loops and occur at constant activities of Src inhibitors and activators, such as C-terminal Src kinase and receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases. We demonstrate that C-terminal Src kinase and receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase underexpression or their simultaneous overexpression can transform Src response patterns into oscillatory or bistable responses, respectively. Similarly, Src overexpression leads to dysregulation of Src activity, promoting sustained self-perpetuating oscillations. Distinct types of responses can allow SFKs to trigger different cell-fate decisions, where cellular outcomes are determined by the stimulation threshold and history. Our mathematical model helps to understand the puzzling experimental observations and suggests conditions where these different kinetic behaviors of SFKs can be tested experimentally.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell movement 3adephosphorylation 3amathematical models 3amitosis 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3atyrosine 0aautophosphorylation 0abistability 0aexcitable behavior 0aoscillations 0aSrc-family kinases1 aKholodenko, Boris N.0 tFEBS journal.g2009 Aug., v. 276, no. 15 p.4102-4118dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07117.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090714b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02925naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010700168300001800275500002400293520168700317650001102004650001602015650001502031650001202046650001002058650003102068650002602099650001002125650001102135650002102146650001502167700002002182700002102202700002002223700002302243700002102266700002202287773010002309852000902409856008502418655001202503IND4463302420221116164231.0120524s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330242DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.14862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonda, Kathleen C.10aEvaluation of iohexol clearance used to estimate glomerular filtration rate in clinically normal foals  ap. 1486-1490.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To determine whether pharmacokinetic analysis of data derived from a single IV dose of iohexol could be used to predict creatinine clearance and evaluate simplified methods for predicting serum clearance of iohexol with data derived from 2 or 3 blood samples in clinically normal foals. Animals-10 healthy foals. Procedure-Serum disposition of iohexol and exogenous creatinine clearance was determined simultaneously in each foal (5 males and 5 females). A 3-compartment model of iohexol serum disposition was selected via standard methods. Iohexol clearance calculated from the model was compared with creatinine clearance. Separate limited-sample models were created with various combinations of sample times from the terminal slope of the plasma versus time profile for iohexol. Correction factors were determined for the limited-sample models, and iohexol clearance calculated via each method was compared with exogenous creatinine clearance by use of method comparison techniques. Results-Mean exogenous creatinine clearance was 2.17 mL/min/kg. The disposition of iohexol was best described by a 3-compartment open model. Mean clearance value for iohexol was 2.15 mL/min/kg and was not significantly different from mean creatinine clearance. A method for predicting serum iohexol clearance based on a 2-sample protocol (3- and 4-hour samples) was developed. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Iohexol clearance can be used to predict exogenous creatinine clearance and can be determined from 2 blood samples taken after IV injection of iohexol. Appropriate correction factors for adult horses and horses with abnormal glomerular filtration rate need to be determined. 3aadults 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3afemales 3afoals 3aglomerular filtration rate 3aintravenous injection 3amales 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3aprediction1 aWilcke, Jeff R.1 aCrisman, Mark V.1 aWard, Daniel L.1 aRobertson, John L.1 aFinco, Delmar R.1 aBraselton, Emmett0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2003 Dec., v. 64, no. 12 p.1486-1490x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.14863Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03170naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245015800169300001800327500002400345520194000369650001702309650001102326650001602337650001602353650001502369650001402384650001602398650001102414650001302425650001302438650001702451650002002468650001302488700002002501700002402521700002102545773010002566852000902666856008502675655001202760IND4463297920221116161816.0120524s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446329792DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.17382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWooldridge, Anne A.10aEffects of treatment with oxytocin, xylazine butorphanol, guaifenesin, acepromazine, and detomidine on esophageal manometric pressure in conscious horses  ap. 1738-1744.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To compare effects of oxytocin, acepromazine maleate, xylazine hydrochloride-butorphanol tartrate, guaifenesin, and detomidine hydrochloride on esophageal manometric pressure in horses. Animals-8 healthy adult horses. Procedure-A nasogastric tube, modified with 3 polyethylene tubes that exited at the postpharyngeal area, thoracic inlet, and distal portion of the esophagus, was fitted for each horse. Amplitude, duration, and rate of propagation of pressure waveforms induced by swallows were measured at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 minutes after administration of oxytocin, detomidine, acepromazine, xylazine-butorphanol, guaifenesin, or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Number of spontaneous swallows, spontaneous events (contractions that occurred in the absence of a swallow stimulus), and high-pressure events (sustained increases in baseline pressure of > 10 mm Hg) were compared before and after drug administration. Results-At 5 minutes after administration, detomidine increased waveform amplitude and decreased waveform duration at the thoracic inlet. At 10 minutes after administration, detomidine increased waveform duration at the thoracic inlet. Acepromazine administration increased the number of spontaneous events at the thoracic inlet and distal portion of the esophagus. Acepromazine and detomidine administration increased the number of high-pressure events at the thoracic inlet. Guaifenesin administration increased the number of spontaneous events at the thoracic inlet. Xylazine-butorphanol, detomidine, acepromazine, and guaifenesin administration decreased the number of spontaneous swallows. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Detomidine, acepromazine, and a combination of xylazine butorphanol had the greatest effect on esophageal motility when evaluated manometrically. Reduction in spontaneous swallowing and changes in normal, coordinated peristaltic activity are the most clinically relevant effects. 3aacepromazine 3aadults 3abutorphanol 3adeglutition 3adetomidine 3aesophagus 3aguaifenesin 3ahorses 3amaleates 3aoxytocin 3apolyethylene 3asodium chloride 3axylazine1 aEades, Susan C.1 aHosgood, Giselle L.1 aMoore, Rustin M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2002 Dec., v. 63, no. 12 p.1738-1744x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.17383Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02576naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245008100154300001600235520148200251650001601733650001201749650002101761650001501782650002201797650001101819650001001830650001101840650001401851650001501865653002101880653000801901653000901909653001001918773012201928852000902050856007502059930003302134946001102167655001202178IND4423900720221116161738.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442390072DNAL7 a10.1071/MF080192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDroppo, Ian G.10aBiofilm structure and bed stability of five contrasting freshwater sediments  ap. 690-699.  aUsing an annular flume, erosion characteristics of five diverse sediment types (stormwater pond, contaminated lacustrine, fluvial, aquaculture waste and industrial grade kaolin sediment), each with different physical and biological characteristics, were examined for relative erosion resistance and factors contributing to bed sediment stability. Suspended flocs represent primary building blocks of bed sediment with mass settling being independent of suspended solid concentration. Biofilm growth period, depositing floc structure and composition, nutrient supply and sediment properties all played a complex role in dictating the stability of the sediments. The river, lake and stormwater pond sediments were the most resistant to erosion relative to the high nutrient and organic content aquaculture sediment and kaolin. Biofilms developed to varying degrees on all sediments with the greatest growth occurring with the aquaculture sediment and the least with kaolin. While electrochemical properties will provide some attraction and stabilising forces, with no measurable consolidation evident for the examined sediments, it is suggested that active biofilm development was the dominant factor controlling bed stability and erosion potential. Differences in biological mediation of strength between sediments were partially attributed to the structural differences within the biofilms and integration of the extracellular polymeric fibril matrix within the sediment pores. 3aaquaculture 3abiofilm 3aelectrochemistry 3afreshwater 3aindustrial wastes 3akaolin 3alakes 3arivers 3asediments 3astormwater 0abiostabilisation 0aEPS 0afloc 0ashear0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2009, v. 60, no. 7 p.690-699dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF080193Available from publisher's Web site  a20090731b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009400165300001800259520171300277650002701990650002702017650000902044650002602053650002102079650002202100650003002122650001702152650001902169651001802188700002402206700001902230700002002249700002402269773017402293856005102467852000902518655001202527IND60613887920221116161629.0180918e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061388792DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-4312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSexton, Ty10aSalmonella Contamination in Broiler Synovial Fluid: Are We Missing a Potential Reservoir?  ap. 1425-1431.  aThe objective of this study was to assess the presence and characteristics of Salmonella enterica found in the synovial fluid of broiler carcasses. The synovial fluid of three individual joints from 500 broiler carcasses was individually sampled from five broiler processing facilities located in the Southeast and West regions of the United States (1,500 total samples). The external surface of broiler carcass was decontaminated before sampling of the shoulder, coxofemoral, and tibiofemoral joints. Individual samples were enriched, composited, and subjected to rapid PCR-based detection of Salmonella. Individual samples from any positive composites were also enriched before determination of Salmonella presence in the same manner. Positive individual samples were subjected to secondary enrichment before plating onto selective agar for isolation of Salmonella. Salmonella isolates were serotyped before determination of antimicrobial susceptibility. Overall, 1.00% (5 of 500 broiler carcasses) of composite samples and 0.47% (7 of 1,500 samples) of individual samples were positive for Salmonella. Five of the seven isolates were susceptible to all drugs tested and determined to be Salmonella Enteritidis. The remaining two isolates, identified as Salmonella Typhimurium, were resistant to streptomycin. To our knowledge, no previous assessments of Salmonella in the synovial fluid of broilers has been reported; however, results of the present study suggested that the synovial fluid may be a reservoir for Salmonella in broilers. Although the prevalence of Salmonella is low, this information provides valuable insight into potential poultry contamination pathways and warrants further exploration. 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aagar 3aantibiotic resistance 3abroiler chickens 3achicken carcasses 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astreptomycin 3asynovial fluid 3aUnited States1 aGeornaras, Ifigenia1 aBelk, Keith E.1 aBunning, Marisa1 aMartin, Jennifer N.0 tJournal of food protection.g2018 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.1425-1431dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-431  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002100176245009800197300001600295500002400311500001500335520089300350650001401243650001201257650001801269650001401287650001001301650001001311650001401321650001401335650001501349650001101364650001101375650003401386653002201420653002201442653002001464700002101484700002301505700002001528773010101548852000901649856008901658930003301747945002501780946001101805655001201816IND4405623620221116161644.0080513e20080520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440562362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2008.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF110 0aF2001 aMitani, Nobuhito10aCitrus hybrid seedlings reduce initial time to flower when grafted onto shiikuwasha rootstock  ap. 452-455.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe long juvenile period of citrus seedlings before flowering is one of the major obstacles in citrus breeding. Under the citrus breeding program of National Institute of Fruit Tree Science in Japan, 299 citrus hybrid seedlings were grafted onto shiikuwasha (Citrus depressa HAYATA) and cultivated. Approximately one-third of the plants flowered two and a half years after grafting. The average length of the main stems of flowering plants was 308cm, while that of non-flowering plants was 264cm. Half of the plants having main stem length >=300cm formed flowers, while most of the plants having main stem length <210cm formed no flower. These results indicate that plant vigor influences the flowering and that grafting effectively accelerated flowering. The proportion of flowering plants varied among cross combinations, ranging from 71.4% to 8.0% among the 10 cross combinations used. 3acultivars 3ahybrids 3acitrus fruits 3aflowering 3astems 3avigor 3aseedlings 3aphenology 3arootstocks 3alength 3aCitrus 3arootstock-scion relationships 0aplant development 0agrafting (plants) 0aCitrus depressa1 aMatsumoto, Ryoji1 aYoshioka, Terutaka1 aKuniga, Takeshi0 tScientia horticulturae.g2008 May 20, v. 116, no. 4 p.452-455dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2008.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/08/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02690naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011800166300001800284500002400302520177900326650000902105650002702114650001502141650001302156650001202169700002502181773010002206852000902306856008502315655001202400IND4463303120221116161407.0120524s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330312DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.15282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarch, Philip A.10aMinimum alveolar concentration measures of central nervous system activation in cats anesthetized with isoflurane  ap. 1528-1533.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To compare the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane required to prevent corticocerebral activation, autonomic responses, and purposeful movements after somatic or visceral stimulation in cats anesthetized with isoflurane. Animals-17 healthy spayed female cats. Procedure-Bispectral index (BIS), autonomic parameters, and purposeful movements were monitored before and after somatic or visceral stimuli in cats anesthetized with isoflurane. End-tidal (ET) isoflurane concentration was varied to determine MAC values for cortical arousal (MACBIS), autonomic responsiveness (MACBAR), and purposeful movement (MAC). Bispectral index values greater than 60 were considered to represent corticocerebral activation. Results-Minimum alveolar concentration for purposeful movement was significantly less than MACBIS and MACBAR for both somatic and visceral stimulation. Individual MAC values for somatic stimulation were not significantly different from respective MAC values for visceral stimulation. The percentage of cats that had a BIS response greater than 60 was inversely related to the end-tidal isoflurane concentration. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Corticocerebral arousal and subcortical autonomic reflexes occured at isoflurane anesthetic concentrations at which reflexive or purposeful movements were absent. These results suggested that isoflurane had a preferential effect on voluntary motor output at low end-tidal isoflurane concentrations, and that sensory pathways, subcortical sympathetic output, and cortical responsiveness are less susceptible to the anesthetic effects of isoflurane. Bispectral index values obtained after somatic or visceral stimulation were sensitive for the detection of early changes in cortical excitability. 3acats 3acentral nervous system 3aisoflurane 3areflexes 3aspaying1 aMuir, William W.

'Nellie White' (Easter lily) were grown under a combination of six constant day/night temperature regimes and five N-P-K nutrient treatments under short days for 107d (growing period 1 or GP-1) to compare the effects on growth and development and bulb production. Results during GP-1 were as follows: failure of bulblets to produce a shoot (“no-shows”) was found at high temperatures (30/26 and 26/22°C) and not influenced by the nutrient treatments. Flower bud abortion was observed in the minus-N, minus-P, and minus-N-P-K treatments at high temperatures (30/26 or 26/22°C), but not observed at any temperatures in the complete and minus-K treatments. The loss of bulb fresh weight in minus-N treated bulblets was less than in the other treatments resulting in less root and shoot growth in the minus-N treatment. At the intermediate temperatures where growth was highest, omission of N, P, K, or all three resulted in losses in stem bulb fresh weight, stem plus leaf fresh weight, number of flowers, and stem root fresh weight. Omission of N, P, or all three nutrients resulted in lowest basal root fresh weight. Bulb N and K concentrations were lowest in plants grown with complete nutrient solution at the two coldest temperature regimes (14/10 and 10/6°C). Bulb P concentration was lowest at the three coldest (18/14, 14/10 and 10/6°C) and the warmest (30/26°C) temperature regimes. Stem length was shorter when P was omitted. Omission of any of the three nutrients resulted in lower concentrations of the other nutrients. The one exception was where low K did not affect N concentration. In the second phase of the experiment, plants grown at 18/14°C and irrigated with the complete nutrient solution for 107d (GP-1) were continued at this day/night temperature regime and five N-P-K nutrient treatments for another 89d under long days (growing period 2 or GP-2). Results during GP-2 were as follows. Basal bulb yield was not impacted by omission of N, P, or K, or all three. Of all growth measurements, only stem plus leaf fresh weight was lower and only when all three nutrients (minus-N-P-K) were omitted. At the end of GP-2, basal bulb concentrations of N and P did not differ from the concentrations in bulbs at the beginning of GP-1; however, K concentration was lower at the end of GP-2. Omission of N or P further resulted in lower bulb K concentration, suggesting that a moderate supply of N, P, and K be applied during GP-2 since an additional year of bulb production is needed to produce forcing-sized bulbs. 3afloriculture crops 3aNPK fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3aabortion (plants) 3aroots 3ashoots 3aheat stress 3abulbs 3aLilium longiflorum 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3abuds 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient deficiencies 3aair temperature 3apotassium 3aphotoperiod 3anitrogen 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aflowers 0aplant development1 aKim, S.H.1 aNelson, P.V.1 aDe Hertogh, A.A.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2008 May 20, v. 116, no. 4 p.430-436dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2008.02.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/08/07  aNon-US 7aarticle01961naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245009100163300001600254520084600270650001201116650001801128650001101146650001101157700003201168700001801200700002601218700001901244700002001263700002701283700002601310773012501336852000901461856008301470939003301553946001301586655001201599IND4457380820221116161455.0110429e20110429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445738082DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12010662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Diane K.10aSurface-Generated Mesoscale Eddies Transport Deep-Sea Products from Hydrothermal Vents  ap. 580-583.  aAtmospheric forcing, which is known to have a strong influence on surface ocean dynamics and production, is typically not considered in studies of the deep sea. Our observations and models demonstrate an unexpected influence of surface-generated mesoscale eddies in the transport of hydrothermal vent efflux and of vent larvae away from the northern East Pacific Rise. Transport by these deep-reaching eddies provides a mechanism for spreading the hydrothermal chemical and heat flux into the deep-ocean interior and for dispersing propagules hundreds of kilometers between isolated and ephemeral communities. Because the eddies interacting with the East Pacific Rise are formed seasonally and are sensitive to phenomena such as El Niño, they have the potential to introduce seasonal to interannual atmospheric variations into the deep sea. 3aEl Nino 3aheat transfer 3alarvae 3amodels1 aMcGillicuddy, Dennis J.

CTLA-4 shares two ligands (CD80 and CD86) with a stimulatory receptor, CD28. Here, we show that CTLA-4 can capture its ligands from opposing cells by a process of trans-endocytosis. After removal, these costimulatory ligands are degraded inside CTLA-4-expressing cells, resulting in impaired costimulation via CD28. Acquisition of CD86 from antigen-presenting cells is stimulated by T cell receptor engagement and observed in vitro and in vivo. These data reveal a mechanism of immune regulation in which CTLA-4 acts as an effector molecule to inhibit CD28 costimulation by the cell-extrinsic depletion of ligands, accounting for many of the known features of the CD28-CTLA-4 system.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aantigens 3acytotoxicity 3aimmune response 3aligands 3amechanism of action1 aZheng, Yong1 aNakamura, Kyoko1 aAttridge, Kesley1 aManzotti, Claire1 aSchmidt, Emily M.1 aBaker, Jennifer1 aJeffery, Louisa E.1 aKaur, Satdip1 aBriggs, Zoe1 aHou, Tie Z.1 aFutter, Clare E.1 aAnderson, Graham1 aWalker, Lucy S.K.1 aSansom, David M.0 tScience.g2011 Apr. 29, v. 332, no. 6029 p.600-603dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12029473Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110429  aOther US 7aarticle02933naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245012800165300001400293500002400307500001500331520171300346650001802059650001402077650001602091650001502107650001302122650002102135650001202156650003402168650002002202650001102222650001402233653003202247700001902279700001902298700001902317773009502336852000902431856008302440655001202523IND4463304420221116161426.0120524s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330442DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidpath, Julia F.10aEffect of passive immunity on the development of a protective immune response against bovine viral diarrhea virus in calves  ap. 65-69.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aObjective-To determine whether passively acquired antibodies prevent development of a protective immune response to live virus in calves. Procedures-18 calves. Procedure-Calves were caught immediately after birth and tested free of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and serum antibodies against BVDV. Within 48 hours, 12 calves were fed colostrum that contained antibodies against BVDV and 6 calves received BVDV antibody free milk replacer. Three milk replacer fed and 6 colostrum fed calves were exposed to virulent BVDV2-1373 at 2 to 5 weeks of life when passively acquired serum antibody titers were high. After serum antibody titers against BVDV had decayed to undetectable concentrations (at 7 to 9 months of age), the 3 remaining milk replacer fed calves, 6 colostrum fed calves previously exposed to BVDV2-1373, and 6 colostrum fed calves that had not been exposed to the virus were inoculated with BVDV2-1373. Results-Passively acquired antibodies prevented clinical disease in inoculated colostrum fed calves at 2 to 5 weeks of life. Serum antibody titers did not increase in these calves following virus inoculation, and serum antibody titers decayed at the same rate as in noninoculated colostrum fed calves. Inoculated colostrum fed calves were still protected from clinical disease after serum antibody titers had decayed to nondetectable concentrations. Same age colostrum fed calves that had not been previously exposed to the virus were not protected. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance-A protective immune response was mounted in calves with passive immunity, but was not reflected by serum antibodies titers. This finding has implications for evaluating vaccine efficacy and immune status. 3amilk replacer 3acolostrum 3ablood serum 3aantibodies 3avaccines 3apassive immunity 3aviruses 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aimmune response 3acalves 3avirulence 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aNeill, John D.1 aEndsley, Janet1 aRoth, James A.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2003 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.65-69x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.653Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02859naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100004100143245012100184300001400305500002400319520168600343650001502029650001502044650001602059650001502075650001502090650001702105650001002122650002002132650001302152700002702165700002202192700002402214700002402238700002402262773009502286852000902381856008302390655001202473IND4463304120221116161448.0120524s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330412DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández del Palacio, Maria Josefa10aEvaluation of transcutaneous Doppler ultrasonography for the measurement of blood flow in the femoral artery of pigs  ap. 43-50.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To compare measurements of blood flow in the common femoral artery obtained by duplex Doppler ultrasonography (DDU) and a reference ultrasonic transit-time flow (TTF) method and to examine the impact of Doppler spectral waveform measurement techniques on volumetric estimates. Animals-5 healthy female pigs. Procedure-Femoral arterial blood flow was measured simultaneously in anesthetized pigs by use of a TTF probe (left femoral artery) and transcutaneous DDU (right femoral artery). A range of flow states was induced pharmacologically by using xylazine, bradykinin, dobutamine, and isoflurane. Volumetric blood flow was calculated from DDU waveforms, using the product of the flow velocity integral (FVI), the cross-sectional vessel area, and heart rate. Three calculations of FVI were obtained by manually tracing the Doppler spectral envelopes at the outer envelope, the modal, and the inner envelope of the spectral dispersion pattern. Data analysis included calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Results-Blood flow measured by DDU was more closely correlated with TTF measurements when the modal or inner envelope tracing method was used ( r, 0.76 and 0.78; limits of agreement, -100 to 54.2 and -48.5 to 77.0 mL/min, respectively). Limits of agreement for the outer envelope tracing method were -238.5 to 64 mL/min. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance-Transcutaneous DDU is a reliable noninvasive technique for measuring blood flow in the femoral artery of pigs over a range of flow states. Tracing the inner envelope of the Doppler spectral dispersion pattern provided the best estimate of blood flow in this study. 3ablood flow 3abradykinin 3acorrelation 3aheart rate 3aisoflurane 3aproduct flow 3aswine 3aultrasonography 3axylazine1 aLuis Fuentes, Virginia1 aBonagura, John D.1 aSchober, Karsten E.1 aHatfield, Daniel G.1 aLaughlin, Harold M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2003 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.43-50x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.433Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02215naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245011800183300001600301520044900317650001700766650001600783650001200799650003400811650004700845650002900892650005400921650003100975650003101006650000901037650005501046650000901101650001701110650003101127650005701158650004501215650001701260650003201277653000901309653002201318653001401340700002201354700002201376700002301398773012601421852000901547856008501556930003301641946001101674655001201685IND4426156120221116161554.0090918e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442615612DNAL7 a197049652pmid7 a10.1007/s10517-009-0543-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaumov, A.

Animals-7 healthy young Dutch Warmblood horses (range, 13 to 18 months old), 7 healthy adult Dutch Warmblood horses (range, 4 to 10 years old), and 7 healthy elderly Dutch Warmblood horses (range, 18 to 21 years old). Procedure-An EMG needle examination was performed to evaluate insertional activity, spontaneous activity, and motor unit action potential (MUAP) variables. Although all horses were conscious, young horses were sedated prior to examination. Results-Mean insertional activity in young horses was significantly lower than in elderly horses. Pathologic spontaneous activity was rarely found in young and adult horses but was frequently evident in all muscles in all elderly horses. The MUAP duration and amplitude were significantly lower in all muscles of young horses, compared with values for adult and elderly horses. The MUAP duration and number of phases and turns were significantly lower in adult horses than in elderly horses. Group differences for percentages of polyphasic and complex MUAPs were also found. The 95% confidence intervals for MUAP duration, MUAP amplitude, and number of phases and turns for the subclavian, triceps, and lateral vastus muscles were significantly lower in young horses than in adult or elderly horses. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance-Age of the horse being examined should be considered when EMG examination is performed. 3aDutch Warmblood 3aaction potentials 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3aelectromyography 3ahorses 3amuscles 3aquantitative analysis 3askeletal muscle1 aFranssen, Hessel1 aKolk, Johannes H. van der0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2003 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.70-75x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.703Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01248naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009100165300001600256520036500272650001700637650002000654653002100674700002300695773011200718852000900830856008500839930003300924946001300957655001200970IND4428716620221116161615.0091113e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442871662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11094-009-0314-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampiev, A.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the suppressive function of immature myeloid cells is not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is related to the suppressive mechanism of G-CSF-induced immature myeloid cells (gMCs). We found that Gr-1⁺ CD11b⁺ cells were highly induced in G-CSF-injected donor graft tissue, which is a phenotype of immature myeloid cells, resulting in an inhibition of acute GVHD lethality by suppressing alloreactive donor T-cell expansion. IDO was not detected in primary isolated gMCs; however, this enzyme was markedly induced after treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ). This level was significantly higher in IFN-γ-treated gMCs than in bone marrow myeloid cells, which promote alloreactive T-cell responses. We next investigated the functional role of IDO in gMC-mediated inhibition of acute GVHD lethality. We found no changes in gMC-mediated survival or alloreactive donor T-cell suppression when IDO activity was blocked using 1-methyl tryptophan. In addition, there was no difference in gMC-mediated survival rates between recipients transferred with either wild-type gMCs or IDO⁻/⁻ gMCs. Taken together, our data suggest that gMC-mediated inhibition of lethal acute GVHD is through an IDO-independent mechanism. 3agranulocyte colony-stimulating factor 2aAcute Disease 2aAnimals 2aCell Transplantation 2aFemale 2aGraft Rejectionximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aGraft vs Host Diseaseximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aGranulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factorxpharmacology 2aImmunosuppression Therapy. 2aIndoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenasexgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aInterferon-gammaximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMyeloid Cellsxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aT-Lymphocytesxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolism. 0agraft-versus-host disease 0aimmature myeloid cells 0aindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase1 aLee, Sun-Mi1 aLee, Soo-Woong1 aLee, Won-Sik1 aLee, Sang-Min1 aPark, Ji-Kyoung1 aChoi, Il-Whan1 aPark, Sae-Gwang1 aChoi, Inhak1 aSeo, Su-Kil0 tImmunology.g2009 Sept., v. 128, no. 1pt2 p.e632-e640dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03048.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b20091002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02159naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245008600182300001600268520068200284650002100966650001000987650004400997650001201041650005201053650002101105650000901126650001101135650001401146650001101160650001801171650000901189650002401198650001601222653001801238653002401256653002901280700002401309700002201333700002501355700002101380773012601401852000901527856008501536930003301621946001101654655001201665IND4426153820221116161436.0090918e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442615382DNAL7 a197049422pmid7 a10.1007/s10517-009-0520-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukes, V.

Despite the numerous compounds which could be identified, the biosynthetic pathways and the participating enzymes or cDNAs could be characterized only for a few selected members, whereas the biosynthesis of the majority of the compounds is still largely unknown. In an attempt to characterize additional biosynthetic steps at the molecular level, integration of alkaloid and transcript profiling across Papaver species was performed. This analysis showed high expression of an expressed sequence tag (EST) of unknown function only in Papaver somniferum varieties. After full-length cloning of the open reading frame and sequence analysis, this EST could be classified as a member of the class II type O-methyltransferase protein family. It was related to O-methyltransferases from benzylisoquinoline biosynthesis, and the amino acid sequence showed 68% identical residues to norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase. However, rather than methylating norcoclaurine, the recombinant protein methylated norreticuline at position seven with a Km of 44 μ m using S-adenosyl- l-methionine as a cofactor. Of all substrates tested, only norreticuline was converted. Even minor changes in the benzylisoquinoline backbone were not tolerated by the enzyme. Accordingly, the enzyme was named norreticuline 7-O-methyltransferase (N7OMT). This enzyme represents a novel O-methyltransferase in benzylisoquinoline metabolism. Expression analysis showed slightly increased expression of N7OMT in P. somniferum varieties containing papaverine, suggesting its involvement in the partially unknown biosynthesis of this pharmaceutically important compound. 3aPapaver somniferum 3aamino acid sequences 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aopen reading frames 3apapaverine 3arecombinant proteins 3asequence analysis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPapaverxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPapaverinexbiosynthesis 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0abenzylisoquinoline alkaloids 0aO-methyltransferase 0aopium poppy 0apapaverine biosynthesis 0asecondary metabolism1 aBrandt, Wolfgang1 aSchmidt, Jürgen.1 aKramell, Robert1 aZiegler, Jörg0 tPlant journal.g2009 Oct., v. 60, no. 1 p.56-67dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03937.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02803naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245011100192300001800303520134100321650002101662650001401683650001801697650001601715650001301731650001601744650001401760650001201774650002501786650003301811650003501844650002801879650002001907653001601927653002001943653001201963653002101975653001601996700001502012700001802027773013102045852000902176856009202185930003302277946001102310655001202321IND4428602620221116161228.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442860262DNAL7 a198249272pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01853.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCORNWALLIS, C.K.10aRoutes to indirect fitness in cooperatively breeding vertebrates: kin discrimination and limited dispersal  ap. 2445-2457.  aHamilton demonstrated that the evolution of cooperative behaviour is favoured by high relatedness, which can arise through kin discrimination or limited dispersal (population viscosity). These two processes are likely to operate with limited overlap: kin discrimination is beneficial when variation in relatedness is higher, whereas limited dispersal results in less variable and higher average relatedness, reducing selection for kin discrimination. However, most empirical work on eukaryotes has focused on kin discrimination. To address this bias, we analysed how kin discrimination and limited dispersal interact to shape helping behaviour across cooperatively breeding vertebrates. We show that kin discrimination is greater in species where the: (i) average relatedness in groups is lower and more variable; (ii) effect of helpers on breeders reproductive success is greater; and (iii) probability of helping was measured, rather than the amount of help provided. There was also an interaction between these effects with the correlation between the benefits of helping and kin discrimination being stronger in species with higher variance in relatedness. Overall, our results suggest that kin discrimination provides a route to indirect benefits when relatedness is too variable within groups to favour indiscriminate cooperation. 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3akin selection 3aprobability 3avariance 3avertebrates 3aviscosity 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aBirdsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMammalsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSocial Behavior 0acooperation 0aHamilton's rule 0ahelping 0aindirect fitness 0arelatedness1 aWEST, S.A.1 aGRIFFIN, A.S.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2009 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.2445-2457dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01853.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03411naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001500151245007900166300001600245500018900261500002400450520194500474650002202419650003802441650001302479650002202492650001302514650001902527650001502546650001802561650001602579650001102595650001502606650001302621650001802634650001202652700001402664700001602678700001502694700001602709773014002725852000902865856009102874655001202965IND4463306920221116161253.0120525s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330692DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.944.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Hongju10aGenetic variation in glucosinolate content within Brassica rapa vegetables  ap. 129-140.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Vegetable Production, Quality and Process Standardization in Chain: a Worldwide Perspective, held October 14-17, 2008, Beijing, China.  aIncludes references  aGlucosinolates (GSs) were analyzed in 56 accessions of Brassica rapa grown in the greenhouse. Eight different glucosinolates were identified in the Brassica rapa group. They are the aliphatic glucosinolates progoitrin (PRO), gluconapin (NAP), glucobrassicanapin (GBN), the indolyl glucosinolates 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin (4OH), glucobrassicin (GBC), 4-methoxyglucobrassicin (4ME), neoglucobrassicin (NEO) and the aromatic glucosinolate gluconasturtiin (NAS). Gluconapin, glucobrassicanapin, progoitrin and gluconasturtiin are the most abundant GSs in the Brassica rapa, but there is considerable variation in content among accessions. The total glucosinolate contents in Brassica rapa group varied substantially between the different accessions. The highest amount of GSs (361 µmol/100 g FW) was observed in leaves of vegetable turnip, followed by rapid cycling and yellow sarson, with the amount of 200 and 178 µmol/100 g FW respectively. Whereas the lowest GSs content was found in turnip greens (20.8 µmol/100 g FW) and Wutacai (22.6 µmol/100 g FW). The total aliphatic GSs proportion varied from 50 to 90% of the total GS, while generally the content of indolyl glucosinoloates, especially 4OH glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin is low. Gluconasturtiin was found in relatively high concentrations in komastsuna (14.6 μmol/100 g FW), yellow sarson (7.1 μmol/ 100 g FW) and constitutes as much as 24% of the total amount of glucosinolates. Relatively high amounts of gluconapin (281 mmol/100 g FW) and glucobrassicanapin (60.0 mmol/100 g FW) were observed in the leaves of vegetable turnip. Compared with the Brassica oleracea group, Brassica rapa lacks glucoraphanin and sinigrin but contains gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin. Variations in glucosinolate content among genotypes suggest differences in their health-promoting properties and the opportunity for enhancement of their levels through breeding or genetic modification. 3aBrassica oleracea 3aBrassica rapa subsp. trilocularis 3abreeding 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aglucobrassicin 3agluconapin 3aglucoraphanin 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3aprogoitrin 3asinigrin 3aturnip greens 3aturnips1 aPing, Lou1 aBonnema, G.1 aDekker, M.1 aVerkerk, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Apr., , no. 944 p.129-140dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.944.173Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01502naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245007800171300001600249520052200265650001900787650001300806650002000819650001100839650002300850650001100873650002700884700002400911773010300935852000901038856008501047930003301132946001101165655001201176IND4426159920221116161218.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442615992DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1239-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDziurkowska, Ewelina 10aEvaluation of Two Techniques for Extraction of Cortisol from Human Saliva  ap. 769-774.  aThe aim of the study was to compare two kinds of extraction of cortisol from human saliva.

Isolated microspore culture technique has been used to assist in generating mutants in some species. CGMCC No 2553 is a Brassica allosextuple species (AABBCC, n=27), which owns A, B and C chromosomes simultaneously. A simple, rapid and economic method to get leaf wrinkledness mutants from it was founded in this paper. The method mainly includes two steps. First, microspores isolated in the buds from 2.0 to 3.5 mm in length of CGMCC No 2553 were first incubated at 32.5°C for 24 h then at 25 °C for 14 days in the darkness. Cotyledon embryos were transferred to B5 solid culture medium and then recultivated for 4-5 times. Thus regeneration plants were acquired. Second, after these DH plants were set at 4-5°C for 15-20 days they were grew in greenhouse without heating apparatus at mid February in Beijing or they were directly grew in greenhouse without heating apparatus at January in Beijing at naturally lower temperature for 30-40 days. Then some DH plants could become leaf wrinkledness mutants growing some days later. Results showed 172 DH plants in 2006 and 230 DH plants in 2007 were gotten via isolated microspore culture technique. 8 leaf wrinkledness mutants were gotten from 2006 to 2007. 4 leaf wrinkledness mutants of 175 DH plants in 2007 were gotten. The highest rate of getting mutants was 2.29%. 2 mutants had gotten seeds. The leaf wrinkledness mutants mainly showed wrinkledness in the surface of preceding leaves at the seedling stage. Then the wrinkledness leaves could transfer to normal ones and some also keep the wrinkledness later with their growth. Further studies showed some DH plants could generate more than two stems in which mutant and wild type often burgeoned at the same parent. The mutants had the same characteristics as wild types except for the leaf wrinkledness, therefore they were the better materials for studying wrinkledness characteristics. They are useful in studying heredity, cloning the wrinkledness gene(s) linked to leaf mutants of Brassica allosextuple CGMCC No 2553 in the future. 3atemperature 3abuds 3astems 3achromosomes 3aBrassica 3aseedlings 3abreeding 3acotyledons 3amicrospores 3agenes 3amutants 3aheat treatment 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aculture media 3aleaves 3agreenhouses 3aChina 0aseeds1 aZhang, Fenglan1 aXu, Jiabing0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Apr., , no. 944 p.101-106dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.944.133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02761naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245011100163300001400274500002400288520180100312650001402113650001902127650001102146650001902157650001902176650002002195700002202215700002302237773009502260852000902355856008302364655001202447IND4463304720221116161012.0120524s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330472DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrommer, Harold10aNew approach for quantitative assessment of articular cartilage degeneration in horses with osteoarthritis  ap. 83-87.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To evaluate a modified digital imaging technique for quantitative assessment of the grade of osteoarthritis across the proximal articular surface of the first phalanx in horses. Sample Population-6 metacarpophalangeal (fetlock) joint specimens from 6 horses with various stages of osteoarthritis. Procedure-First phalanx specimens, together with 4 gray scale reference calibration targets, were positioned in a bath with the proximal articular cartilage surface submerged in saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Digital images were obtained from the articular surface before and after staining with Indian ink. Computer-controlled gray level analysis of the nonstained and Indian ink-stained cartilage surfaces and gray scale reference calibration targets was performed by use of the mean pixel value (based on 255-gray scale). An increase in the mean pixel value after staining was used to calculate the cartilage degeneration index (CDI). Results-The CDI of the proximal articular cartilage surface of the first phalanx specimens ranged from 9.2 +/- 5.7 (early stage osteoarthritis) to 41.5 +/- 3.6% (late stage osteoarthritis). The effect of repeating the measurement 6 times in nonstained (including repositioning) and stained specimens (including repositioning and restaining) was not significant. Up to 10 measurements of nonstained specimens could be made without refreshing the bath solution. In stained specimens, mean gray level increased significantly after the sixth measurement. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance-The modified digital imaging technique allowed quantitative assessment of cartilage degeneration across the articular cartilage surface. The CDI is the first quantitative measure for osteoarthritis-induced cartilage degeneration over an entire joint surface in horses. 3acartilage 3adigital images 3ahorses 3aimage analysis 3aosteoarthritis 3asodium chloride1 aWeeren, René van1 aBrama, Pieter A.J.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2003 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.83-87x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.833Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03665naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002000193245011600213300001800329520177600347650003402123650002002157650002802177650003402205650005102239650002702290650001102317650004302328650004102371650004302412650003202455650004402487650004702531650003002578650005102608650006802659653003802727653000802765700001902773700002102792700001902813700002202832700002202854773011402876852000902990856009202999930003303091946001103124655001203135IND4424206620221116160954.0090807e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442420662DNAL7 a191919072pmid7 aPMC27539552pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.03012.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoma, Haruyoshi10aCalpain inhibition induces activation of the distinct signalling pathways and cell migration in human monocytes  ap. e487-e496.  aWe have recently reported that constitutively active calpain negatively regulates activation of the distinct signalling pathways and cell migration in human neutrophils. Here, we report that a similar regulatory system is also functioning in human monocytes, but not lymphocytes. Calpain was constitutively active in resting human monocytes, but not lymphocytes. Mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and p21-activated kinase (PAK, an effector molecule of Rac) were rapidly (within 1 min) activated in monocytes, but not lymphocytes, upon exposure to calpain inhibitors (PD150606 and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO), but not PD145305 (the inactive analogue of PD150606). Following activation of these signalling pathways, monocytes displayed active migration within 5 min after exposure to calpain inhibitors, and active migration was sustained for more than 45 min. The micropipette method revealed that calpain inhibition-mediated monocyte migration was chemotaxis, not random migration. The studies with pharmacological inhibitors suggest that calpain inhibition-mediated monocyte migration is mediated by activation of ERK, p38, JNK, PI3K/Akt and Rac. NSC23766 (Rac inhibitor) and pertussis toxin (PTX) suppressed calpain inhibitor-induced phosphorylation of distinct signalling molecules (PAK, ERK, p38, JNK and Akt) as well as cell migration, suggesting that the PTX-sensitive G protein and Rac axis may be a possible key target of calpain inhibitors. These findings suggest that constitutively active calpain negatively regulates activation of the distinct signalling pathways and cell migration in resting monocytes, but not lymphocytes. 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3apertussis toxin 2aAcrylatesxpharmacology 2aAminoquinolinesxpharmacology 2aCalpainxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aChemotaxisximmunology 2aHumans 2aLymphocytesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMonocytesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNeutrophilsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPertussis Toxinxphysiology 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aProtein Kinasesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPyrimidinesxpharmacology 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2arac GTP-Binding Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 0amitogen-activated protein kinases 0aRac1 aKato, Takayuki1 aFujita, Hisakazu1 aKitagawa, Maki1 aYamano, Tsunekazu1 aKitagawa, Seiichi0 tImmunology.g2009 Sept., v. 128, no. 1pt2 p.e487-e496dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.03012.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b20091002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02500naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002600193245007100219300001600290520140500306650002201711650002101733653001501754653002001769653002601789700002201815700002401837700001901861773012301880852000902003856009202012930003302104946001302137655001202150IND4426449620221116161000.0090925e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442644962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06337.x2doi7 aPMC30444912pmcid7 a196862452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez-Ortiz, Efrain10aProtein phosphatase 5 protects neurons against amyloid-β toxicity  ap. 391-402.  aAmyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to promote neuronal cell loss in Alzheimer's disease, in part through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine phosphatase which has been implicated in several cell stress response pathways and shown to inactivate MAPK pathways through key dephosphorylation events. Therefore, we examined whether PP5 protects dissociated embryonic rat cortical neurons in vitro from cell death evoked by Aβ. As predicted, neurons in which PP5 expression was decreased by small-interfering RNA treatment were more susceptible to Aβ toxicity. In contrast, over-expression of PP5, but not the inactive mutant, PP5(H304Q), prevented MAPK phosphorylation and neurotoxicity induced by Aβ. PP5 also prevented cell death caused by direct treatment with H₂O₂, but did not prevent Aβ-induced production of ROS. Thus, the neuroprotective effect of PP5 requires its phosphatase activity and lies downstream of Aβ-induced generation of ROS. In summary, our data indicate that PP5 plays a pivotal neuroprotective role against cell death induced by Aβ and oxidative stress. Consequently, PP5 might be an effective therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in which oxidative stress is implicated. 3aAlzheimer disease 3aoxidative stress 0aamyloid-β 0aneuroprotection 0aprotein phosphatase 51 aHahm, Byoung Kwon1 aArmstrong, David L.1 aRossie, Sandra0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Oct., v. 111, no. 2 p.391-402dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06337.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02402naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010700170300001600277520102400293650002601317650002101343650002201364650001301386650002601399650001401425650001501439650001701454650004101471650002001512650001601532650001001548650003101558653000901589653001201598653001101610700002501621700002101646700003001667773010901697852000901806856008501815930003301900946001101933655001201944IND4423354820221116161117.0090718e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442335482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-009-9895-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Alan E. 10aAcquisition of phosphorus and nitrogen in the rhizosphere and plant growth promotion by microorganisms  ap. 305-339.  aThe rhizosphere is a complex environment where roots interact with physical, chemical and biological properties of soil. Structural and functional characteristics of roots contribute to rhizosphere processes and both have significant influence on the capacity of roots to acquire nutrients. Roots also interact extensively with soil microorganisms which further impact on plant nutrition either directly, by influencing nutrient availability and uptake, or indirectly through plant (root) growth promotion. In this paper, features of the rhizosphere that are important for nutrient acquisition from soil are reviewed, with specific emphasis on the characteristics of roots that influence the availability and uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen. The interaction of roots with soil microorganisms, in particular with mycorrhizal fungi and non-symbiotic plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, is also considered in relation to nutrient availability and through the mechanisms that are associated with plant growth promotion. 3afunctional properties 3agrowth promotion 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant nutrition 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil biological properties 0aPGPR 0aExudate 0aUptake1 aBarea, José-Miguel 1 aMcNeill, Ann M. 1 aPrigent-Combaret, Claire 0 tPlant and soil.g2009 Aug., v. 321, no. 1-2 p.305-339dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-9895-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02423naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002000151245008400171300001600255500014100271500002400412520122100436650000901657650001201666650001501678650001001693650002801703650002001731650001101751650000901762650001301771700001601784700002101800773014001821852000901961856009101970655001202061IND4463308620221116161415.0120525s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330862DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.943.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunasekaran, W.10aCell wall degrading enzyme activities during ripening in 'Nangka' (AAB) bananas  ap. 103-110.  aPaper presented at the Asia Pacific Symposium on Postharvest Research Education and Extension, held August 2-4, 2010, Bangkok, Thailand.  aIncludes references  aPulp softening during ripening in Musa ‘Nangka’ (AAB) banana was investigated.

Ripening stage determination was done according to the peel colour changes of ‘Nangka’ (AAB) bananas which were monitored chromatically and visually and subsequently correlated with the respiration pattern measured during ripening. The activity of four cell wall degrading enzymes (PME, PG, PL and cellulase) were studied. Results obtained showed a pattern of increasing activity throughout the ripening process where the lowest activity for all four enzymes was observed at the initial stage of ripening. PME and PG however, showed relatively higher activities compared to PL and cellulase in all ripening stages. Significant increase in all cell wall enzyme activities were observed after colour break and coincided with the respiration peak. These findings suggest that cell wall degrading enzymes are activated upon respiration burst and peel colour break during ripening in ‘Nangka’ (AAB) bananas. 3aMusa 3abananas 3acell walls 3acolor 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3apulp 3aripening1 aBoyce, A.N.1 aCantiran̲, Cu.,0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Feb., , no. 943 p.103-110dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.943.103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02090naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245008700168300001600255500014100271500002400412520078800436650001301224650002901237650001301266650002301279650000901302650001001311650002801321650001101349650002301360700002301383700001801406700002101424700001901445773014001464852000901604856009101613655001201704IND4463308720221116161215.0120525s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330872DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.943.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJirapong, C.10aComparison of volatile compounds between fresh and heat-processed aromatic coconut  ap. 111-115.  aPaper presented at the Asia Pacific Symposium on Postharvest Research Education and Extension, held August 2-4, 2010, Bangkok, Thailand.  aIncludes references  aAroma volatile profiles of flesh and water of aromatic young coconut were compared between fresh and heat-processed nut using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS).

Compacts are viewed as inflexible, rigid governance structures incapable of responding to changing environmental and institutional settings because of the use of unanimity rules and the inability to directly regulate water users. Using data from a study of 14 western interstate river compacts we examine this claim. In particular, we explore the response of compacts to water conflicts. We find that members of compacts, closely related water agencies, and compact governments are capable of responding to conflicts. To better understand this finding, we identify the conditions under which compacts are likely to address conflicts, as well as the types of conflict solutions compact governments adopted. 3aconflict management 0ainterstate compacts 0ainstitutional analysis and development framework 0aqualitative comparative analysis1 aHeikkila, Tanya0 tPolicy studies journal.g2009 Aug., v. 37, no. 3 p.367-392dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0190-292X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00319.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090731b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02695naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245011200198300001800310506007600328520115100404506003701555650001801592650000801610650001501618650003201633650001601665650001801681650002101699650001101720650001801731650000901749650001401758650002001772650001501792650002901807700001901836700001301855700002501868700002301893700002401916773008201940852000902022856007902031939003302110946001102143990002302154655001202177IND4457402420221207084533.0110429e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445740242DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkq11422doi7 aPMC30828812pmcid7 a211729302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, De-Sheng12aA novel regulatory circuit in base excision repair involving AP endonuclease 1, Creb1 and DNA polymerase β  ap. 3156-3165.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA repair is required to maintain genome stability in stem cells and early embryos. At critical junctures, oxidative damage to DNA requires the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Since early zebrafish embryos lack the major polymerase in BER, DNA polymerase ss, repair proceeds via replicative polymerases, even though there is ample polb mRNA. Here, we report that Polb protein fails to appear at the appropriate time in development when AP endonuclease 1 (Apex), the upstream protein in BER, is knocked down. Because polb contains a Creb1 binding site, we examined whether knockdown of Apex affects creb1. Apex knockdown results in loss of Creb1 and Creb complex members but not Creb1 phosphorylation. This effect is independent of p53. Although both apex and creb1 mRNA rescue Creb1 and Polb after Apex knockdown, Apex is not a co-activator of creb1 transcription. This observation has broad significance, as similar results occur when Apex is inhibited in B cells from apex⁺/⁻ mice. These results describe a novel regulatory circuit involving Apex, Creb1 and Polb and provide a mechanism for lethality of Apex loss in higher eukaryotes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aDanio rerio 3abinding sites 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenome 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amortality 3aphosphorylation 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics)1 aYang, Xiao-Jie1 aLiu, Wei1 aGuikema, Jeroen E.J.1 aSchrader, Carol E.1 aStrauss, Phyllis R.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Apr., v. 39, no. 8 p.3156-3165x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq11423Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110429  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03613naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002100176245005900197300001600256500002400272500001500296520153800311650002101849650001801870650001501888650002001903650001901923650001101942650001401953650002501967650001201992650001402004650002602018650002602044650002602070650002602096650002502122650003502147650003602182650002102218650002802239650007302267650003302340650002202373650003402395650004402429650005302473650001102526653002302537653001202560653001602572653001902588700001902607700001702626700002102643773009702664852000902761856008802770930003302858945002502891946001102916655001202927IND4405625620221116161233.0080513e20080622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440562562DNAL7 a182435872pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aSuzuki, Kazuhiko10aEquine coronavirus induces apoptosis in cultured cells  ap. 390-395.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEquine coronavirus (ECoV) was first isolated from a diarrheic foal and was found genetically similar to group II coronaviruses. However, its pathological characteristics were not adequately investigated. In our preliminary in vitro investigation, ECoV-induced cell death was observed in bovine kidney-derived MDBK cells. Based on this finding, we investigated whether the ECoV-induced CPE was apoptosis. Following ECoV infection, MDBK cells showed morphological changes such as cell rounding and detachment from the culture surface. Moreover, syncytium formation was observed as the other type of cytopathic effect in ECoV infection. Morphologic and biochemical features of apoptosis, such as nuclear fragmentation and DNA ladder formation, were also detected in ECoV-infected cells. Moreover, as is commonly observed in coronavirus infection in other animals, the activities of effecter caspases - caspase-3/7 - and initiator caspases - caspase-8 and caspase-9 - that are representative factors in the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, respectively, were increased in ECoV-infected MDBK cells. Therefore, it was suggested that ECoV can induce apoptosis in MDBK cells via a caspase-dependent pathway. Apoptotic death of infected cells is detrimental because it causes cell and tissue destruction and inflammatory responses. Although the pathological characteristics of ECoV are largely unknown, apoptosis may be the pathological basis of lesions of the digestive system in ECoV infection. 3alesions (animal) 3aCoronavirinae 3acell lines 3aenzyme activity 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3aapoptosis 3acysteine proteinases 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCaspase 7xmetabolism 2aCaspase 8xmetabolism 2aCaspase 9xmetabolism 2aCaspasesxmetabolism 2aCaspases, Effectorxmetabolism 2aCaspases, Initiatorxmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCoronavirusxphysiology 2aCoronavirus Infectionsxenzymologyxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aCytopathogenic Effect, Viral 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aEnzyme Activationxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aHorse Diseasesxenzymologyxpathologyxvirology. 2aHorses 0aEquine coronavirus 0acaspase 0aCoronavirus 0acultured cells1 aMatsui, Yusuke1 aMiura, Yasuo1 aSentsui, Hiroshi0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 June 22, v. 129, no. 3-4 p.390-395dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.11.0343Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03366naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100002300171245009300194300001600287500002400303500001500327520165700342650002701999650001402026650002102040650002102061650001102082650001802093650001402111650002002125650002002145650001502165650001202180650002702192650002702219653003902246653001802285653002402303653001202327700002802339700003002367700002002397700003402417700004402451700002802495773010602523852000902629856009302638930003302731945002502764946001102789655001202800IND4405626720221116161333.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440562672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL2101 aMagnusson, Vanessa10aBovine oocyte vitrification: Effect of ethylene glycol concentrations and meiotic stages  ap. 265-273.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSuccess in oocyte cryopreservation is limited and several factors as cryoprotectant type or concentration and stage of oocyte meiotic maturation are involved. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of maturation stage and ethylene glycol (EG) concentration on survival of bovine oocytes after vitrification. In experiment 1, kinetics of oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) was evaluated. Germinal vesicle (GV), germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), metaphase I (MI), and metaphase II (MII) oocytes were found predominantly at 0, 0-10, 10-14, and 18-24h of IVM, respectively. In experiment 2, in vitro embryo development after in vitro fertilization (IVF) of oocytes exposed to equilibrium (ES) and vitrification solution VS-1 (EG 30%), or VS-2 (EG 40%) at 0, 12 or 18h of IVM was evaluated. Only blastocyst rate from oocytes vitrified in SV-2 after 18h of IVM was different from control oocytes. Hatched blastocyst rates from oocytes vitrified in VS-1 after 12 and 18h, and SV-2 after 18h of IVM were different from unvitrified oocytes. In experiment 3, embryo development was examined after IVF of oocytes vitrified using VS-1 or VS-2 at 0, 12 or 18h of IVM. Rates of blastocyst development after vitrification of oocytes in VS-1 at each time interval were similar. However, after vitrification in VS-2, blastocyst rates were less at 18h than 0h. Both cleavage rates and blastocyst rates were significantly less in all vitrification groups when compared to control group and only control oocytes hatched. In conclusion, both EG concentration and stage of meiotic maturation affect the developmental potential of oocytes after vitrification. 3achemical concentration 3aviability 3agerminal vesicle 3acryopreservation 3acattle 3aembryogenesis 3aoogenesis 3acryoprotectants 3aethylene glycol 3ablastocyst 3ameiosis 3agermplasm conservation 3ain vitro fertilization 0aassisted reproductive technologies 0avitrification 0ain vitro maturation 0aoocytes1 aFeitosa, Weber Beringui1 aGoissis, Marcelo Demarchi1 aYamada, Claudia1 aTavares, Liliam Mara Trevisan1 aD'Ávila Assumpção, Mayra Elena Ortiz1 aVisintin, José Antonio0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2008 July, v. 106, no. 3-4 p.265-273dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.05.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080709b20080801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/06/25  aNon-US 7aarticle04111naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001800180245013200198300001600330500002400346500001500370520251500385650002302900650001802923650001902941650002602960650001102986650001002997650002003007650002303027650002603050650002003076650002203096650001003118650001203128650001903140653002003159653001903179700001803198700001703216700001703233700001603250700001403266773010603280852000903386856009303395930003303488945002503521946001103546655001203557IND4405626620221116160959.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440562662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL100 0aL3001 aPyykönen, T.14aThe effect of a combination of permanent breeding cage and low housing density on the reproductive success of farmed blue foxes  ap. 255-264.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSocial factors are known to affect the reproduction of many canids both in the wild and in farms. For example, reproduction in farmed silver foxes is regulated by social stress; foxes seem to benefit from noncramped housing conditions and permanent breeding cages. However, no comparable studies have been carried out in farmed blue foxes. The aim of our experiment was to create an alternative, improved, economically viable and practical housing solution for blue foxes. Therefore, we compared reproductive performance of blue foxes in permanent breeding cages with low animal densities (L group, N =79) and traditional housing with its changing social environment with high animal density (H group, N =74). The reproductive data from the L and H groups were compared separately for primiparous and multiparous vixens because the reproductive performance in primiparous vixens was substantially lower (P <0.001) than in multiparous vixens. Altogether, 41 and 39% of the primiparous vixens in the H and L group whelped (P >0.05), but only 28 and 34%, respectively, weaned at least one cub (P >0.05), i.e., 72 and 66% of the primiparous vixens did not reproduce in the H and L group, respectively (P >0.05). The total reproductive performance, expressed as cubs at weaning per breeding female, was 1.7±3.5 for the H and 1.6±2.9 for the L group (P >0.05). In the primiparous vixens, the only statistically significant difference observed between the two housing systems was that the onset of oestrus occurred five days earlier in the H than in the L group (P <0.05). All multiparous vixens in the L group exhibited oestrus compared to 94% in the H group (P >0.05). Furthermore, there was a nonsignificant (ns) trend for fewer barren females (9% versus 17%), more successfully reproducing vixens (83% versus 74%) and a higher number of live-born cubs (10.9±4.7 versus 9.4±3.9) in the L than in H group in the multiparous vixens (for all P >0.05). This resulted in 1.7 and 1.4 cubs more per breeding and per mated vixen, respectively, at weaning in the L group (7.3±5.0) compared to the H group (5.6±4.2), but also this difference was nonsignificant. Although our present results lack statistical significance, they are promising enough to encourage field experiments with sufficiently large number of animals to prove or disprove these preliminary findings that lower housing density and permanent breeding cage, together or separately, may enhance reproduction particularly in multiparous blue fox vixens. 3aanimal communities 3aanimal stress 3abreeding sites 3areproductive behavior 3aestrus 3afoxes 3asocial behavior 3apopulation density 3afarmed animal species 3aanimal breeding 3apregnancy outcome 3acages 3afemales 3aVulpes lagopus 0aanimal behavior 0aAlopex lagopus1 aHänninen, S.1 aMohaibes, M.1 aSepponen, J.1 aMononen, J.1 aAhola, L.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2008 July, v. 106, no. 3-4 p.255-264dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.04.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20080709b20080801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/06/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03894naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100002900180245011400209300001600323500002400339500001500363520239600378650001402774650001302788650001502801650001802816650001402834650001702848650001902865650002402884650001402908650001402922650001902936650001302955650001102968650002202979650001803001650001203019653001803031653001503049700002303064773010603087852000903193856009303202930003303295945002503328946001103353655001203364IND4405627820221116160933.0080513e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440562782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL600 0aL1001 aQureshi, Muhammad Subhan10aInteraction of calf suckling, use of oxytocin and milk yield with reproductive performance of dairy buffaloes  ap. 380-392.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCalf suckling and oxytocin injections are commonly used for pre-milking stimulus in dairy buffaloes under field conditions. A study was conducted to investigate effect of these treatments on reproductive performance. Fifty one Nili-Ravi buffaloes were monitored from parturition up to 150 days postpartum through rectal examination. Data on milk yield, body condition score (BCS) and reproductive parameters were recorded weekly. Postpartum ovulation interval (POI) was determined by presence of an ovulation depression or a very soft corpus luteum haemorrhagicum and was confirmed through milk progesterone levels (MPL). Suckling was used to stimulate milk let down, and where the calf had died, injection of oxytocin was resorted to. Milk samples were analyzed for MPL using radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fat; and milk yield was converted to 4% fat corrected milk (FCM). The mean postpartum uterine involution length (PUI) was 34.30±1.33 days. Mean POI was 59.37±4.76 days and mean postpartum estrus interval (PEI) was 69.03±6.03 days. Suckling period averaged 26.40±5.57 days and correlated with POI (r =0.19, P <0.01) and PEI (r =0.23, P <0.01). POI was shortest in buffaloes suckled for one month (P <0.05). Oxytocin was used with a mean dosage of 7.50 IU, delaying placental expulsion time (PET) and POI but shortening PEI. BCS shortened PET, POI and PEI (P <0.01). Mean FCM was 14.50±0.20, ranging from 2 to 35kg/d; and was higher in estrus group; correlating positively with POI (r =0.31, P <0.01). MPL were 1.37±0.17ng/ml and increased after ovulation, remaining greater than 1.5ng/ml from Day 4 to 14 of the estrus cycle, followed by a rapid decline up to next estrus. BCS in buffaloes resuming oestrus was constantly higher than those failing to resume ovarian cyclicity. Live weight, prepartum was 510.0±5.9kg with a loss of 3.7±2.12kg, 30 days postpartum. The present study suggests a lower reproductive efficiency of dairy buffaloes under the peri-urban farming system reflected by ovarian cyclicity in 68.63% buffaloes within 150 days postpartum and silent estrus in 51.5% of the cases. Increasing suckling duration and use of oxytocin delayed POI, however, POI was shortest in buffaloes suckled for one month. The high yielding buffaloes also manifested better reproductive cyclicity; while moderate yielder showed shorter ovulation intervals and higher conception rate. 3abuffaloes 3aoxytocin 3aconception 3adairy animals 3alactation 3atherapeutics 3amilk synthesis 3ahormonal regulation 3ainjection 3aovulation 3amilk fat yield 3asuckling 3acalves 3apostpartum period 3aestrous cycle 3afemales 0ayoung animals 0amilk yield1 aAḥmad, Naz̲īr.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2008 July, v. 106, no. 3-4 p.380-392dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.05.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080709b20080801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/06/26  aNon-US 7aarticle04233naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002000182245010200202300001600304500002400320500001500344520146500359650002101824650002101845650002101866650002101887650003401908650001901942650002401961650003401985650001802019650002802037650003102065650002102096650000902117650001002126650001902136650002202155650001702177650001802194650002702212650003402239650002202273650007102295650001202366650003402378650003302412650002202445650002002467650003202487650006302519650004602582650004002628650002402668650004002692650000902732650003702741650004302778650004202821650003502863650000902898650002502907650002702932650005202959653001203011653001803023653002903041700001803070700001703088773009903105852000903204856008503213930003303298945002503331946001103356655001203367IND4405629520221116161220.0080513e20080522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440562952DNAL7 a183877612pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2008.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aTsai, Hsin-Hung10aEffects of San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang on U46619-induced increase in pulmonary arterial blood pressure  ap. 457-462.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthnopharmacological relevance: San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang (SHXT), composed of Coptidis rhizoma, Scutellariae radix and Rhei rhizoma, is traditionally used to treat hypertension. Aim of the study: Our aim was to investigate the pharmacology effect of SHXT on a thromboxane A₂ analogue U46619-induced increase in pulmonary hypertension and protein expression in primary pulmonary smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Materials and methods: Arterial blood pressure and isometric tension in the aorta and pulmonary artery of rats were measured by pressure and force transducers, respectively. Protein expressions on PASMCs were detected by Western blotting. Results: SHXT significantly attenuated U46619-induced increase in arterial blood pressure. The inhibitory effect of SHXT on pulmonary arterial pressure was greater than systemic arterial pressure in U46619 treated rats. Similarly, the inhibitory effect of SHXT on U46619-induced vasoconstriction in rat pulmonary arterial rings was greater than that in aortic rings. In U46619 treated PASMCs, SHXT down-regulated expression of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), Rho-kinase (ROCK) II, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and up-regulated expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) α₁ and sGCβ₁. Conclusions: SHXT attenuated U46619-induced increase in systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Inhibition of PDE5, ROCK-II, COX-2 and stimulation of sGC may play important roles in the cardiovascular effects of SHXT. 3amedicinal plants 3apulmonary artery 3aWestern blotting 3avasoconstriction 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3ablood pressure 3amechanism of action 3aphosphoric diester hydrolases 3asmooth muscle 3aantihypertensive effect 3agene expression regulation 3aherbal medicines 3arats 3aaorta 3atissue culture 3aprotein synthesis 3ahypertension 3aanimal models 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aguanylate cyclase 2a15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid 2aAnimals 2aAorta, Thoracicxdrug effects 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Separation 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 5xbiosynthesis 2aCyclooxygenase 2xbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxpharmacology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIsometric Contractionxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMuscle Contractionxdrug effects 2aMuscle, Smooth, Vascularxdrug effects 2aMyocytes, Smooth Musclexdrug effects 2aPulmonary Arteryxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aVasoconstrictor Agents 2arho-Associated Kinasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0akinases 0arho-kinase II 0aphosphodiesterase type 51 aChen, Ing-Jun1 aLo, Yi-Ching0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2008 May 22, v. 117, no. 3 p.457-462dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2008.02.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03697naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001300182245010600195300001600301500002400317500001500341520149100356650002401847650001701871650002201888650002301910650001801933650002101951650001101972650002101983650001402004650001802018650001102036650001002047650001602057650003402073650002402107650001202131650002002143650003702163650005202200650002202252650001602274650002402290650002402314650003102338650001302369650003802382650003602420650002102456650002702477650004502504650003402549653003102583653001602614653002202630700001202652700001202664700001302676773009902689852000902788856008502797930003302882945002502915946001102940655001202951IND4405629220221116161039.0080513e20080522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440562922DNAL7 a183948362pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2008.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aLuo, Jie10aIon channel mechanism and ingredient bases of Shenfu Decoction's cardiac electrophysiological effects  ap. 439-445.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAim of the study: Ion channel mechanism of cardiac electrophysiological effects of Shenfu Decoction (SFD, Ginseng and Aconiti Praeparatae Decoction), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, and its ingredient bases were investigated in guinea pigs. Materials and methods: After administration of an injection made from SFD (Shenfu Injection, SFI), the indexes of transmembrane action potential (TAP) in vivo and sodium channels in isolated ventricular myocyte were assayed by suspended microelectrodes and patch clamp techniques respectively, and ingredients of SFD were compared with. Results: After administration of SFI, the action potential amplitude (APA) and maximum velocity (V max) of TAP decreased. In the presence of either SFI or Fuzi active ingredient (FZAI)(5, 10, and 15%), not any other ingredient, the density of voltage-dependent sodium current (I Na) decreased significantly, while the inhibition ratio of SFI was larger. EC₅₀ of SFI was less than the one of FZAI, and SFI displayed effects on I Na in wider voltage scope than FZAI in current-voltage curve. Both SFI and FZAI shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of sodium channels to the left, and the recovery curve to the right. Conclusions: The results indicated that the cardiac electrophysiological effects of SFI were exerted by blocking sodium channels, and FZAI contributed to such effects most but inferior to SFI, which justified its use in anti-arrhythmia, myocardial protection, etc. 3amechanism of action 3aion channels 3aaction potentials 3aactive ingredients 3aion transport 3amedicinal plants 3adosage 3aherbal medicines 3ainjection 3aanimal models 3asodium 3aheart 3aguinea pigs 3aOriental traditional medicine 2aAconitumxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aCell Separation 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aElectrophysiology 2aGuinea Pigs 2aHeartxdrug effects 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIon Channelsxdrug effects 2aKinetics 2aMembrane Potentialsxdrug effects 2aMyocytes, Cardiacxdrug effects 2aPanaxxchemistry 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSodium Channelsxdrug effects 0aeffective concentration 50 0aingredients 0aelectrophysiology1 aMin, Su1 aWei, Ke1 aCao, Jun0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2008 May 22, v. 117, no. 3 p.439-445dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2008.02.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005200168300001600220520156600236650000801802650002401810650001301834650001601847650001001863650001601873650001101889650002001900650003101920650002501951650001701976650001101993650000902004650001902013650002002032650001502052650002102067651001102088700002402099700001802123773020302141856004802344852000902392655001202401IND60631516820221116161206.0190227s1994    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063151682DNAL7 a10.1080/026266694094927282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGUPTA, SUSHIL K.10aUse of injected helium as a hydrological tracer  ap. 109-119.  aHelium has several characteristics which make it attractive for use as a tracer in hydrological studies. These include its inert nature, relatively high solubility in water (~ 1 %), low molecular diffusion in water, ready availability in commercial quantities, nontoxic nature, and low background atmospheric concentration. The use of helium as a tracer of water movement has become possible through the development of an instrument which takes advantage of the fact that at room temperature helium diffuses through a quartz glass membrane at a rate of three to four orders of magnitude greater than any other gas. This paper describes: (i) a set of experiments undertaken to compare breakthrough of helium with common salt (NaCl) tracer through laboratory sand columns; (ii) a set of groundwater tracing experiments conducted in a basaltic aquifer in Central O'ahur, Hawaii and (iii) two laboratory experiments undertaken to evaluate the applicability of helium instrumentation for the tracing of submerged plumes in open water conditions. The test results demonstrate that helium behaves as a conservative tracer during saturated flow through porous media. During unsaturated flow, exchange of helium with air entrained in the porous media reduces its usefulness. During submerged flow of a labelled plume, helium behaves like fluorescein in a relatively tranquil laboratory tank environment for hours but is gradually lost through the air-water interface, thus limiting the usefulness of helium in shallow plume tracing studies to short duration experiments. 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aaquifers 3afluorescein 3aglass 3agroundwater 3ahelium 3ainstrumentation 3alaboratory experimentation 3aliquid-air interface 3aporous media 3aquartz 3asand 3asaturated flow 3asodium chloride 3asolubility 3aunsaturated flow 3aHawaii1 aMORAVCIK, PHILIP S.1 aLau, Stephen,0 tHydrological sciences journal.g1994, v. 39, no. 2 p.109-119dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626669409492728  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011400125300001400239520063700253650001800890650002100908650001700929650001900946650001400965650001400979650002300993650000901016650000901025650001101034650002201045651001301067653001901080700001701099700001601116773015701132852000901289930003301298945001301331946001101344655001201355IND2332757920221116161258.0030527e200203  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233275792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTowers, W.10aPotential impact of draft proposals to revise the EC Directive controlling sewage-sludge applications to land  ap. 65-71.  aThe EC Directive which controls the application of sewage sludge to agricultural land, in particular, the reduction in permitted concentrations of heavy metals in sludge and sludge-amended soils, is being reviewed by the European Commission.

The scenarios cast doubt on the long-term viability of the sludge-recycling option in Scotland. 3asewage sludge 3aland application 3aheavy metals 3asoil pollution 3adatabases 3arecycling 3aagricultural soils 3alead 3azinc 3anickel 3aenvironmental law 3aScotland 0aeu regulations1 aPaterson, E.1 aCoull, M.C.0 tWater and environmental management : journal of the Institution of Water and Environmental Management.g2002 Mar., v. 16, no. 1 p.65-71x0951-73597nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01570naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005300125300001600178520043300194650001800627650002100645650002800666650001400694650002000708650002300728650001500751650002100766650001500787650001700802650002200819650002200841653001400863653001200877653003000889700001600919773015900935852000901094930003301103945001301136946001101149655001201160IND2332759720221116161152.0030527e200211  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233275972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMara, D.D.10aSludge to land: microbiological double standards  ap. 249-252.  aThe microbiological requirements for enhanced treated sludge in the Safe Sludge Matrix are reviewed and compared with those for foods, which are much less stringent.

This can result in on-site impacts to crops and field operations and offsite impacts on the wider environment. Research into soil and water management in green asparagus production has been undertaken in the UK since 2010. This paper details two separate runoff and erosion trials conducted in 2012 and 2013 on commercial asparagus fields. Each trial has tested the efficacy of a range of treatments applied to inter-row wheelings including green waste compost (of PAS:100 quality protocol standard) and wheat straw mulch at different application rates, both with and without shallow soil disturbance. It was realised early on that compost was ineffective in runoff and soil loss management where application quantity was restricted by nitrogen regulations in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. Straw mulch alone has consistently reduced soil loss across both trials by 72 to 87% as compared to the bare soil control. Shallow soil disturbance alone reduced soil loss by 4 to 13%, with no significant differences observed between various tillage implements tested. Despite the reductions observed in soil loss, runoff sediment concentration still exceeds that stipulated by EU Directive for surface water quality; risking pollution of any receiving water bodies. The knowledge gained from these studies should be used to develop more effective runoff and soil loss control in order to ensure the future sustainability of asparagus production. 3aEuropean Union 3aapplication rate 3acomposts 3acrops 3adisturbed soils 3agreen waste 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apollution 3aproduction technology 3aprotocols 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3astraw mulches 3asurface water 3atillage implements 3atopographic slope 3awater management 3awater quality 3awheat straw 3aUnited Kingdom1 aSimmons, R.

Two previously defined types of models are used: in PE type models the input series are precipitation and potential evapotranspiration; in P type models the only input is precipitation. The main conclusions are: (1) random errors in precipitation data, when great enough, affect model performance significantly; (2) systematic errors in precipitation data are less important for the estimation of river flow; and (3) a data length of 10 years is necessary and sufficient for a reliable calibration of monthly water balance models of humid basins. 3abasins 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic engineering 3ahydrologic models 3amodel validation 3arunoff1 aVANDEWIELE, G.

In this paper, the research progress in the adsorption of heavy metals in water treatment by ENFMs is reviewed. Three types of ENFMs, including organic polymer ENFMs, organic polymer/inorganic material composite ENFMs and inorganic ENFMs are summarized, and their adsorption capacities for heavy metals in water are compared. The adsorption selectivity and capacity of ENFMs for heavy metals are depended largely on the type and number of functional groups on the surface of membranes, and usually the more the functional groups, the higher the adsorption capacity. The adsorption mechanisms of ENFMs are also mainly determined by the type of functional groups on the membrane. At present, the main challenge is to achieve the mass production of high-quality nanofibers and their actual application in the treatment of heavy metal-containing wastewater. Therefore, more consideration should be focused on the improvement of stability, mechanical strength and reusability of ENFMs. This review may provide an insight for the development of ENFMs-based adsorbents for heavy metals separation and water purification in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3aporosity 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurface area 3awastewater 3awater purification 0aElectrospinning 0aNanofibrous 0aMembrane 0aHeavy Metal 0aWater treatment1 aZheng, Yu-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3858-10371 aZhang, Bao-Gang1 aDai, Yun-Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6335-44100 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 401 p.123608-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1236083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014500163500002200308520168000330592002802010650002002038650001302058650002502071650002502096650002502121650002502146650002102171650001402192650001402206650001702220650002402237650000902261650002002270650003102290650001002321650001902331650001202350650001802362650001302380650003402393650001502427650001502442650004302457650005202500650001202552650001302564653001202577653001302589653002302602653000902625653001602634700001402650700001602664700001802680700001702698773009002715856008602805852000902891655001202900IND60661555520221121025750.0190830e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066155552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.1052862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qi10aRole of miR-731 and miR-2188-3p in mediating Chlorpyrifos induced head kidney injury in common carp via targeting TLR and apoptosis pathways  aPre-press version  aChlorpyrifos (CPF) is an environmental pollutant with increasing importance due to its high toxicity to fish and aquatic animals. In the present study, we divided 120 common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) into two groups including control group and CPF group, CPF group was exposed to 14.5 μg/L CPF for 30 d. 17 miRNAs were differentially expressed in CPF group head kidney tissues according to the results of miRNAome analysis. In addition, histopathological examination and electron microscopy proved that CPF exposure could lead to damage of head kidney and obvious apoptosis characteristics. The possible target genes of miRNA were predicted using online target gene prediction websites, miRNAome sequencing, GO and KEGG enrichment. miRNAome results showed that expression of miR-731 and miR-2188-3p in CPF group was 0.48 time and 0.45 time as control group, respectively. qRT-PCR results proved the reality of miRNAome. During CPF exposure, mRNA expression of TLR pathway genes and its downstream genes involved in autophagy and apoptosis pathway including TLR1, TLR2, TLR7, TLR9, MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, IRF7, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, Caspase3, Caspase8 and Bax were differentially increased under CPF exposure, along with ATG13 and Bcl2 decreased at the same time. Western blot results indicated that apoptosis related protein Caspase3 and Caspase8 were differentially up-regulated in the CPF group. In summary, CPF exposure could induce apoptosis while inhibited autophagy in head kidney of common carp via the regulation of miR-2188-3p and miR-731 by targeting TLR pathway. These results provide new insights for unveiling the biological effects of CPF and miRNAs in common carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aInternet 3aToll-like receptor 1 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aToll-like receptor 7 3aToll-like receptor 9 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3achlorpyrifos 3aelectron microscopy 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3apollutants 3aprediction 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 3atoxicity 0amiR-731 0amiR-2188 0atoll-like receptor 0acarp 0ahead kidney1 aYang, Jie1 aGong, Yafan1 aCai, Jingzeng1 aZhang, Ziwei0 tAquatic toxicology.g2019 Aug. 22, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.1052863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011600170300001800286520133500304592002801639650002301667650004401690650001301734650001201747650003101759650001201790650001801802650001601820650001501836650001601851650001101867650001701878650001401895650000901909650001101918650001401929650001401943650001301957650001501970650001301985650001301998650001102011650002102022650001302043650002002056650002602076650002002102650000902122700002502131700001702156700001802173700002002191700002702211773012702238856008102365852000902446655001202455IND60672439120221120122649.0191016e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067243912DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0370-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopal Prabakaran, 10aEvaluation of Chemical Composition and In Vitro Antiinflammatory Effect of Marine Microalgae Chlorella vulgaris  ap. 3263-3270.  aThe present study was aimed to investigate the nutritional composition, chemical components and anti-inflammatory activity of C. vulgaris. The isolated microalga was mass cultured in laboratory by selective media with optimum conditions. Protein content was found to be higher for 45.23% followed by carbohydrate (23.43%) and total lipid (18.12%). Minerals components was recorded by the following order: Magnesium > Calcium > Iron > Manganese > Zinc > Copper. Seven vitamins were estimated, vitamin B₃ was recorded higher (13.3 mg/100 g) and B₁₂ has shown lesser amount (0.21 mg/100 g). The pigments chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids were found to be 4.7 mg/g, 4.2 mg/g and 6.11 mg/g respectively. Secondary metabolite was extracted by methanol and chloroform and further screened for the in vitro anti-inflammatory effect through the inhibition of albumin denaturation, antiproteinase, hypotonicity-induced haemolysis and anti-lipoxygenase assays and results have been recorded by concentration dependent. From the results, the anti-inflammatory activities of the methanolic extract were found higher than the chloroform extract at 500 µg/ml. The functional groups of the potent methanolic extract were studied by FT-IR analysis which revealed the presence of alkane, nitro and carboxyl groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalbumins 3aalkanes 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3acarotenoids 3achloroform 3achlorophyll 3acopper 3adenaturation 3ahemolysis 3airon 3alipids 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amethanol 3amicroalgae 3aminerals 3amoieties 3aniacin 3anutrient content 3apigments 3aprotein content 3asecondary metabolites 3aselective media 3azinc1 aMeivelu Moovendhan, 1 aArumugam, A.1 aMatharasi, A.1 aDineshkumar, R.1 aPitchai Sampathkumar, 0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2019 Nov., v. 10, no. 11 p.3263-3270dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-018-0370-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009500162520060100257592002800858650001600886650001900902650001100921650001800932650002000950653001500970653002700985653002101012700001901033700001801052773010301070856008501173852000901258655001201267IND60786112620221119235554.0220824e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078611262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1540572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Lu10aLewis base promoted photoredox catalyzed addition of allylic radicals to Michael acceptors  aUpon activation via photoredox reaction conditions, allylic boronic esters can generate allylic radicals that react readily with Michael acceptors.

Many condensates appear to form by the assembly of multivalent molecules, which produce phase-separated networks with liquidlike properties. These networks then recruit client molecules, with the total composition providing functionality. Here we use a model system of poly-SUMO and poly-SIM proteins to understand client–network interactions and find that the structure of the network plays a strong role in defining client recruitment and thus functionality. The basic unit of assembly in this system is a zipperlike filament composed of alternating poly-SUMO and poly-SIM molecules. These filaments have defects of unsatisfied bonds that allow for both the formation of a 3D network and the recruitment of clients. The filamentous structure constrains the scaffold stoichiometries and the distribution of client recruitment sites that the network can accommodate. This results in a nonmonotonic client binding response that can be tuned independently by the client valence and binding energy. These results show how the interactions within liquid states can be disordered yet still contain structural features that provide functionality to the condensate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensates 3aenergy 3aliquids 3aphysical chemistry1 aCotten, Michael A.1 aKim, Jonggul1 aRosen, Michael K.1 aSchmit, Jeremy D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0104-54680 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Jan. 04, v. 125, no. 1 p.467-476dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c110573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015800165300001800323520204700341592002802388596009202416650001802508650001202526650001402538650002302552650002802575650001202603650001202615650001802627650001702645650001502662650001802677650002402695650002402719650002102743650001302764650001102777650001002788650001802798650001502816650001402831650001402845650001102859700001802870700005502888773012702943856008103070852000903151655001203160IND60672439220221120143422.0191016e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067243922DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0373-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMithra, M. G.10aFed-Batch Saccharification as a Strategy towards Reducing Enzyme Dosage and Enhancing Fermentable Sugar Yield from Pretreated Lignocellulo-Starch Biomass  ap. 3279-3293.  aPURPOSE: Lignocellulo-starch biomass (LCSB) comprising root and vegetable processing residues contain starch also along with cellulose and hemicellulose and hence require whole slurry saccharification using an enzyme cocktail containing starch hydrolysing enzyme as well along with cellulase and xylanase. The cost-effective production of ethanol necessitates high fermentable sugar yield (> 80 g/l) in the hydrolysate which is possible through fed-batch saccharification as it overcomes issues such as low mass transfer and high viscosity of slurry encountered on high solids loading. To our knowledge no information is available on the fed-batch saccharification of LCSBs and hence the objective of the study was to investigate the possibility of enhancing the sugar yield at low enzyme dosage through fed-batch saccharification approach. METHODS: Fed-batch saccharification of pretreated LCSBs [steam (ST), dilute sulphuric acid (DSA) and microwave-assisted DSA (MW-DSA)] in enhancing the sugar yield was investigated using a triple enzyme cocktail at two cumulative loading densities (15 g/100 ml and 20 g/100 ml) and compared with the respective batch system. RESULTS: The hydrolysis yield from ST fed-batch system was very high (84–95%) for the residues followed by 83–90% yield from MW-DSA system at 15 g/100 ml cumulative substrate loading. Glucose and xylose were uniformly present in all the hydrolysates with higher levels of glucose in the steam pretreated fed-batch system SFB1 (15 g/100 ml). High phenolic retention in the hydrolysates did not affect saccharification as detoxification chemicals were supplemented. CONCLUSIONS: Fed-batch saccharification enhanced the sugar yield from pretretated LCSBs and based on the hydrolysis yield, 15 g/100 ml cumulative substrate loading was better than 20 g/100 ml loading and steam pretreatment (45 min) emerged as the best. Pulsed addition of substrate with only one-time enzyme feeding at the start resulted in enzyme saving during the fed-batch saccharification.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 853/2015/KSCSTEcKerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment 3abatch systems 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acost effectiveness 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aethanol 3aglucose 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3amass transfer 3amicrowave treatment 3aprocessing residues 3asaccharification 3aslurries 3astarch 3asteam 3asulfuric acid 3avegetables 3aviscosity 3axylanases 3axylose1 aSajeev, M.

Indeed, thermochemical conversion such as pyrolysis is a fast process without any solvent or enzyme for the depolymerisation of biomass. In this work, cellulose was pyrolyzed to produce sugars which have been then fermented by bacteria (Clostridium acetobutylicum) to produce acetone and butanol. This type of bacteria presents an interesting biological platform: it is resilient, easily up-scalable and Clostridium can be genetically engineered to target various other chemicals. Pyrolysis of cellulose was performed in a continuous fluidized bed reactor equipped with a staged condensation system, including a warm electrostatic precipitator. Different bio-oil fractions rich in levoglucosan (LVG) and with different concentrations in inhibitors for the fermentation stage were produced. LVG was found to be non-fermentable by C. acetobutylicum. Therefore, the bio-oil fractions were hydrolysed to obtain fermentable glucose. The mechanisms of acid hydrolysis (with diluted H₂SO₄) of LVG and cellobiosan have been revealed by high resolution mass spectrometry. The microorganisms were not able to grow with all hydrolysed bio-oil fractions depending on the concentration in inhibitors (aldehydes and organic acids). The fractions rich in LVG (and then glucose) lead to normal bacterial growth and normal fermentation products pattern without the need of detoxification. These results show the importance of a pyrolysis process with a staged condensation as a preliminary step for fermentation. It opens the road to production of various cellulose-derived chemicals by bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aacetone 3aacid hydrolysis 3abacteria 3abacterial growth 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abutanol 3acellulose 3adepolymerization 3aenzymes 3afermentation 3afluidized beds 3aglucose 3amass spectrometry 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis oils 3asolvents 0aHydrolysis 0aABE fermentation1 aGreenhalf, C.1 aBarbiero, C.1 aGuedon, E.1 aBriens, C.1 aBerruti, F.1 aDufour, A.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Dec., v. 143 p.105884-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1058843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245008600162300001600248500001900264520112500283592002801408650002201436650001301458650002301471650002501494650002101519700005301540700001701593773013301610856008001743852000901823655001201832IND60723542320221117025826.0210114e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072354232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c063152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yanbin10aStructural Phase Transformation in Amorphous Molybdenum Disulfide during Friction  ap. 836-844.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMolybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) coatings are known for their ultralow friction coefficient (0.005) due to the appearance of tribofilms with a lamellar structure. Nevertheless, the dynamics of MoS₂ sheet formation are rarely studied. In this paper, temperature-, load-, and slippage-induced transition of pure MoS₂ from an amorphous structure to a higher-order structure were studied by means of reactive molecular dynamics. The forming process of MoS₂ flake conforms to the characteristics of classical nucleation theory (CNT). The relevant atomic-scale processes, such as nucleation, growth, approaching, aligning, and shaping, are analyzed and explained. The results confirm that the sliding process involved in friction does promote the formation of MoS₂ tribofilms. In addition, the sliding behavior can facilitate the transformation of the crystal structure, which greatly reduces grain boundary defects in molybdenum disulfide flakes. Our findings may have important implications to gain insight into the crucial factors that contribute to rapid and effective structural transformation in friction processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3afriction 3amolecular dynamics 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aphase transition1 aPu, Jibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6513-66171 aWang, Liping0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 125, no. 1 p.836-844dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c063153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001800286520117900304592002801483650004401511650002101555650001901576650001301595650002501608650002101633650001001654650001701664650001501681650001901696650001201715650001901727650001101746650001801757650001501775650001001790650001501800650001601815650002001831650001301851700002401864773012701888856008102015852000902096655001202105IND60672439420221120143527.0191016e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067243942DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0348-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvtar Singh,10aEffect of Partial Enzymatic Hydrolysis on Physicochemical and Foaming Properties of Ovary from Squid Loligo formosana  ap. 3351-3361.  aSquid ovary (SO) was treated with 1% Alcalase or 1% papain at different hydrolysis times and foaming properties of resulting hydrolysates were investigated. SO hydrolysate (SOH) prepared by Alcalase for 30 min (SOH-Al-30) with degree of hydrolysis (DH) of 1.79% showed the highest foaming capacity (FC) (236%). For SOH prepared by papain for 15 min with DH of 0.21%, FC of 221% was attained. Foams from both SOH were collapsed by 27% when incubated at 25 °C for 60 min. The SOH-Al-30 powder showed high solubility and surface hydrophobicity. Particle size of SOH-Al-30 powder was slightly higher than that of squid ovary powder (SOP). FTIR spectra indicated that hydrolysis slightly affected the conformation and interaction of protein molecules. SOH-Al-30 pre-heated at 60 °C showed the highest FC (300%) and had the lowest liquid drainage when whipped for 4 min. Viscoelastic properties and microstructure of foam from pre-heated SOH-Al-30 were much improved than those from SOP. Thus, enzymatic hydrolysis having the controlled DH, followed by pre-heating at optimum temperature with the appropriate whipping time could improve foaming properties of squid ovary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLoligo formosana 3aanimal ovaries 3adrainage 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afoaming capacity 3afoams 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amicrostructure 3apapain 3aparticle size 3asolubility 3asquid 3asubtilisin 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity 3awhipping1 aBenjakul, Soottawat0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2019 Nov., v. 10, no. 11 p.3351-3361dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-018-0348-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011000164500001900274520139700293592002801690650001601718650001801734650002501752650001201777650001401789650001201803650002001815650002001835650002201855650002201877650001401899650002301913653001801936653002101954653001801975653002901993653001602022700001402038700001402052700002002066700001702086773011402103856008602217852000902303655001202312IND60707506820221117052153.0201230e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070750682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1236192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Long10aDouble-enzymes-mediated Fe2+/Fe3+ conversion as magnetic relaxation switch for pesticide residues sensing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is a great challenge to develop a newly rapid and accurate detection method for pesticide residues. In this work, based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (CHO), a double-enzymes-mediated Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ conversion as magnetic relaxation switch was explored for the measurement of acetamiprid residue. In the double-enzymes reactions, acetylcholine chloride (ACh) can be catalyzed to produce choline by AChE, which is successively hydrolyzed to betaine and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) by CHO. According to the enzyme inhibition principle, AChE activity will be inactivated in the presence of acetamiprid, thus leading to the less production of H₂O₂. Wherein, Fe²⁺, ACh, AChE and CHO were optimized as the reaction substrates. In the reaction system, acetamiprid can be reflected by the transverse relaxation time (T₂) that related with H₂O₂ mediated Fe²⁺ variations, which was further developed as an enzyme cascade amplification method. The detection linear range is 0.01∼1000 μg mL⁻¹ (R² = 0.99), and the limit of detection (LOD) is 2.66 ng mL⁻¹ (S/N = 3, n = 3), behaving a 335-fold improvement in LOD than that of traditional enzyme inhibition method (0.89 μg mL⁻¹). This method can realize “one-step mixing” detection of acetamiprid, which makes it a promising analytical tool for monitoring pesticide residue in complicated samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetamiprid 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abetaine 3achlorides 3acholine 3acholine oxidase 3adetection limit 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amagnetism 3apesticide residues 0aFe2+-T2sensor 0amagnetic sensing 0aAChE activity 0aneonicotinoid pesticides 0afood safety1 aZhou, Min1 aLiu, Chen1 aChen, Xiaoqiang1 aChen, Yiping0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 403 p.123619-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1236193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002600144245011800170300001400288500000900302520206500311592002802376650002102404650002702425650001702452650001702469650002002486650002802506650002502534650001302559650002502572650002602597650001902623650001102642650001102653650001702664650001602681650003602697650001702733650000902750650002102759650000902780650002502789650002802814651001902842700001502861700002402876700001402900700001802914773012102932852000903053856008003062655001203142IND4415840620221120141209.0191226e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441584062DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2008.0004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldwin, Christian M.10aNitrogen and Plant Growth Regulator Influence on ‘Champion’ Bermudagrass Putting Green under Reduced Sunlight  ap. 75-81.  aepub  aManaging warm-season turfgrasses with reduced sunlight is challenging due to C₄ plant morphological limitations, such as reduced lateral stem growth. Adjusting cultural management practices, such as N and trinexapac-ethyl (TE) [4-(cyclopropyl-a-hydroxy-methylene)-3,5-dioxocyclohexanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester], application may benefit turfgrass performance when sunlight is reduced. Therefore, a 2-yr field study from 15 June to 15 September in 2006 and 2007 at Clemson University investigated the best management practices for sustaining a high quality ‘Champion’ bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. X C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) putting green maintained at a 3.2-mm mowing height under reduced sunlight. Treatments included full-sunlight, 55% full-day shade, TE (0.02 kg a.i. ha⁻¹ 2 wk⁻¹), Fe (2.7 kg ha⁻¹ 2 wk⁻¹), and N as liquid urea at 147, 293, and 440 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ Data collection included visual turfgrass quality (TQ), total clipping yield, clipping chlorophyll concentration, root total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC), thatch accumulation, and thatch depth. Overall, Fe applications minimally impacted parameters measured. Increasing N rates linearly increased TQ when grown under full sunlight. Applying N at ∼40% lower (147 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) than the typical recommended rates for ultradwarf bermudagrass putting greens improved Champion TQ under reduced light compared to higher N rates. Applying TE resulted in a linear TQ increase for full sunlight and shade-grown Champion bermudagrass. Under reduced sunlight, a 15% chlorophyll concentration increase was noted for TE-treated plots compared to nonTE-treated plots. Shade reduced thatch accumulation 40% compared to sun-grown Champion, which suggests less aggressive cultivation practices are required for thatch control under reduced light. Champion bermudagrass did not provide an acceptable putting green quality when grown under 55% full-day shade, however, adjusting management practices enhanced Champion bermudagrass quality under reduced light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aCynodon transvaalensis 3aturf grasses 3agolf courses 3asolar radiation 3aplant growth substances 3aplant growth control 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afield experimentation 3alawns and turf 3aheight 3amowing 3aplant litter 3achlorophyll 3achemical constituents of plants 3aroot systems 3airon 3airon fertilizers 3aurea 3aappearance (quality) 3adry matter accumulation 3aSouth Carolina1 aLiu, Haibo1 aMcCarty, Lambert B.1 aLuo, Hong1 aToler, Joe E.0 tAgronomy journal.g2009 Jan., v. 101, no. 1 p.75-81dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2008.0004x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02994naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245016300209300001400372500001900386520154200405592002801947650001501975650002201990650001102012650001502023650001302038650001602051650001502067650002202082650001902104650001702123700002502140700002002165700006302185700001702248700002702265700006002292773013102352856008002483852000902563655001202572IND60723542620221117025848.0210114e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072354262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c070372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaheri, Mohammad M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9121-007810aDistinguishing Electron and Hole Dynamics in Functionalized CdSe/CdS Core/Shell Quantum Dots Using Complementary Ultrafast Spectroscopies and Kinetic Modeling  ap. 31-41.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe evolution of excitation energy and photogenerated charges in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) functionalized with molecular acceptors can be probed on ultrafast time scales using techniques such as transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. However, historical interpretations that the 1S(e)-1S₃/₂(h) transition in Cd-chalcogenide QDs is fully attributable to electrons may be misleading, and multiexponential models used to fit TA kinetics do not correspond directly to specific photophysical processes. Here, we present visible-wavelength and mid-IR TA and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements to inform a comprehensive kinetic model of the photoexcited CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs functionalized with passivating oleic acid (OA), hole-accepting ferrocene, or electron-accepting naphthalene bisimide (NBI). We show that ∼30% of the 1S signal and 72% of the IR signal can originate from holes in well-passivated core/shell QDs. We also demonstrate evidence of electron trapping in OA-capped core/shell QDs, with additional electron transfer and hole trapping in the QDs functionalized with NBI. Electron (hole) trapping and detrapping occur in 450 ± 100 ps (430 ± 70 ps) and 340 ± 100 ps (1.1 ± 0.4 ns) respectively, while the time constant for electron transfer to NBI is ∼1.8 ns. The comprehensive picture of photophysical processes provided by the complementary ultrafast techniques and kinetic modeling can accelerate both the fundamental science and application development of nanostructured and molecular systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aferrocenes 3akinetics 3anaphthalene 3aoleic acid 3aphotoluminescence 3asemiconductors 3aspectroscopy1 aElbert, Katherine C.1 aYang, Shengsong1 aDiroll, Benjamin T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3488-02131 aPark, Jungmi1 aMurray, Christopher B.1 aBaxter, Jason B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8702-39150 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 125, no. 1 p.31-41dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c070373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245011500169300001600284520122200300592002801522650001401550650001601564650001301580650001001593650002601603650002101629650002601650650001201676650001501688650001301703650001001716650002101726650002601747650002201773650002001795650001601815650001501831651001101846653003001857653003001887653002101917653001801938653001601956653003001972653003002002653003102032653002102063653002102084653001902105653002902124700002402153700002102177773008702198856007802285852000902363655001202372IND60481219720221119170256.0160203e20140617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048121972DNAL7 a10.2478/hacq-2014-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirini, Chrisoula B.10aSteppe-Like Grass Land Vegetation in the Hills around the Lakes of Vegoritida and Petron, North-Central Greece  ap. 121-169.  aThe present paper describes the floristic composition and synecology of steppe-like dry grasslands occurring in a Natura 2000 site in North-Central Greece around the two karstic lakes of Vegoritida and Petron. In total, 245 releves of vascular plant species composition and abundance were sampled and subjected to cluster analysis and ordination analysis. Passive explanatory variables, including environmental parameters as well as indicator values, were used to support the ecological interpretation. Four plant communities were distinguished in the area, namely Artemisia campestris-Dasypyrum villosum, Chrysopogon gryllus-Bothriochloa ischaemum, Satureja montana-Artemisia alba and Stipa capillata-Koeleria macrantha. All communities were classified within the Festuco-Brometea class and the Astragalo-Potentilletalia order. Soil properties (soil reaction, moisture and nutrient content) and meso-climate factors (temperature variation along topographic gradients) were identified as the main factors determining the floristic differentiation among the four communities. The dry grasslands harbor a number of species associated with steppic habitats. We discuss the relict character of the steppe-like vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aChrysopogon 3aSatureja 3aStipa 3abotanical composition 3acluster analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3alakes 3anutrient content 3aordination techniques 3aplant communities 3asoil properties 3atemperature 3atopography 3aGreece 0aAstragalo-Potentilletalia 0adry calcareous grasslands 0aFestuco-Brometea 0asteppe plants 0asyntaxonomy 0avegetation classification 0aAstragalo-Potentilletalia 0asuha travišča na apnencu 0aFestuco-Brometea 0astepske rastline 0asintaksonomija 0aklasifikacija vegetacije1 aTsiripidis, Ioannis1 aBergmeier, Erwin0 tHacquetia.g2014 June 17, v. 13, no. 1 p.121-169dDe Gruyter Openx1854-98297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/hacq-2014-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245011000179500002200289520209600311592002802407650001702435650001502452650002502467650001502492650002302507650002602530650001202556650001502568650001502583650001302598650003002611650002102641650002002662650001802682650001402700650001202714651001102726653001702737653003202754653002102786653001802807700003902825700007002864700007102934700007303005700005803078700004003136700007103176773009503247856008403342852000903426655001203435IND60661556020221121173903.0190830e20190816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066155602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2019.1043832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, Leandro Carneiro10aSoil physical quality associated with tillage practices during sugarcane planting in south-central Brazil  aPre-press version  aSoil tillage operations had been carried out during the sugarcane planting to improve soil's physical quality, thus providing proper conditions for sugarcane growth. Long-term field experiments were designed to assess the implications of tillage operations during sugarcane planting on soil physical quality and the associated effects on sugarcane yields under two soil types in south-central Brazil. In 2013, two treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with four repetitions: (i) conventional tillage (CT) and ii) no-tillage (NT). Undisturbed soil samples were collected representing the row and inter-row positions to a 0.4-m depth (0-0.10, 0.10-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m) over four crop cycles (from 2014 to 2017). In the laboratory, bulk density (BD), soil resistance to penetration (SRP), macroporosity (MaP) and microporosity (MiP) were evaluated. Additionally, sugarcane yields were measured annually using an instrumented truck equipped with load cells. CT management alleviated soil compaction only in the plant cane cycle, indicating that the intensive machinery traffic performed in sugarcane harvesting nullify the effects of tillage practices. The opening of planting furrow in both tillage systems reduced soil physical limitations, thus favoring the crop development in the row position. The changes in soil physical attributes were observed mostly in the inter-row position. In clayey soil, BD increased by 24 and 16%, and the SRP by 63 and 55% in the 0-0.10 m layer from plant cane to 3rd ratoon for CT and NT, respectively. Similarly, in sandy loam soil, the SRP increased over time in the 0-0.10 m layer for CT and NT, reaching values higher than 2 MPa. MaP decreased for values lower than 0.10 m3 m-3 after four years for both soils and tillage systems. Regardless of soil type, tillage management did not show differences in sugarcane yields over the assessed period. Our findings suggest that NT could be a feasible strategy to reduce soil mobilization and its negative implications on several ecosystem services without compromise sugarcane yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aclay soils 3aconventional tillage 3acrop yield 3aecosystem services 3afield experimentation 3afurrows 3aharvesting 3ano-tillage 3aplanting 3aresistance to penetration 3asandy loam soils 3asoil compaction 3asoil sampling 3asugarcane 3atraffic 3aBrazil 0aSoil quality 0aConservationist agriculture 0asugarcane yields 0aSaccharum spp1 aMagalhães, Paulo Sérgio Graziano1 aBordonal, Ricardo Oliveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5957-29091 aCherubin, Maurício Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7920-83621 aCastioni, Guilherme Adalberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6216-12191 aTenelli, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1241-62361 aFranco, Henrique Coutinho Junqueira1 aCarvalho, João Luís Nunes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5089-94110 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Aug. 16, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.1043833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012500164520097100289592002801260650001201288650001601300650001301316650001301329650001401342650001601356650002101372650001701393653001501410653002001425653002601445653002001471653003001491700001501521700001601536700001801552700001801570773010101588856008201689852000901771655001201780IND60786113220221119235223.0220816e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078611322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2022.1793012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shipeng10aInfluence of flue gas torrefaction on the fuel properties and pyrolysis characteristics of real components of corn stalk  aThe aim of this study was to identify the changes in fuel properties and pyrolysis characteristics of the torrefied real components of corn stalk. The isolated components were torrefied with simulated flue gas and nitrogen in a thermogravimetric analyzer at 230, 260 and 290 °C for 30 min. The ultimate analysis indicated that flue gas atmosphere was beneficial to improving the fuel properties of isolated components. Compared to non-oxidative atmosphere, the flue gas had a greater impact on the initial pyrolysis temperature and char yield of the isolated components. The results of mathematical deconvolution analysis (MDA) demonstrated that the pyrolysis weight losses of native mixture could be quantitatively represented by the linear summation of isolated components. The differential thermogravimetric (DTG) characteristic curves could be used to qualitative analyze the changes in relative contents of the structural components of the torrefied biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acorn stover 3aflue gas 3anitrogen 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atorrefaction 0aCorn stalk 0aReal components 0aFlue gas torrefaction 0aFuel properties 0aPyrolysis characteristics1 aWang, Qing1 aWu, Chunlei1 aLiu, Hongpeng1 aSun, Baizhong0 tThermochimica acta.g2022 Sept., v. 715 p.179301-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2022.1793013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010400161300001600265520213000281592002802411650001302439650002102452650002202473650001302495650001502508650001702523650003302540650001602573650001102589650001302600651001002613653001502623653002302638653001602661653000802677700001802685700002002703700001702723700001702740773014302757856007802900852000902978655001202987IND60738411320221123040325.0210524e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073841132DNAL7 a10.37992/2021.1201.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, K. V.10aTailoring genetic diversity of greengram genotypes through principal component and cluster analysis  ap. 163-169.  aOne hundred genotypes of green gram were evaluated at the Pulse Research Station, AAU, Vadodara, Gujarat during summer 2019 for genetic diversity study based on six biometrical traits and to identify the best performing genotype suited to Gujarat. To determine the extent of variability existing among 100 green gram genotypes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), cluster analysis and the inter-relationship existing between biometrical traits through Pearson’s correlation analysis were carried out. The highest correlation was observed among the seeds per pod and pod length, pods per plant and the number of branches per plant. 100 seed weight had a negative and significant correlation with plant height, the number of branches per plant and pods per plant. According to the principal component analysis, two principal components (PCs) had eigenvalues more than unity and accounted to explain 67.37 per cent of the total variance that exists among six traits. PC1 and PC2 accounted for 39.88 and 27.49 per cent proportion of total variance, respectively. All traits were highly loading on PC1 except pod length and 100 seed weight which were loading on PC2. Three different groups of biometrical traits were observed in the component pattern. A hundred genotypes were classified into eleven clusters through the hierarchical cluster analysis method. Cluster I comprised a maximum number of genotypes followed by cluster VI, cluster II and cluster VII. Based on the cluster analysis, it could be recommended that crosses could be made between the genotypes of Cluster VIII and IX, Cluster VIII and X and Cluster X and XI which are distantly related. Lower plant height was observed in the genotypes under Cluster VIII and clusters X consisted of tall genotypes with a higher number of branches per plant. The highest pod length, pods per plant and seeds per pod were recorded under cluster IX. Cluster IV had a significantly higher 100 seed weight. Intraclass correlation (R²) was the highest for pod length followed by plant height and seeds per pod indicating that these traits played an important role in divergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiometry 3acluster analysis 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amung beans 3aplant height 3aprincipal component analysis 3aseed weight 3asummer 3avariance 3aIndia 0aGreen gram 0aBiometrical traits 0aCorrelation 0aPCA1 aParmar, D.

The biomechanical models of the MBSC and NBSC were established. The biomechanical models were verified through the perception experiments of the MBSC and the NBSC. The results showed that the SMPF could sense the deformation of the cupula. The MBSC and NBSC could sense the angular velocity and accelerations. What's more, it was speculated that in a human body, the endolymph probably had a function of liquid mass while the membranous semicircular canal and the cupula had a function similar to a spring in the human semicircular canal.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomechanics 3adeformation 3ahumans 3aliquids 3aspring 0aBiomechanical model 0aBionic semicircular canal 0aMembrane semicircular canal 0aSymmetric electrodes Metal core PVDF Fiber (SMPF)1 aLu, Shien1 aWang, Zhi1 aQin, Yongbin1 aLi, Jialing1 aGuo, Guangming1 aGong, Junjie1 aJiang, Yani0 tHeliyon.g2022 May, v. 8, no. 5 p.e09480-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e094803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012600165300001600291520181800307592002802125650002802153650004002181650001002221650001602231650001402247650001102261650002602272650001202298653001402310653001202324653001402336700001802350700002102368700002002389700002202409700002202431700002302453773011102476856008302587852000902670655001202679IND60778878020221121044102.0220613e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077887802DNAL7 a10.2478/contagri-2022-00152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagi, Ferenc10aIncidence of Grapevine Fanleaf Virus (GFLV) and Grapevine Leafroll-Associated Viruses (GLRaV 1−3) in Vojvodina Province  ap. 102-109.  aDuring May and June of 2021, a total of 123 grapevine leaf samples were collected and analyzed for infection by grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) and three viruses from the grapevine leafroll-associated virus complex -1, -2 and -3 (GRLaV-1, GRLaV-2 and GRLaV-3, respectively). The samples were collected from commercial vineyards, small backyard vineyards and grapevine nurseries located across the entire Vojvodina Province (Bačka, Banat and Srem). OEPP/EPPO sampling protocols were followed during the sampling of leaf tissues showing possible virus infection symptoms. Among the 123 samples, 47 were collected from Bačka region (Bačko Gradište − 11, Bečej − 10, Temerin − 15, Vrbas − 1, Hajdukovo − 10), 50 from Banat region (Srpska Crnja − 10, Vojvode Stepe − 10, Čoka − 10, Uljma −20) and 26 from Srem region (Šid − 6, Banoštor − 10, Sremski Karlovci − 10) and serological ELISA tests were performed for virus detection. GFLV was detected in five samples (4.06%), GLRaV-1 was detected in six samples (4.87%), while GLRaV-2 was not detected in any of the analyzed grapevine samples. GLRaV-3 was present in five samples (4.06%). When infection rates were examined in relation to cultivars, GFLV was detected in Cardinal, Zalagyöngye, Black Muscat, Italian Riesling and Dornfelder. GRLaV-1 was detected in cultivars Cardinal, Black Muscat, Italian Riesling and Merlot, and GRLaV-3 in cultivars Othello and Italian Riesling. Based on these results, it can be concluded that GFLV and GRLaV-1 and GRLaV-3 are present in vineyards across Vojvodina Province and affect different grapevine cultivars. To effectively control virus infections and their spreading, continuous monitoring of these viruses and their vectors is required along with the planting of healthy propagation material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrapevine fanleaf virus 3aGrapevine leafroll-associated virus 3aVitis 3aagriculture 3acultivars 3aleaves 3apropagation materials 3aviruses 0agrapevine 0aviruses 0adetection1 aBarać, Goran1 aIličić, Renata1 aSavić, Zagorka1 aStarovlah, Milica1 aKonstantin, Đina1 aPopović, Tatjana,0 tContemporary Agriculture.g2022 June 01, v. 71, no. 1-2 p.102-109dSciendowJournal:26806x2466-47747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/contagri-2022-00153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245008600171300001600257520184400273592002802117650001602145650001602161650002302177650001802200650001202218650001002230650001902240650001602259650001702275650000802292650002602300650001502326650001002341650001502351650001902366650000902385650001402394650001102408650001202419651001502431653001902446653001502465653001702480653001902497653001502516700001702531700003002548700001602578773009902594856009002693852000902783655001202792IND60525151620221120233741.0190318e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052515162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Hazrat13aAn assessment of chemical and biological product use in aquaculture in Bangladesh  ap. 199-209.  aThe aim of this study is to describe current chemical use practices in the aquaculture sector of Bangladesh and to identify the factors that influence them. A survey on the use of chemical and biological products was conducted between November 2011 and June 2012 using structured questionnaires administered to operators of nine farm groups, including homestead ponds, carps, tilapias, koi fish, shrimps, shrimps and prawns, prawns, rice and fish, and pangas. Farm type and farm owner characteristics were used as independent variables to explain observed chemical use. Forty-six chemical and biological products (7 water and sediment treatment compounds, 13 disinfectants, 7 antibiotics, 7 pesticides, 8 fertilizers and 4 feed additives and probiotics) were reported to be applied in aquaculture. The use of disinfectants and antibiotics was found to be highest in intensive koi and pangas farms as compared to other farm groups, whereas the use of fertilizers was lowest in these farm groups. A higher percentage of prawn and shrimp/prawn farmers applied pesticides than other farm groups. A multivariate analysis showed that patterns of use of chemical and biological products were significantly different across aquaculture farm groups, with the largest number of chemical compounds used by the intensive koi farm group. The study shows that, despite rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture in Bangladesh, use of chemical and biological products is still relatively low compared to other aquaculture producing countries in Asia. However, despite this finding, the study identified a large number of compounds that are currently in use, and that require further regulation and evaluation regarding their potential environmental and human health impacts, as already done in most developed countries.Chemical use practices in Bangladesh  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3achemical compounds 3adisinfectants 3afarmers 3afarms 3afeed additives 3afertilizers 3ahuman health 3akoi 3amultivariate analysis 3apesticides 3aponds 3aprobiotics 3aquestionnaires 3arice 3asediments 3ashrimp 3asurveys 3aBangladesh 0aAntimicrobials 0aProbiotics 0aFish farming 0aShrimp farming 0aBangladesh1 aRico, Andreu1 aMurshed-e-Jahan, Khondker1 aBelton, Ben0 tAquaculture.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 454 p.199-209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03828naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013200174300001600306520232800322592002802650650001902678650002502697650001402722650002302736650001102759650001302770650001502783650002002798650000702818650001202825650001502837650002002852650001902872650002102891650000902912650000902921650001902930650001902949653003302968653002403001653001803025653001703043653003303060773014503093856008703238852000903325655001203334IND60780062320221118013522.0220615e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078006232DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-0163.2022.00021.02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Meenakshi10aAnalysis of available-phosphate and alkaline phosphatase (Apase) activity during a rice cultivation cycle in rice agroecosystem  ap. 103-109.  aRice-fields constitute a very interesting habitat for the study of phosphatase activity as they are dominated by cyanobacteria and contribute significantly to maintain soil fertility. The enzyme phosphatase can be classified according to the substrate on which it acts such as phosphomonoesterase (PMEase), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of monoester bonds and phosphodiesterase (PDEase) which acts on diester bonds and so on. Phosphatases are classified as acid (pH 4.0–5.0) or alkaline (pH 9.0–10.5) phosphatases-ACP (acidic phosphatase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase), respectively depending on the pH at which the maximum activity occurs. Since alkaline phosphatases participate in the production of orthophosphate ions and their transportation into the cytoplasm, a negative correlation has been found between intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity and orthophosphate concentration in the growing microorganisms. The purpose of this study is to perform an empirical analysis and reveal the pivotal role of available-phosphate and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity on the growth of rice crops during the course of cultivation. In this study, the scientific data has been collected and refined through the field as well as laboratory work. Moreover, in order to analyze the total availability and absorbability of phosphorus in the soil, the very popular Olsen method has been used. The result is revealing a comparative account of available-P of soils & water collected from surface and sub-surface regions during a rice cultivation cycle as well as average PMEase activity of filtered and unfiltered water in relation to total-P of unfiltered water during a rice cultivation cycle. The maximum content of available-P in both soil and water was recorded in the deep water region in the month of November and then further decreased at the end of crop cycle. Maximum total P in water was detected in July-August and minimum in November. Photosynthetic N₂-fixation has an absolute requirement of ATP and its requirement is specifically met through the process of photosynthetic phosphorylation. This important function cannot be realized in the phosphate deficient condition. The concentration of available P in water seems to be non-inhibitory concentration for extracellular/cellular enzymatic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acytoplasm 3aempirical research 3aesters 3ahabitats 3ahydrolysis 3aorthophosphates 3apH 3apaddies 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorylation 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant protection 3arice 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3atransportation 0aAlkaline Phosphatase (APase) 0aAvailable Phosphate 0aCyanobacteria 0aPaddy-Fields 0aPhosphomonoesterase (PMEase)0 tAnnals of plant protection sciences.g2022 Mar., v. 30, no. 1 p.103-109dSociety Of Plant Protection ScienceswJournal:2082x0974-01637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-0163.2022.00021.03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245023100153300001600384500001400400500002000414520169300434592002802127596006402155596005902219596008402278650001402362650001102376650001602387650001002403650001602413650001202429650002402441650002002465650001702485650001602502650001802518700001802536700001802554700001502572700005602587700002002643700001702663700001602680700001402696700001602710700005702726773013202783856007302915852000902988655001202997IND60730961220221122065511.0210313e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073096122DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.138902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Tong14aThe combination treatment of cholesterol‐loaded methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin and methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin significantly improves the fertilization capacity of vitrified bovine oocytes by protecting fertilization protein JUNO  ap. 519-530.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany experiments show that vitrification significantly reduces the fertilization capacity of mammalian oocytes, restricting the application of vitrified oocytes. It has been proven that the JUNO protein plays a vital role in mammalian oocytes fertilization. However, little information is available about the effects of vitrification on the JUNO protein and the procedure to protect it in bovine oocytes. Here, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of vitrification on the JUNO protein level in bovine oocytes. In this study, MII oocytes were treated with cholesterol‐loaded methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin (CLC; 0, 10, 15, 20 mM) for 45 min before vitrification and methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin (MβCD; 0, 2.25, 4.25, 6.25 mM) for 45 min after thawing (38–39°C). Then, the expression level and function of JUNO protein, cholesterol level in the membrane, the externalization of phosphatidylserine, sperm binding capacity and the developmental ability of vitrified bovine oocytes were examined. Our results showed that vitrification significantly decreased the JUNO protein level, cholesterol level, sperm binding capacity, development ability, and increased the promoter methylation level of the JUNO gene and apoptosis level of bovine oocytes. Furthermore, 15 mM CLC + 4.25 mM MβCD treatment significantly improved the cholesterol level and increased sperm binding and development ability of vitrified bovine oocytes. In conclusion, the combination treatment of cholesterol‐loaded methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin and methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin significantly improves the fertilization capacity of vitrified bovine oocytes by protecting fertilization protein JUNO.  aPublisher supplied data  a6202027cNatural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality  a31972568cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aASTIP‐2016‐IAS‐06cAgricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program 3aapoptosis 3acattle 3acholesterol 3agenes 3amethylation 3aoocytes 3aphosphatidylserines 3aprotein content 3areproduction 3aspermatozoa 3avitrification1 aZhang, Peipei1 aHao, Haisheng1 aDu, Weihua1 aPang, Yunwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7312-179X1 aZhao, Shanjiang1 aZou, Huiying1 aZhu, Huabin1 aYu, Weili1 aLi, Shujing1 aZhao, Xueming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6110-26900 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.519-530dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.138903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015200159520150900311592002801820650001201848650002001860650002001880650002401900650002901924650002501953650001401978650001301992650001302005650001502018650001802033700002002051700002002071700002802091700002102119700002002140700001802160773012302178856007502301852000902376655001202385IND60781048720221117234434.0220623e20220610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078104872DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141224252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOddoux, Sarah 10aEffect of a Dietary Supplement Combining Bioactive Peptides and Magnesium on Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety: A Clinical Trial in General Practice  aAnxiety is a high frequency disorder in the general population. It is usually treated with benzodiazepines, which cause side effects and a dependence that could make withdrawal difficult. Alternative treatments are therefore needed to reduce the use of anxiolytics, particularly for adjustment disorder with anxiety. An observational, multicentre, prospective, longitudinal study has been conducted by general practitioners and one gynaecologist to evaluate the efficacy of a dietary supplement on adjustment disorder with anxiety (Stress 2 study). Patients diagnosed as anxious with a score of ≥20 on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (Ham-A, first visit on Day 0 (V0)) were offered a 28-day treatment with a dietary supplement formulated with bioactive peptides from a fish protein hydrolysate (Gabolysat®), magnesium and vitamin B6. At the second visit (V1), the Ham-A Rating Scale, the Patient Global Impression scale (PGI) and the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) were administered. A 50% reduction in the Ham-A score, was achieved for 41.9% of the patients. The mean Ham-A score decreased by 12.1 ± 5.7 points (p < 0.001) between V0 (25.6 ± 3.8) and V1 (13.6 ± 6.0). Furthermore, according to the CGI scale, the anxiety of 75.3% of patients improved significantly and very significantly, with limited side effects and a negligible rebound effect. In conclusion, adjustment disorder with anxiety seems to be effectively managed by an alternative and safer solution than benzodiazepines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3abenzodiazepines 3aclinical trials 3adietary supplements 3afish protein hydrolysate 3alongitudinal studies 3amagnesium 3apatients 3apeptides 3apyridoxine 3atranquilizers1 aViolette, Paul 1 aCornet, Jeanne 1 aAkkoyun-Farinez, Julie 1 aBesnier, Michel 1 aNoël, Antoine 1 aRouillon, F.,0 tNutrients.g2022 June 10, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141224253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009800168300001600266500001900282520123000301592002801531650001201559650000901571650001501580650001601595650000701611650002401618653001201642653001401654653001901668653000801687653001901695700001601714700001501730700001701745700001601762700001901778700001701797700001501814700005601829773009001885856008501975852000902060655001202069IND60713466420221120181108.0201125e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071346642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2020.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Dongling10aCharacterization of a DNA-hydrolyzing DNAzyme for generation of PCR strands of unequal length  ap. 181-189.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aI-R3 DNAzyme is a small, highly active catalytic DNA for DNA hydrolysis. In here, we designed two cis-structure DNAzymes (I-R3N and I-R3S) based on the different locates of the joint linker between I-R3 and its substrate. Data demonstrated that both DNAzymes were highly dependent on Zn²⁺, and worked at a narrow range around pH 7.0. They exhibited strong anti-interference with Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺, but inhibited by Na⁺ and K⁺. Moreover, single and multiple-site mutations were generated within the catalytic core to carry out a comprehensive mutational study of I-R3 motif, in which most nucleotides were highly conserved and the nucleotides A5, T11 and T8 were identified as the mutational hotspots. Furthermore, an efficient variant A5G was obtained and its reaction condition was optimized. Finally, we constructed A5G to the 3’ end of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and applied it for asymmetrical PCR amplification to produce a single and double-stranded DNA mixture, in which A5G within ssDNA can self-cleave to generate a shorter desired ssDNA by denaturing gel separation. This would provide a new non-chemical modification approach for preparation of the expected ssDNA for in vitro selection of DNAzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3agels 3ahydrolysis 3anucleotides 3apH 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aDNAzyme 0aZinc ions 0aDNA hydrolysis 0aPCR 0aUnequal length1 aYu, Wenqian1 aXu, Jiacui1 aWang, Fulong1 aJiang, Ying1 aSheng, Yongjie1 aSun, Yanhong1 aZhang, Jin1 aJiang, Dazhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6035-08840 tBiochimie.g2020 Dec., v. 179 p.181-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013100173300001400304500001500318520189300333592002802226650001802254650003102272650001902303650002402322650002102346650002402367650002302391650002902414650002902443650001302472650001502485650001702500650001302517650002502530653000702555653000902562653000802571653001102579653002502590653001602615653000802631653000802639653000902647653000902656653000802665653000902673653000902682653001302691653001102704653002702715653002702742700001702769700002402786773008502810856008502895852000902980655001202989IND60542491620221121214533.0190403e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054249162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2015.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Yangquanwei10aSoil carbon and nitrogen fractions in the soil profile and their response to long-term nitrogen fertilization in a wheat field  ap. 38-46.  a2019-12-06  aEcosystems receive elevated inputs of nitrogen (N) from anthropogenic sources, and understanding the effects of such N addition on the soil carbon (C) and N cycles are important. Soils contain many different C and N fractions that have diverse physical and chemical compositions, and these fractions can be used as early and sensitive indicators of C and N cycling. In this study, we investigated the composition of different C and N fractions and their sensitivities in the upper 200cm of soils planted with winter wheat in areas that had received different N fertilization rates since 2004. Our results indicate that N enrichment may affect C and N cycling by changing certain fractions of soil organic matter. Light fraction of carbon (LFOC), light fraction of nitrogen (LFON), heavy fraction of carbon (HFOC), and heavy fraction of nitrogen (HFON) were constant among the different N rates. In contrast, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased in the 180, 270 and 360kgha−1 treatments in the 20–200cm soil layer, and easily oxidizable organic C (EOC) was the highest in the 90kgha−1 treatment and decreased in the high-N treatments in the 0–20cm soil layer. Both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and inorganic N (NO3− and NH4+) increased as N input increase. Nitrate (NO3−) is the fraction most sensitive to N fertilization. The LFOC, LFON and EOC are more sensitive than other fractions in the surface soil layer, but dissolved organic C and N may be better indicators in the subsurface layers. Our results demonstrate how the C and N fractions respond to different N fertilization rates in the top 200cm of the soil profile and further our understanding of the physical protection mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN), which will aid in the adoption of appropriate management practices for C and N accumulation and stabilization in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil profiles 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3asoil separates 3asoil organic carbon 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizer analysis 3aammonium compounds 3adissolved organic carbon 3aanthropogenic activities 3aplanting 3aecosystems 3awinter wheat 3anitrates 3anitrogen fertilizers 0aSI 0aHFOC 0aDOC 0acarbon 0aSoil carbon fraction 0aSensitivity 0aDOM 0aDON 0aNH4+ 0aLFOC 0aEOC 0aHFON 0aLFON 0anitrogen 0aNO3− 0aSoil nitrogen fraction 0aNitrogen fertilization1 aYan, Weiming1 aShangguan, Zhouping0 tCatena.g2015 Dec., v. 135 p.38-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008100164300001600245520135200261592002801613650002101641650001101662650001101673650000901684650000901693650001201702650001501714650001101729650001601740650001301756650002201769650001001791650000901801650001701810650002001827650002301847653002101870653001501891653002201906653002101928653001001949653001001959700002001969700002001989773013602009856007802145852000902223655001202232IND60594370020221122230721.0190514e20161110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059437002DNAL7 a10.1139/cjss-2016-00572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEerpina, Ramesh10aCollembola diet switching in the presence of maize roots varies with species  ap. 171-177.  aCollembola are known to feed on a wide range of soil material, predominantly rhizosphere fungi, and root-derived substances.

This hemiedaphic species was given different combinations of maize plants (−13.28‰ δ¹³C, 3‰ δ¹⁵N) and ¹⁵N-enriched rye grass litter (−28.88‰ δ¹³C, 17 516.86‰ δ¹⁵N) in a C₃ soil system (−27.27‰ δ¹³C, 5.27‰ δ¹⁵N) under controlled conditions. After 8 wk, there was clear evidence of root feeding because the δ¹³C signature in collembola tissue was −19.28‰ in the presence of maize plants alone and −18.29‰ with maize plants grown in soil mixed with ryegrass litter, whereas collembola in unplanted soil microcosms had a δ¹³C signature of −23.66‰. Data analysis with a two-source isotope mixing model indicates that up to 60% of the carbon requirements of F. candida were derived from living maize roots. Whether collembola root feeding is due to grazing on roots directly or on mycorrhiza (root-fungus association) requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFolsomia candida 3aLolium 3acarbon 3acorn 3adiet 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3amixing 3amycorrhizae 3anitrogen 3arhizosphere fungi 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil ecology 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 0afeeding behavior 0acollembola 0aisotope signature 0aFolsomia candida 0aδ13C 0aδ15N1 aBoiteau, Gilles1 aLynch, Derek H.0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 97, no. 2 p.171-177dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1934x1918-18417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2016-00573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171300001600273500001900289520145700308592002801765650002101793650001201814650001901826650001001845650001101855650001301866650001901879650001901898650002101917650001301938650003701951653002401988653001102012653000802023653001002031653003502041653002202076700001902098700002202117700002102139700002102160700002002181700006002201773009002261856008502351852000902436655001202445IND60713466520221120190608.0201125e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071346652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2020.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuyama, Tetsuya10aEPHA2 antisense RNA modulates EPHA2 mRNA levels in basal-like/triple-negative breast cancer cells  ap. 169-180.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEphrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), whose over-expression has been observed in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer. EPHA2 expression may be causally related to tumorigenesis; therefore, it is important to understand how EPHA2 gene (EPHA2) expression is regulated. Here, we report that EPHA2 antisense RNA (EPHA2-AS), a natural antisense transcript, is an important modulator of EPHA2 mRNA levels. EPHA2-AS is a ∼1.8 kb long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with a poly(A) tail that encodes two splice variants, EPHA2-AS1/2. They are constitutively expressed in a concordant manner with EPHA2 mRNA in human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines and in patient samples, with the highest levels detected in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. The silencing of EPHA2-AS1/2 by a sense oligonucleotide or over-expression of an antisense oligoribonucleotide, which were both designed from the EPHA2 mRNA region (nt 2955–2974) targeted by AS1/2, showed that EPHA2-AS1/2 modulated EPHA2 mRNA levels by interacting with the specific AS1/2-complementary region in the mRNA. The EPHA2-AS1/2 did not prevent microRNAs from acting on the relevant microRNA response elements shared by EPHA2-AS1/2 and EPHA2 mRNA. Our studies demonstrate a crucial role played by EPHA2-AS1/2 in modulating EPHA2 mRNA levels, and hence production of EPHA2 protein, a key oncogenic RTK that contributes to the tumorigenesis of TNBC cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acarcinogenesis 3agenes 3ahumans 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3anon-coding RNA 3aoligonucleotides 3apatients 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 0aEPHA2 antisense RNA 0alncRNA 0aNAT 0aEPHA2 0aTriple-negative breast cancers 0aMDA-MB-231 cells1 aSakamoto, Ryou1 aKumagai, Kazuhiro1 aNishizawa, Mikio1 aKimura, Tomonori1 aSugie, Tomoharu1 aKimura, Tominori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8696-89650 tBiochimie.g2020 Dec., v. 179 p.169-180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015100166300001800317520168600335592002802021650001502049650002102064650001302085650002102098650001302119650000902132650002202141650001902163650002002182650001002202650002502212650004102237650001302278650000902291650001302300650001202313650002002325650001202345653000802357653001302365653002002378653001702398653002002415700001902435700001702454700002102471700002202492700001802514700001602532773010802548856008202656852000902738655001202747IND60691572320221122220650.0210311e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069157232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReicher, Naama10aFrom broiler breeder hen feed to the egg and embryo: The molecular effects of guanidinoacetate supplementation on creatine transport and synthesis  ap. 3574-3582.  aSupplementation of broiler breeder hens with beneficial additives bears great potential for affecting nutrient deposition into the fertile egg. Guanidinoacetate (GAA) is the endogenous precursor of creatine that is used as a feed additive for improving cellular energy metabolism in animal nutrition. In the present study, we have investigated whether GAA supplementation in broiler breeder feed affects creatine deposition into the hatching egg and molecular mechanisms of creatine transport and synthesis within hens and their progeny. For this, broiler breeder hens of 47 wk of age were supplemented with 0.15% GAA for 15 wk, and samples from their tissues, hatching eggs and progeny were compared with those of control, nonsupplemented hens. A significant increase in creatine content was found within the yolk and albumen of hatching eggs obtained from the GAA group, compared with the control group. The GAA group exhibited a significant increased creatine transporter gene expression compared with the control group in their small intestines and oviduct. In GAA group progeny, a significant decrease in creatine transporter expression at embryonic day 19 and day of hatch was found, compared with control group progeny. At the day of hatch, creatine synthesis genes (arginine glycine amidinotransferase and guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase) exhibited significant decrease in expression in the GAA group progeny compared with control group progeny. These results indicate that GAA supplementation in broiler breeder feed increases its absorbance and deposition into hatching eggs, subsequently affecting GAA and creatine absorbance and synthesis within broiler progeny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aanimal nutrition 3aarginine 3abroiler breeders 3acreatine 3aeggs 3aenergy metabolism 3afeed additives 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aguanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase 3ahatching 3ahens 3aoviducts 3aprogeny 3asmall intestine 3atissues 0aGAA 0acreatine 0abroiler breeder 0ahatching egg 0agene expression1 aEpstein, Tomer1 aGravitz, Dor1 aCahaner, Avigdor1 aRademacher, Meike1 aBraun, Ulrike1 aUni, Zehava0 tPoultry science.g2020 July, v. 99, no. 7 p.3574-3582dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013000170300001600300520101400316592002801330650001701358650001801375650001601393650001601409650001301425650001701438650002801455650001801483650002301501650001101524650002001535650002701555650001401582650001301596700001601609700001701625773009201642856008401734852000901818655001201827IND60086025520221121054130.0141101e20130805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008602552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2013.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xiaoming10aLongitudinal patterns of macroinvertebrate communities in relation to environmental factors in a Tibetan-Plateau river system  ap. 107-114.  aAs the water source of Asian several largest rivers, the numerous Tibetan-Plateau systems support a unique but still unexplored biodiversity. This paper investigates one such river to examine the longitudinal variations of macroinvertebrate richness and composition, and identify the assemblage-environment associations. Altogether 94 taxa belonging to 38 families were identified. Chironomidae was the species-richest and numerically-dominant group, followed by Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera. Taxon richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity and EPT composition significantly decreased downstream, but composition of Chironomidae and Oligochaeta increased. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that five environmental factors including substrate, channel width, current velocity, total suspended solids and turbidity were significant predictors of the community variance. This study gives new taxonomical and ecological information on lotic macroinvertebrate assemblages in a poorly-known high altitude region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aEphemeroptera 3aOligochaeta 3aTrichoptera 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3acorrespondence analysis 3alotic systems 3amacroinvertebrates 3arivers 3asupport systems 3atotal suspended solids 3aturbidity 3avariance1 aXie, Zhicai1 aChen, Yifeng0 tQuaternary international.g2013 Aug. 5, v. 304 p.107-114dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2013.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014000166500001900306520135800325592002801683650001801711650001101729650001901740650002101759650002601780650001601806650002701822650001801849650001701867650001501884650002701899650001901926650001201945650000901957650002101966650001101987651001701998653002602015653006502041653005702106653004302163653003802206700002502244773009402269856008402363852000902447655001202456IND60713466820221120181208.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071346682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1114272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQadir, Saeed10aCAREC energy corridor: Opportunities, challenges, and IMPACT of regional energy trade integration on carbon emissions and energy access  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe research paper examines Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) integrated energy market potentials, challenges, and opportunities for 1) harnessing untapped renewable energy potential; 2) promoting the cross-border trade to cater the rising regional demand mismatch of electricity; 3) improving energy security; and 4) reducing the carbon footprint of the region. The research demonstrates that the CAREC Energy Corridor (CEC) will optimize regional trade cooperation by building cross-border energy trade infrastructure, systems, and governance mechanisms by employing a Regional Public Goods (RPG) framework. The research finds that a one percent increase in energy imports within the region is associated with the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 0.245 kg per $ of GDP; the increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per unit of energy use by 0.233 per kg of oil equivalent; and the growth in electricity production from renewable sources by 0.414 kW hour, thus improving regional electricity affordability, access, and energy security. The cost benefit analysis reveals that traditional (fossil fuel or hydro) power generation and transmission costs must either beat or match the price competition and transmission flexibility options offered by renewables to sustain competitiveness of the regional electricity market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acost benefit analysis 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy policy 3afossil fuels 3agovernance 3agross domestic product 3ainfrastructure 3amarkets 3aoils 3apower generation 3aprices 3aCentral Asia 0aCAREC Energy corridor 0aImpact of energy trade on carbon emissions and energy access 0aEnergy trade integration using regional public goods 0aEnergy infrastructure and connectivity 0aSouth asia regional energy market1 aDosmagambet, Yergali0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Dec., v. 147 p.111427-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1114273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014800162300001800310520172300328592002802051650002202079650001602101650000902117650001302126650001602139650002402155650001502179650002002194650001602214650002002230650002802250650002002278650001202298650001602310650002002326650001402346650001102360650001502371650001202386650001102398650002902409650002402438650001602462650001302478650001802491650002502509653001902534653001502553653001702568653001002585653002302595700001902618700002202637700001502659700001702674700001602691700001802707773010802725856008202833852000902915655001202924IND60691572520221122220652.0210311e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069157252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReda, F.M.10aDoes the use of different oil sources in quail diets impact their productive and reproductive performance, egg quality, and blood constituents?  ap. 3511-3518.  aThe present study investigated the impact of dietary oil sources (soybean, corn, peanut, flaxseed, olive, and sunflower oils as sources of omega 3, 6, and 9 fatty acids) on productive and reproductive traits, egg quality, hematological and biochemical blood parameters of laying Japanese quail. A total of 360 eight-week mature Japanese quail were randomly divided into 6 groups fed for 8 wk on a basal diet included with 1.5% of different oil sources. Results showed that the highest egg weights and the best feed conversion ratio (P < 0.01) were recorded for quail fed diets supplemented with 1.5% soybean and peanut oil. The highest hatchability percentages (P < 0.05) were recorded for quail fed diets supplemented with corn oil as compared to the other oils. Furthermore, diets enriched with corn, olive, or sunflower oils had higher values of blood lymphocytes (%) compared to the other treated groups. Blood total cholesterol significantly decreased in quail fed on corn, peanut, flaxseed, or olive oil sources as compared to soybean or sunflower oil groups. Immunologically, the highest levels (P < 0.001) of immunoglobulins (G and M) were recorded for quail fed on corn or olive oil sources compared to other oil sources. Quail consuming olive oil–included diets showed a significant increase in superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase activities and a significant decrease on malondialdehyde level compared with those consumed the other oil sources. It could be concluded that varying the oil source can affect productive, reproductive, and health aspects of Japanese quail. Soybean oil showed good results regarding production aspects; however, olive oil was the best regarding health aspects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3acholesterol 3acorn 3acorn oil 3adietary fat 3adietary supplements 3aegg weight 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acids 3afeed conversion 3aglutathione transferase 3aimmunoglobulins 3alinseed 3alymphocytes 3amalondialdehyde 3aolive oil 3aolives 3apeanut oil 3apeanuts 3aquails 3areproductive performance 3areproductive traits 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3asunflower oil 3asuperoxide dismutase 0adifferent oils 0aproduction 0areproduction 0aquail 0aantioxidant status1 aEl-Kholy, M.S.1 aAbd El-Hack, M.E.1 aTaha, A.E.1 aOthman, S.I.1 aAllam, A.A.1 aAlagawany, M.0 tPoultry science.g2020 July, v. 99, no. 7 p.3511-3518dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245008900180300001200269520133800281592002801619596007601647596007601723596007601799596007601875650001601951650002601967650000901993650001802002650002302020650002102043650001102064650001902075650001802094650002002112650001102132650001902143650001302162650002502175650002502200700002802225700002602253700002902279700003202308700001702340773010502357856008302462852000902545655001202554IND60778268020221118153100.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077826802DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-022-03638-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuilger-Casagrande, Mariana10aEffects of biogenic silver and iron nanoparticles on soybean seedlings (Glycine max)  ap. 255.  aBACKGROUND: Biogenic metallic nanoparticles have been emerging as a promising alternative for the control of phytopathogens and as nanofertilizers. In this way, it is essential to investigate the possible impacts of these new nanomaterials on plants. In this study, the effects of soil contamination with biogenic silver (AgNPs) and iron (FeNPs) with known antifungal potential were investigated on morphological, physiological and biochemical parameters of soybean seedlings. RESULTS: The exposure of plants/seedlings to AgNPs induced the reduction of root dry weight followed by oxidative stress in this organ, however, adaptive responses such as a decrease in stomatal conductance without impacts on photosynthesis and an increase in intrinsic water use efficiency were also observed. The seedlings exposed to FeNPs had shown an increase in the levels of oxygen peroxide in the leaves not accompanied by lipid peroxidation, and an increase in the expression of POD2 and POD7 genes, indicating a defense mechanism by root lignification. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that different metal biogenic nanoparticles cause different effects on soybean seedlings and these findings highlight the importance of investigating possible phytotoxic effects of these nanomaterials for the control of phytopathogens or as nanofertilizers.  aPublisher supplied data  a#2016/13692-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a#2017/20932-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a#2017/21004-5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a#2017/13328-5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aGlycine max 3aantifungal properties 3airon 3alignification 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant pathogens 3asilver 3asoil pollution 3asoybeans 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency1 aBilesky-José, Natália1 aSousa, Bruno Teixeira1 aOliveira, Halley Caixeta1 aFraceto, Leonardo Fernandes1 aLima, Renata0 tBMC plant biology.g2022 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.255-255dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03638-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008000166500001900246520139000265592002801655650001101683650001801694650001201712650001101724650000901735650002901744651001001773653002601783653002901809653002201838700001601860700001401876700001201890773009401902856008401996852000902080655001202089IND60713466920221120200700.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071346692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1117062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Deqing12aA functional index model for dynamically evaluating China's energy security  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith the aim of overcoming the shortcomings of the conventional energy security index (ESI) used in dynamic assessment of energy security, the present study introduces the functional data analysis method into ESI construction and establishes a dynamic energy security index (DESI) model. The DESI is a generalization of the conventional ESI with a dynamic weighting mechanism in a continuous time domain. In the DESI model, every normalized indicator within three dimensions — energy supply, energy consumption and environmental — is smoothed into a continuous curve, and the changes in its importance are reflected objectively by functional information entropy weights with dynamic information updating. Whereas the three sub-index curves with different importance are distinguished via assigning different weights according to the special national circumstances. The methods of generating a curve for single indicator, sub-index curves, and dyna mic weighting curves are discussed in detail, and the robustness of weighting and aggregation choice in DESI is tested using sensitive analysis. Results of applying DESI to evaluate China's energy security show that the overall changes of China's energy security have undergone a W-shaped fluctuation. To ensure consistently high levels of energy security, the government should focus on oil supply and renewable energy technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aentropy 3amodels 3aoils 3arenewable energy sources 3aChina 0aEnergy security index 0aFunctional data analysis 0aDynamic weighting1 aTian, Sihua1 aFang, Lei1 aXu, Yan0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Dec., v. 147 p.111706-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1117063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014100168300001500309520185600324592002802180650003002208650001102238650002002249650001202269650001102281650001102292650001102303650001602314650001502330651001002345651001802355700001402373700001302387700001402400773009102414856008402505852000902589655001202598IND60086025820221121054212.0141101e20130805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008602582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2013.03.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Hanqing10aSpring and summer precipitation changes from 1880 to 2011 and the future projections from CMIP5 models in the Yangtze River Basin, China  ap. 95-106.  aPrecipitation changes in spring (MAM) and summer (JJA) over the Yangtze River Basin during 1880–2011 were analyzed based on observation datasets from 21 gauge stations. The projected changes in precipitation were evaluated using nine Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) datasets. The results suggest that interannual and interdecadal changes in spring and summer precipitation occurred during 1880–2011. The Dry–Dry events of seasonal evolution generally occurred over the past 132 years. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was applied to detect the oscillation periods, in which quasi – 3a, 5a, 15a, and 40a periods of spring and quasi – 3a, 5a, 11a, 22a, and 40a periods of summer were identified. S-EOF analysis was employed to identify the major modes of seasonal precipitation evolution from spring to summer. The abnormal location of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and insufficient water vapor was found to be associated with the 2011 spring drought, and their sudden change is also responsible for the flood in June. A Taylor diagram showed an improved capability to simulate monthly precipitation using the nine CMIP5 datasets. The projected precipitation changes show that the significant positive linear trends of spring precipitation will occur at representative concentration pathways (RCP)2.6 and RCP8.5, whereas summer precipitation will mainly undergo interannual change. For the projected spatial pattern of precipitation anomaly, spring precipitation will increase in the northern basin but decrease in the south under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in the 2020s and 2040s. Under RCP4.5, positive anomalies can be found in the middle and lower basins. In contrast to those in the spring pattern, the negative anomalies of summer precipitation are concentrated in the middle and lower basins under each RCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3adata collection 3adrought 3amodels 3aspring 3asummer 3awater vapor 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aLuo, Yong1 aYao, Yao1 aLiu, Chun0 tQuaternary international.g2013 Aug. 5, v. 304 p.95-106dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2013.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245013100160300001800291500001500309520172800324592002802052650001102080650002602091650001302117650001102130650001202141650001002153650002402163650001902187650002502206650001702231650000902248650001502257650001302272650002502285650001402310650001002324650001602334650004102350653001902391653002602410653001502436700002002451700002302471700002202494773015402516856007802670852000902748655001202757IND60539518020221117233619.0190318e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053951802DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-82472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScano, Paola12aA gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach for the characterization of goat milk compared with cow milk  ap. 6057-6066.  a2019-12-06  aIn this work, the polar metabolite pool of commercial caprine milk was studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical data analysis. Experimental data were compared with those of cow milk and the discriminant analysis correctly classified milk. By the same means, differences due to heat treatments (UHT or pasteurization) on milk samples were also investigated. Results of the 2 discriminant analyses were combined, with the aim of finding the discriminant metabolites unique for each class and shared by 2 classes. Valine and glycine were specific to goat milk, talose and malic acid to cow milk, and hydroxyglutaric acid to pasteurized samples. Glucose and fructose were shared by cow milk and UHT-treated samples, whereas ribose was shared by pasteurized and goat milk. Other discriminant variables were not attributed to specific metabolites. Furthermore, with the aim to reduce food fraud, the issue of adulteration of caprine milk by addition of cheaper bovine milk has been also addressed. To this goal, mixtures of goat and cow milk were prepared by adding the latter in a range from 0 to 100% (vol/vol) and studied by multivariate regression analysis. The error in the level of cow milk detectable was approximately 5%. These overall results demonstrated that, through the combined approach of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical data analysis, we were able to discriminate between milk typologies on the basis of their polar metabolite profiles and to propose a new analytical method to easily discover food fraud and to protect goat milk uniqueness. The use of appropriate visualization tools improved the interpretation of multivariate model results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aribose 3adiscriminant analysis 3aUHT milk 3avaline 3aglucose 3agoats 3aregression analysis 3apasteurization 3aadulterated products 3ametabolomics 3amilk 3amalic acid 3afructose 3aglycine (amino acid) 3agoat milk 3afraud 3ametabolites 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aheat treatment 0amultivariate analysis 0afood fraud1 aMurgia, Antonio1 aPirisi, Filippo M.1 aCaboni, Pierluigi0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Oct., v. 97, no. 10 p.6057-6066dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-82473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013100167520204600298592002802344650003402372650001002406650002002416650001002436650001702446650001602463650000902479650002802488650001602516650001802532650001102550650002902561650001902590650001702609650002102626650002202647650001002669650002802679650003802707650001002745650000902755650003202764650001502796700001602811700001502827700001402842700002002856700001902876700002002895773013402915856008503049961000903134852000903143655001203152IND60672720620221117004715.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067272062DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz031.OR24-07-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Weimin10aDietary Fruit and Vegetable Supplementation Suppresses Diet-induced Atherosclerosis in LDL Receptor Knockout Mice (OR24-07-19)  aEpidemiological studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables (F&V) is inversely associated with incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the evidence for causality and underlying mechanisms is lacking. Our objective was to determine if increased consumption of F&V could prevent atherosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms. A unique blend of the most commonly consumed 24 F&V was freeze-dried into a powder and mixed into diets. Thirty six 4-week old male LDL receptor knockout mice were randomly assigned to one of 3 diet groups (12/group): low fat (LF, 10 kcal% fat), high-fat (27 kcal% fat) with 0% F&V (HF), and HF plus 15% F&V diet (HF + FV, equivalent to 8–9 servings for humans). After 20 weeks, mice were euthanized and blood, aorta, and liver tissue were collected. Aortic atherosclerotic lesion, hepatic steatosis, plasma lipid profile and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were measured. No significant differences were found in body weight among the 3 groups. Mice fed HF diet had larger aortic atherosclerotic lesion and hepatic steatosis area than mice fed LF diet by 6.5 and 1.9 fold, respectively (p < 0.001). HF + FV group had 80% less aortic lesion and hepatic steatosis than HF group (p < 0.001). Mice fed HF diet had significantly higher plasma TG and LDL and lower HDL levels than mice fed LF diet, and this dyslipidemia was prevented by F&V supplementation. Further, HF + FV group had lower plasma TNFα levels compared to HF0 group (p < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis showed that aortic atherosclerotic lesion and hepatic steatosis area were negatively correlated with plasma HDL (p < 0.001) and significantly and positively correlated with TNFα, and the ratios of LDL/HDL, TG/HDL, and non HDL/HDL. Our results demonstrate a causal role of high intake of F&V in preventing HF-induced atherosclerosis and hepatic steatosis, which may be mediated through improved dyslipidemia and reduced inflammation.

The relative importance of growth, survivorship, and recruitment to population growth (λ) was assessed by performing elasticity and life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses. We also evaluated the relative contribution of sexual and asexual recruitment to λ by analyzing four different scenarios: (1) the combined impact of sexual and asexual recruitment, (2) the impact of only sexual recruits, (3) the impact of only asexual fragmentation, and (4) the impact of no recruitment. Size-based transition matrices were parameterized with field data collected at two sites in the southwest coast of Puerto Rico: Media Luna West (MLW), a reef exposed to high water movement and at Las Pelotas (LP), a reef experiencing low water motion. Estimated λ of 0.8940 and 0.7973 at MLW and LP respectively suggest that both populations are declining. Elasticity analysis indicated that survivorship may be the most important contributor to λ at both sites. However, λ at MLW was influenced more by the survivorship of small individuals whereas survivorship of the large size-class contributed the most to λ at LP. LTRE analysis indicates that the difference in λ between sites was mostly due to difference in survivorship of small sponges. At both sites, λ decreased considerably when sexual recruitment was excluded from the model whereas the absence of asexual recruitment barely changed λ. Therefore, it is suggested that sexual recruitment plays a major role (in comparison to asexual fragmentation) in the population dynamics of this sponge at the studied sites. We conclude that spatial variability in water motion plays an important role in population dynamics of A. compressa by influencing survivorship patterns, including the relative contribution of asexual and sexual recruitment to population growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDemospongiae 3aanimal growth 3aasexual reproduction 3apopulation growth 3asexual reproduction 3aspatial variation 3aspecies recruitment 3asurvival rate 3aPuerto Rico1 aSabat, Alberto M.1 aYoshioka, Paul M.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Oct. 31, v. 407, no. 2 p.355-362dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245015800161300001800319500002000337520197700357592002802334650002002362650001402382650001702396650001702413650001002430650001502440650001202455650001402467650001602481650001302497650001602510651001102526651000902537651001202546651001702558651001502575651001502590700003402605700002202639700002102661773010802682856007302790852000902863655001202872IND60579612720221119105630.0170824e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057961272DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.129812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKainulainen, Kent10aIsland hopping, long‐distance dispersal and species radiation in the Western Indian Ocean: historical biogeography of the Coffeeae alliance (Rubiaceae)  ap. 1966-1979.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The Western Indian Ocean region (WIOR) is home to a very diverse and largely unique flora that has mainly originated via long‐distance dispersals. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the origins of the WIOR biodiversity and to understand the dynamics of colonization events between the islands. We investigate spatial and temporal hypotheses of the routes of dispersal, and compare the dispersal patterns of plants of the Coffeeae alliance (Rubiaceae) and their dispersers. Rubiaceae is the second most species‐rich plant family in Madagascar, and includes many endemic genera. The neighbouring archipelagos of the Comoros, Mascarenes and Seychelles also harbour several endemic Rubiaceae. LOCATION: The islands of the Western Indian Ocean. METHODS: Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times were reconstructed from plastid DNA data of an ingroup sample of 340 species, using Bayesian inference. Ancestral areas and range evolution history were inferred by a maximum likelihood method that takes topological uncertainty into account. RESULTS: At least 15 arrivals to Madagascar were inferred, the majority of which have taken place within the last 10 Myr. Most dispersal events were supported as being from mainland Africa, but Catunaregam may have dispersed from Asia. Although most Coffeeae alliance lineages are zoochorous, the general pattern of dispersals from Africa is incongruent with the biogeographic origins of the extant Malagasy volant frugivores. Several out‐of‐Madagascar dispersals were inferred to the neighbouring islands, as well as back‐colonizations of Africa. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The African flora has been of foremost importance as source of dispersal to the islands of the Western Indian Ocean. Following the colonization of Madagascar, rapid radiations appear to have taken place in some clades, and Madagascar has also been an important source area for subsequent dispersal to the Comoros, Mascarenes and Seychelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aRubiaceae 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aflora 3afrugivores 3aislands 3aphylogeny 3aplastid DNA 3atopology 3auncertainty 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aComoros 3aIndian Ocean 3aMadagascar 3aSeychelles1 aRazafimandimbison, Sylvain G.1 aWikström, Niklas1 aBremer, Birgitta0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.1966-1979dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.129813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245020500160520144800365592002801813650003101841650002101872650001101893650002301904650003701927650001201964650001801976650001401994650001302008651001002021700001802031700002102049700001902070700002002089700002702109700002102136700001802157700002002175700002302195700002302218773012102241856007302362852000902435655001202444IND60711696220221118121244.0200928e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071169622DNAL7 a10.3390/f110909552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsunaga, Koji 10aDo Seedlings Derived from Pinewood Nematode-Resistant Pinus thunbergii Parl. Clones Selected in Southwestern Region Perform Well in Northern Regions in Japan? Inferences from Nursery Inoculation Tests  aBackground and Objectives: To determine whether the progeny of pinewood nematode-resistant Pinus thunbergii Parl. clones selected in the southwestern region of Japan could be successful in reforestation in the northern region, we investigated the magnitude of the genotype–environment interaction effect on the resistance against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner and Buhrer) Nickle in P. thunbergii. Materials and Methods: We inoculated P. thunbergii seedlings of six full-sib families, with various resistance levels, with B. xylophilus in nurseries at three experimental sites in the northern and southern regions of Japan. All parental clones of the tested families originated from southwestern Japan, and selection of parental clones for resistance was performed in the same region. Sound rates after nematode inoculation were calculated, and survival analysis, correlation analysis and variance component analysis were performed. Results and Conclusions: Families with high sound rate in the southern region also showed a high sound rate in the northern region. In almost all cases, Spearman’s correlation coefficients for sound rates were more than 0.698 among sites. The variance component of the interaction between site and family was small compared to that of site and family separately. Thus, we conclude that the resistant clones selected in the southern region would retain their genetic resistance in the northern regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aPinus thunbergii 3aclones 3agenetic resistance 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aprogeny 3areforestation 3aseedlings 3avariance 3aJapan1 aIki, Taiichi 1 aHirao, Tomonori 1 aOhira, Mineko 1 aYamanobe, Taro 1 aIwaizumi, Masakazu  G.1 aMiura, Masahiro 1 aIsoda, Keiya 1 aKurita, Manabu 1 aTakahashi, Makoto 1 aWatanabe, Atsushi 0 tForests.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110909553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245009100180300001600271520125900287592002801546650001601574650000901590650002101599650002301620650001601643650001201659650001701671650002301688650001801711650002001729650001801749650001601767650003001783650001701813650001501830650001501845650000901860650001301869653000901882653001501891653001501906653001401921653002301935653002001958700002101978773009901999856009002098852000902188655001202197IND60525152420221120085333.0190318e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052515242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawood, Mahmoud A.O.10aRecent advances in the role of probiotics and prebiotics in carp aquaculture: A review  ap. 243-251.  aThe demand for cultured carp species has grown tremendously during the last decade due to their high market value. Recently, intensive aquaculture system has been expanding and is emerging as one of the most practical and promising tools to meet the requirements of carp. However, in intensive fish farming, animals are subjected to stress conditions that weaken fish immune systems, leading to increased susceptibility to diseases. These diseases have resulted in production losses and remain as one of the major causes of concern for carp farmers. Recently, one of the major limiting factors in intensive fish culture is the use of dietary supplements probiotics and prebiotics. These natural ingredients enhance the immune response of fish, confer tolerance against different stressors and minimize the risk associated with the use of chemical products such as: vaccines, antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. The present review summarizes and discusses the results of probiotic and prebiotic administration on growth performance, gut physiology, intestinal microbiota, immune response and health status of different carp species. Furthermore, this study tries to cover the gaps in existing knowledge and suggest issues that merit further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3acarp 3adigestive system 3adisease resistance 3afarmed fish 3afarmers 3afish culture 3agrowth performance 3ahealth status 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aingredients 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amarket value 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3arisk 3avaccines 0aCarp 0aProbiotics 0aPrebiotics 0aNutrition 0aGrowth performance 0aImmune response1 aKoshio, Shunsuke0 tAquaculture.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 454 p.243-251dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010600172300001600278500001500294520210700309592002802416650002102444650000902465650000902474650001002483650001902493650002502512650001602537650001202553650000902565650002002574650001902594650000902613650001002622650001202632650002102644650001302665651001002678653002802688653002302716653001502739653001202754653001102766653000902777700001802786700001802804700002102822700001902843773008702862856008502949852000903034655001203043IND60542492120221122001508.0190403e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054249212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2015.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Shingo10aInhibition of arsenic accumulation in Japanese rice by the application of iron and silicate materials  ap. 328-335.  a2019-12-06  aThere are many rice paddy fields with relatively high arsenic (As) concentrations in areas that have not been subjected to countermeasures because the As level was below the criterion value established by the Agricultural Land Soil Contamination Prevention Law in Japan. To reduce the risk of excessive As in rice paddy fields using agronomic methods applicable to common farming practices, we examined the effect of the application of iron (Fe) and silicate materials on As uptake by rice plants in bottomless concrete frames filled with soil collected from an area surrounding a former As-polluted region. Following the application of calcium silicate slag at a rate of 0.5kgm−2, no significant effect was observed on the As concentration in rice grain or straw, but the available silicate in the soil was increased. The application of Fe materials at a rate of 0.5kgm−2 resulted in a significant reduction of the As concentration in grain and straw, as shown by an analysis of variance. The lowest concentrations of As in both grain and straw were obtained with the application of a metal Fe powder (EM), followed by that with an Fe oxide material (FB), a converter furnace slag (FM), and the control. The EM and FB applications both significantly reduced the 1M HCl-soluble As concentration in soil compared to the control. The levels of both acid ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (Fe-ox) and citrate–bicarbonate–dithionite extractable Fe (Fe-CDB) in the soil were significantly increased by the application of EM and that of FB compared to the FM and the control. A negative significant correlation was obtained between the amount of 1M HCl-soluble As and two types of free Fe oxide. These results suggest that the available As in soil was strongly fixed with the Fe oxides that were increased by the application of Fe materials, and that the decrease of available As in the soil induced a decrease in the As uptake by rice plants. The application of Fe materials will thus be effective to lower or prevent the risk of the rice cultivation in paddy fields with relatively high levels of As.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium silicate 3arisk 3arice 3aslags 3asoil pollution 3aanalysis of variance 3airon oxides 3aarsenic 3airon 3afarming systems 3arisk reduction 3asoil 3astraw 3apaddies 3aammonium oxalate 3afurnaces 3aJapan 0aArsenic-polluted region 0aAvailable silicate 0aIron oxide 0aArsenic 0aoxides 0aRice1 aKasuga, Junko1 aTaiki, Nozomi1 aMakino, Tomoyuki1 aArao, Tomohito0 tCatena.g2015 Dec., v. 135 p.328-335dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014700155520143100302592002801733650001401761650001001775650001401785650002401799650001301823650001801836650001701854650001201871650002301883650001101906650001201917650001101929650001801940650002401958700002001982700001702002700001702019700001302036700001902049700002002068700001802088700001902106700001602125773012302141856007502264852000902339655001202348IND60781049620221117234406.0220623e20220611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078104962DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141224322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hu 10aSwimming Suppresses Cognitive Decline of HFD-Induced Obese Mice through Reversing Hippocampal Inflammation, Insulin Resistance, and BDNF Level  aObesity is an important public health problem nowadays. Long-term obesity can trigger a series of chronic diseases and impair the learning and memory function of the brain. Current studies show that scientific exercise can effectively improve learning and memory capacity, which also can provide benefits for obese people. However, the underlying mechanisms for the improvement of cognitive capacity under the status of obesity still need to be further explored. In the present study, the obesity-induced cognition-declined model was established using 4-week-old mice continuously fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, and then the model mice were subjected to an 8-week swimming intervention and corresponding evaluation of relevant indicators, including cognitive capacity, inflammation, insulin signal pathway, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF), and apoptosis, for exploring potential regulatory mechanisms. Compared with the mice fed with regular diets, the obese mice revealed the impairment of cognitive capacity; in contrast, swimming intervention ameliorated the decline in cognitive capacity of obese mice by reducing inflammatory factors, inhibiting the JNK/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signal pathway, and activating the PGC-1α/BDNF signal pathway, thereby suppressing the apoptosis of neurons. Therefore, swimming may be an important interventional strategy to compensate for obesity-induced cognitive impairment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3aexercise 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amemory 3aobesity 3apeople 3apublic health 3asignal transduction1 aLiang, Ji-Ling 1 aWu, Qiu-Yue 1 aLi, Jin-Xiu 1 aLiu, Ya 1 aWu, Liang-Wen 1 aHuang, Jie-Lun 1 aWu, Xiao-Wen 1 aWang, Minghui,1 aChen, Ning 0 tNutrients.g2022 June 11, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141224323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245015900164500001400323520155100337592002801888650001401916650001901930650002501949650001301974650002201987650002602009650001402035650001502049650000902064650001702073650001202090650002202102650001602124650001502140650001702155650001502172650002802187650001902215650002302234650001302257650001402270650001102284650001202295650001502307700001302322700001702335700002102352700001202373700001602385700001802401700001802419773012702437856008502564852000902649655001202658IND60724523320221121075512.0210122e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072452332DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90100832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan 10aDandelion (Taraxacum mongolicum Hand.-Mazz.)

A total of 12 mid-lactation dairy cows were selected and randomly classified into two groups, supplementing dandelion with 0 (CON) and 200 g/d per cow (DAN) above basal diet, respectively. Rumen fluid samples were collected in the last week of the trial for microbiome and metabolome analysis. The results showed that supplementation of DAN increased the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen, acetate, and butyrate significantly. The rumen bacterial community was significantly changed in the DAN group, with Bacterioidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria being the main ruminal bacterial phyla. The abundance of Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, UCG_005, and Christensenellaceae_R_7_group were relatively higher, whereas that of Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG_002 and Dialister were lower in the DAN than those in the CON. Metabolomics analysis showed that the content of d-glucose, serotonin, ribulose-5-phosphate, and d-glycerate were higher in the DAN group. These metabolites were enriched in the starch and sucrose metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, tryptophan metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. The ribulose-5-phosphate and d-glycerate were correlated with Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, UCG_005, and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group positively. This study demonstrated that the supplementation of dandelion impacts the ruminal microorganisms and metabolites in a way that rumen fermentation was enhanced in lactating dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDialister 3aProteobacteria 3aTaraxacum mongolicum 3aacetates 3aammonium nitrogen 3abacterial communities 3abutyrates 3adairy cows 3adiet 3afermentation 3aglucose 3alactating females 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amicrobiome 3apentose phosphate cycle 3arumen bacteria 3arumen fermentation 3asampling 3aserotonin 3astarch 3asucrose 3atryptophan1 aLv, Mei 1 aWang, Jiaqi 1 aTian, Zhonghong 1 aYu, Bo 1 aWang, Bing 1 aLiu, Jianxin 1 aLiu, Hongyun 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90100833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014600171300001400317520155700331592002801888650001301916650001201929650001101941650001501952650002501967650001101992650001302003650001702016650001502033650001402048650001502062650003102077650000902108650001702117650000902134650002302143651001602166651001002182653001802192653001602210653002202226653002102248653002802269653003102297700001902328700002102347773008502368856008502453852000902538655001202547IND60542492220221122001706.0190403e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054249222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2015.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Amico, Michele10aSmall-scale variability of soil properties and soil–vegetation relationships in patterned ground on different lithologies (NW Italian Alps)  ap. 47-58.  aCryogenic patterned ground represents spectacular periglacial landscapes. On the Alps, sorted/nonsorted patterned ground features larger than 1m, formed by deep seasonal cryoturbation with or without permafrost, occupy exposed, stable surfaces at high altitudes and represent a particularly harsh habitat for plant life.We analyzed soils across transects through typical active patterned ground features (sorted/nonsorted circles and stripes) on four common lithotypes (calcschists, serpentinite, gabbros and gneiss) in the Western Italian Alps, in order to observe the small-scale lateral and depth variability in physico-chemical properties, and their association with cryoturbation, plant cover and species distribution.Cryoturbation was correlated with lateral/vertical textural sorting across features, mostly visible on silt and coarse sand, but with opposite trends on sorted and nonsorted patterned ground types. A strong lateral variability in organic carbon was detected, with high values near the better vegetated rims and low contents in the centers. Exchangeable bases, heavy metals and nutrients followed the same distribution. However, the differences inherited from the parent materials were overwhelming.Climate is the main driver of high altitude ecosystems, reducing total plant cover and causing cryoturbation, which in turn creates strong edaphic gradients over small distances. Plant species and communities are well correlated with edaphic properties inherited from the parent materials, such as exchangeable Ca and heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acalcium 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3aexchangeable calcium 3agneiss 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3alandscapes 3anutrients 3apermafrost 3aphysicochemical properties 3asand 3aserpentinite 3asilt 3asoil heterogeneity 3aAlps region 3aItaly 0aCryoturbation 0aPedogenesis 0aPeriglacial soils 0aSerpentine soils 0aSorted patterned ground 0aNonsorted patterned ground1 aGorra, Roberta1 aFreppaz, Michele0 tCatena.g2015 Dec., v. 135 p.47-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016900159300001800328500002000346520223300366592002802599650001202627650002402639650001502663650000902678650002102687650002202708650001202730650001302742700002102755700002202776700001802798700002102816700002002837700002202857700002802879700002002907773010802927856007303035852000903108655001203117IND60579612920221119105427.0170824e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057961292DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.129762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidalgo, Manuel10aSize‐spectra across geographical and bathymetric gradients reveal contrasting resilient mechanisms of recovery between Atlantic and Mediterranean fish communities  ap. 1939-1951.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Marine conservation often prioritizes measures based on ecosystem diversity, missing important information on the size and structure of communities such as that provided by body size‐spectra (SS). While most studies have focussed on temporal or spatial patterns of SS, there is no research investigating their spatial heterogeneity, which is a key community trait revealing mechanisms of resilience. We aimed to comparatively determine the main patterns of variation of fish SS and their spatial heterogeneity across geographic and bathymetric gradients. LOCATION: Shelf and slope Atlantic and Mediterranean demersal ecosystems. METHODS: Using the information obtained from the experimental surveys, we calculated fish SS at four bathymetric strata and investigated the influence of the biomass of small‐sized and large‐sized fish on their temporal and spatial variation. We also assessed the functional relationship between the mean pattern and the spatial heterogeneity of SS as a characteristic structural trait of a community. RESULTS: The variation in SS demonstrates that Atlantic communities were geographically and bathymetrically more connected, while those in the Mediterranean were more fragmented. The relationship between mean SS and its spatial heterogeneity was a community fingerprint differentiating two contrasting pathways of community recovery between Atlantic and Mediterranean ecosystems. Atlantic communities were recovering because of the temporal increasing contribution of large fish and a ‘rescue effect’ of neighbouring areas, which have spatially homogenized size structure. Mediterranean communities were, by contrast, spatially clustered and highly dependent on small‐sized fish variability that hampers the capacity of ecosystems to recover after a chronic degradation. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of SS variation depend on the spatial complexity of communities, which contrasts between Atlantic and Mediterranean systems. Integrative analyses of size‐based indicators (mean and variance) provide a complete assessment of the structural properties of communities and characterize the resilience mechanisms of recovery against perturbations under contrasting ecological contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afish 3afish communities 3aspatial variation 3asurveys 3avariance1 aQuetglas, Antoni1 aOrdines, Francesc1 aRueda, Lucía1 aPunzón, Antonio1 aDelgado, Marina1 aGil de Sola, Luis1 aEsteban Drake, Antonio,1 aMassutí, Enric0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.1939-1951dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.129763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010100158520163300259592002801892650002001920650001901940650002301959650002201982650001202004650001502016650002102031650001502052650002002067650001102087650001402098650001502112650001602127650001002143650001602153650001602169650001502185651001602200651001602216700002202232773012002254856007302374852000902447655001202456IND60711696420221118121210.0200928e20200819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071169642DNAL7 a10.3390/f110909032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvando, Paola 10aOptimal Harvesting Decision Paths When Timber and Water Have an Economic Value in Uneven Forests  aWe developed an uneven-aged forest economic decision-making framework that combines: (i) a size-structured matrix model, based on growth and mortality predictions of a dynamic process-based forest landscape model, (ii) an optimal control model that determines the dynamics of control and state variables, which in turn are defined by tree harvesting and forest stock, respectively, and (iii) a water yield function that depends on changes in the leaf area index (LAI), the latter being affected by forest management. This framework was used to simulate the effects of economic-driven harvesting decisions on water yields on a catchment of South-Western Swiss Alps when both timber and water benefits are considered. Water benefits are estimated as environmental prices considering current water demands for drinking, irrigation and hydropower production. We simulated optimal harvesting decisions given the initial forest structure at each 200 m × 200 m grid cells, a set of restrictions to harvesting, and specific species survival, recruitment and growth probabilities, all of which are affected by the stand’s LAI. We applied this model using different harvesting restriction levels over a period of 20 to 40-years, and accounting for single and joint timber and water benefits. The results suggested that at the environmental prices estimated at the catchment area, water benefits have a slight influence on harvesting decisions, but when water is accounted for, harvesting decisions would include more tree species and different diameter classes, which, in principle, is expected to favor more diverse forest structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adrinking water 3aeconomic valuation 3aforest management 3aforests 3aharvesting 3airrigation water 3alandscapes 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3amortality 3aprediction 3aprobability 3atrees 3awater power 3awater yield 3awatersheds 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aSpeich, Matthias 0 tForests.g2020 Aug. 19, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110909033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245009800159300001600257520099300273592002801266650001401294650001601308650001101324650001701335650001501352650000901367650001201376653002901388653003701417653002601454653003501480700002001515773013601535856007801671852000901749655001201758IND60594370720221122202811.0190514e20161012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059437072DNAL7 a10.1139/cjss-2016-00872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiao10aUsing boundary-layer theory to solve the convection–dispersion equation of solute transport  ap. 141-148.  aConcern about the transport of chemicals in groundwater systems has stimulated the development of many models to describe transport in porous media, the most common of which under steady-state conditions is the convection–dispersion equation (CDE). We propose a novel solution to the CDE for predicting profiles of solute concentrations and estimating transport parameters. The solution was adapted from polynomial and exponential boundary-layer (BL) solutions based on BL theory. The accuracy of the new BL solution was dependent on the number of polynomial terms and the properties of the soil. The errors in predicting profiles of solute concentrations and estimating transport parameters were usually lower for a model combining one exponential and two polynomial terms than for a model with only one polynomial term. The new BL solution provides an alternative for simulating solute transport under field conditions and improves the methodology of using BL theory to solve the CDE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3agroundwater 3amodels 3aporous media 3aprediction 3asoil 3asolutes 0asolute transport in soil 0aconvection–dispersion equation 0aboundary-layer theory 0atransport parameter estimation1 aShao, Ming’an0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2016 Oct. 12, v. 97, no. 2 p.141-148dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1934x1918-18417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2016-00873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245020900169520195800378592002802336650001302364650001802377650001602395650001602411650001402427650002202441653001202463653002302475653003102498653002402529653001002553653001502563700001402578700001302592700001502605700001902620700002002639773011902659856008802778852000902866655001202875IND60783730720221118025443.0220929e20221125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078373072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1576212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiaqi10aDramatic changes in aerosol composition during the 2016–2020 heating seasons in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region and its surrounding areas: The role of primary pollutants and secondary aerosol formation  aWith the implementation of a series of air pollution mitigation strategies during the past decade, great air quality improvements have been observed in the BTH region. Despite of significant decreases in gaseous pollutants, such as SO₂ and NO₂, the enhancement of secondary aerosol formation was observed. NO₃⁻ has surpassed SO₄²⁻ and OM to become the dominant PM₂.₅ component. We find that the reduction of POC mainly dominated the decreasing trend of OC. As for secondary inorganic components, the key processes or factors controlling the spatial-temporal variation characteristics were different. The areas with large SO₄²⁻ concentrations corresponded well to those with high SO₂ concentrations, while the synchronized NO₃⁻ better followed spatial patterns in O₃ than NO₂. From 2016 to 2020, the response of SO₄²⁻ to SO₂ was close to a linear function, while the reaction of NO₃⁻ to the decrease of NO₂ displayed nonlinear behavior. Such different relationships indicated that SO₄²⁻ was predominantly controlled by SO₂, while NO₃⁻ was not only related to NO₂ but also determined by the secondary conversion process. The ratios of SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, NH₄⁺, and OC to EC between 2016 and 2020 were generally higher than 1 in typical BTH cities, and the ratio of NO₃⁻ to EC was exceptionally high, with a range reaching up to 200 %. Besides, this ratio coincided well with the enhancement of Oₓ, indicating the potential role of Oₓ to secondary NO₃⁻ formation. The diurnal cycle of NO₃⁻, O₃, and NO₂ concentration change rate indicated that the relative increase of O₃ during nighttime may offset the effectiveness of NOX emission reduction. This study provided observational evidence of enhanced secondary NO₃⁻ formation with the rising trend of atmospheric oxidation and emphasized the importance of nighttime chemistry for NO₃⁻ formation in the BTH region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aenvironment 3aoxidation 3apollution control 0aNitrate 0aEmission reduction 0aSpatial-temporal variation 0aSecondary pollution 0aOzone 0aBTH region1 aGao, Jian1 aChe, Fei1 aWang, Yali1 aLin, Pengchuan1 aZhang, Yuechong0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 25, v. 849 p.157621-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1576213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245016800168500001900336520123300355592002801588650001101616650001101627650001901638650001101657650001801668650000901686650001401695650002101709650001501730650001001745653000901755653001601764653002801780653002001808653000801828653002601836700002501862700002401887700001901911700002101930700001601951700001801967700001801985700002202003700001802025700002402043700001902067700001802086773010802104856008402212852000902296655001202305IND60713467420221120200757.0210114e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071346742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1117752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdmonds, James10aCould congressionally mandated incentives lead to deployment of large-scale CO2 capture, facilities for enhanced oil recovery CO2 markets and geologic CO2 storage?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn passing the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, Congress reformed and strengthened a section of the tax code, 45Q, which provides tax credits of up to $35/ton CO₂ for the capture and utilization of CO₂ in qualifying applications such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and up to $50/ton CO₂ for CO₂ that is captured and permanently stored in a geologic repository. Earlier versions of the tax credit with lower credit values generated limited interest. This change to the tax code could potentially alter U.S. energy systems. This paper examines the effect of the increased 45Q credits on CO₂ capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) deployment in the United States and on petroleum and power production. A range of potential outcomes is explored using five modeling tools. The paper goes on to explore the potential impact of possible modifications of the current tax credit including extension of its availability in time, the period over which 45Q tax credits can be utilized for any given asset and increases in the value of the credit as well as interactions with technology availability and carbon taxation. The paper concludes that 45Q tax credits could stimulate additional CCUS beyond that which is already underway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apower generation 3atax credit 3ataxes 0aCCUS 0aCO2 capture 0aUtilization and storage 0a45Q tax credits 0aEOR 0aEnhanced oil recovery1 aNichols, Christopher1 aAdamantiades, Misha1 aBistline, John1 aHuster, Jonathan1 aIyer, Gokul1 aJohnson, Nils1 aPatel, Pralit1 aShowalter, Sharon1 aVictor, Nadja1 aWaldhoff, Stephanie1 aWise, Marshall1 aWood, Frances0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Nov., v. 146 p.111775-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1117753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010000169520147300269592002801742650001501770650001101785650002001796650001301816650001801829650001601847650002601863650001301889650001101902650001501913650002001928650001601948650001301964653001301977653002401990653001302014653001702027653002402044700001502068700001502083700001702098700001202115700001502127700001702142773011902159856008802278852000902366655001202375IND60783730820221118025411.0220914e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078373082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1576222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaoyi10aAging factor and its prediction models of chromium ecotoxicity in soils with various properties  aAging of pollutants determines bioavailability and toxicity thresholds of environmental pollutants in soil. However, the ecotoxicity of chromium (Cr) rarely considers the effect of aging as well as soil properties. In order to explore the aging characteristics and establish their quantitative relationship with different soil properties, this study selected 7 soils with different properties through exogenous addition of Cr and determined its toxicity on barley root elongation. From 14d to 540d, EC₁₀ and EC₅₀ of barley root elongation ranged from 21.40 to 312.52 (mg·kg⁻¹) and 50.15 to 883.88 (mg·kg⁻¹) respectively. The hormesis appeared in the dose-response curve of acid soil as relative barley root elongation reached >110 % compared with the control. Extended aging time of Cr from 14d to 540d was associated with the attenuation of the toxicity of Cr, as the aging factor increased from 1.26 to 6.09 for EC₅₀, from 0.88 to 4.98 for EC₁₀. The prediction model of AFEC₅₀ and soil properties is lg (AF₃₆₀d) = 0.306lg Clay+0.026lg CEC + 0.240 (R² = 0.872, P < 0.01). The results demonstrated that with the extension of aging time, the toxicity of Cr decreased at 360d and reached a slow reaction stage, after that soil OC, Clay and CEC could well explain the aging procedure of Cr (VI).

In a case-control discrete choice experiment, we measure the level of acceptance in terms of people's willingness-to-accept (WTA) for having future land-based wind power developments in Norway; comparing exposed and non-exposed people's WTA. We find that exposure lowers acceptance. Furthermore, exposed people are also unwilling to pay as much to increase general domestic renewable energy production (from all sources) as non-exposed people, and thus have lower acceptance for such renewable energy policy initiatives. After testing for type of exposure, we argue that the inconclusiveness in the literature of how exposure affects acceptance of wind power developments could be due to the fact that impacts considered differ somewhat across studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy policy 3apeople 3awind power 3aNorway 0aDiscrete choice experiment 0aExposure 0aRenewable energy 0aWillingness-to-accept 0aSocietal acceptance1 aGrimsrud, Kristine1 aKipperberg, Gorm1 aLindhjem, Henrik1 aNavrud, Ståle,0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Dec., v. 147 p.111780-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1117803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100002000168245004100188300001600229520123700245592002801482650001101510650002301521650001201544650001601556650001501572650001101587650001701598650001301615650001001628653001601638653001601654653002401670653001101694653001701705653001701722653001601739700002001755773010401775856011601879852000901995655001202004IND60130912420221119163459.0151127e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013091242DNAL7 a10.1614/0043-1745(2001)049[0184:TCIIC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAskew, Shawn D.10aTropic croton interference in cotton  ap. 184-189.  aStudies were conducted to determine the effect of interference between tropic croton (Croton glandulosus) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) on plant growth and productivity. Tropic croton height was not affected by weed density, but cotton height decreased with increased weed density 10 wk after planting. Tropic croton biomass per plant was not affected by weed density, but total weed biomass per meter of crop row increased with weed density. Cotton lint yield decreased linearly 2 kg ha⁻⁻¹ with each gram increase in weed dry biomass per meter of row. Percent yield loss––density relationship was described by the rectangular hyperbola model. Estimated coefficients A (maximum yield loss) and I (yield loss per unit density as density approaches zero) were 129.6 ±± 42.2 and 35.6 ±± 8.0%%, respectively, when asymptotic iterations were based on least sums of squares. When A was constrained to 100%% yield loss, I was 42.5 ±± 5.1%%. Results indicated that tropic croton was less competitive with cotton than many weeds but represents an economic threat to cotton growers.Nomenclature: Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. ‘‘Deltapine 51’’; tropic croton, Croton glandulosus var. septentrionalis Muell.-Arg.

Background and Objectives: WUE is a classic physiological process of plants that reflects the compromise between carbon assimilation and water loss and has a profound influence on their performance in water-limited environments. Forest expansion in Mediterranean regions associated with land abandonment can influence the WUE of plants due to the existence of two opposing gradients: one of favourable–unfavourable environmental conditions and another one of increased–decreased intraspecific competition, the former increasing and the latter decreasing towards the expanding front. The main objective of this study was to elucidate how the WUE of Juniperus thurifera varied along the stages of forest expansion and to provide insight on how this variation is influenced by intraspecific competition and abiotic factors. Materials and Methods: Seventeen plots at different distances from the mature forest core were selected at three sites located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. For 30 individuals within each plot, we measured biometric characteristics, age, tree vigour, and C/N ratio in leaves, and the leaf carbon isotope signature (δ¹³C (‰)) as a proxy for WUE. Around each individual, we scored the percentage cover of bare soil, stoniness, conspecifics, and other woody species. Results: WUE of J. thurifera individuals varied along the forest expansion gradient, being greater for the individuals at the expanding front than for those at the mature forest. WUE was influenced by the cover of conspecifics, tree age, and C/N ratio in leaves. This pattern reveals that less favourable environmental conditions (i.e., rocky soils and higher radiation due to lower vegetation cover) and younger trees at the expanding front are associated with increased WUE. The increased cover of conspecifics decreases irradiance at the mature forest, involving milder stress conditions than at the expanding front. Conclusions: Lower WUE in mature forests due to more favourable conditions and higher WUE due to abiotic stress at expanding fronts revealed high constraints on water economy of this tree species in these two contrasting situations. Climate change scenarios bringing increased aridity are a serious threat to Juniperus thurifera forests, affecting both mature and juvenile populations although in different ways, which deserve further research to fully unveil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus thurifera 3aabandoned land 3aabiotic stress 3abiometry 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aforests 3aintraspecific competition 3ajuveniles 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3atree age 3atrees 3avegetation cover 3avigor 3awater use efficiency 3awoody plants 3aIberian Peninsula1 aValladares, Fernando 1 aMartín-Forés, Irene 0 tForests.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110909603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245018100172300001800353500002000371520228600391592002802677650001502705650001402720650001202734650002202746650002002768650002202788650002702810650000902837650003002846650001802876650001002894650001702904650002502921650001102946650001402957650002502971650001402996650002503010650002603035651002203061700003103083700002303114700001903137773010803156856007303264852000903337655001203346IND60579613320221119105616.0170824e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057961332DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.129932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeñalver‐Alcázar, Miguel10aSex‐dependent implications of primary productivity and conspecific density on geographical body size variation in a newt: disentangling local, large scale and genetic factors  ap. 2096-2108.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Geographical body size variation has interested biologists since the 19th century. However, there is no consensus regarding the mechanisms involved, especially in amphibians. At the intraspecific level, different approximations and hypotheses have addressed this problem, but no study has integrated information at different spatio‐temporal ecological and (phylo)genetic scales whilst considering differences between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms involved in geographical body size variation in the Iberian newt (Lissotriton boscai), accounting for the main hypotheses potentially explaining variation in this phenotypic trait in amphibians. LOCATION: Iberian Peninsula. METHODS: We used a novel multivariate technique (partial least squares regression) that accounts for interdependence amongst variables whilst allowing for the inclusion of multiple local and macroscale predictors. We considered intraspecific genetic differentiation including information from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in populations representative of the species’ distribution. We addressed causal hypotheses of heat conservation, temperature‐related development, water and food availability, seasonality, competition and predation. RESULTS: Annual primary productivity and intraspecific competition were of greatest relevance to explain body size variation in females, whilst seasonality of primary productivity was more important in males. Differences between sexes are interpreted based on previous experiments on the behavioural ecology of this species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that sex‐dependent implications of competition for food drive geographical body size variation in an urodele amphibian, supporting the density‐resource hypothesis. Our results suggest that food availability, conspecific density and competition are important in explaining intraspecific body size variation in amphibians. This study highlights how selecting model species with an experimental background can help interpret geographical variation in phenotypic traits. We emphasize the value of simultaneously considering alternative hypotheses of phenotypic variation at different ecological and (phylo)genetic spatio‐temporal scales in revealing potentially hidden relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiologists 3abody size 3afemales 3afood availability 3agenetic factors 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3aheat 3aintraspecific competition 3aleast squares 3amales 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apredation 3aprimary productivity 3asalamanders and newts 3aIberian Peninsula1 aMartínez‐Solano, Iñigo1 aSequeira, Fernando1 aAragón, Pedro0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.2096-2108dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.129933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245004400193300001600237520179900253592002802052650002302080650001302103650000902116650001602125650001502141650002002156650001302176650001002189650001002199651001102209651001102220653002002231653003102251653001702282653001502299653001002314700002302324700002202347700001602369773010402385856011702489852000902606655001202615IND60130912720221119163302.0151127e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013091272DNAL7 a10.1614/0043-1745(2001)049[0202:IOPAIC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassinga, Rafael A.10aInterference of Palmer amaranth in corn  ap. 202-208.  aPalmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) is a major weed in corn (Zea mays) fields in the southern Great Plains of the United States. Field studies were conducted in 1996, 1997, and 1998 near Garden City, KS, to evaluate the effects of Palmer amaranth density and time of emergence on grain yield of irrigated corn and on seed production of Palmer amaranth. Palmer amaranth was established at densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 plants m⁻⁻¹ of corn row both concurrently at corn planting and when corn was at the three- to six-leaf stage. The control plots were weed free. The Palmer amaranth planted with corn emerged with corn, whereas that planted later emerged at the four-, six-, and seven-leaf stages of corn. The Palmer amaranth emerging with corn reduced yield from 11 to 91%% as density increased from 0.5 to 8 plants m⁻⁻¹ of row. In contrast, yield loss from Palmer amaranth emerging later than corn was observed only when the emergence occurred at the four- and six-leaf stages. The corn leaf area index (LAI) decreased as Palmer amaranth density increased. Reduction in corn LAI from Palmer amaranth interference was smaller for the second emergence date than for the first emergence date. Seed production per Palmer amaranth plant decreased with greater density, but seed per unit area increased from 140,000 to 514,000 seeds m⁻⁻² at densities of 0.5 and 8 plants m⁻⁻¹ of row, respectively, when Palmer amaranth emerged with corn and from 1,800 to 91,000 seeds m⁻⁻² at the same densities for later emergence dates. Although Palmer amaranth is highly competitive in corn, this study shows that yield loss is affected more by time of emergence than by density.Nomenclature: Corn, Zea mays L. ‘‘DK 592SR’’; Palmer amaranth, Amaranthus palmeri S.

In recent years, AC has been found in starch-containing foods due to Maillard reaction in a high-temperature process. Therefore, how to mitigate the toxic effect of AC is a research spot. Blumea laciniata is a widely used folk medicine in Asia and the extract from B. laciniata (EBL) exhibited a strong protection on cells against oxidative stress. In this work, we used EBL to protect Hep G2 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans against AC toxicity. As the results turned out, EBL increased cell viability under AC stress and notably reduced the cell apoptosis through decreasing the high level of ROS. Moreover, EBL extended the survival time of C. elegans, while EBL failed to prolong the survival time of mutants that were in Insulin signaling pathway. Besides, the expressions of antioxidant enzymes were activated after the worms were treated with EBL and daf-16 gene was activated. Our results indicated that EBL exhibited a protective effect against AC induced toxicity in Hep G2 cells and C. elegans via Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. These outcomes may provide a promising natural drug to alleviate the toxic effect of AC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumea 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aMaillard reaction 3aacrylamides 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3adrugs 3agenes 3ainsulin 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atoxins 3atraditional medicine 3aAsia 0aBlumea laciniata 0aAcrylamide 0aInsulin-like signaling pathway 0aAC 0aROS 0aFBS 0aDMEM 0aPBS 0aEBL 0aMMP 0aSOD 0aGSH-Px 0aGSH1 aLuo, Siyuan1 aWang, Xiaoju1 aZhou, Yiling1 aZhang, Yuan1 aZhu, Shuai1 aChen, Tao1 aFeng, Shiling1 aYuan, Ming1 aDing, Chunbang0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2021 Dec., v. 158 p.112667-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1126673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245017400166520135100340592002801691650002101719650003501740650001601775650001401791650001101805650001101816650000901827650002201836650001501858650001801873653002001891653001401911653002101925653002101946653002001967700001401987700001502001700001702016700001802033700001502051700005302066700001402119773009202133856008602225852000902311655001202320IND60786110120221119235253.0220816e20230101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078611012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1237602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Qiuyue10aSmartphone readable colorimetry and ICP-MS dual-mode sensing platform for ultrasensitive and label-free detection of Escherichia coli based on filter-assisted separation  aThe development and application of portable and user-friendly biosensing technology for rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria are essential for human and environmental care. In this work, based on the phenomenon that the filter membrane can selectively separate MnO₂ nanosheets (MnO₂ NSs) and Mn²⁺, a novel label-free sensing platform was developed to detect the Escherichia coli (E. coli) using β-galactosidase (β-Gal) as a marker. MnO₂ NSs were utilized as a dual-mode signal molecule of smartphone-based colorimetric analysis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). β-Gal can catalyze the 4-Aminophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside (PAPG) to produce p-aminophenol (PAP), which could reduce MnO₂ NSs to Mn²⁺. After selective separation of MnO₂ NSs and Mn²⁺ by the filter, colorimetric detection was achieved with a smartphone by identifying the RGB value of the MnO₂ NSs coated membrane, while the Mn²⁺ in the filtrate was detected by ICP-MS. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) of E. coli by smartphone-based RGB analysis and ICP-MS were 5.6 × 10³ CFU mL⁻¹ and 35 CFU mL⁻¹, respectively. This method was successfully used for E. coli assay in meat, vegetables, and fruit samples with the advantages of sensitivity, simplicity, and short incubation time (within 1 h).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acolorimetry 3afiltrates 3afruits 3ahumans 3ameat 3amobile telephones 3ananosheets 3arapid methods 0aMnO2 nanosheets 0aDual-mode 0aβ-galactosidase 0aEscherichia coli 0aFilter membrane1 aChen, Xin1 aQi, Liping1 aYang, Haiyan1 aWang, Yanping1 aZhang, Mei1 aHuang, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2681-530X1 aYuan, Xin0 tTalanta.g2023 Jan. 01, v. 251 p.123760-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1237603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012600175300001500301520100700316592002801323650001901351650001601370650001101386650001701397650001301414650003101427650001201458650002301470650001001493650001801503650001901521650001301540650000901553650000701562650001401569650002001583653001901603653001901622653002401641653004001665653002301705700002101728700002001749773010001769856008601869852000901955655001201964IND60525754920221120113134.0190319e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052575492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2015.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDombrowski, Jannika10aMultiscale approach to characterize bulk, surface and foaming behavior of casein micelles as a function of alkalinisation  ap. 92-102.  aCaseins display the major protein fraction in milk, and thus, significantly impact on milk's techno-functional properties such as foaming. As the micellar structure is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic as well as electrostatic forces, a gradual increase in pH value from 6.0 to 11.0 induced pronounced structural modifications. In consequence of alkalinisation, micelle size and composition changed. This had an impact on the solution properties such as turbidity. Furthermore, interfacial characteristics, e.g. surface pressure evolution and surface dilatational properties were affected. Different situations occurred regarding interfacial covering, which was also reflected in the resulting foam structures. The highest foam stability was obtained for pH 9.0. At this pH, highly voluminous casein micelles combined with a considerable amount of serum casein formed maximal viscoelastic surface layers. Micelle dissociation reduced viscoelasticity as well as foam stability, whilst drainage increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinization 3ablood serum 3acasein 3adissociation 3adrainage 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afoaming 3afoaming properties 3afoams 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3amilk 3apH 3aturbidity 3aviscoelasticity 0aCasein micelle 0aAlkalinisation 0aCasein dissociation 0aInterfacial dilatational properties 0aFoaming properties1 aDechau, Johannes1 aKulozik, Ulrich0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2016 June, v. 57 p.92-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2015.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008200175520128700257592002801544650001601572650002401588650001101612650001301623650002801636650001501664650000701679650001201686650001801698650002201716650001101738653001501749653001401764653001801778653001201796700002501808700002201833700002401855773011801879856008601997852000902083655001202092IND60707504120221117051928.0211003e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070750412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1111932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibilisco, Pablo E.10aComposting of seaweed waste: Evaluation on the growth of Sarcocornia perennis  aComposting represents a suitable and cheap method for handling and processing seaweeds accumulated on the coast. Within this framework, two seaweed composts were prepared, one with Undaria pinnatifida accumulated in spring-summer and other with a mixture of seaweeds accumulated in autumn-winter, both from Central Patagonian beaches. The effect of these two composts was evaluated experimentally as an amendment for the growth of Sarcocornia perennis (chickenclaws), a plant species dominating Patagonian salt marshes. Both composts were applied at 75, 50, and 25% doses with perlite. The analysis of the compost properties (phytotoxicity test, C/N, electrical conductivity, pH, and metal content) allowed characterizing both composts as matures and stables. The growth results showed that both composts allow the growth of S. perennis in all doses tested; however, Undaria compost was better in the stimulation of vegetative growth when applied in dose 50%, followed by 75% of both composts. For these reasons, both composts from seaweed waste accumulated on Patagonian coasts could be used in the growth of S. perennis and potentially other plant species, giving value to the seaweeds that currently are considered a waste that disturb these coasts and are discarded without use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcocornia 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3acoasts 3acomposts 3aelectrical conductivity 3amacroalgae 3apH 3aperlite 3aphytotoxicity 3avegetative growth 3awastes 0aComposting 0aPatagonia 0aSeaweed waste 0aUndaria1 aLancelotti, Julio L.1 aNegrin, Vanesa L.1 aIdaszkin, Yanina L.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 274 p.111193-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1111933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008200166300001600248520096000264592002801224650002201252650001201274650001101286650004101297650001101338650001901349650001001368650001401378650001201392650001201404650002001416650000901436650001301445650002301458653002501481653000901506653001201515653000901527653001101536653001201547653002201559653001701581653001301598700002101611700001801632700002501650700002301675773010001698856008701798852000901885655001201894IND60566736720221117183041.0190402e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056673672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xuan10aEvaluation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in foods, with an emphasis on rice flavour  ap. 531-544.  aThe popcorn-like aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) is a key contributor to the desirable aroma of fragrant rice and is also important in the aroma of other foods, such as pandan leaf, popcorn and Mediterranean sausage. It can be formed enzymatically in the rice grain as it grows and is also formed, as part of the Maillard reaction, when rice is heated. This review examines the formation of 2-AP in rice and other foods, particularly its formation during cooking, focusing on the importance of the Maillard reaction between reducing sugar breakdown products and 1-pyrroline derived from the amino acids proline and ornithine. The synthesis of 2-AP is discussed alongside the attempts that have been made to stabilise this relatively unstable compound. The analysis of 2-AP by instrumental techniques, particularly gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry, alongside the use of sensory studies, is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3acooking 3aflavor 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aleaves 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aornithine 3apopcorn 3aproline 3areducing sugars 3arice 3asausages 3asensory evaluation 0a2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline 0a2-AP 0aFlavour 0aRice 0aPandan 0aPopcorn 0aMaillard reaction 0aBiosynthesis 0aAnalysis1 aHandoko, Dody D.1 aPather, Leela1 aMethven, L.q(Lisa),1 aElmore, J.

In this study, the unique chemical traits of the complex volatile fraction of extra-virgin olive oils from Italian production are captured by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry and explored by pattern recognition algorithms. The consistent realignment of untargeted and targeted features of over 73 samples, including oils obtained by different olive cultivars (n = 24), harvest years (n = 3), and processing technologies, provides a solid foundation for sample identification and discrimination based on production region (n = 6). Through a dedicated multivariate statistics workflow, identitation is achieved by two-level partial least-square (PLS) regression, which highlights region diagnostic patterns accounting between 58 and 82 of untargeted and targeted compounds, while sample classification is performed by sequential application of soft independent modeling for class analogy (SIMCA) models, one for each production region. Samples are correctly classified in five of the six single-class models, and quality parameters [i.e., sensitivity, specificity, precision, efficiency, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)] are equal to 1.00.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3acultivars 3afood chemistry 3amass spectrometry 3aolives 3aproduct authenticity 0aextra-virgin olive oil 0acombined untargeted and targeted (UT) fingerprinting 0aidentitation and authentication 0ageographical origin1 aJiménez-Carvelo, Ana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9061-16861 aLiberto, Erica1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6675-85171 aBicchi, Carlo1 aReichenbach, Stephen E.1 aCuadros-Rodríguez, Luis1 aCordero, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3201-07750 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 July 28, v. 69, no. 31 p.8874-8889dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c029813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245017600198300001800374500001900392500002000411520162200431592002802053650001202081650001002093650002802103650001602131650002102147650001302168650002002181650001302201650001302214650001202227700001802239700002502257700001802282700002202300700006202322700006002384700002102444773013502465856007202600852000902672655001202681IND60738339720221122224009.0210524e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073833972DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.39152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPage, Kathryn L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8994-656110aReview of crop‐specific tolerance limits to acidity, salinity, and sodicity for seventeen cereal, pulse, and oilseed crops common to rainfed subtropical cropping systems  ap. 2459-2480.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil constraints limit crop water and nutrient extraction and lead to yield loss globally. In rainfed agriculture, the selection of crop species more likely to yield well under constrained conditions is an important management tool. However, information on the most appropriate crops is often difficult to access due to its publication in a wide range of disparate sources and the various measures of crop tolerance used. This study aimed to improve our ability to identify crops for constrained areas in rainfed subtropical cropping systems by compiling published information that had assessed the grain yield response to acidic, saline, or sodic conditions of 17 cereal, pulse, and oilseed crops. This information was used to develop a 'traffic light' system for salinity and acidity to provide guidance on when soil pH or the electrical conductivity of a saturated soil extract (ECₑ) is likely to be 'good', 'potentially limiting', or 'poor' for grain yield. Crops were also ranked according to their likely ability to yield well under saline, acidic, or sodic conditions. For all crops, the point at which grain yield was affected by soil constraints was variable and there was often only a small amount of published information available to help guide the identification of tolerance limits and rankings, particularly for sodicity. Many studies were also conducted under experimental conditions that differed from rainfed farming, which can affect the transferability of results. Confidence in the tolerance limits and rankings is thus only moderate and further work is required to confirm their applicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acrops 3aelectrical conductivity 3agrain yield 3aland degradation 3aoilseeds 3arainfed farming 3asalinity 3asodicity 3asoil pH1 aDang, Yash P.1 aMartínez, Cristina,1 aDalal, Ram C.1 aWehr, J.

This study attempts to evaluate threat status of forest ecosystems by determining regional-level hot spots of deforestation, fragmentation and fires in Myanmar. The states of Ayeyarwady, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw have the highest annual rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2016. There is a significant reduction in spatial extent of large core forest. Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw had shown more than 20% of loss in large core forest from 2005 to 2016. Geospatial analysis indicates all the major forest types were affected by fires during 2003 to 2017. The study found that dry deciduous forests were highly affected by fires. More than 60% of the forest area of Magway, Mandalay, Chin, Kayah, Kayin and Shan had found to be under forest fire hot spot. Comparative spatial assessment was carried out on fire hot spots, deforested and fragmented landscapes to provide overview of priority conservation areas. The study identified five states in Myanmar affected by multiple threats and categorised as Conservation Priority Hot Spot I, eight states as Conservation Priority Hot Spot II and two states as low-risk areas categorised as Conservation Priority Hot Spot III. The analysis of hot spots of deforestation, fragmentation and fires provides a consistent way of ecosystem monitoring and biodiversity conservation in Myanmar. The study demonstrates repeatable earth observations as an important prerequisite for sustainable forest management in Myanmar.  aPublisher supplied data  a2011cIndian Space Research Organisation 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aconservation areas 3adeciduous forests 3adeforestation 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest fires 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3amonitoring 3aprioritization 3aremote sensing 3asustainable forestry 3aMyanmar1 aUnnikrishnan, Anjaly1 aAsra, Mahbooba1 aMaya Manikandan, T.1 aJaishanker, R.0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2019 Oct., v. 47, no. 10 p.1737-1749dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-019-01025-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010900169520194900278592002802227650001902255650001302274650001302287650002102300650002302321650001102344650002002355650001102375650001402386650001102400650002602411650001002437651001002447651001702457651001802474651001702492653001902509653001202528653001802540653002402558653003102582700001902613700001202632700001602644700001202660700001902672700001502691700002002706700001402726773011802740856008602858852000902944655001202953IND60707504220221117051257.0211003e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070750422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1111972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiaojuan10aUsing stable nitrogen and oxygen isotopes to identify nitrate sources in the Lancang River, upper Mekong  aThe Lancang River in China is the headwater of the Mekong River. The impacts of reservoirs on the water, sediment and nutrient trapping in the Lancang River have attracted considerable attention, both locally and abroad. In this research, watershed-scale nitrogen load and nitrate sources along the Lancang River upstream in free-flowing reaches (FFRs) and downstream regulated reaches (RRs) were analyzed using stable nitrogen and oxygen isotopes. The results showed that the nitrogen nutrient (TN, NO₃⁻ and NH₄⁺) concentration increased from upstream to downstream along the Lancang River, and the highest values come from large-scale urban samples rather than the reservoirs. Compared to other large rivers in China, such as the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Yalu Tsangpo River, nitrogen nutrient content in the Lancang River is at low level. The nitrate concentration ranged from 0.14 mg/L to 0.63mg/Land increased significantly downstream. The isotopic values ranged from 2.8‰ to 5.2‰ for δ¹⁵N–NO₃⁻ and from 4‰ to 8.5‰ for δ¹⁸O–NO₃⁻ along the river, and the δ¹⁵N–NO₃⁻ value rose significantly downstream. According to the nitrogen and oxygen isotope approach, soil organic nitrogen mineralization was the main source of the nitrate with an average of 51% contribution; domestic sewage was the second largest contributor with an average of 33% but increase downstream, likely due to the significantly larger population in the downstream region. Furthermore, the nitrate concentration decreased and δ¹⁵N- and δ¹⁸O–NO₃⁻ enriched in the Nuozhadu reservoir, indicating that the reservoir may enhance nitrate consumption and reduce nitrogen pollution to downstream reaches. The results provide a perspective of nitrogen nutrient for the trans-border river management and more insight researches are called for understanding the controversial nutrient transport topic in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3amineralization 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrient transport 3aoxygen 3aoxygen isotopes 3arivers 3asediments 3asewage 3asoil organic nitrogen 3awater 3aChina 3aMekong River 3aYangtze River 3aYellow River 0aIsotope tracer 0aNitrate 0aLancang river 0aSource contribution 0aReservoir retention effect1 aTang, Yongchun1 aXu, You1 aZhang, Sisi1 aMa, Jun1 aXiao, Shangbin1 aJi, Daobin1 aYang, Zhengjian1 aLiu, Defu0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 274 p.111197-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1111973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245013000172300001800302520101700320592002801337650001601365650002101381650003501402650002401437650001701461650001501478650000901493650001901502650001301521650001901534650001701553650001101570650002201581700001201603700001901615700001401634700001401648700001701662700001301679700001601692700001301708700001401721700001301735700001701748773008701765856009001852852000901942655001201951IND60090377620221121230551.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009037762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Peng10aFolic acid-conjugated Silica-modified gold nanorods for X-ray/CT imaging-guided dual-mode radiation and photo-thermal therapy  ap. 9796-9809.  aMultifunctional nanoprobes are designed to own various functions such as tumor targeting, imaging and selective therapy, which offer great promise for the future of cancer prevention, diagnosis, imaging and treatment. Herein, silica was applied to replace cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) molecules on the surface of gold nanorods (GNRs) by the classic Stöber method, thus eliminating their cytotoxicity and improving their biocompatibility. Folic acid molecule was covalently anchored on the surface of GNRs with silane coupling agent. The resultant folic acid-conjugated silica-modified GNRs show highly selective targeting, enhanced radiation therapy (RT) and photo-thermal therapy (PTT) effects on MGC803 gastric cancer cells, and also exhibited strong X-ray attenuation for in vivo X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging. In conclusion, the as-prepared nanoprobe is a good candidate with excellent imaging and targeting ability for X-ray/CT imaging-guided targeting dual-mode enhanced RT and PTT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abiocompatibility 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acomputed tomography 3acytotoxicity 3afolic acid 3agold 3aimage analysis 3ananorods 3aneoplasm cells 3aradiotherapy 3asilica 3astomach neoplasms1 aBao, Le1 aZhang, Chunlei1 aLin, Jing1 aLuo, Teng1 aYang, Dapeng1 aHe, Meng1 aLi, Zhiming1 aGao, Guo1 aGao, Bing1 aFu, Shen1 aCui, Daxiang0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Dec., v. 32, no. 36 p.9796-9809dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245010100202520137800303592002801681650005001709650001601759650002101775650001501796650001701811650001101828650001401839650001501853650002001868653001901888653002401907653002301931653002001954653000801974653000901982653001001991653000902001653000902010653000802019653000902027653000802036653000802044653000802052653000902060653000802069653000802077653000902085653001102094653000902105653000802114653000902122653001002131653000902141653000902150653000802159700006102167700005902228700005902287700002202346700002202368773011202390856008202502852000902584655001202593IND60756478920221122042503.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075647892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2021.1126702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLouie, Fian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6419-162212aA comparative evaluation of dietary exposure to glyphosate resulting from recommended U.S. diets  aSince its commercial introduction in 1974, national and international regulatory agencies have consistently reported no human health concerns associated with the herbicide glyphosate when used according to label directions. However, in 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. Despite IARC being the sole outlier in its conclusion, dietary exposure to glyphosate remains a health concern to some members of the public. While glyphosate residues have been detected in foods, it is unclear whether a specific eating pattern substantially contributes to glyphosate exposure. Therefore, dietary glyphosate intake was determined for three eating patterns recommended in the U.S. The 95th percentile of glyphosate ingestion at 2,000 calories/day for adults for the U.S.-Style, Mediterranean-Style, and Vegetarian eating patterns ranged from 38 to 960, 39 to 1100, and 39 to 880 μg/day, respectively. No significant differences were observed in glyphosate intake between the dietary styles, and the 95th percentile glyphosate intakes were well below the current U.S. EPA chronic oral reference dose (RfD) of 0.1 mg/kg/day. Our data demonstrate that ingestion of certain high residue foods, particularly grains and legumes, is a driver of total dietary glyphosate body burden regardless of dietary style.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3acarcinogens 3adietary exposure 3aglyphosate 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aingestion 3atoxicology 3avegetarian diet 0aDietary styles 0aExposure assessment 0aPesticide residues 0aRisk assessment 0aADI 0aARfD 0aATSDR 0aECHA 0aEFSA 0aEPA 0aEPSP 0aFAO 0aFDA 0aHHS 0aIARC 0aMRL 0aNCI 0aNOEL 0aNHANES 0aNSRL 0aRfD 0aOECD 0aOEHHA 0aPMRA 0aUSDA 0aWHO1 aJacobs, Neva F.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3757-04671 aYang, Lisa G.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8288-53451 aPark, Catherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1678-70581 aMonnot, Andrew D.1 aBandara, Suren B.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2021 Dec., v. 158 p.112670-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1126703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012700174520181000301592002802111650001802139650000802157650002302165650001802188650001602206650001702222650003102239650001102270650001602281650001602297650001702313650001902330650001802349650001002367650001602377650001402393650001702407650001402424650002202438650001602460650002002476650001502496653002302511653003002534653002002564700002402584700001702608700003002625700003002655700006702685700006702752700006702819773009502886856008202981852000903063655001203072IND60756479020221120065538.0211219e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075647902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales-Rubio, Russell10aPM2.5 induces airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation via the AhR pathway in a sensitized Guinea pig asthma-like model  aExposure to fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) induces airway inflammation and hyperreactivity that lead to asthma. The mechanisms involved are still under investigation. We investigated the effect of resveratrol (3,4’,5-trihydroxystilbene) (RES) on airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and CYP1A1 protein expression (an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) target) induced by PM₂.₅ exposure in an allergic asthma experimental guinea pig model. The polyphenolic compound RES was used due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and as an antagonist of the AhR; thus, providing mechanistic insights.Animals were sensitized with aluminum hydroxide and ovalbumin and exposed to filtered air or PM₂.₅. Exposure to PM₂.₅ was conducted using a whole-body chamber particle concentrator (5 h/day) for 15 days. Animals received saline solution or RES (10 mg/kg per day) orally for 21 days simultaneously to the OVA challenge or PM₂.₅ exposure.PM₂.₅ exposure (mean 433 ± 111 μg/m³ in the exposure chamber) in OVA challenged animals induced an asthma-like phenotype characterized by increased baseline lung resistance (Rrs) and central airway resistance (Rn) in response to acetylcholine (ACh) evaluated using a flexiVent system®. A parallel increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-γ), inflammatory cells (eosinophils and neutrophils) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung CYP1A1 increase also occurred. RES significantly inhibited airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation, and CYP1A1 protein expression in the OVA-challenged PM₂.₅ exposed animals.In summary, with the use of RES we demonstrate that PM-induced airway hyperreactivity is modulated by the inflammatory response via the AhR pathway in an allergic asthma guinea pig model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aair 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3aantioxidants 3aaryl hydrocarbon receptors 3aasthma 3aeosinophils 3aguinea pigs 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-6 3alungs 3aneutrophils 3aovalbumin 3aparticulates 3aphenotype 3aprotein synthesis 3aresveratrol 3asodium chloride 3atoxicology 0aParticulate matter 0aAryl hydrocarbon receptor 0aHyperreactivity1 aAmador-Muñoz, Omar1 aRosas, Irma,1 aSánchez-Pérez, Yesennia1 aGarcía-Cuéllar, Claudia1 aSegura-Medina, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5562-17151 aOsornio-Vargas, Álvaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8287-71021 aDe Vizcaya-Ruiz, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2097-04640 tToxicology.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 465 p.153026-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245018900176300001600365520148800381592002801869650001601897650001401913650001201927650003501939650001301974650002001987650003902007650004302046650002002089650001302109650002402122650001402146650002002160650001402180650002502194653002902219653002702248653003402275653003702309653003402346700002302380700003002403700002702433700002802460700002202488773010002510856008702610852000902697655001202706IND60566736920221117183048.0190402e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056673692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaucedo-Velez, A.A.10aSpeciation analysis of organoarsenic compounds in livestock feed by microwave-assisted extraction and high performance liquid chromatography coupled to atomic fluorescence spectrometry  ap. 493-500.  aThe development of a new method to determine the presence of the organoarsenic additives p-arsanilic acid (ASA), roxarsone (ROX) and nitarsone (NIT) in livestock feeds by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet oxidation hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HPLC-UV/HG-AFS) after microwave assisted extraction (MAE) was proposed. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C18 column with 2% acetic acid/methanol (96:4, v/v) as the mobile phase. The limits of detection (LODs) were 0.13, 0.09 and 0.08mgL−1, and the limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.44, 0.30 and 0.28mgL−1. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for ASA, ROX and NIT determined from five measurements of the mixed calibration standard were 3.3, 5.3, and 5.4%, respectively.MAE extraction of phenylated arsenic compounds using 1.5M H3PO4 at 120°C for 45min allowed for maximum recoveries (%) of total arsenic (As) and organoarsenic species, with no degradation of these compounds. The extraction of total As was approximately 97%, and the As species recoveries were between 95.2 and 97.0%. The results of the analysis were validated using mass balance by comparing the sum of extracted As with the total concentration of As in the corresponding samples. The method was successfully applied to determine the presence of these compounds in feed samples. ASA was the only As species detected in chicken feed samples, with a concentration between 0.72 and 12.91mgkg−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadditives 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achickens 3adetection limit 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alivestock feeds 3amethanol 3amicrowave treatment 3aoxidation 3aphosphoric acid 3aroxarsone 3astatistical analysis 0aPhenyl arsenic compounds 0aLivestock feed samples 0aMicrowave assisted extraction 0aAtomic fluorescence spectrometry 0aReversed phase chromatography1 aHinojosa-Reyes, L.1 aVillanueva-Rodríguez, M.1 aCaballero-Quintero, A.1 aHernández-Ramírez, A.1 aGuzmán-Mar, J.L.0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 232 p.493-500dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245011000182520097000292592002801262650001901290650001901309650001201328650002601340650002601366650002001392650001501412650001901427650000901446650001701455650002101472650002301493650001601516650001401532653001901546653001201565653001201577653001201589653002101601700003101622700003701653700002501690700002601715700003101741700005001772773011001822856008601932852000902018655001202027IND60697741920221122201813.0211106e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069774192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.1078772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito de Oliveira, Tássio10aEffects of multiple climate change factors on exoenzyme activities and CO2 efflux in a tropical grassland  aClimate change is expected to affect rainfall dynamics and the global average temperature. Here, we evaluated the effects of those changes, the intense water deficit and warming (+2 °C), on a tropical grassland soil. We tested the correlation between soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) and soil respiration (CO₂ efflux) and temperature and soil water content (SWC). A climate change simulation was performed in a field experiment using a temperature free-air-controlled enhancement facility. SWC was the main driver of changes in EEA. The most affected enzymes were β-glucosidase, xylanase and phosphatase. As SWC declined, the potential activity of β-glucosidase and xylanase decreased, while the activity of phosphatase and CO₂ efflux increased (P < 0.01). Thus, intense drought periods are likely to have a greater influence on the rates of decomposition and mineralization in the evaluated soil than is the 2 °C increase in mean temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aextracellular enzymes 3afield experimentation 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3amineralization 3arain 3asoil enzymes 3asoil respiration 3asoil water content 3atemperature 3axylanases 0aClimate change 0aDrought 0aWarming 0aEnzymes 0aSoil respiration1 ade Lucas, Rosymar Coutinho1 aScarcella, Ana Silvia de Almeida1 aContato, Alex Graça1 aPasin, Thiago Machado1 aMartínez, Carlos Alberto,1 aPolizeli, Maria de Lourdes Teixeira de Moraes0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 148 p.107877-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.1078773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011500174520132400289592002801613650002801641650001201669650001401681650002301695650001401718650001201732650002901744650002501773650001901798650001301817650001701830650002201847650001401869653002101883653001401904653001201918653002001930653001401950653001401964653001601978653001801994700001902012700002002031773010602051856008502157852000902242655001202251IND60715024420221120061402.0220110e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071502442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2020.1266272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Lalit Kumar10aAttenuation of Acinetobacter baumannii virulence by inhibition of polyphosphate kinase 1 with repurposed drugs  aAcinetobacter baumannii is clinically one of the most significant pathogens, especially in intensive care settings, because of its multidrug-resistance (MDR). Repurposing of high-affinity drugs is a faster and more plausible approach for combating the emergence of MDR and to tackle bacterial infections. This study was aimed to evaluate the approved drugs potentially inhibiting A. baumannii PPK1 (AbPPK1) mediated synthesis of polyphosphates (polyP). Based on virtual screening, molecular dynamic simulation, and CD spectroscopy for thermal stability, two stable ligands, etoposide and genistein, were found with promising contours for further investigation. Following in vitro inhibition of AbPPK1, the efficacy of selected drugs was further tested against virulence traits of A. baumannii. These drugs significantly reduced the biofilm formation, surface motility in A. baumannii and led to decreased survival under desiccation. In addition to inhibition of PPK1, both drugs increased the expression of polyP degrading enzyme, exopolyphosphatase (PPX), that might be responsible for the decrease in the total cellular polyP. Since polyP modulates the virulence factors in bacteria, destabilization of the polyP pool by these drugs seems particularly striking for their therapeutic applications against A. baumannii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3abiofilm 3aetoposide 3aexopolyphosphatase 3agenistein 3aligands 3amultiple drug resistance 3apolyphosphate kinase 3apolyphosphates 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3athermal stability 3avirulence 0aRepurposed drugs 0avirulence 0abiofilm 0aPPK1 inhibition 0agenistein 0aetoposide 0adesiccation 0aMD Simulation1 aSharma, Prince1 aCapalash, Neena0 tMicrobiological research.g2021 Jan., v. 242 p.126627-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2020.1266273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005200139245014300191300001600334500001900350500002000369520126200389592002801651596009501679650002601774650001601800650002101816650001801837650002001855650001601875650000901891650001401900650001301914650002301927650001701950650001201967650001101979650001601990700005502006700001802061700005302079773012102132856007302253852000902326655001202335IND60738340220221121042820.0210524e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073834022DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.132152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yubo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7906-151310aTaurine supplementation increases the potential of fishmeal replacement by soybean meal in diets for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides  ap. 691-699.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effects of replacing dietary fishmeal by soybean meal with taurine supplementation on feed intake, growth, feed utilization, body composition and waste output of largemouth bass were examined. A control diet (C) contained 400 g/kg fishmeal, 20%, 40% and 60% of fishmeal in diet C was replaced by soybean meal, with or without 5 g/kg taurine supplementation (abbreviated as S20 + T, S40 + T, S60 + T, S20, S40 and S60, respectively). Significantly lower weight gain was found in fish fed diet S60 compared with fish fed diet C (p < 0.05), while no significant difference was found in weight gain between fish fed diet C and fish fed diets S20, S20 + T, S40 + T and S60 + T (p > 0.05). No statistically differences were found in feed intake and feed conversion ratio between fish fed diet C and fish fed diets S20, S20 + T, S40, S40 + T and S60 + T (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found in nitrogen retention efficiency, body crude protein content and nitrogen waste among fish fed different test diets (p > 0.05). This study suggests that dietary fishmeal level for largemouth bass can be reduced to 240 g/kg and further reduced to 160 g/kg with taurine addition, with soybean meal used as a fishmeal substitute.  aPublisher supplied data  aLGN19C190007cPublic Welfare Project of Science Technology Department of Zhejiang Province 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aaquaculture 3abody composition 3acrude protein 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afish 3afish meal 3anitrogen 3anitrogen retention 3asoybean meal 3ataurine 3awastes 3aweight gain1 aMa, Hengjia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8034-71641 aWang, Xiujuan1 aRen, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1111-31930 tAquaculture nutrition.g2021 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.691-699dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.132153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015500172520151300327592002801840650005801868650002901926650002201955650001101977650001501988650001702003651001002020653001702030653002902047653002902076653002602105653002002131700001702151700001902168700001602187700001902203773011802222856008602340852000902426655001202435IND60707504720221117055844.0211003e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070750472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasmeen, Humaira10aExploring the impact of technological innovation, environmental regulations and urbanization on ecological efficiency of China in the context of COP21  aThe objective of this study was to explore the roles of technological innovation, environmental regulations, and urbanization in ecological efficiency within the context of the 2015 Paris agreement. Initially, the study employed the super-efficiency DEA model to estimate the ecological efficiencies of 30 regions in China. Following this, the system GMM method was used to explore the impacts of technological innovation, environmental regulations, and urbanization on ecological efficiency. We used annual data from 2008 to 2018. The results indicate that, in terms of ecological efficiency, the eastern region was the highest ranked, followed by central and western regions, respectively. The urbanization index has a negative impact on ecological efficiency at a national level. However, in the context of regions, it is positively significant in the eastern region, while the results in the central and western regions are insignificant. The influence of technological innovation on ecological efficiency is found to be significantly positive at both national and regional levels. It is generally perceived that environmental regulations are pivotal for sustainability. Our results verify this argument and indicate that environmental regulations have a positive impact on ecological efficiency in the central and eastern regions. However, their impact is found to be negative in the western region. Policy suggestions are discussed, in order to further strengthen environmental laws and sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aenvironmental management 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3atechnology 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aUrbanization 0aTechnological innovation 0aEnvironmental regulation 0aEcological efficiency 0aParis agreement1 aTan, Qingmei1 aZameer, Hashim1 aTan, Junlan1 aNawaz, Kishwar0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 274 p.111210-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167500001400288520147100302592002801773650002301801650001601824650002501840650002301865650001401888650001401902650001101916650002101927650001701948650001501965650000901980650003701989650001902026650002202045650002402067650001702091650002002108650002902128653002302157653001402180653001102194653001002205653000902215653001002224653000902234653001102243653000702254653001002261653001002271700001502281700005502296773009402351856008502445852000902530655001202539IND60715024620221120061346.0210121e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071502462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Yun-Mi10aOleanolic acid protects against mast cell-mediated allergic responses by suppressing Akt/NF-κB and STAT1 activation  aNAL-light  aOleanolic acid (OA) is an active compound found in a variety of medicinal herbs and plants. Though OA has been widely attributed with a variety of biological activities, studies focused on its anti-allergic inflammation properties are insufficient.Given the rapid increase in allergic diseases and the lack of fundamental treatment options, this study aimed to find a safe and effective therapy for allergic disorders.We evaluated the inhibitory effect of OA on allergic inflammatory response and the possible mechanisms underlying the effect using phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187 (PMACI)-stimulated human mast cell (HMC)-1, and a mouse model of compound 48/80-induced anaphylactic shock.OA suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions in PMACI-induced HMC-1 cells by inhibiting activation of the Akt, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 signaling pathways. Moreover, OA showed a protective effect against compound 48/80-induced anaphylactic shock through inhibition of histamine release and immunoglobulin E level via regulation of NF-κB and STAT1 activation.The results showed that OA suppressed mast cell-mediated allergic response by transcriptional regulation. We suggest that OA has potential effect against allergic inflammatory disorders, including anaphylaxis, and might be a useful therapeutic agent for allergic disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aanaphylaxis 3aanti-allergic agents 3acalcium ionophores 3acytokines 3ahistamine 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainflammation 3amast cells 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoleanolic acid 3aprotective effect 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics) 0aAllergic responses 0aMast cell 0aNF-κB 0aSTAT1 0aDSCG 0aHMC-1 0aMAPK 0aNF-κB 0aOA 0aPMACI 0aSTAT11 aLee, Minho1 aAn, Hyo-Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2937-874X0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Jan., v. 80 p.153340-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014500168520156300313592002801876650001201904650002401916650003101940650002901971650001502000650001002015651001002025653001902035653002102054653002702075653002502102700001702127773011802144856008602262852000902348655001202357IND60707504820221117051920.0211003e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070750482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Chenshuo10aEffect of terrain relief on the transport cost on road of biomass raw materials: Energy conservation study of 9 cities and counties in China  aTransport cost on road is an important limiting factor in the development of biomass energy. At present, transport cost on road is typically calculated using the average slope derived from the elevational difference between two points on a 2D road network, but this method ignores terrain relief, which is an important factor that influences road slope and vehicle fuel consumption. This study explores the effect of terrain relief on transport cost on road to provide data support for the optimization of transportation routes for biomass raw materials. By setting sample points at different intervals along a transportation route to accommodate different reliefs, the results showed that terrain relief was positively correlated with the unit distance transport cost on road by truck of biomass raw materials. When the sample interval was less than 500 m, the unit distance transport cost on road decreased rapidly with an increase in sample interval, and the rate of decline in hilly areas was greater than that in plains areas. When the sample interval was greater than 500 m, the unit distance transport cost on road decreased slowly and approached a stable level as the sample interval increased. In hilly areas, the transport cost on road of biomass raw materials and the relief effect were greater than those in plains areas. Therefore, when calculating the transport cost on road of biomass raw materials, we recommend using sample intervals less than 500 m to achieve a more accurate calculation and maintain a relatively small calculation load.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental management 3alandscapes 3aroads 3aChina 0aTerrain relief 0aBiomass material 0aTransport cost on road 0aTransportation route1 aZhang, Yifei0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 274 p.111212-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013500170500001900305520090600324592002801230650001601258650001101274650002301285650001701308650001901325650001401344650001501358650001001373650001201383650001101395653001701406653001701423653001701440700001801457700002401475700002101499773010601520856008701626852000901713655001201722IND60718248320221121081334.0201213e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071824832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Saumya10aProcess scale-up of an efficient acid-catalyzed steam pretreatment of rice straw for xylitol production by C.

Neutralization with barium hydroxide produced insoluble salt and noticeably reduced HMF and furfurals. Xylitol yield of 0.6 g/g of xylose, was achieved by fermenting rice straw hydrolysate medium with C. tropicalis MTCC 6192. This two-step process of production of xylitol from xylose rich hydrolysate is much simpler and produced minimal inhibitors including organic acids such as acetic acid. This process is modified for upscaling at optimized parameters and will simultaneously minimize the pollution problem caused by rice straw and is also promising for commercial scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3abarium 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrolysates 3aneutralization 3apollution 3arice straw 3asteam 3axylitol 3axylose 0aPretreatment 0aFermentation 0aMass balance1 aKaur, Dalveer1 aYadav, Sudesh Kumar1 aKrishania, Meena0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Jan., v. 320 p.124422-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009800165300001800263500001100281520137700292592002801669596004601697650001301743650001201756650001901768650002101787650001801808650002201826650002001848650002001868700001901888700005901907773012401966856008202090852000902172655001202181IND60746897420221120031315.0210806e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074689742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-06512-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthar, Teeba10aRecent advances on drug development and emerging therapeutic agents for Alzheimer’s disease  ap. 5629-5645.  aReview  aAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative old age disease that is complex, multifactorial, unalterable, and progressive in nature. The currently approved therapy includes cholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA-receptor antagonists and their combination therapy provides only temporary symptomatic relief. Sincere efforts have been made by the researchers globally to identify new targets, discover, and develop novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD. This brief review article is intended to cover the recent advances in drug development and emerging therapeutic agents for AD acting at different targets. The article is compiled using various scientific online databases and by referring to clinicaltrials.gov and ALZFORUM (alzforum.org) websites. The upcoming therapies act on one or more targets including amyloids (secretases, Aβ₄₂ production, amyloid deposition, and immunotherapy), tau proteins (tau phosphorylation/aggregation and immunotherapy) and neuroinflammation in addition to other miscellaneous targets. Despite the tremendous improvement in our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of AD, only aducanumab was approved by FDA for the treatment of AD in 18 years i.e., since 2003. Hence, it is concluded that novel therapeutic strategies are required to discover and develop therapeutic agents to fight against the century old AD.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGP/HSS/19/232/2019cThe Research Council 3aInternet 3aamyloid 3acholinesterase 3adrug development 3aimmunotherapy 3amolecular biology 3apathophysiology 3aphosphorylation1 aAl Balushi, K.1 aKhan, Shah Alam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0729-34030 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 July, v. 48, no. 7 p.5629-5645dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06512-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009600211300001600307520163200323592002801955650001601983650002301999650001602022650001202038650001302050650001302063650001702076650003102093650001302124650001802137650002102155650001902176650001102195650001802206650002102224650000702245650002702252650001402279650002702293653002002320653002202340653001702362653002302379700001702402773010002419856008602519852000902605655001202614IND60525755620221120122841.0190319e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052575562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2015.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Shing-Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2669-757410aEffect of trisodium citrate on swelling property and structure of cationic starch thin film  ap. 254-265.  aEffects of trisodium citrate (citrate), as an ionic crosslinker of cationic starch (CS), on swelling property of citrate-CS thin film immersing into various pH solutions were studied. The maximal turbidity of film forming solutions (FFS) indicates the most extensive ionic crosslinking of citrate to CS occurring at charge ratio (R) = 3 instead of the charge neutrality point (R = 1) due to the co-existence of electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding. The CS FFS is composed of leached amylose and unbursted swollen granules mainly occupied by amylopectin. Proved by the rheological properties of citrate-CS FFS and the microscopic images of citrate-CS thin films during swelling studies, citrate governs the pH-dependent swelling behavior within the unbursted swollen granule via ionic crosslinking either in solution or in thin films. Besides, the ionic crosslinking from citrate is able to decrease the surface hydrophilicity of CS thin film by hindering the exposure of cationic group. The small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns of swollen citrate-CS thin films are well fitted by employing the correlation length model. The rise of the exponent in low q region (n) is found to be correlated with the presence of deprotonated citrate induced aggregates, constructing a strong network against osmotic pressure, thus leading to a low water retention capacity of the thin film. Proposed nano-structure inside swollen granule from SAXS can explain the results of swelling test and microscopic images. The citrate-CS thin film can potentially serve as an active coating for pH-triggered releasing of active compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aactive ingredients 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acitrates 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agranules 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3aosmotic pressure 3apH 3arheological properties 3aturbidity 3awater holding capacity 0aCationic starch 0aTrisodium citrate 0apH-sensitive 0aIonic crosslinking1 aLai, Hsi-Mei0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2016 May, v. 56 p.254-265dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2015.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011300173300001800286520191400304592002802218596004002246596003602286650002802322650002502350650001702375650001602392650001302408650002902421650001802450650002302468650001002491650002202501650001302523650002002536650002502556650002802581650001702609700002702626700001902653773012402672856008202796852000902878655001202887IND60746897520221120031304.0210806e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074689752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-06576-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetayesh-Mehr, Zahra10aEvaluation of the in vivo antihypertensive effect and antioxidant activity of HL-7 and HL-10 peptide in mice  ap. 5571-5578.  aBACKGROUND: The tendency to use bioactive peptides has increased in recent decades, and research would be essential for recognizing the therapeutic effects of peptides present in animals or food resource. In this study, the in vivo antioxidant and antihypertensive properties of peptides HL-7 with the sequence of YLYELR and HL-10 with the sequence of AFPYYGHHLG were identified from scorpion venom of H. lepturus were evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: To study the in vivo effects of peptides, D-galactose-induced and DOCA salt-induced mice models were used. The results of the antioxidant assay for both peptides showed that the activity of serum and liver catalase (CAT), as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes, was significantly decreased in the D-galactose-induced group (NC), while MDA levels were increased in serum and the liver tissue samples (p < 0.01). Compared with the D-galactose-induced mice, the peptide treated mice group had a higher activity of antioxidant enzymes namely CAT and SOD, as well as a lower lipid peroxidation level. Also, the results of antihypertensive activity for both peptides showed that systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the mice treated with the HL-7 and HL-10 peptides were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). The administration of the HL-7 peptide at doses of 2 mg/kg BW (LP1), 5 mg/kg BW (-IP1) and 15 mg/kg BW (HP1) significantly diminished the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 11 mmHg, 31 mmHg and 40.47 mmHg, respectively. Accordingly, treatment of mice with the HL-10 peptide at doses of 2 mg/kg BW (LP2), 5 mg/kg BW (IP2) and 15 mg/kg BW (HP2) considerably lowered the MAP by 8 mmHg, 18.3 mmHg and 21.93 mmHg, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that both the HL-7 and HL-10 peptides could be potentially utilized as antihypertensive and antioxidant components.  aPublisher supplied data  aUOZ-GR-9718-96cUniversity of Zabol  a1399/07/28cUniversity of Zabol 3aantihypertensive effect 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3adiastolic blood pressure 3adose response 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amolecular biology 3apeptides 3ascorpion venoms 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asystolic blood pressure 3atherapeutics1 aGhasemi, Leila Vafadar1 aAsoodeh, Ahmad0 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 July, v. 48, no. 7 p.5571-5578dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06576-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01531naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012100160300002000281520042200301592002800723650001700751650002300768650002200791650001400813650002200827700002000849700002200869700001800891700002000909700001900929700002600948773012400974856007401098852000901172655001201181IND60667016720221120051410.0190919e20150206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066701672DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra12021c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujita, Hideaki10aComprehensive chemical secretory measurement of single cells trapped in a micro-droplet array with mass spectrometry  ap. 16968-16971.  aSecretomics, the comprehensive study of cell releasates, offers a non-invasive approach to understanding cell heterogeneity.

In one of the most well-studied examples, the spermatozoa of all mammalian species must undergo a series of physiological changes as they transit the male (epididymal maturation) and female (capacitation) reproductive tracts prior to realizing their potential to fertilize an ovum. However, the origin and adaptive advantage afforded by these intricate processes of post-testicular sperm maturation remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we review literature pertaining to the nature and the physiological role of epididymal maturation and subsequent capacitation in comparative vertebrate taxa including representative species from the avian, reptilian, and mammalian lineages. Such insights are discussed in terms of the framework they provide for helping to understand the evolutionary significance of post-testicular sperm maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aendocrinology 3aepididymis 3afemales 3amales 3amammals 3aova 3apaternity 3areptiles 3aspermatozoa 0aSperm capacitation 0aSperm competition 0aSperm maturation 0aSperm motility1 aCafe, Shenae L.1 aEamens, Andrew L.1 aDe Iuliis, Geoffry N.1 aBromfield, Elizabeth G.1 aMartin, Jacinta H.1 aSkerrett-Byrne, David A.1 aDun, Matthew D.0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 517 p.110955-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.1109553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010200163300001400265520100600279592002801285650002001313650001201333650001101345650002201356650001301378650001401391650001701405650001501422653001201437653001801449653002201467653001301489653001101502700002101513700002701534773014101561856007801702852000901780655001201789IND60738409320221120233858.0210524e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073840932DNAL7 a10.37992/2021.1201.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasanth, Ajay10aGenetic divergence study for duration and biomass traits in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)

In this study, 200 diverse sets of sorghum accessions were evaluated during rabi, 2019 with an aim of assessing genetic diversity for fodder component traits using D² statistics. Fresh biomass contributed the highest (47.4%) towards divergence followed by days to flowering (35.9%) and plant height (16.7%). All the 200 genotypes were grouped into 6 clusters with Cluster I having the maximum number of genotypes (108) followed by cluster IV (47), VI (39) and clusters II, III, V having the least genotype number (2). Cluster I had the highest (10.61) intra cluster distance while cluster II had the least (0.41) intra cluster distance. Inter cluster distance between I and IV was observed the highest (10.43) while the least was observed between III and V. Genotypes from Cluster II and IV were observed to be the best suited for fodder improvement programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3abiomass 3aforage 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aplant height 3astatistics 0aSorghum 0aD2 statistics 0aGenetic diversity 0aClusters 0aFodder1 aPremnath, Ameena1 aMuthurajan, Raveendran0 tElectronic journal of plant breeding.g2021 Mar., v. 12, no. 1 p.22-27dIndian Society of Plant BreederswJournal:27365x0975-928X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.37992/2021.1201.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245009200181500002200273520056800295592002800863650002700891650000900918650001300927650001300940650001600953651001900969653003000988653001601018653001101034700002501045700006601070700006101136773009001197856008601287852000901373655001201382IND60661554220221122220825.0190830e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066155422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2019.1053512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbuquerque, Cristiano Q.14aThe visual quality of annual growth increments in fish otoliths increases with latitude  aPre-press version  aThis study evaluated the latitudinal influence on otolith readability through average percent error (APE) assessments and contrast ratios evaluations of the opaque and translucent incremental zones in Micropogonias furnieri otoliths (n = 83) sampled along the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean.

To inform advancement pathways for FCEVs, we conducted an expert elicitation on vehicle costs and performance at anticipated production volumes, governmental actions to advance FCEVs, anticipated sales of FCEVs equipped with an automated driving system (ADS), and anticipated infrastructure deployments. Between 2020 and 2035, experts assessed a three-fold decline in fuel cell system costs to $60/kW and over an order of magnitude increase in production volume to 225,000 systems/year. Levelized costs of driving were assesed at $0.25–$0.90/mile and $0.17–$0.65/mile in 2035 and 2050, respectively. FCEVs could constitute a considerable share of ADS-equipped vehicle sales depending on cost and performance trajectories of automated driving technology and electric vehicles. Experts identified regulatory and incentive-based policies as important governmental actions to advance FCEVs and recommended hydrogen, fuel cells, and technology deployment activities each receive at least 20% of government research and development funding. Medians of experts' U.S. refueling station deployment assessments were 500 and 2,000 stations cumulative in 2030 and 2040, respectively. The middle 50% of respondents anticipated 2030 cumulative FCEV deployments in China of 100,000–1 million.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acarbon 3adecline 3aenergy policy 3aexpert opinion 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3ainfrastructure 3aresearch and development 3atransportation 3aChina 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell 0aCost 0aExpert elicitation 0aPolicy 0aVehicle automation1 aLima Azevedo, Inês M.1 aLitster, Shawn1 aSamaras, Constantine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8803-28451 aWhitefoot, Kate S.1 aWhitacre, Jay F.0 tEnergy policy.g2022 Jan., v. 160 p.112671-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1126713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168520074700271592002801018650001401046650001401060650001801074650001601092650002201108653001501130653002801145653002301173653001401196700001601210700001801226700001401244700001701258773010301275856008501378852000901463655001201472IND60786111420221119235432.0220824e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078611142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1540442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Liuyang10aRapid construction of acridines via BF3•Et2O promoted cyclization of 2-phenylamino benzophenones  aA concise and practical strategy for the rapid construction of acridines from 2-phenylamino benzophenone promoted by BF₃•Et₂O has been developed. The reaction goes through the intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation and dehydration with a facile work-up procedure. It shows good functional group tolerance and the yields of acridines are mostly in range of 90–99 %. The efficiency of this reaction is tremendously high, which can be completed within 30 min. Gram-scale synthesis and synthetic application experiment illustrate the practical utility of the method as a synthetic tool.

To prepare the treatment diets, the basal diet was supplemented with either the exogenous natuzyme (at 0, 0.25 and 0.5 g kg⁻¹), PB (at 0% and 0.1%) or both of them. The six treatments were assigned to triplicate groups and the feeding trial lasted for two months. The results showed that PB treatment constrained the positive effect of EN (especially at the higher dose) on the FCR and final weight. However, IGF and GH expression not only increased following either PB or EN inclusion, but also, their simultaneous addition promoted their individual effects. Together, higher level of GH and IGF mRNA levels in this study was not associated with a significant growth enhancement, this can be due to the fact that more time should be considered to display their effects. In the light of these results, we recommend that the combined use of probiotics and exogenous enzymes especially at the higher dose can be inhibitory.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuso huso 3aPediococcus 3aaquaculture 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adiet 3agrowth performance 3ahematology 3aimmune response 3ajuveniles 3aprobiotics 3aproteinases 0aPB 0aEN 0aPediococcus acidi lactici (PB) 0aNatuzyme (EN) 0aGrowth hormone 0aInsulin-like growth factor and beluga1 aHasanpour, Shaghayegh1 aSafari, Roghieh1 aImanpour, Mohammad Reza1 aGutiérrez, Joaquim0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 June, v. 24 p.101180-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1011803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011900176300001800295520167500313592002801988596002502016650001302041650002302054650001902077650001202096650002202108650001602130650001102146650002502157650001102182650001402193650002302207650002402230650002002254650001402274650002202288650000902310650001102319650001302330700006702343700003302410700003102443700003902474773012702513856008102640852000902721655001202730IND60672437720221120210717.0191016e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067243772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0342-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraz, Inara Guglielmetti10aEffect of the Addition of Aluminum Recycling Waste on the Pozzolanic Activity of Sugarcane Bagasse Ash and Zeolite  ap. 3493-3513.  aThe pozzolanic activity of aluminum recycling waste (AW) was evaluated along with sugarcane bagasse ash (BA) and zeolite (ZE) to give a more sustainable use. These materials were characterized and submitted to the pozzolanic activity test by a modified Chapelle test and the compressive strength of mortars prepared with limestone Portland cement (LPC). The final solids were characterized again to determine the hydrated products. The main reactive chemical components of AW are Al₂O₃ and MgO, which are in the form of hydroxides, such as nordstrandite (Al(OH)₃), meixnerite ([Mg₅Al₃(OH)₁₆][(OH)₃·(H₂O)₄]), brucite (Mg(OH)₂) and magnesium chloride hydroxide hydrate (Mg₃(OH)₅Cl·4H₂O). All of the studied materials were classified as pozzolans by the modified Chapelle test, and the main hydrated products formed in the AW sample were katoite, ettringite, talc and amesite. When mixed with BA and ZE, C-A-S-H and C-S-H phases were also formed. The C-S-H phases and portlandite were detected only in the solids of the modified Chapelle test of BA and ZE. Calcite was present in all samples, indicating that part of the Ca(OH)₂ was consumed by the carbonation process. The compressive strength test of mortars revealed that only ZE is a pozzolan. In mortars containing AW the production of ettringite and calcium carboaluminate increased due to the reactions of aluminum, respectively, with gypsum and calcite present in LPC. In addition to portlandite, C-S-H was formed only in the BA and ZE mortars. Although hydration reactions were not sufficient to form C-S-H in AW mortar, reactive aluminum favors the formation of primary ettringite.  aPublisher supplied data  a2011/13168-1cFAPESP 3aaluminum 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aaluminum oxide 3acalcite 3acalcium hydroxide 3acarbonation 3acement 3acompression strength 3agypsum 3alimestone 3amagnesium chloride 3amagnesium hydroxide 3amagnesium oxide 3arecycling 3asugarcane bagasse 3atalc 3awastes 3azeolites1 aShinzato, Mirian Chieko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9238-339X1 aMontanheiro, Tarcísio José1 ade Almeida, Thelma Miranda1 ade Souza Carvalho, Flávio Machado0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2019 Nov., v. 10, no. 11 p.3493-3513dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-018-0342-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002700156245008100183300001800264520145500282592002801737650000801765650001601773650002301789650001801812650002001830650002701850650002601877650001301903650001301916650001701929700002001946700001901966700001901985700001902004700001802023700001902041700001802060700001702078700002102095700001802116773008702134856009002221852000902311655001202320IND60090378820221122013953.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009037882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Mohammad Ariful10aAccelerated gene transfer through a polysorbitol-based transporter mechanism  ap. 9908-9924.  aHere we report an accelerated gene transfer through a polysorbitol-based osmotically active transporter (PSOAT) that shows several surprising results through interesting mechanisms. The nano-sized and well-complexed PSOAT/DNA particles are less toxic, stable at serum and show no aggregation after lyophilization due to their polysorbitol backbone. The transfection is remarkably accelerated both in vitro and in vivo, presumably due to a transporter mechanism of PSOAT in spite of possibility of reduction of transfection by many hydroxyl groups in the transporter. PSOAT possesses a transporter mechanism owing to its polysorbitol backbone, which enhances cellular uptake by exerting polysorbitol transporter activity, thus accelerates gene transfer to cells because transfection ability of PSOAT is drastically reduced in the presence of a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitor, which we have reported as an inhibitor of the transporter to cells. Moreover, the gene expression is found to be enhanced by hyperosmotic activity and buffering capacity due to polysorbitol and polyethylenimine backbone of PSOAT, respectively. The polysorbitol in PSOAT having polyvalency showed more efficiency in accelerating gene transfer capability than monovalent sorbitol. The above interesting mechanisms display PSOAT as a remarkably potential system to deliver therapeutic (small interfering RNA) and diagnostic agents for effective treatment of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablood serum 3abuffering capacity 3afreeze drying 3agene expression 3aprostaglandin synthase 3asmall interfering RNA 3asorbitol 3atoxicity 3atransfection1 aYun, Cheol-Heui1 aChoi, Yun-Jaie1 aShin, Ji-Young1 aArote, Rohidas1 aJiang, Hu-Lin1 aKang, Sang-Kee1 aNah, Jae-Woon1 aPark, In-Kyu1 aCho, Myung-Haing1 aCho, Chong-Su0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Dec., v. 32, no. 36 p.9908-9924dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01832naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008900169300001800258520061000276592002800886650001600914650002300930650002300953650002100976650002300997650002301020650001001043650001401053650001001067653001301077653001601090653002601106653002201132653003301154700002101187700002001208773010401228856008101332852000901413655001201422IND60697742920221122133918.0200607e20180621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069774292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Ryan G.10aSelective formation of heteroaryl thioethers via a phosphonium ion coupling reaction  ap. 3129-3136.  aHeteroaryl thioethers, comprised of pyridines and diazines, are an important class of compounds with relevance to medicinal chemistry. Metal-catalyzed cross-couplings and SNAr reactions are traditionally used to form C–S bonds in these systems but are limited by available halogenated precursors. An alternative approach is presented where pyridines and diazines are transformed into heterocyclic phosphonium salts and then C–S bonds are formed by adding thiolate nucleophiles. The process is 4-selective for pyridines, simple to execute and can be used to make derivatives of complex pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adrugs 3apyridines 3asalts 0aDiazines 0aC–S bonds 0aHeteroaryl thioethers 0aPhosphonium salts 0aLate-stage functionalization1 aJett, Brianna M.1 aMcNally, Andrew0 tTetrahedron.g2018 June 21, v. 74, no. 25 p.3129-3136dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2017.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245009200210300001800302520156600320592002801886650002401914650002401938650002301962650002101985650000902006650001202015650001802027650001302045650001802058650002102076773012702097856008102224852000902305655001202314IND60672437820221120210645.0191016e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067243782DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0349-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakashima, Masanobu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0192-793510aEnhanced Phosphate Release from Anaerobically Digested Sludge Through Sulfate Reduction  ap. 3419-3425.  aThis study was conducted to demonstrate enhanced phosphate release in mesophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge in relation to sulfate reduction. Sulfate was added as sulfuric acid to influent sewage sludge at the three levels, 0, 461 and 922 mg-S/L (0, 14.4 and 28.8 mmol/L, respectively). The sewage sludge used was one without artificial modification for 70 days, and then chemically pre-precipitated one artificially prepared by adding 4 g/L (17.9 mmol/L) of FePO₄·4H₂O for 77 days (influent total phosphorus of 302 and 855 mg/L, respectively). The anaerobic digesters were operated at 35 °C and 20 days hydraulic retention time. The phosphate concentration in digested sludge at the final stage reached 7.3, 89 and 112 mg/L for the sewage sludge without artificial modification, and 114, 258 and 461 mg/L for the chemically pre-precipitated sewage sludge, at the three levels of sulfate addition respectively. The phosphate concentration was almost proportional to the sulfate concentration added, indicating that the introduction of sulfate to anaerobic digestion can enhance phosphate release. The enhanced phosphate release was attributable to sulfate reduction to sulfide and subsequent release of phosphate from ferric or ferrous phosphate. In addition to the above mechanism involving sulfate reduction, phosphate release was estimated to occur from ferric phosphate along with iron reduction. A possible disadvantage of involving sulfate reduction is that part of the methane is lost due to the consumption of methane precursors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3achemical reduction 3aferric phosphate 3airon 3amethane 3asewage sludge 3asulfates 3asulfuric acid 3atotal phosphorus0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2019 Nov., v. 10, no. 11 p.3419-3425dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-018-0349-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014900169500001900318520098200337592002801319650001701347650002401364650001101388650001401399650002201413650001901435650002001454650001501474650002301489650002601512650001301538650001901551650001401570650001401584653001901598653002701617653003301644653002301677700001701700700001601717700001701733700001501750700001501765700001501780773010601795856008701901852000901988655001201997IND60718248920221121040801.0210322e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071824892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shunan10aAnaerobic co-digestion of chicken manure and cardboard waste: Focusing on methane production, microbial community analysis and energy evaluation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect and microbial community changes between chicken manure (CM) and cardboard (CB) during anaerobic co-digestion. Meanwhile, the energy balance of biogas engineering was extrapolated based on the batch tests. In batch tests, co-digestion system achieved the highest improvement (14.2%) and produced 319.62 mL CH₄/gVS with a 65:35 ratio of CB: CM. More extracellular polymeric substance secretion promoted the electron transfer for acidogenesis and more hydrolase was provided with 31.6% improvement. The microbial analysis illustrated that higher acetoclastic Methanosaeta abundance was achieved, leading to 211% enhancement of acetoclastic pathway. Moreover, associated network illustrated that the higher methane production was mainly achieved through matching of hydrolytic bacteria and acidogenesis bacteria. As for energy balance, the synergistic effect increased the energy output by 38% and energy recovery to 46.4%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosaeta 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acardboard 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy balance 3aenergy recovery 3ahydrolases 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3apolymers 3apoultry manure 3asecretion 3asynergism 0aChicken manure 0aAnaerobic Co-digestion 0aMicrobial community analysis 0aSynergistic effect1 aChen, Wenhan1 aLuo, Wendan1 aFang, Hongli1 aLv, Huanyu1 aLiu, Rutao1 aNiu, Qigui0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Feb., v. 321 p.124429-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009100169300001600260520099700276592002801273650003701301650002801338650001701366650001901383650001901402650001101421650001301432650001201445653004001457653001701497653003001514653003401544653001501578700001701593700001701610700001501627700002201642700001601664700001701680773010001697856008701797852000901884655001201893IND60566737620221117175409.0190402e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056673762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.03.1672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Junguang10aInactivation of soybean trypsin inhibitor by dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma  ap. 515-522.  aSoybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) is considered as one of the most important anti-nutritional factors in soybeans. The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts and underling mechanisms of dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma on STI activities. The results shown that DBD plasma treatment significantly induced the inactivation of STI in soymilk and Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor from soybean (SKTI) in a model system. After exposure to DBD plasma at 51.4W for 21min, the STI activities of soymilk were reduced by 86.1%. Affter being treated by DBD plasma, the intrinsic fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity of SKTI were significantly decreased, while the sulfhydryl contents were increased. It is assumed that DBD plasma-induced conformational changes and oxidative modification might contribute to the inactivation of SKTI. In summary, DBD plasma technology is a potential alternative to heat treatment for the inactivation of anti-nutritional substances in food legumes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKunitz-type proteinase inhibitor 3aantinutritional factors 3afluorescence 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3asoybeans 3asoymilk 0aDielectric-barrier discharge plasma 0aInactivation 0aSoybean trypsin inhibitor 0aKunitz-type trypsin inhibitor 0aMechanisms1 aXiang, Qisen1 aLiu, Xiufang1 aDing, Tian1 aZhang, Xiangsheng1 aZhai, Yafei1 aBai, Yanhong0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 232 p.515-522dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.03.1673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009500170300001600265520189500281536012702176592002802303596007702331650001802408650002502426650002302451650001402474650001102488650001902499650001402518650001402532650001802546650001102564650000902575650000902584650001802593650001202611651002102623653002602644653002402670653000902694700002702703700001702730700001902747773011602766856008502882852000902967655001202976IND60679267920221119103421.0191221e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067926792DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2019.16291292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDizman, Serdar14aThe assessment of radioactivity and radiological hazards in soils of Bolu province, Turkey  ap. 211-218.  aThe radioactivity levels in soil samples of Bolu province of north-western Turkey have been determined. There has been no information about radioactivity measurement reported in soil samples in Bolu province so far. For this reason, the activity concentrations of natural and artificial radionuclides (²²⁶Ra, ²³²Th, ⁴⁰K, and ¹³⁷Cs) were measured in soil samples collected from 40 different points in Bolu province of north-western Turkey using gamma spectrometry technique with a high-purity germanium detector. The average activity concentrations (range) of ²²⁶Ra, ²³²Th, ⁴⁰K, and ¹³⁷Cs were found to be 18.2 (3.8–49.9) Bq/kg, 17.3 (4.1–37.9) Bq/kg, 258.3 (64.6–518.9) Bq/kg, and 7.5 (0.6–43.6) Bq/kg, respectively. At the end of the analysis, the radioactivity values were lower than the world average values reported by United Nations Scientific Committee on Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). In order to evaluate the radiological hazards resulting from natural radioactivity, radium equivalent activity (Raₑq), gamma index (Iᵧ), external hazard index (Hₑₓ), absorbed dose rate in air (D), annual gonadal dose rate (AGDE), the annual effective dose rate (AEDE), and excess life time cancer risk (ELCR) were calculated and found in the range of 14.8–129.8 Bq/kg, 0.1–0.5, 0.0–0.4, 7.0–60.2 nGy/h, 49.8–417.5 µSv/y, 8.6–73.8 µSv/y, and 0.3 × 10⁻⁴ to 2.6 × 10⁻⁴, respectively. These results were compared with recommended values (370 Bq/kg for Raₑq, <1 for Iᵧ, <1 for Hₑₓ, 55 nGy/h for D, 300 µSv/y for AGDE, 70 µSv/y for AEDE, and 2.9 × 10⁻⁴ for ELCR) by European Commission (EC), UNSCEAR and International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). As a result, health hazards originated by natural radiation from soil samples of the Bolu province is low and insignificant.  aThis study was supported by Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University’s Scientific Research Unit (Project No. 2018.03.02.1321).  aPublisher supplied data  a.03.02.cBolu Abant Izzet Baysal University’s Scientific Research Unit 3aabsorbed dose 3acesium radioisotopes 3agamma spectrometry 3agermanium 3agonads 3ahealth hazards 3aneoplasms 3apotassium 3aradioactivity 3aradium 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3athorium 3aTurkey (country) 0aNatural radioactivity 0aradiological hazard 0aBolu1 aGörür, Filiz Korkmaz1 aKeser, Recep1 aGörür, Osman0 tEnvironmental forensics.g2019 July 3, v. 20, no. 3 p.211-218dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12311x1527-59307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2019.16291293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013300167300001800300520137800318592002801696650001301724650001101737650003801748650001201786650002001798650001601818650001101834650002401845650005201869650001401921650001301935650001501948653002701963653001401990653001302004653002502017653001502042700001702057700002002074700002102094700005802115773014902173856008302322852000902405655001202414IND60533228620221119153041.0181120e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053322862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sang-Woo,10aEfficient endodermal induction of human adipose stem cells using various concentrations of Activin A for hepatic differentiation  ap. 1178-1184.  aActivin A, which is a signaling molecule similar to Nodal, rapidly promotes endoderm induction of both embryonic stem (ES) cells and MSCs. Protocols for hepatic induction exhibit differences in efficiency and reproducibility depending on the specific methods or sources of MSCs. We characterized the effects of Activin A concentration on induction efficiency during hepatic differentiation of MSCs. Human MSCs (hMSCs) were differentiated into a hepatic lineage via a three-step protocol. Cells were first cultured in fetal bovine serum-free MSCs conditioned medium supplemented with Activin A (20, 50, or 100 ng/mL) for 3 days followed by treatment with additional agents. RT-PCR analysis, immunocytochemistry assays, periodic acid and Schiff's solution staining, and ELISAs were performed to confirm hepatic induction of hMSCs. Expression of genes related to the primitive foregut endoderm was observed in cells treated with higher concentration of Activin A. Gene expression related to functional primitive hepatocytes was observed in the early phases of hepatic differentiation. During the early period of the differentiation protocol, greater albumin secretion was observed when cells were treated with higher concentrations of Activin A.Conclusion: Thus, Activin A concentration affects the rate of endoderm induction of hMSCs, and at higher concentrations in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3acattle 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aforegut 3agene expression 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3aimmunocytochemistry 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3astaining 3astem cells 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aActivin A 0aEndoderm 0aCell differentiation 0aHepatocyte1 aMin, Seon Ok1 aBak, Seon Young1 aHwang, Ho Kyoung1 aKim, Kyung Sik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9498-284X0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 464, no. 4 p.1178-1184dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024001800130040001800148100002500166245010600191300001600297520193900313592002802252650001202280650001302292650001302305650001102318650001502329650001702344650002202361650001502383650002202398650002502420650002202445650000902467650002102476650002002497651000902517653002902526653002002555653001702575653001902592653001202611700002002623700002102643773012102664856008302785852000902868655001202877IND60564299820221118221903.0180625e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056429982DNAL7 a10.2993/0278-0771-36.3.5352doi4 aetbi-36-03-05  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoos, Christopher I.10aAnthropogenic Burning, Agricultural Intensification, and Landscape Transformation in Post-Lapita Fiji  ap. 535-553.  aSlash-and-burn cultivation (swidden) is an important and extensive strategy among agriculturalists in Oceania. The length of the fallow period, in which non-cultivated vegetation is allowed to regrow, is critical to the sustainability of this strategy in tropical environments. Long fallow periods permit greater soil recovery and higher yields over the long term whereas shorter fallow periods drive cycles of soil degradation that ultimately result in a landscape that is too degraded for continued cultivation. Anthropologists recognize that decreasing swidden fallow times is a key form of agricultural intensification that may have shaped interpolity conflict and social complexity. Although it is easy to identify the degraded landscapes that are a legacy of this pattern today, it has been a challenge for archaeologists to identify the timing and rate at which such processes took place in the past. We use alluvial stratigraphic records of charcoal and stable carbon isotopes from a small drainage in Western Viti Levu, Fiji, to reconstruct the timing and rate of intensification of swidden agriculture from long-fallow clearing of native forest, to shorter fallow burning of secondary forest and grassland, to grassland conversion. Results suggest that swidden cultivation in the lower Sigatoka Valley did not commence until centuries after Lapita colonization (ca. 2950 cal BP). Early swiddening apparently used relatively short fallow periods coupled with residential mobility to sustain horticultural yields until mobility no longer became a viable option. Archaeological indicators of resource stress co-occur with persistent swiddening after 1450 cal BP, although these precede the collapse into degraded grassland conditions at 1000 cal BP. Archaeological evidence for conflict increase after landscape degradation, although emerging social inequalities only appear after centuries of degraded conditions and conflict.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acharcoal 3adrainage 3afallow 3agrasslands 3ahorticulture 3aintensive farming 3alandscapes 3asecondary forests 3ashifting cultivation 3asocial inequality 3asoil 3asoil degradation 3astable isotopes 3aFiji 0ahuman-environment impact 0aswidden farming 0afire history 0ageoarchaeology 0aOceania1 aField, Julie S.1 aDudgeon, John V.0 tJournal of ethnobiology.g2016 Oct., v. 36, no. 3 p.535-553dSociety of EthnobiologywJournal:19742x2162-44967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-36.3.5353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015100172300001800323520152700341592002801868650001501896650003601911650002501947650001601972650003101988650001202019650001102031650001302042650002202055650002302077650001402100700002302114700001902137700002602156700002002182700002102202700001702223700002502240773010602265856008602371852000902457655001202466IND60580674220180802000000.0170926e20170926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058067422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b018552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelegård, Robert10aDistinct Electrostatic Interactions Govern the Chiro-Optical Properties and Architectural Arrangement of Peptide–Oligothiophene Hybrid Materials  ap. 7102-7110.  aThe development of chiral optoelectronic materials is of great interest due to their potential of being utilized in electronic devices, biosensors, and artificial enzymes. Herein, we report the chiral–optical properties and architectural arrangement of optoelectronic materials generated from noncovalent self-assembly of a cationic synthetic peptide and five chemically defined anionic pentameric oligothiophenes. The peptide–oligothiophene hybrid materials exhibit a three-dimensional ordered helical structure and optical activity in the π–π* transition region that are observed due to a single chain induced chirality of the conjugated thiophene backbone upon interaction with the peptide. The latter property is highly dependent on electrostatic interactions between the peptide and the oligothiophene, verifying that a distinct spacing of the carboxyl groups along the thiophene backbone is a major chemical determinant for having a hybrid material with distinct optoelectronic properties. The necessity of the electrostatic interaction between specific carboxyl functionalities along the thiophene backbone and the lysine residues of the peptide, as well as the induced circular dichroism of the thiophene backbone, was also confirmed by theoretical calculations. We foresee that our findings will aid in designing optoelectronic materials with dynamic architectonical precisions as well as offer the possibility to create the next generation of materials for organic electronics and organic bioelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronics 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenzymes 3alysine 3amoieties 3aoptical isomerism 3asynthetic peptides 3athiophene1 aRouhbakhsh, Zeinab1 aShirani, Hamid1 aJohansson, Leif B.

The aim of this study is to elucidate whether ILG shows the anti‐inflammatory and antimetabolic syndrome effects through gut microbiota modification. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice are fed a high‐fat diet (HFD) with or without ILG for up to 12 weeks. The effect of ILG on body weight, blood glucose level, adipose tissue inflammation, gut barrier function, and gut microbiota composition are investigated. ILG supplementation alleviates HFD‐induced obesity, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance and suppresses inflammatory gene expression in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Moreover, ILG supplementation modifies gut bacterial composition by increasing the abundance of antimetabolic disease‐associated species (e.g., Parabacteroides goldsteinii and Akkemansia muciniphila) and up‐regulated genes associated with gut barrier function. Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) from ILG‐fed donors counteract HFD‐induced body and eWAT weight changes, inflammation‐related gene expression, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance, thereby suggesting that ILG‐responsive gut bacteria exerts anti‐inflammatory and antimetabolic syndrome effects. CONCLUSION: Alterations in gut bacteria underly the beneficial effects of ILG against adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic disorders. ILG may be a promising prebiotic for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data  cToyama Pharmaceutical Valley Development Consortium 3aabsorption barrier 3ablood glucose 3adigestive system 3aepididymis 3afood research 3agene expression 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolic syndrome 3amicrobiome 3aobesity 3aprebiotics 3awhite adipose tissue1 aFurusawa, Yukihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6020-69651 aHonda, Hiroe1 aWatanabe, Yasuharu1 aFujisaka, Shiho1 aNishikawa, Miyu1 aIkushiro, Shinichi1 aKurihara, Shin1 aTabuchi, Yoshiaki1 aTobe, Kazuyuki1 aTakatsu, Kiyoshi1 aNagai, Yoshinori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5754-53570 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2022 May, v. 66, no. 10 p.e2101119-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2021011193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245009300182520137400275592002801649650002401677650000801701650001301709650002501722650001801747650001601765650002001781650000901801650001101810650001201821650002301833650001501856650001101871700002401882700002401906700004301930700002301973700003001996700003302026700003002059700002802089700003602117700003402153773012302187856008202310852000902392655001202401IND60794308420221119185657.0220922e20220829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079430842DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110909872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva-Junior, Elias Barbosa10aPulmonary Fibrosis and Hypereosinophilia in TLR9-/- Mice Infected by Cryptococcus gattii  aCryptococcus gattii is a worldwide-distributed basidiomycetous yeast that can infect immunocompetent hosts. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the disease. The innate immune response is essential to the control of infections by microorganisms. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is an innate immune receptor, classically described as a non-methylated DNA recognizer and associated with bacteria, protozoa and opportunistic mycosis infection models. Previously, our group showed that TLR9⁻/⁻ mice were more susceptible to C. gattii after 21 days of infection. However, some questions about the innate immunity involving TLR9 response against C. gattii remain unknown. In order to investigate the systemic cryptococcal infection, we evaluated C57BL/6 mice and C57BL/6 TLR9⁻/⁻ after intratracheal infection with 10⁴C. gattii yeasts for 21 days. Our data evidenced that TLR9⁻/⁻ was more susceptible to C. gattii. TLR9⁻/⁻ mice had hypereosinophilia in pulmonary mixed cellular infiltrate, severe bronchiolitis and vasculitis and type 2 alveolar cell hyperplasia. In addition, TLR9⁻/⁻ mice developed severe pulmonary fibrosis and areas with strongly birefringent fibers. Together, our results corroborate the hypothesis that TLR9 is important to support the Th1/Th17 response against C. gattii infection in the murine experimental model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptococcus gattii 3aDNA 3aProtozoa 3aToll-like receptor 9 3abronchiolitis 3ahyperplasia 3ainnate immunity 3amice 3amodels 3amycoses 3apulmonary fibrosis 3avasculitis 3ayeasts1 aDiniz-Lima, Israel 1 aSilva, Amanda Couto1 aGuimarães-de-Oliveira, Joyce Cristina1 aMorrot, Alexandre 1 aFreire-de-Lima, Leonardo 1 ada Fonseca, Leonardo Marques1 ade Brito-Gitirana, Lycia 1 aDecote-Ricardo, Debora 1 ade Matos Guedes, Herbert Leonel1 aFreire-de-Lima, Celio Geraldo0 tPathogens.g2022 Aug. 29, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110909873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024001200170040001800182100002000200245011500220300001600335500002000351506017300371520131800544592002801862650001501890650002401905650001101929650001001940650002201950650001301972650001001985650002601995650002002021650001102041650001102052650000702063650002302070650001602093650001902109650001802128650001802146650001002164650001502174700002302189700002202212773010702234856011402341856008302455956008702538961001302625852000902638655001202647IND60580674520221214224104.0220805e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058067452DNAL7 a3391322aris7 a10113/58067452hdl7 a10.1094/CCHEM-03-17-0049-R2doi8 ans13744  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Eun Young10aEffects of Bran Prehydration on Functional Characteristics and Bread‐Baking Quality of Bran and Flour Blends  ap. 834-839.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe effect of bran prehydration on the composition and bread‐baking quality was determined using bran and flour of two wheat varieties. Bran was hydrated in sodium acetate buffer (50mM, pH 5.3) to 50% moisture at 25 or 55°C for 1.5 or 12 h. The soluble sugar content in bran increased with prehydration. Decreases in phytate and soluble fiber were observed in prehydrated bran, but insoluble fiber was not affected by prehydration. Likewise, free phenolic content decreased, and there was little change in the content of bound phenolics in prehydrated bran. The compositional changes were greater in the bran prehydrated at 55 than at 25°C, and for 12 than for 1.5 h. Addition of prehydrated bran delayed dough development of bran and flour blends and slightly increased water absorption of dough. A higher loaf volume of fresh bread and lower crumb firmness of bread stored for 10 days were observed in bread containing bran prehydrated at 25°C than in bread containing nonhydrated bran or bran prehydrated at 55°C. The prehydration of bran at 25°C before being incorporated into refined flour for dough mixing improved bread quality by altering bran compositional properties, allowing enough water to be absorbed by fibrous materials in the bran and preventing water competition among dough constituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3adough 3adough development 3afirmness 3aflour 3afunctional properties 3ainsoluble fiber 3aloaves 3amixing 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytic acid 3asodium acetate 3asoluble fiber 3asugar content 3awheat 3awheat bran1 aFuerst, E.

In this study, the therapeutic effects of G. cambogia on glucose homeostasis in obesity‐induced diabetes are explored and the underlying mechanisms are investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: C2C12 myotubes are treated with G. cambogia; glucose uptake, intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, and related alterations in signaling pathways are examined. High‐fat diet (HFD)‐fed mice are administered G. cambogia for 8 weeks; oral glucose tolerance is evaluated, and the regulation of identified targets of signaling pathways in quadriceps skeletal muscle are examined in vivo. G. cambogia increases glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes and induces the upregulation of AMPK, ACC, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Notably, G. cambogia markedly elevates both intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, activating CaMKII, a Ca²⁺‐sensing protein, and TBC1D4‐mediated GLUT4 translocation, to facilitate glucose uptake. Furthermore, high‐glucose‐induced inhibition of glucose uptake and signal transduction is reverted by G. cambogia. In an HFD‐induced diabetes mouse model, G. cambogia administration results in significant blood glucose‐lowering effects, which are attributed to the regulation of targets that have been identified in vitro, in quadricep skeletal muscle. CONCLUSION: These findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which G. cambogia regulates glucose homeostasis in obesity‐induced diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019R1C1C1010698cNational Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)  a2021cBK21 FOUR Program by Chungnam National University 3aGarcinia gummi-guta 3ablood 3acalcium 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3adiabetes 3afood research 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amyotubes 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics1 aKim, Min‐Tae1 aMyung, Chang‐Seon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6292-29110 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2022 May, v. 66, no. 10 p.e2100669-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2021006693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245011800209300001400327506007600341520061100417592002801028506003701056650002601093650001601119650001301135650001001148650001001158650001301168650001401181700003401195700002101229773010901250856008101359852000901440655001201449IND60601687420221207093448.0180706e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060168742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2014.06.0162doi7 aPMC42533002pmcid7 a250902402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevin, Bruce R.,10aPersistence: a copacetic and parsimonious hypothesis for the existence of non-inherited resistance to antibiotics  ap. 18-21.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe postulate that phenotypic resistance to antibiotics, persistence, is not an evolved (selected-for) character but rather like mutation, an inadvertent product of different kinds of errors and glitches.

The low acute toxicity and high biodegradability of SBMs suggest their discharge at sea would cause minimal impacts on marine ecosystems, however, chronic toxicity testing has demonstrated adverse effects of SBMs on fish health. Sparse environmental monitoring data indicate effects of SBMs on bottom invertebrates. However, no environmental toxicity assessment has been performed on fish attracted to the cutting piles. SBM formulations are mostly composed of synthetic base oils, weighting agents, and drilling additives such as emulsifiers, fluid loss agents, wetting agents, and brine. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of exposure to individual ingredients of SBMs on fish health. To do so, a suite of biomarkers [ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, biliary metabolites, sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, DNA damage, and heat shock protein] have been measured in pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) exposed for 21 days to individual ingredients of SBMs. The primary emulsifier (Emul S50) followed by the fluid loss agent (LSL 50) caused the strongest biochemical responses in fish. The synthetic base oil (Rheosyn) caused the least response in juvenile fish. The results suggest that the impact of Syndrill 80:20 on fish health might be reduced by replacement of the primary emulsifier Emul S50 with an alternative ingredient of less toxicity to aquatic biota. The research provides a basis for improving the environmental performance of SBMs by reducing the environmental risk of their discharge and providing environmental managers with information regarding the potential toxicity of individual ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aPagrus 3aacute toxicity 3aadditives 3aadverse effects 3abiodegradability 3achronic toxicity 3adrilling 3aemulsifiers 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afish health 3aheat shock proteins 3aingredients 3ainvertebrates 3ajuveniles 3ametabolites 3aoils 3arisk 3asnapper 3atoxicity testing 2aAnimals 2aBilexmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xmetabolism 2aDNA Damage 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aExtraction and Processing Industry 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxmetabolism 2aL-Iditol 2-Dehydrogenasexbloodxmetabolism. 2aPerciformes 2aToxicity Tests 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity.1 aGagnon, Marthe Monique0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Sept., v. 184, no. 9 p.5311-5325dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2342-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012700163300001800290520157200308592002801880650002601908650002601934650002501960650002401985650002502009650001502034650002202049650002202071650002002093650001602113650001302129650001902142650001102161650001102172650002302183650001602206650001702222650001902239650002102258650001702279650002802296650001402324650001402338700001902352700001802371700001502389700001702404700001802421700005602439773013902495856007902634852000902713655001202722IND60642302420221119135942.0190507e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064230242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b072812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongna10aIntegration of Metabolomics and Lipidomics Reveals Metabolic Mechanisms of Triclosan-Induced Toxicity in Human Hepatocytes  ap. 5406-5415.  aTriclosan (TCS), an extensively used antimicrobial agent, has raised considerable concern due to its hepatocarcinogenic potential. However, previous hepatotoxicity studies primarily focused on the activation of specific intracellular receptors, the underlying mechanisms still warrant further investigation at the metabolic level. Herein, we applied metabolomics in combination with lipidomics to unveil TCS-related metabolic responses in human normal and cancerous hepatocytes. Endogenous and exogenous metabolites were analyzed for the identification of metabolic biomarkers and biotransformation products. In L02 normal cells, TCS exposure induced the up-regulation of purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism, caused lipid accumulation, and disturbed energy metabolism. These metabolic disorders in turn enhanced the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the alteration of antioxidant enzyme activities, down-regulation of endogenous antioxidants, and peroxidation of lipids. TCS-induced oxidative stress is thus considered to be one crucial factor for hepatotoxicity. However, in HepG2 cancer cells, TCS underwent fast detoxification through phase II metabolism, accompanied by the enhancement of energy metabolism and elevation of antioxidant defense system, which contributed to the potential effects of TCS on human hepatocellular carcinoma development. These different responses of metabolism between normal and cancerous hepatocytes provide novel and robust perspectives for revealing the mechanisms of TCS-triggered hepatotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid metabolism 3aanti-infective agents 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomarkers 3abiotransformation 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahumans 3alipids 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidation 3areactive oxygen species 3areceptors 3atriclosan1 aShao, Xiaojian1 aZhao, Hongzhi1 aLi, Xiaona1 aWei, Juntong1 aYang, Chunxue1 aCai, Zongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7013-55470 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Apr. 09, v. 53, no. 9 p.5406-5415dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b072813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245016900181300001600350520154900366592002801915650001801943650001601961650002101977650001001998650001502008650001702023650003902040650001902079650001602098650001302114650001702127650001302144651001002157653005002167653004202217653004502259653004402304653002202348653001502370700001802385700001402403773012302417856008902540852000902629655001202638IND60543393620221120101148.0190410e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054339362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Jitendra Kumar10aStudy the effect of insecticide dimethoate on photosynthetic pigments and photosynthetic activity of pigeon pea: Laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectroscopy  ap. 297-305.  aPigeon pea is one of the most important legume crops in India and dimethoate is a widely used insecticide in various crop plants. We studied the effect of dimethoate on growth and photosynthetic activity of pigeon pea plants over a short and long term exposure. Plant growth parameters, photosynthetic pigment content and chlorophyll fluorescence response of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) plants treated with various concentrations of the insecticide dimethoate (10, 20, 40 and 80ppm) have been compared for 30days at regular intervals of 10days each. Laser induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectra and fluorescence-induction kinetics (FIK) curve of dimethoate treated pigeon pea plants were recorded after 10, 20 and 30days of treatment. Fluorescence intensity ratio at the two fluorescence maxima (F685/F730) was calculated by evaluating curve-fitted parameters. The variable chlorophyll fluorescence decrease ratio (Rfd) was determined from the FIK curves. Our study revealed that after 10days of treatment, 10ppm of dimethoate showed stimulatory response whereas 20, 40 and 80ppm of dimethoate showed inhibitory response for growth and photosynthetic activity of pigeon pea plants, but after 20 and 30days of treatment all the tested concentrations of dimethoate became inhibitory. This study clearly shows that dimethoate is highly toxic to the pigeon pea plant, even at very low concentration (10ppm), if used for a prolonged duration. Our study may thus be helpful in determining the optimal dose of dimethoate in agricultural practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3achlorophyll 3achronic exposure 3acrops 3adimethoate 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aphotosynthesis 3apigeon peas 3apigments 3aplant growth 3atoxicity 3aIndia 0aLaser induced chlorophyll fluorescence (LICF) 0aFluorescence induction kinetics (FIK) 0aFluorescence intensity ratio (F685/F730) 0aPlant vitality index {Rfd=(Fm−Fs)/Fs} 0aDimethoate stress 0aPigeon pea1 aDubey, Gunjan1 aGopal, R.0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Oct., v. 151 p.297-305dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009500166500002200261520125200283592002801535650001301563650001201576650001401588650002301602650001701625650001501642650001301657650001701670650001301687650001401700650001201714650001701726650001701743650001601760650001301776653001601789653003001805653002601835653001701861700002001878700001701898700002001915700001701935700001701952700001801969700005801987700001402045700001102059700005502070700005502125700006402180773010102244856008702345852000902432655001202441IND60669843620221119100529.0190923e20190918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066984362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jia10aRecycling benzene and ethylbenzene from in-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of plastic wastes  aPre-press version  aRecovering waste plastics by catalytic fast pyrolysis to selectively generate aromatic hydrocarbons is a promising approach to dispose of solid wastes. In the present work, catalytic conversion of polystyrene over ultra-stable Y zeolites (USY) was conducted to directionally produce benzene and ethylbenzene. Experimental results indicated that catalyst type considerably affected the distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons, and USY with high surface area (734 m2/g), large pore size (5.6 nm), an abundant amount of strong acid sites (1.21 mmol/g) exhibited the most effective shape selectivity for ethylbenzene and benzene generation as the yield enhanced rate reached 401.8% and 61.1%, respectively. Plastic type also played a vital role in the formation of desirable aromatic hydrocarbons, and polystyrene was more beneficial to the production of ethylbenzene as a 54-fold increase was obtained compared to polycarbonate in the catalytic degradation process. Concerning reaction conditions to maximize the formation of benzene and ethylbenzene in the catalytic decomposition of polystyrene, the catalyst/feedstock mass ratio, Si/Al mole ratio in USY, and catalytic conversion temperature could be optimized at 1.5, 5.3, and 650 oC, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethylbenzene 3afeedstocks 3aplastics 3apolystyrenes 3aporosity 3apyrolysis 3asilicon 3asolid wastes 3asurface area 3atemperature 3azeolites 0aPolystyrene 0aThermochemical conversion 0aAromatic hydrocarbons 0aUSY zeolites1 aJiang, Jianchun1 aSun, Yunjuan1 aZhong, Zhaoping1 aWang, Xiaobo1 aXia, Haihong1 aLiu, Guanghua1 aPang, Shusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9785-17111 aWang, Kui1 aLi, Mi1 aXu, Junming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1398-23361 aRuan, Roger1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8835-26491 aRagauskas, Arthur J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3536-554X0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 18, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245014500193300001800338520138300356592002801739650001701767650002401784650001801808650003001826650001801856650001401874650002101888650001801909653002501927653001001952653001201962653004001974653001802014700002402032700002802056700002202084773012102106856008102227852000902308655001202317IND60651205020221117060019.0190711e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065120502DNAL7 a284921092pmid7 a10.1017/S003118201700066X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVAN DER MESCHT, LUTHER10aRevisiting the role of dissimilarity of host communities in driving dissimilarity of ectoparasite assemblages: non-linear vs linear approach  ap. 1365-1374.  aWe revisited the role of dissimilarity of host assemblages in shaping dissimilarity of flea assemblages using a non-linear approach. Generalized dissimilarity models (GDMs) were applied using data from regional surveys of fleas parasitic on small mammals in four biogeographical realms. We compared (1) model fit, (2) the relative effects of host compositional and phylogenetic turnover and geographic distance on flea compositional and phylogenetic turnover, and (3) the rate of flea turnover along gradients of host turnover and geographic distance with those from earlier application of a linear approach. GDMs outperformed linear models in explaining variation in flea species turnover and host dissimilarity was the best predictor of flea dissimilarity, irrespective of scale. The shape of the relationships between flea compositional turnovers along host compositional turnover was similar in all realms, whereas turnover along geographic distance differed among realms. In contrast, the rate of flea phylogenetic turnover along gradients of host phylogenetic turnover differed among realms, whereas flea phylogenetic turnover did not depend on geographic distance in any realm. We demonstrated that a non-linear approach (a) explained spatial variation in parasite community composition better than and (b) revealed patterns that were obscured by earlier linear analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiphonaptera 3acommunity structure 3aectoparasites 3ageographical distribution 3alinear models 3aphylogeny 3aregional surveys 3asmall mammals 0abiogeographic realms 0afleas 0amammals 0ageneralized dissimilarity modelling 0aspatial scale1 aKHOKHLOVA, IRINA S.1 aWARBURTON, ELIZABETH M.1 aKRASNOV, BORIS R.0 tParasitology.g2017 Sept., v. 144, no. 10 p.1365-1374dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003118201700066X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03757naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167500002200255520212400277592002802401650002702429650002502456650001502481650001302496650001702509650001102526650001702537650001802554650001402572650001702586650002302603650001802626650003702644650001202681650001402693650001302707650001802720650001902738650001702757650001402774653002502788653003702813653000902850653000902859653001602868653002702884700001602911700002002927700001802947700002202965700002202987773006503009856008403074852000903158655001203167IND60582335220221123001918.0171006s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058233522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2017.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, A. Reum10aStreptococcus gordonii lipoproteins induce IL-8 in human periodontal ligament cells  aPre-press version  aStreptococcus gordonii, a Gram-positive oral bacterium, is a life-threatening pathogen that causes infective endocarditis. It is frequently isolated from the periapical lesions of patients with apical periodontitis and has thus been implicated in inflammatory responses. However, little is known about the virulence factors of S. gordonii responsible for the induction of inflammatory responses in the periapical areas. Here, we investigated the role of S. gordonii cell wall-associated virulence factors on interleukin (IL)-8 induction in human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells using ethanol-inactivated wild-type S. gordonii, a lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-deficient mutant (ΔltaS), and a lipoprotein-deficient mutant (Δlgt). Wild-type S. gordonii induced IL-8 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in human PDL cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A transient transfection and reporter gene assay demonstrated that wild-type S. gordonii activated Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Additionally, IL-8 production induced by wild-type S. gordonii was substantially inhibited by anti-TLR2-neutralizing antibodies. Both wild-type S. gordonii and the ΔltaS mutant induced IL-8 production; however, this response was not observed when cells were stimulated with the Δlgt mutant. Interestingly, lipoproteins purified from S. gordonii induced IL-8 production, whereas purified LTA did not. In addition, purified lipoproteins stimulated TLR2 more potently than LTA. Furthermore, S. gordonii-induced IL-8 expression was specifically inhibited by blocking p38 kinase, while lipoprotein-induced IL-8 expression was inhibited by blocking p38 kinase, ERK, or JNK. Of particular note, exogenous addition of purified S. gordonii lipoproteins enhanced Δlgt-induced IL-8 production in human PDL cells to an extent similar to that induced by the wild-type strain. Collectively, these results suggest that lipoproteins are an important component of S. gordonii for the induction of IL-8 production in human PDL cells through TLR2 activation. Therefore, lipoproteins potentially contribute to inflammatory apical periodontitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus gordonii 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3aendocarditis 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3aligaments 3alipoproteins 3alipoteichoic acids 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3apathogens 3apatients 3aperiodontitis 3areporter genes 3atransfection 3avirulence 0aApical periodontitis 0aHuman periodontal ligament cells 0aIL-8 0aTLR2 0aLipoprotein 0aStreptococcus gordonii1 aAhn, Ki Bum1 aKim, Hyun Young1 aSeo, Ho Seong1 aYun, Cheol‐Heui1 aHan, Sŏng-hyŏn,0 tMolecular Immunology.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2017.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245017100188300001800359520144000377592002801817650001501845650001901860650003101879650002101910650001701931650001001948650003001958650002101988650001802009650001402027650001802041653001802059653001802077653001902095653001502114653001802129653001602147653002102163700002002184700002302204700002002227700001902247700002102266700006002287773012002347856008102467852000902548655001202557IND60651205120221117055325.0190711e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065120512DNAL7 a288319452pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820170006712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPALACIOS, GENESIS10aStudies in vitro on infectivity and sensitivity to antileishmanial drugs in New World Leishmania species transfected with the green fluorescent protein [pIR3(-)-eGFP]  ap. 1718-1725.  aCurrent chemotherapeutic agents for leishmaniasis have several disadvantages interfering with the effective treatment and therefore more and better antileishmanial drugs are needed. Discovery of candidates for leishmaniasis treatment requires not only accurate and precise methodologies but also well-known biological system to measure infectivity of parasites and antileishmanial activity of the new compounds. Significant variation in the in vitro and in vivo infectivity and sensitivity to established and experimental drugs in Leishmania strains are reported. This work reports the in vitro biological behavior and antileishmanial drugs sensitivity of different green fluorescent protein transfectant Leishmanias strains. The in vitro growth kinetic and infectivity to U937 cells vary slightly in the Leishmania transfectant strains in comparison with their correspondant wild-type. However, the insertion of the pIR3(-)-eGFP may affect the sensitivity of the parasites to meglumine antimoniate (MA) and miltefosine but not to amphotericin B (AMB) and pentamidine isethionate. In consequence, AMB or pentamidine isethionate but not MA or miltefosine should be used as antileishmanial control drugs during in vitro assays of antileishmanial activity. Furthermore, is recommended to test compounds against more than one Leishmania strain in order to verify that the antileihmanial activity of these compound is similar among species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania 3aamphotericin B 3aantileishmanial properties 3aantileishmanials 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ain vitro studies 3aleishmaniasis 3aparasites 3apathogenicity 0aL. panamensis 0aL. guyanensis 0aL.braziliensis 0aL.mexicana 0aL.amazonensis 0ainfectivity 0adrug sensitivity1 aPARODI, ADRIANA1 aUPEGUI, YULIETH A.1 aMONTOYA, ANDRES1 aPULIDO, SERGIO1 aVÉLEZ, IVÁN D.1 aROBLEDO, SARA M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2752-49310 tParasitology.g2017 Nov., v. 144, no. 13 p.1718-1725dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820170006713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245008900181300001400270520179200284592002802076650002702104650001302131650003002144650001802174650002502192650001502217650001102232650001102243651001902254651001102273651001102284651001602295651001002311700001702321700001702338700004302355773011602398856008502514852000902599655001202608IND60610456220221121170113.0180828e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061045622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Ceballos, M.A.10a7Be behaviour and meteorological conditions associated with 7Be peak events in Spain  ap. 17-26.  aThis work regards a comprehensive analysis of the overall distribution of ⁷Be activity concentrations in Spain and the synoptic meteorological conditions associated with the highest ⁷Be peaks (>8 mBq/m³). The use of four sampling stations (Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid, and Sevilla) included in REMdb, with different latitudinal location, as well as the relatively long time period used in this study (2001–2010), allowed to improve the understanding of ⁷Be spatio-temporal distribution in Spain.The comparison of the ⁷Be activity concentrations mean values indicated a north-south gradient (from 3.1 ± 1.1 mBq/m³ in Bilbao to 4.0 ± 1.8 mBq/m³ in Sevilla), even though not statistically significant (as indicated by the t-test). However, the analysis of frequency distributions and temporal evolutions of ⁷Be activity concentrations have suggested the presence of two main areas, namely northern (Bilbao and Barcelona) and southern (Sevilla) Spain.The identification and analysis of periods associated with the highest values of ⁷Be have allowed studying the different synoptic patterns associated with stratospheric–tropospheric transport (STT). In particular, three episodes (one in the north and two in the south) potentially associated with vigorous STT have been identified and analysed in detail. The results displayed that the omega block configuration, extending either over western Russia and Scandinavia or into the Atlantic Ocean, forced the prevailing jet stream to the northeast and south of Spain respectively with subsequent subsidence. In summer, this blocking configuration at high latitudes was combined with the presence of the Azores high pressure system to the west of Spain, affecting the ⁷Be activity concentration recorded in the south.  aPublisher supplied data 3afrequency distribution 3alatitude 3ameteorological parameters 3aradioactivity 3aspatial distribution 3asubsidence 3asummer 3at-test 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aAzores 3aRussia 3aScandinavia 3aSpain1 aBrattich, E.1 aLozano, R.L.1 aCinelli Calvoli, Giovanni,d1625-1706,0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.17-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009300173300001800266520119500284592002801479650001601507650002001523650001301543650001601556650002401572650002101596650001201617650001801629650001701647650001301664650001601677650002101693700003001714700001701744700002201761700001901783700002701802700002201829773009901851856008601950852000902036655001202045IND60577508720180109000000.0170809e20160830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057750872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b013562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValldeperas, Maria10aSponge Phases and Nanoparticle Dispersions in Aqueous Mixtures of Mono- and Diglycerides  ap. 8650-8659.  aThe lipid liquid crystalline sponge phase (L₃) has the advantages that it is a nanoscopically bicontinuous bilayer network able to accommodate large amounts of water and it is easy to manipulate due to its fluidity. This paper reports on the detailed characterization of L₃ phases with water channels large enough to encapsulate bioactive macromolecules such as proteins. The aqueous phase behavior of a novel lipid mixture system, consisting of diglycerol monooleate (DGMO), and a mixture of mono-, di- and triglycerides (Capmul GMO-50) was studied. In addition, sponge-like nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by Polysorbate 80 (P80) were prepared based on the DGMO/GMO-50 system, and their structure was correlated with the phase behavior of the corresponding bulk system. These NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to determine their size, shape, and inner structure as a function of the DGMO/GMO-50 ratio. In addition, the effect of P80 as stabilizer was investigated. We found that the NPs have aqueous pores with diameters up to 13 nm, similar to the ones in the bulk phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3adiacylglycerols 3adiameter 3adispersions 3aelectron microscopy 3alight scattering 3aliquids 3ananoparticles 3apolysorbates 3aproteins 3astabilizers 3atriacylglycerols1 aWiśniewska, Małgorzata,1 aRam-On, Maor1 aKesselman, Ellina1 aDanino, Dganit1 aNylander, T.q(Tommy),1 aBarauskas, Justas0 tLangmuir.g2016 Aug. 30, v. 32, no. 34 p.8650-8659dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b013563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245007200204300001800276500001900294520107400313592002801387650002201415650002001437650001101457650002201468650001601490700005101506773012101557856008401678852000901762655001201771IND60711329420221122065456.0200922e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071132942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c011322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7681-716X10aRole of Chain Dynamics in the Melt Memory Effect of Crystallization  ap. 7887-7898.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelf-nucleation (SN) methods, stress relaxation, interrupted shear flow experiments, and a one-dimensional diffusion model were used to reveal the kinetic origin of the melt memory effects of polycaprolactone (PCL), which can be regulated by changing chain dynamics with the introduction of a miscible dynamically asymmetric component, poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN). SAN plays a pivotal role in strengthening the melt memory effect and increasing the nucleation efficiency of the PCL in the blend. The lifetime of the melt memory effect in PCL/SAN blends is much longer than the relaxation time of segmental orientation and the mutual diffusion time, while the re-entanglement kinetics almost matches the survival of the melt memory effect. The lifetime and the re-entanglement time possess similar temperature dependence with activation energy much higher than that of the viscous flow. Such quantitative agreements provide solid evidence that the kinetic origin of the melt memory effect in PCL/SAN blends far above the melting point is chain re-entanglements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acrystallization 3amodels 3astress relaxation 3atemperature1 aYu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5615-91980 tMacromolecules.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 53, no. 18 p.7887-7898dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c011323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012700166520159300293592002801886650003101914650001601945650002201961650001201983650005301995650002702048650001902075650000902094653001202103653001702115653002102132653004402153653003102197700001702228700001402245700001402259700001602273700005602289773009002345856008702435852000902522655001202531IND60669843820221119100017.0200318e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066984382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2019.1701502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiang10aEndogenous ET-1 promotes ANP secretion through activation of COX2-L–PGDS–PPARγ signaling in hypoxic beating rat atria  aEndothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent stimulus for the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and hypoxia stimulates the release of ET-1, which is involved in the regulation of atrial ANP secretion. However, the precise mechanism of endogenous ET-1 in the regulation of hypoxia-induced ANP secretion is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mechanism of hypoxia-induced endogenous ET-1 regulation of ANP secretion in isolated perfused hypoxic beating rat atria. The results of this study showed that acute hypoxia significantly stimulated ET-1 release and upregulated the expression of its type A as well as type B receptors (ETA and ETB receptors). Endogenous ET-1 induced by hypoxia markedly upregulated the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) through activation of its two receptors, leading to an increase in lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) expression and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) production. L-PGDS-derived PGD2 activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), ultimately promoting hypoxia-induced ANP secretion. Conversely, L-PGDS-derived PGD2 may in turn regulate L-PGDS expression by a nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated feedback mechanism. These results indicate that endogenous ET-1 induced by hypoxia promotes hypoxia-induced ANP secretion by activation of COX2–L-PGDS–PPARγ signaling in beating rat atria. In addition, the positive feedback loop between L-PGDS-derived PGD2 and L-PGDS expression induced by hypoxia is part of the mechanism of hypoxia-induced ANP secretion by endogenous ET-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrial natriuretic peptide 3aendothelins 3ahormone secretion 3ahypoxia 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandins 3arats 0aHypoxia 0aEndothelin-1 0aCyclooxygenase 2 0aLipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase 0aAtrial natriuretic peptide1 aHan, Zhuo-na1 aLiu, Ying1 aHong, Lan1 aCui, Bai-ri1 aChʻoe, Hun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1680-63540 tPeptides.g2019 Dec., v. 122 p.170150-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2019.1701503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014000175300001600315520147400331536021101805592002802016596006902044596003102113650001702144650001202161650003502173650001302208650002202221650001502243650000902258650001102267650002402278650001402302650001402316650001402330650001102344650002102355650001602376651001402392653002502406653001502431653003102446700002202477700001602499700002102515700002602536773013802562856008502700852000902785655001202794IND60636325220221119113155.0190408e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063632522DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2018.15248392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamdan, Abd Mujahid10aMagnetic characterizations of nickel hyperaccumulating plants (Planchonella oxyhedra and Rinorea bengalensis) from Halmahera, Indonesia  ap. 364-371.  aMagnetic minerals, such as magnetite and hematite, have been reported to be present, in particular, leaves as biogenic particles. The magnetic minerals and properties of Ni hyperaccumulators have not previously been reported in the literature. This study aimed to characterize the magnetic properties of two Ni hyperaccumulating plant species, R. bengalensis and P. oxyhedra, which grow in an ultramafic region on Halmahera Island, Indonesia. For comparison, similar characterization was carried out on two non-hyperaccumulating plant species which grow in the same region. Concentrations of Ni, Fe, and Mn in the leaves of the hyperaccumulating plants were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and their magnetic properties were characterized using measurements of magnetic susceptibility, low temperature magnetic susceptibility, and hysteresis curves. The results show that, compared to the non-hyperaccumulating plants, the Ni hyperaccumulating plants have higher concentrations of Ni and similar concentration of Fe. The magnetic susceptibilities of hyperaccumulating plants are positive, and those of non-hyperaccumulating plants are negative. This suggests that the abundance of Ni, rather than Fe, may control the magnetic properties of Ni hyperaccumulating plants. This probable connection between Ni concentration and plant magnetic properties could be advantageous for identifying hyperaccumulators, and should, therefore, be explored further.  aThis research was funded by the Ministry of Research and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia and Institut Teknologi Bandung to S.

The obtained device therefore offers a reduced back pressure and rapid kinetics for its longitudinal channels, as well as possesses improved extraction capacity compared with traditional SPME method thanks to the increase of coating volume. In addition, the extraction of analytes was specific by using molecularly imprinted coatings, which greatly reduced the interference of sample matrix. To evaluate the new strategy, the PEEK tube was firstly packed with multiple ofloxacin imprinted fibers (OFL-MIP-fibers) for the analysis of four fluoroquinolones in animal-producing food samples. The extraction yields were significantly increased with the enrichment factors from 69 to 136. Sensitive results were achieved with the limits of detection as low as 0.016–0.11μg/L (S/N=3). This method was applied successfully to analysis of fluoroquinolones in pork liver and chicken samples with good repeatability (RSDs less than 7.2%). To expand the method, the PEEK tube was then filling with two different fibers imprinted by ofloxacin and sulfamethazine respectively in order to obtain simultaneous extraction of these two categories of antibiotic drugs. Preliminary results showed the hybrid packing strategy could simultaneously enrich the target analytes from complicated samples. The possibility of applying the method to pork liver sample spiked with fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides was also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibiotics 3achickens 3acoatings 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliver 3amolecular imprinting 3aofloxacin 3apork 3asolid phase microextraction 3asulfonamides 3aswine1 aSong, Chaoyong1 aLi, Gongke0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Nov. 9, v. 1263 p.21-27dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04241naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245005100183300001800234520272300252592002802975650001403003650001503017650002703032650001703059650001303076650001803089650001103107650002203118650002303140650002203163650001103185650001203196650003403208650001403242650001803256650002003274651001903294653001803313653001903331653002403350653001203374653001203386653002003398653002403418700002303442700002403465773012003489856008103609852000903690655001203699IND60651205220221117055615.0190711e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065120522DNAL7 a286535902pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820170006832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAYEH, AHMED10aGuinea worm: from Robert Leiper to eradication  ap. 1643-1648.  aGuinea worm disease, dracunculiasis or dracontiasis, is an ancient disease with records going back over 4500 years, but until the beginning of the 20th century, little was known about its life cycle, particularly how humans became infected. In 1905, Robert Thomas Leiper was sent by the British colonial authorities to West Africa to investigate the spread of Guinea worm disease and to recommend measures to prevent it. While carrying out his investigations, he made important contributions to the aetiology, epidemiology and public health aspects of Guinea worm disease and provided definitive answers to many outstanding questions. First, he tested the validity of previous theories; second, he confirmed the role of water fleas, which he identified as Cyclops, as the intermediate hosts in the life cycle; third, he investigated the development of the parasite in its intermediate host; and fourth, he recommended measures to prevent the disease. [The crustacean Order Cyclopoida in the Family Cyclopidae contains 25 genera, including Cyclops which itself contains over 400 species and may not even be a valid taxon. It is not known how many of these species (or indeed species belonging to related genera) can act as intermediate hosts of Dracunculus medinensis nor do we know which species Fedchenko, Leiper and other workers used in their experiments. It is, therefore, best to use the terms copepod, or copopoid crustacean rather than Cyclops in scientific texts. In this paper, these crustaceans are referred to as copepods except when referring to an original text.] Leiper described the remarkable changes that took place when an infected copepod was placed in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid; the copepod was immediately killed, but the Dracunculus larvae survived and were released into the surrounding water. From this, he concluded that if a person swallowed an infected copepod, their gastric juice would produce similar results. He next infected monkeys by feeding them copepods infected with Guinea worm larvae, and thus conclusively demonstrated that humans became infected by accidentally ingesting infected crustaceans. Based on these conclusions, he advocated a number of control policies, including avoidance of contaminated drinking water or filtering it, and these preventive measures paved the way for further research. The challenge to eradicate Guinea worm disease was not taken up until about seven decades later since when, with the support of a number of governmental and non-governmental organizations, the number of cases has been reduced from an estimated 3·5 million in 1986 to 25 in 2016 with the expectation that this will eventually lead to the eradication of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aCyclopidae 3aDracunculus medinensis 3aepidemiology 3aetiology 3agastric juice 3ahumans 3ahydrochloric acid 3aintermediate hosts 3aissues and policy 3alarvae 3amonkeys 3anongovernmental organizations 3aparasites 3apublic health 3awater pollution 3aWestern Africa 0aRobert Leiper 0adracunculiasis 0aGuinea worm disease 0aCyclops 0acopepod 0adisease control 0asafe drinking water1 aCairncross, Sandy,1 aCox, Francis E.

We found that the obtained films are solids and have a conductivity of up to 18 ± 6 mS/cm, associated with the negatively charged counterion, indicating no loss of conductivity, compared to the ionic liquid in the liquid state. The membranes were conductive within a large process window and in air, thanks to the fact that the iCVD process does not affect the mobility of the anion in the ionic liquid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that varying the deposition conditions can influence the homogeneity and conductivity of the resulting membranes. The promising results of this study represent an important stepping stone on the way to novel ion-conductive membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acrosslinking 3aethylene glycol 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3apolymers 3avapors1 aTazreiter, Martin1 aPerrotta, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7007-61531 aCoclite, Anna Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5562-97440 tMacromolecules.g2020 Sept. 11, v. 53, no. 18 p.7962-7969dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009100162300001600253520085100269592002801120650002301148650001801171650001601189650002301205650001101228650001501239650002201254650001401276650002201290650002101312650002301333653003601356653001601392653002001408653002601428653002001454700002101474700002301495773012501518856008301643852000901726655001201735IND60582335520221121064918.0181012e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058233552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2017.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Lei10aThermal degradation of five veterinary and human pharmaceuticals using pyrolysis-GC/MS  ap. 120-125.  aVeterinary drug residues and, more recently, pharmaceutically active contaminants have been detected in food.

A range of degradation products observed with this technique have been reported earlier with more complex approaches.

To date, Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques have been widely used for detection of MPs in aquatic organisms, which requires complex protocols of tissue digestion and MP separation and are time- and reagent-consuming. This novel approach directly separates, identifies, and characterizes MPs from the hyperspectral image (HSI) of the intestinal tract content in combination with a support vector machine classification model, instead of using the real digestion/separation protocols. The procedures of HSI acquisition (1 min) and data analysis (5 min) can be completed within 6 min plus the sample preparation and drying time (30 min) where necessary. This method achieved a promising efficiency (recall >98.80%, precision >96.22%) for identifying five types of MPs (particles >0.2 mm). Moreover, the method was also demonstrated to be effective on field fish from three marine fish species, revealing satisfying detection accuracy (particles >0.2 mm) comparable to Raman analysis. The present technique omits the digestion protocol (reagent free), thereby significantly reducing reagent consumption, saving time, and providing a rapid and efficient method for MP analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adrying 3aecosystems 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aintestines 3amarine fish 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3arapid methods 3asupport vector machines1 aWang, Xue1 aShan, Jiajia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6623-62811 aZhao, Junbo1 aZhang, Wei1 aLiu, Lifen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2949-63481 aWu, Fengchang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2615-28490 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Apr. 08, v. 53, no. 9 p.5151-5158dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b073213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014400170300001800314500001900332520168800351592002802039650001502067650002302082650003002105650002202135650001302157650001602170650003202186700002102218700002002239700001702259700002002276700001902296700005602315700005702371773012102428856008402549852000902633655001202642IND60711329620221122065638.0200922e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071132962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huai-Hsuan10aTwo-Dimensional Tetrathienonaphthalenes-Based Donor–Acceptor Copolymers: Synthesis, Isomeric Effect, and Organic Field-Effect Transistors  ap. 7740-7748.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo-dimensional alkylated αβ-TTN and βα-TTN were designed and synthesized. The cross-shaped αβ-TTN and βα-TTN moieties were polymerized to afford two isomeric polymers, Pαβ-TTNFBT₄₀ and Pβα-TTNFBT₄₀. Pαβ-TTNFBT₄₀ using an α-aNDT unit in the main chain exhibited more red-shifted absorption and a smaller HOMO/LUMO band gap than Pβα-TTNFBT₄₀ using β-aNDT in the main chain. Compared to Pβα-TTNFBT₄₀ showing a curved backbone, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Pαβ-TTNFBT₄₀ exhibited a quasi-linear polymeric backbone that induces stronger intermolecular interactions and higher molecular ordering in the solid state. Pαβ-TTNFBT₄₀ exhibited an organic field-effect transistor (OFET) hole mobility of 1.12 × 10–² cm² V–¹ s–¹, which outperformed Pβα-TTNFBT₄₀ by 1 order of magnitude (1.60 × 10–³ cm² V–¹ s–¹). Through side-chain engineering and optimization, Pαβ-TTNFBT₂₄ using a shorter 2-butyloctyl side chain further strengthened the intermolecular interactions. From grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), Pαβ-TTNFBT₂₄ adopted an edge-on π–π stacking orientation in a thin film, leading to an improved mobility of 1.75 × 10–¹ cm² V–¹ s–¹, which has exceeded the mobility of the one-dimensional α-aNDT-based PaNDTDTFBT (4.70 × 10–² cm² V–¹ s–¹). This research demonstrated that the two-dimensional structure is an effective strategy to achieve higher OFET mobility, and the geometry of the main chain played a more significant role than that of the side chain in determining the physical and packing properties of polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acomposite polymers 3adensity functional theory 3afilms (materials) 3ageometry 3atransistors 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aChang, Shao-Ling1 aHuang, Kuo-Hsiu1 aCao, Fong-Yi1 aCheng, Kuang-Yi1 aSun, Han-Sheng1 aLai, Yu-Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1921-69231 aCheng, Yen-Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0780-45570 tMacromolecules.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 53, no. 18 p.7740-7748dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245006500185300001800250520140800268592002801676650001601704650002701720650002801747650002401775650001501799650001501814650001501829650001101844650001001855650001401865650002001879650001301899650001801912650002501930653002501955653002301980700002202003700002202025700002602047700002002073773012102093856008102214852000902295655001202304IND60651205420221117055310.0190711e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065120542DNAL7 a285832142pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820170007012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARTY, MATHIEU10aTrichomonas tenax and periodontal diseases: a concise review  ap. 1417-1425.  aPeriodontal diseases (gingivitis and periodontitis), result from a disruption of the host–oral microbiome homoeostasis. Whereas the pathological role of some specific bacterial strains during periodontal diseases is well documented, the impact of parasites in periodontium pathophysiology is still under debate. This review aims to collect data about the prevalence and the potential role of Trichomonas tenax during periodontal diseases. Data from 47 studies revealed that T. tenax prevalence in diseased periodontium ranged from 0 to 94·1%. The prevalence of oral protozoan infections was found to be largely greater in patients with periodontal diseases than with healthy periodontium. The parasite detection was mainly performed by direct microscopy. Trichomonas tenax presence was clearly correlated with periodontal disease. The high heterogeneity of its periodontal prevalence may be correlated with the diversity of the population screened (age, sex, systemic diseases), and the methods used for diagnosis. This protozoan seems to have the capacity to be involved in the inflammatory process of gum disease. Animal experimentation, using relevant physiopathological models of periodontitis, needs to be performed to investigate the ability of T. tenax to cause and/or worsen the disease. Further investigations using standardized experimental designs of epidemiologic studies are also needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichomonas 3aanimal experimentation 3aepidemiological studies 3aexperimental design 3agingivitis 3amicrobiome 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amouth 3aparasites 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3aperiodontitis 3aprotozoal infections 0aperiodontal diseases 0aparasitic diseases1 aLEMAITRE, MATHIEU1 aKÉMOUN, PHILIPPE1 aMORRIER, JEAN-JACQUES1 aMONSARRAT, PAUL0 tParasitology.g2017 Sept., v. 144, no. 11 p.1417-1425dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820170007013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007500171300001600246520079500262592002801057650001301085650001101098650001301109650000901122650000901131650001201140650001801152650001801170650001101188650001401199650001201213650001201225653000901237653002001246653001901266700005501285700005501340700001501395773011801410856008501528852000901613655001201622IND60610456620221121170027.0180828e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061045662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandsberger, S.10aDisequilibrium in the uranium and actinium series in oil scale samples  ap. 126-129.  aWe have investigated the disequilibrium of the uranium and actinium series and have found both ²²⁶Ra (90,200 ± 4300 Bq/kg) and ²²⁸Ra have activity concentrations orders of magnitude higher that ²³⁸U (1.83 ± 0.36 Bq/kg) and ²³²Th (7.0 ± 0.4) which are at the head of the decay series.

This study reports for the first time the drying kinetics of skim milk droplets with 50wt.% initial solids, as typically encountered in practice. The changes in droplet temperature, moisture content, and diameter were experimentally determined using glass-filament single droplet drying technique. Enhanced effects of drying temperature on droplet shrinkage were observed. Experimental data were correlated using the Reaction Engineering Approach (REA) with the master activation-energy curve providing a good description to the drying histories. Activation energy curves obtained here were compared with previous data from lower initial concentrations, as well as the plot obtained using a preliminary desorption method. The outcomes support the suitability of REA to interpret the drying behavior of skim milk with high initial solids level, which is the norm for practical spray drying of milk with feed concentration of around 50wt.%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adesorption 3adroplets 3adrying temperature 3aengineering 3ashrinkage 3askim milk 3aspray drying 3awater content1 aWoo, Meng Wai1 aSelomulya, Cordelia1 aChen, Xiao Dong1 aPatel, Kamlesh1 aSchuck, Pierre1 aJeantet, Romain0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 Apr., v. 109, no. 4 p.701-711dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009400165300001600259500001900275520206900294592002802363650001702391650001902408650002002427650001202447650001302459650001302472650001802485650001302503650001402516650002202530650001702552650000902569650002702578650001202605650001002617651001502627700001402642700002102656773014102677856008602818852000902904655001202913IND60694283320221120082130.0200511e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069428332DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2004.115117432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, R10aIdenti®cation and characterization of plum and pluot cultivars by microsatellite markers  ap. 164-169.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPluots are putative hybrids between plums (Prunus salicina Lindl.) and apricots (P. armeniaca L.). The capability to distinguish among plum and pluot cultivars is important in breeding and cultivation. We investigated the genetic diversity among 14 plums, 6 pluots and one plumcot representing commercial cultivars in California, with 28 microsatellite markers. We also tested seven apricot cultivars as a reference to ®nd evidence of apricot in the ancestry of pluots and plumcot. The parental material used in the original cross that produced the pluot and plumcot was not available. Of the 28 SSR markers, 25 were from sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) and three from peach (Prunus persica L.). Approximately 80% of the cherry primers generated ampli®cation products in plum and pluots, showing transportability between these Prunus species. One to eight putative alleles per locus were displayed by the tested SSRs in plums and pluots. In plum and pluot samples a total of 100 alleles were identi®ed with an average of 4.3 alleles per primer combination. The SSR markers were successfully used for the discrimination of all tested cultivars. In pluots, 76 alleles were found in which 63 (83%) were speci®cally coming from plum, 9 (12%) were common in plum, pluots and apricot while no allele in the pluots was observed that was contributed from apricot. In plumcot, 49 alleles were observed in which 25 (51%) were from plum, 18 (36%) were speci®cally from apricot and 6 (12%) were common in plum, plumcot and apricot. Relationships among the 28 plum, pluot and apricot cultivars were represented by a dendrogram, constructed on the basis of 168 SSR markers. The dendrogram showed the plums and pluots form a cluster distinct from the apricots, with pluot cultivars interspersed among plum cultivars and more closely related to plum than to apricot. Plumcot made a separate branch and was placed between the plum and apricot cluster. These results suggest that the SSR markers are valuable tools for identi®cation of cultivars and diversity analyses in plum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3aPrunus persica 3aPrunus salicina 3aalleles 3aancestry 3aapricots 3abiotechnology 3acherries 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3ahorticulture 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apeaches 3aplums 3aCalifornia1 aPotter, D1 aSouthwick, S.

The morophology change of osteoblasts was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cell viability was studied by MTT analysis. BMP2 expression was analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Mineralization ability of osteoblasts was researched by using alizarin red staining method. The results indicate that a very low concentration (0.06 μM) of sodium cyclamate can curle and fold microfilament and microtubule of osteoblasts. The increase addition of sodium cyclamate resulted significantly decrease of cells viability. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) was seriously suppressed by sodium cyclamate. Alizarin Red staining experiment revealed that sodium cyclamate decreased the mineralization ability of osteoblasts. The present results suggest that sodium cyclamate can seriously inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aalizarin 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acell viability 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afluorescent antibody technique 3amicrotubules 3amineralization 3aosteoblasts 3asodium cyclamate 3astaining 3atoxicity 0aOsteoporosis 0aSodium cyclamate 0aFood safety 0aSweetener1 aChen, Guanyu1 aZhou, Kang1 aZhang, Peng1 aRen, Xiuli1 aMei, Xifan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Jan. 08, v. 508, no. 2 p.507-511dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.11.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011100208500001900319520165000338592002801988650002402016650002602040650002202066650001202088650001102100650002402111650001402135650001302149650001802162650001802180650002402198650001102222650001102233650001502244650001202259650001502271650001602286651001202302653001302314653001702327653002702344653001202371653001602383700001802399700002202417700002602439700005802465700002302523700002002546773010702566856008602673852000902759655001202768IND60713969920221122052455.0201202e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071396992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1060702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCannon, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5238-686310aHydrodynamic habitat thresholds for mangrove vegetation on the shorelines of a microtidal estuarine lagoon  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough understanding the requisite hydrodynamic habitat for mangrove vegetation is vital for successful restoration efforts, few studies have quantitatively assessed the in-situ tolerance of mangroves to relevant physical forcing mechanisms. In this work, hydrodynamic thresholds for the persistence of mangrove vegetation (Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans, and Laguncularia racemosa) are assessed using a hindcast wind-wave model coupled with a high-resolution shoreline survey, with analysis including 383 km of shoreline located in a microtidal estuary along the Atlantic coast of Florida (north Indian River Lagoon, USA). Observed mangrove distribution patterns were most strongly correlated with the modelled wave climate (p < 0.001) and measured intertidal slope (Sₒ; p < 0.001), and mangrove presence probabilities were maximized for sample sites characterized by low slopes (Sₒ < 0.5) and weakly energetic waves (80th percentile wave height: H₈₀ < 2.5 cm). Critical wave thresholds (mean ± 95% confidence interval) of H₅₀=4.2 ± 0.4cm and H₈₀ = 8.0 ± 0.5cm were estimated for 50th and 80th percentile wave heights, respectively, representing the wave climate limits above which mangrove presence probabilities fall below 50%. Low intertidal slopes were observed to enhance mangrove wave tolerance (Sₒ≅0; H₈₀ = 9 cm) while high slopes led to dramatic reductions in threshold wave heights (Sₒ≅1; H₈₀ = 4 cm). These results have important implications for future restoration efforts, providing the first available quantitative wave thresholds for mangrove habitat suitability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia germinans 3aLaguncularia racemosa 3aRhizophora mangle 3aclimate 3acoasts 3aconfidence interval 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3alittoral zone 3amangrove ecosystems 3amodels 3arivers 3ashorelines 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awater waves 3aFlorida 0aMangrove 0aWave climate 0aHydrodynamic threshold 0aEstuary 0aRestoration1 aKibler, Kelly1 aDonnelly, Melinda1 aMcClenachan, Giovanna1 aWalters, Linda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7593-00561 aRoddenberry, Annie1 aPhagan, Jessica0 tEcological engineering.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 158 p.106070-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1060703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013600166300001600302500001900318520161200337592002801949650002101977650001601998650001802014650001002032650002102042650001802063650001102081650001702092650001202109650001302121650001402134650001302148650001302161650000902174650001902183650001702202650001002219651001402229700001602243700001602259700001302275700001702288700001702305773014102322856008602463852000902549655001202558IND60694283820221123010343.0200511e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069428382DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2004.115117492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, H10aEffect of nitrogen on the skin colour and other quality attributes of ripe ‘Kensington Pride’ mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit  ap. 204-210.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNear-ripe ‘Kensington Pride’ mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit with green skin colour generally return lower wholesale and retail prices. Pre-harvest management, especially nitrogen (N) nutrition, appears to be a major causal factor. To obtain an understanding of the extent of the problem in the Burdekin district (dry tropics; the major production area in Australia), green mature ‘Kensington Pride’ mango fruit were harvested from ten orchards and ripened at 20 ± 0.5 ° C. Of these orchards, 70% produced fruit with more than 25% of the skin surface area green when ripe. The following year, the effect of N application on skin colour and other quality attributes was investigated on three orchards, one with a high green (HG) skin problem and two with a low green (LG) skin problem. N was applied at pre-flowering and at panicle emergence at the rate of 0, 75, 150, 300 g per tree (soil applied) or 50 g per tree as foliar N for the HG orchard, and 0, 150, 300, 450 g per tree (soil applied) or 50 g per tree (foliar) for the LG orchards. In all orchards the proportion of green colour on the ripe fruit was significantly (P<0.05) higher with soil applications of 150 g N or more per tree. Foliar sprays resulted in a higher proportion of green colour than the highest soil treatment in the HG orchard, but not in the LG orchards. Anthracnose disease severity was significantly (P<0.05) higher with 300 g of N per tree or foliar treatment in the HG orchard, compared with no additional N. Thus, N can reduce mango fruit quality by increasing green colour and anthracnose disease in ripe fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aanthracnose 3abiotechnology 3acolor 3adisease severity 3afruit quality 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3amangoes 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aorchards 3apanicles 3asoil 3asoil treatment 3asurface area 3atrees 3aAustralia1 aHofman, P.,1 aHolmes, R.,1 aBally, I1 aStubbings, B1 aMcconchie, R0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 79, no. 2 p.204-210dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2004.115117493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245006500199300001800264506007600282520159600358592002801954506003701982650002202019650001902041650001702060650001102077650004402088650002102132650001402153650003702167650003302204700002102237700002502258700001802283700002302301700002602324700002202350700002002372700001802392700001802410700002002428700001902448773010402467856007502571852000902646655001202655IND60530997420221207110139.0160723e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053099742DNAL7 a10.1021/bi30070592doi7 aPMC34450462pmcid7 a229288102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEibl, Clarissa10aStructural and Functional Analysis of the NLRP4 Pyrin Domain  ap. 7330-7341.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNLRP4 is a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family of cytosolic receptors and a member of an inflammation signaling cascade. Here, we present the crystal structure of the NLRP4 pyrin domain (PYD) at 2.3 Å resolution. The NLRP4 PYD is a member of the death domain (DD) superfamily and adopts a DD fold consisting of six α-helices tightly packed around a hydrophobic core, with a highly charged surface that is typical of PYDs. Importantly, however, we identified several differences between the NLRP4 PYD crystal structure and other PYD structures that are significant enough to affect NLRP4 function and its interactions with binding partners. Notably, the length of helix α3 and the α2−α3 connecting loop in the NLRP4 PYD are unique among PYDs. The apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) is an adaptor protein whose interactions with a number of distinct PYDs are believed to be critical for activation of the inflammatory response. Here, we use co-immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid, and nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift perturbation analysis to demonstrate that, despite being important for activation of the inflammatory response and sharing several similarities with other known ASC-interacting PYDs (i.e., ASC2), NLRP4 does not interact with the adaptor protein ASC. Thus, we propose that the factors governing homotypic PYD interactions are more complex than the currently accepted model, which states that complementary charged surfaces are the main determinants of PYD–PYD interaction specificity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrystal structure 3ahydrophobicity 3ainflammation 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprecipitin tests 3areceptors 3astructure-activity relationships 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aGrigoriu, Simina1 aHessenberger, Manuel1 aWenger, Julia1 aPuehringer, Sandra1 aPinheiro, Anderson S.1 aWagner, Roland N.1 aProell, Martina1 aReed, John C.1 aPage, Rebecca1 aDiederichs, Kay1 aPeti, Wolfgang0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 51, no. 37 p.7330-7341dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi30070593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009600169300001400265520113300279592002801412650002701440650001101467650001801478650002101496650002001517650001701537650001101554650001801565650001901583650001201602650002301614651001201637700003001649773012301679856005501802852000901857655001201866IND4464985820221121125121.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446498582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1470-6431.2011.01004.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKriwy, Peter10aHealth and environmental consciousness, costs of behaviour and the purchase of organic food  ap. 30-37.  aThis paper examines environmental and health consciousness, as well as behavioural costs and their effects on the purchase of organic products. The consumption of organic products is regarded as an investment in individual health. The low‐cost hypothesis takes environmental attitudes and behavioural costs into account and is applied to organic food consumption. The survey conducted in three German cities in 2006 using self‐administered questionnaires (n = 521) does not investigate willingness to pay but rather self‐reported behaviour. The results of the regressions using the Heckman correction show that income does not affect the regularity of organic food consumption but that it does influence individual expenditure on organic food. Furthermore, there is an inverted u‐shaped relation between age and the purchase of organic products. Although health consciousness has a stronger association with organic food consumption than does environmental concern, the interaction between behavioural costs and health or environmental consciousness shows no effect. Thus, the low‐cost hypothesis is not supported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acities 3aconsciousness 3afood consumption 3afood purchasing 3ahuman health 3aincome 3aorganic foods 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 3aGermany1 aMecking, Rebecca‐Ariane0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2012 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.30-37dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1470-64237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2011.01004.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014100174300001400315520077700329592002801106650001801134650001901152650002001171650001901191650001501210650002601225650002901251700001401280700001801294773009301312856008401405852000901489655001201498IND60113018520221120045224.0141111e20121109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011301852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoestheden, Matthew10aFast, extraction-free analysis of chlorinated phenols in well water by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 68-73.  aA fast and sensitive analytical method was developed for the chlorinated phenols included in the Canadian Drinking Water Guidelines without the need for costly, time-consuming sample extraction and concentration. Sensitivity and specificity were achieved by derivatization with dansyl chloride and detection via liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The dansyl-modified analytes displayed method detection limits in the range of 0.01–1.0μg/L, enabling the direct determination of chlorophenols from well water without sample enrichment. Recoveries (n=4 days) ranged from 91 to 101% and accuracies were between 79 and 116% (n=4).

Positive results were obtained from 36/54 (67%) neck and 24/32 (75%) tongue samples using an 18S rDNA PCR. A 468 base pair consensus sequence that was generated from the 18S rDNA PCR amplicons (KX229728) showed 100% identity to Sarcocystis lutrae. The ITS1 PCR results revealed that 12/20 (60%) neck and 10/20 (50%) tongue samples were positive for Sarcocystidae DNA. A 1074 bp consensus sequence was generated from the ITS1 PCR amplicons (KX431307) and showed 100% identity to S. lutrae. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis support the finding that the rDNA found in badgers is identical to that of S. lutrae. This parasite has not been previously reported in badgers or in the UK.

The primary objective of the research is to compare the relative efficiency of these two systems in relation to a metafrontier that envelops both technologies. In addition, the article analyses how efficient each growing system is at using its own technology, that is, when farms’ efficiency is benchmarked in relation to the best practices in their group. Contrary to conventional practice, farms’ performance is analyzed in terms of specific growing tasks: soil and plant cover management, pruning, fertilization and phytosanitary treatments. The results obtained highlight that both organic and conventional orchards would be able to achieve substantial global cost savings if they reached the maximum level of efficiency that their technological restrictions permit. They also reveal that the gap between the levels of efficiency on the frontier of each of the systems and the metafrontier is much wider in the case of organic citriculture than in conventional growing systems. Consequently, there is evidence that the limitations imposed on organic citriculture by regulatory and technological determinants have a significant impact on the relative efficiency of organic orchards in citrus fruit production, with potential consequences as regards their financial viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3acitrus fruits 3aconventional farming 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic sustainability 3afarms 3afruit growing 3aorchards 3aorganic production 3apruning 3asoil 3aSpain 0aOrganic citrus farming 0aTechnical efficiency 0aData envelopment analysis 0aDirectional distance function 0aMetafrontier1 aReig Martínez, Ernest,0 tAgricultural systems.g2014 July, v. 129 p.115-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2014.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245017500161300001600336520136200352592002801714650001401742650001201756650001601768650001501784650001701799650001301816650002001829650000901849650004201858650001401900650002501914650003601939650001701975650001801992650000902010650002002019650001202039650001802051650000902069650001902078650001402097650002102111650002202132650001702154650003802171650003202209650001802241653001902259653002102278653001402299653002702313653000902340653002602349700001402375700002102389700002102410700001802431700002202449700002102471700001802492700001702510700005702527773014602584856008302730852000902813655001202822IND60625050020221120052441.0190206e20190108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062505002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.11.1752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chi10a5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), enhances heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression and attenuates tubulointerstitial fibrosis and renal apoptosis in chronic cyclosporine nephropathy  ap. 583-589.  aCyclosporine-A (CsA) is an immunosuppressant indicated for various immunological diseases; however, it can induce chronic kidney injury. Oxidative stress and apoptosis play a crucial role in CsA-induced nephrotoxicity. The present study evaluated the protective effect of combining 5-aminolaevulinic acid with iron (5-ALA/SFC), a precursor of heme synthesis, to enhance HO-1 activity against CsA-induced chronic nephrotoxicity.Mice were divided into three groups: the control group (using olive oil as a vehicle), CsA-only group, and CsA+5-ALA/SFC group. After 28 days, the mice were sacrificed, and blood and kidney samples were collected. In addition to histological and biochemical examination, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines was assessed.Renal function in the 5-ALA/SFC treatment group as assessed by the serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels was superior to that of the CsA-only treatment group, demonstrating that 5-ALA/SFC significantly attenuated CsA-induced kidney tissue inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, and tubular atrophy, as well as reducing the mRNA level of TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β1, and iNOS while increasing HO-1.The activity of 5-ALA/SFC has important implications for clarifying the mechanism of HO-1 activity in CsA-induced nephrotoxicity and may provide a favorable basis for clinical therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aatrophy 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3acyclosporine 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3aheme 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahistology 3aimmunologic diseases 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3airon 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anephrotoxicity 3aolive oil 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurea nitrogen 0aCyclosporine-A 0aOxidative stress 0aApoptosis 0a5-Aminolaevulinic acid 0aIron 0aHeme oxygenase (HO)-11 aZhu, Ping1 aFujino, Masayuki1 aIsaka, Yoshitaka1 aIto, Hidenori1 aTakahashi, Kiwamu1 aNakajima, Motowo1 aTanaka, Tohru1 aZhuang, Jian1 aLi, Xiao-Kang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0897-21410 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Jan. 08, v. 508, no. 2 p.583-589dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.11.1753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008500172300001600257520154800273592002801821650002001849650001401869650002901883650002301912650001801935650001801953650001001971650000901981650001201990650001202002651001202014653001202026653002002038653001202058653001702070653002002087700002202107700002602129700001802155700002002173700001802193773011802211856008502329852000902414655001202423IND60610457220221121100902.0180828e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061045722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCinelli, Giorgia10aMapping uranium concentration in soil: Belgian experience towards a European map  ap. 220-234.  aA map of uranium concentration in soil has been planned for the European Atlas of Natural Radiation. This Atlas is being developed by the Radioactivity Environmental Monitoring (REM) group of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. The great interest in uranium compared to other terrestrial radionuclides stems from the fact that radon (²²²Rn) is in the decay chain of uranium (²³⁸U) and that public exposure to natural ionizing radiation is largely due to indoor radon.With several different databases available, including data (albeit not calibrated) from an airborne survey, Belgium is a favourable case for exploring the methodology of uranium mapping. A harmonized database of uranium in soil was built by merging radiological (not airborne) and geochemical data. Using this harmonized database it was possible to calibrate the data from the airborne survey.Several methods were used to perform spatial interpolation and to smooth the data: moving average without constraint, by soil class and by geological unit. When using the harmonized database, it is first necessary to evaluate the uranium concentration in areas without data or with an insufficient number of data points.Overall, there is a reasonable agreement between the maps on a 1 km × 1 km grid obtained with the two datasets (airborne U and harmonized soil U) with all the methods. The agreement is better when the maps are reduced to a 10 km × 10 km grid; the latter could be used for the European map of uranium concentration in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aionizing radiation 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3aradon 3asoil 3asurveys 3auranium 3aBelgium 0aBelgium 0aUranium in soil 0aMapping 0aSoil classes 0aGeological unit1 aTondeur, Francois1 aDehandschutter, Boris1 aBossew, Peter1 aTollefsen, Tore1 aDe Cort, Marc0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.220-234dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014000166300001600306520167800322592002802000650000802028650002602036650001802062650002502080650003102105650001102136650003702147650005102184650001302235650002002248650001402268650001102282650002602293653001102319653002802330653001302358653001602371653000802387653001302395700002002408700002202428700002102450700002402471700002502495700001902520700001702539700001902556700001702575700001802592773012102610856008202731852000902813655001202822IND60533276220221122184238.0160728e20151204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053327622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.10.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeno, Hideaki10aAugmentation of invadopodia formation in temozolomide-resistant or adopted glioma is regulated by c-Jun terminal kinase–paxillin axis  ap. 240-247.  aTemozolomide (TMZ) is one of the few effective anticancer agents against gliomas. However, acquisition of TMZ resistance or adaptation by gliomas is currently a crucial problem, especially increased invasiveness which is critical for the determination of clinical prognosis. This study investigated the molecular regulatory mechanisms of TMZ resistance in gliomas involved in invasiveness, particularly invadopodia formation, a molecular complex formed at the invasive front to cause extracellular matrix degradation during cellular local invasion. The TMZ-resistant clone of the U343 MG human glioma cell line (U343-R cells) was established. U343-R cells demonstrated higher invadopodia formation compared with U343 cells without TMZ resistance (U343-Con cells). Immunoblot analysis of DNA damage-related mitogen-activated protein kinase signals found increased phosphorylation of c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) and higher activation of its downstream signaling in U343-R cells compared with U343-Con cells. Treatment of U343-R cells with specific inhibitors of JNK or siRNA targeting JNK suppressed up-regulation of invadopodia formation. In addition, paxillin, one of the known JNK effectors which is phosphorylated and affects cell migration, was phosphorylated at serine 178 in JNK activity-dependent manner. Expression of paxillin with mutation of the serine 178 phosphorylation site in U343-R cells blocked invadopodia formation. The present findings suggest that increased formation of invadopodia in U343-R cells is mediated by hyperactivation of JNK-paxillin signaling, and both JNK and paxillin might become targets of novel therapies against TMZ-resistant gliomas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell movement 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3aprognosis 3aserine 3asmall interfering RNA 0aGlioma 0aTemozolomide-resistance 0aInvasion 0aInvadopodia 0aJNK 0aPaxillin1 aTomiyama, Arata1 aYamaguchi, Hideki1 aUekita, Takamasa1 aShirakihara, Takuya1 aNakashima, Katsuhiko1 aŌtani, Naoki,1 aWada, Kojiro1 aSakai, Ryuichi1 aArai, Hajime1 aMori, Kentaro0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Dec. 04, v. 468 p.240-247dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.10.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008200167300001600249500001900265520087300284592002801157650003001185650001801215650001901233650001401252650002401266650000901290650001901299650001701318650001101335650002201346650002201368700001401390773014101404856008601545852000901631655001201640IND60694285320221120071503.0200511e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069428532DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2004.115117642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeh, D.

The extent to which electrolyte leakage from English ivy leaf discs, measured using a test for cell membrane thermostability (CMT), could be related to the reduction to shoot dry weight induced by heat in the greenhousegrown plants was determined. A curved relationship existed between the relative injury (RI) value occurring in leaf tissue discs of English ivy cultivars and treatment temperature. A single temperature treatment at 50°C resulted in injury values near the midpoint of the response curve and showed the greatest sensitivity in detecting genotypic differences in heat tolerance. The cultivars with a high RI value are those with the lesser CMT and more reduction in shoot dry weights by high day/night temperature at 35/30°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHedera helix subsp. helix 3abiotechnology 3acell membranes 3acultivars 3aelectrolyte leakage 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ahorticulture 3aleaves 3anight temperature 3athermal stability1 aHsu, P.Y.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 79, no. 2 p.298-302dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2004.115117643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245009600208300001600304520096100320592002801281650001201309650001701321650001801338650001101356650001001367650000901377650001301386651001201399653001001411653002001421653001701441653003001458653005101488700002001539700001901559700001601578700001501594700001401609700001701623700005801640700001501698700001501713700001301728773011801741856008501859852000901944655001201953IND60610457320221121100907.0180828e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061045732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedmann, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9813-652510aIndoor radon, geogenic radon surrogates and geology – Investigations on their correlation  ap. 382-389.  aThe indoor radon concentration was measured in most houses in a couple of municipalities in Austria. At the same time the activity concentration of radium in soil, the soil gas radon concentration, the permeability of the ground and the ambient dose equivalent rate were also measured and the geological situations (geological units) were recorded too. From the indoor radon concentration and different house and living parameters a radon potential (Austrian radon potential) was derived which should represent the radon concentration in a standard room. Another radon potential (Neznal radon potential) was calculated from the soil gas radon concentration and the permeability. The aim of the investigation was to correlate all the different variables and to test if the use of surrogate data (e.g. geological information, ambient dose equivalent rate, etc.) can be used to judge the radon risk for an area without performing numerous indoor measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageology 3apermeability 3aradioactivity 3aradium 3aradon 3arisk 3asoil air 3aAustria 0aRadon 0aRadon potential 0aIndoor radon 0aGeogenic radon surrogates 0aRadon correlated with environmental parameters1 aBaumgartner, A.1 aBernreiter, M.1 aGräser, J.1 aGruber, V.1 aKabrt, F.1 aKaineder, H.1 aMaringer, F.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2492-22721 aRinger, W.1 aSeidel, C.1 aWurm, G.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.382-389dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245014800185300001800333520126400351592002801615650002201643650001301665650001101678650002901689650002301718650001701741650003501758650001901793650001101812650001401823650001501837650001801852650002001870650001701890650002401907651001101931653001601942653001401958653001901972653002601991700005802017700001902075700002002094700001602114773012002130856008102250852000902331655001202340IND60651206120221117060225.0190711e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065120612DNAL7 a288051642pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820170007862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBENNEMA, S.

In this paper, the spatial distribution of F. hepatica in bovines in Brazil was modelled using a decision tree approach and a logistic regression, combined with a geographic information system (GIS) query. In the decision tree and the logistic model, isothermality had the strongest influence on disease prevalence. Also, the 50-year average precipitation in the warmest quarter of the year was included as a risk factor, having a negative influence on the parasite prevalence. The risk maps developed using both techniques, showed a predicted higher prevalence mainly in the South of Brazil. The prediction performance seemed to be high, but both techniques failed to reach a high accuracy in predicting the medium and high prevalence classes to the entire country. The GIS query map, based on the range of isothermality, minimum temperature of coldest month, precipitation of warmest quarter of the year, altitude and the average dailyland surface temperature, showed a possibility of presence of F. hepatica in a very large area. The risk maps produced using these methods can be used to focus activities of animal and public health programmes, even on non-evaluated F. hepatica areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola hepatica 3aaltitude 3acattle 3adecision support systems 3adisease prevalence 3afascioliasis 3ageographic information systems 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3aparasites 3aprediction 3apublic health 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 3asurface temperature 3aBrazil 0aLiver fluke 0aruminants 0aprediction map 0ageospatial diagnostic1 aMOLENTO, M.

Morphological traits such as internodal length, leaf traits (area, colour attributes, fresh and dry weight), fruit number, fruit weight and yield were analysed. Correlations and step-wise regression equations were used to infer the relationship among the traits and fruit yield. Larger leaf area, greater internodal length, high leaf fresh weight, high leaf dry weight, small fruits and low fruit yield were observed in Arka Surya. Fresh weight, dry weight and lightness of leaf together showed significant regression (R² = 0.528) with annual fruit yield per plant. Arka Prabhath performed better than Arka Surya under coconut canopy with optimal fruit size and yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acoconuts 3acolor 3afruit size 3afruit weight 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agardens 3agynodioecy 3aleaf area 3aleaf dry mass 3aleaves 3apapayas1 aVaingankar, J.

This study explored the effect of white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) as cover crops on weed pressure and Fusarium infestation in spring wheat and spring barley grain under different tillage systems.Five tillage practices were investigated in a loam soil in long term tillage experiment in Central Lithuania in Dotnuva: deep ploughing (22–24 cm), shallow ploughing (16–18 cm), shallow harrowing (8–10 cm), deep harrowing (14–16 cm) and direct drilling, with and without cover crop. Cover crops were sown using fertilizer spreader: white mustard seed were spread before harvest of the spring wheat and spring barley in 2013 and 2014, respectively and white clover – at the beginning of vegetation of winter oilseed rape in early spring, in 2017. Cover crops effect on Fusarium fungi was evaluated in spring cereals grown after the cover crop: in spring barley in 2014 and in spring wheat in 2018.Both cover crops resulted in lower weed pressure for a post - harvest period under different tillage practises. White mustard suppressed weed air-dry mass up to 90 and white clover up to 99 percent. White mustard has influenced the decrease of Fusarium graminearum contamination in spring barley grain as well as white clover reduced F. culmorum infestation level in spring wheat grain. Our results suggest that white mustard and white clover as cover crops might be an option for integrated pest management in order to supplement weed control strategy and Fusarium head blight prevention under sustainable tillage practises.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aFusarium culmorum 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aSinapis alba subsp. alba 3aTrifolium repens 3acover crops 3adeep tillage 3adirect seeding 3afertilizers 3afungi 3aharrowing 3aharvest date 3aintegrated pest management 3aloam soils 3amustard seed 3aphysical properties 3aplowing 3aspring 3aspring barley 3aspring wheat 3atopsoil 3avegetation 3aweed control 3aweeds 3awinter 3aLithuania 0aWhite mustard 0aWhite clover 0aExtensive tillage1 aSuproniene, Skaidre1 aAuskalniene, Ona1 aPranaitiene, Simona1 aSvegzda, Povilas1 aVersuliene, Agne1 aCeseviciene, Jurgita1 aJanusauskaite, Daiva1 aFeiza, Virginijus0 tCrop protection.g2020 Jan., v. 127 p.104966-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245020200210520116800412592002801580650001101608650002201619650001601641650001101657650001301668650001301681650000901694650001601703650001301719650001501732653001901747653002401766653001701790653002201807653001401829653001801843700006001861700001901921700002201940700002101962773010801983856008802091852000902179655001202188IND60700775320221119102528.0200809e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070077532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1091842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrolov, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6564-982910aCAMPUS-S – The model of ground layer vegetation populations in forest ecosystems and their contribution to the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen. I. Problem formulation and description of the model  aThe CAMPUS-S model was developed to simulate ground-layer vegetation populations in forest ecosystems and their contribution to carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The model uses several modeling techniques: matrix, l-systems and cellular automata modeling. The genetic species-specific features are defined for each ontogenetic stage (L-systems), while their implementation for certain individuals in the course of modeling depends on external conditions (cellular automata). To implement the variance of the transitions between ontogenetic stages, the matrix modeling method is used. The spatial resolution of the model is 1 cm² and the time step is one month. The model consists of two submodels: a submodel of the plant populations’ structure, and a submodel of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in plants and soil. The space in the CAMPUS-S model is heterogeneous. The map of the microrelief is dynamically loaded from an external source, according to which the temperature and the moisture of the soil are distributed across space during the simulation. To implement the feedback mechanism between plants and soil, integration with the Romul_Hum model is performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aforest ecosystems 3amicrorelief 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aontogeny 3asoil 3atemperature 3avariance 3avegetation 0aCAMPUS-S model 0aPopulation dynamics 0aDwarf shrubs 0aCellular automata 0al-systems 0aMatrix models1 aShanin, Vladimir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8294-77961 aZubkova, Elena1 aBykhovets, Sergey1 aGrabarnik, Pavel0 tEcological modelling.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 431 p.109184-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1091843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008500167300001600252520101800268592002801286650004401314650002301358650001901381650000901400650002701409650001701436650001801453650001401471650001601485653001901501653000801520653001901528653001001547653002401557700001301581700001601594700001801610700001701628700001301645700001701658773012401675856008301799852000901882655001201891IND60582336520221121235115.0181012e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058233652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2017.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Qinghua10aEffects of CO2 on coal rapid pyrolysis behavior and chemical structure evolution  ap. 370-378.  aRapid pyrolysis of Shenfu bituminous coal was conducted with a wall temperature 1073–1473K and residence time 0–750ms in both CO2 and N2 atmospheres to study the pyrolysis mechanism in CO2 atmosphere. The interest was focused on mass loss, gas yield, element content of chars and a series of chemical structure parameters (CH2/CH3, Har/H, fa and (R/C)u) obtained by FT-IR analyses. The results show that varied impacts dominated on pyrolysis at different temperatures in CO2 atmosphere. Mass loss decreased at 1073K but increased at 1273 and 1473K. Both heterogeneous reaction of CO2 with char and homogeneous reactions of CO2 with volatile occurred during pyrolysis in CO2 atmosphere. The combined effect of enhanced polycondensation of aromatic rings and C-CO2 reaction has been found to increase the mass loss of char. More H-containing free radicals generated during polycondensation, which consequenctly increase combination possibility with other radical fragments to inhibit the cross-linking reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acondensation reactions 3acrosslinking 3afree radicals 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aCoal pyrolysis 0aCO2 0aChar structure 0aFT-IR 0aOxy-fuel combustion1 aGao, Rui1 aLi, Hongjun1 aDai, Zhenghua1 aYu, Guangsuo1 aLiu, Xia1 aWang, Fuchen0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2017 Nov., v. 128 p.370-378dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2017.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245010300211300001600314500001900330520121100349592002801560650001701588650002201605650002101627650004401648650002701692650002701719650000901746650002901755650002801784650000901812650003701821650001501858650001801873650001901891650003701910650002101947650001901968700002501987700002002012700002202032700002102054773012102075856008202196852000902278655001202287IND60738195020221118051021.0210521e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073819502DNAL7 a10.1007/s40009-020-00982-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddiqui, Mahtab Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2043-711410aSynthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Evaluation of Piyar Gum-Induced Silver Nanoparticles  ap. 203-208.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBuchanania lanzan gum commonly known as char, achar, piyar and chironji is a naturally occurring water-soluble, edible polysaccharide derived from the bark of Buchanania lanzan Spreng. Silver nanoparticles have been synthesized using Buchanania lanzan gum exudates adopting green synthesis methodology and characterized by UV–Vis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential and particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirming the synthesis of AgNPs. The synthesized piyar gum-induced AgNPs are spherical in shape, small enough in size (14.74–19.86 nm) and noncytotoxic. Evaluation of bactericidal activity of synthesized piyar gum-induced AgNPs against 17 strains of 14 Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, using agar well diffusion method, exhibited strong bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration against two Gram-negative bacterial strains, i.e., Escherichia coli and Avibacterium avium, was found to be 0.52 µg/mL and 0.53 µg/mL, respectively, which was at par with that of positive control (0.5 mM silver nitrate solution).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvibacterium 3aBuchanania lanzan 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3aatomic force microscopy 3abark 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ananosilver 3aparticle size 3asilver nitrate 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater solubility 3azeta potential1 aChowdhury, Arnab Roy1 aSingh, Bhoj Raj1 aMaurya, Sudarshan1 aPrasad, Niranjan0 tNational Academy science letters.g2021 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.203-208dSpringer IndiawJournal:21643x0250-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40009-020-00982-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013500168300001600303520137300319536034701692592002802039596007802067596007902145596006202224650001502286650001202301650002002313650003802333650001302371650000902384650001202393650001702405650001602422650001902438650002202457653002702479653002702506653002902533653002902562653003402591700002002625700002002645700001202665700001802677700001502695700001902710700001702729773012802746856008502874852000902959655001202968IND60636326420221119113109.0190408e20190503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063632642DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2019.15801972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Ju-Lan10aThermal energy storage and thermodynamic properties of (E)-3-m-tolylbut-2-enoic acid as a medium temperature phase change material  ap. 468-475.  aPhase change materials (PCMs) that can store and release heat energy over the temperature range from 363 to 393 K are crucial for solar absorption cooling, and it is worthy to seek new solid-liquid PCMs candidates that melt and crystallize in this temperature range. In this paper, (E)-3-m-tolylbut-2-enoic acid (mTBEA) was applied as a PCM candidate. Its thermal energy storage properties and thermal stability were systematically investigated. The results showed that mTBEA melted at 382.9 ± 0.5 K and crystallized at about 364 K, with a melting enthalpy (ΔfᵤₛH) of 138.4 ± 6.9 J g⁻¹ and showed good long-term cyclic stability and thermal stability. The supercooling of mTBEA was stabilized at about 20 K, indicating that the conservation condition of melted mTBEA could be simple. In addition, the melted mTBEA could release all the absorbed thermal energy upon crystallizing. Besides, mTBEA exhibited good thermal stability for it to be applied as PCM. Hence, mTBEA is a promising PCM candidate for solar absorption cooling. Furthermore, the heat capacity of mTBEA was measured by modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MTDSC) over the temperature range from 198.15 to 431.15 K, and the molar thermodynamic functions, [HT-H₂₉₈.₁₅]ₘ and [ST-S₂₉₈.₁₅]ₘ, were calculated based on the fitted molar heat capacity data.  aThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (2017JJ1026, 13JJ3068), the Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department (15B0002) and Guangxi Key Laboratory of Information Materials (Guilin University of Electronic Technology), P.R.

However, such a prediction is now hindered by the paucity of suitable nanodescriptors with applicable nanostructure annotation methods. Inspired by face recognition technology, we have developed a novel nanostructure annotation method to automatically convert nanostructures to images for convolutional neural network modeling. In this operation, nanostructure features were directly learned from nanoparticle images without complicated nanodescriptor calculations. The constructed convolutional neural network models were successfully used to predict physicochemical properties (i.e., logP and zeta potential) and biological activities (i.e., cellular uptake and protein adsorption) of 147 unique nanoparticles, including 123 gold nanoparticles, 12 platinum nanoparticles, and 12 palladium nanoparticles. Our nanostructure diversity and wide distribution of experimental values are beneficial for building predictive deep learning models. The deep learning models provide highly accurate predictions with all determination coefficients (R²) higher than 0.68 for both cross validation and external prediction. In addition, the constructed model is explainable because we can visualize how it learns from the class activation map. This approach enables a much more efficient end-to-end deep learning modality suitable for design of next generation nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aartificial intelligence 3aface 3agreen chemistry 3ananogold 3aneural networks 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3aprediction 3azeta potential 0aFace recognition 0aNano−Bio interaction 0aNanostructure annotation 0aNanomaterial design1 aZhang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3074-56471 aRusso, Daniel P.1 aZhu, Hao1 aYan, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7970-67640 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 8, no. 51 p.19096-19104dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c074533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005700188245006200245300001400307506007600321520057200397592002800969506003700997650003101034650001701065650001601082650001401098700001601112773010901128856008101237852000901318655001201327IND60601683720221207094056.0180706e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060168372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2014.01.0072doi7 aPMC52281632pmcid7 a246076422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEoh, Hyungjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5164-582410aAllostery and compartmentalization: old but not forgotten  ap. 23-29.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHomeostasis is an essential capability of all cells mediated by complex and diverse regulatory networks.

Recently, mechanochemical C–H bond activation has received due attention and the use of low-valent first-row transition metals in C–C cross-coupling via C–H activation under mechanochemical conditions is an additional feather to the cost-effectiveness of such useful synthetic protocols. The present method allows direct C-2 alkenylation of indoles in a mixer mill, employing a commercially available low-valent manganese catalyst, MnBr(CO)₅, providing a sustainable route to hydroindolation on alkynes. The developed protocol is highly C-2-selective by the presence of a heteroaromatic N atom as a directing group (namely, pyridyl) and tolerant of structural variations with electron-rich and electron-deficient substituents both in the indoles and in the alkynes. Silica as the grinding media and the presence of a catalytic amount of acid and DIPEA as the base worked favorably to afford a variety of 2-alkenyl indoles in excellent yields at ambient conditions. The terminal alkynes offered better results than internal alkynes in terms of yields and reactivity. The scalability of the reaction was demonstrated by conducting the reactions in the gram scale. A short study indicated that a little tweak in conditions can be useful for double alkenylation to afford carbazole derivatives in moderate yields. A low E-factor along with a clean reaction profile, an easy experimental setup, the absence of an anhydrous condition, and being devoid of toxic organic solvents proclaims its advantage over the available conventional methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalysts 3acost effectiveness 3across-coupling reactions 3agreen chemistry 3aindoles 3amanganese 3amechanochemistry 3aregioselectivity 3asilica 3atoxicity 0amanganese-catalyzed 0aC−H bond activation 0ahigh regioselectivity 0amixer milling 0asustainable synthesis1 aBhosle, Akhil A.1 aPanjikar, Padmini C.1 aChatterjee, Amrita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8666-27231 aBanerjee, Mainak1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6833-55310 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 8, no. 51 p.19105-19116dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c074653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01611naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245006500166500001400231520073200245592002800977650001201005650002401017651001101041700002001052700002401072700002101096773012001117856007501237852000901312655001201321IND60711624920221119031607.0200928e20200824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071162492DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100914872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonkowski, Slawomir 10aHistorical Surgical Treatments in Polish Veterinary Medicine  aNAL-light  aSeveral methods of surgical treatments have been used in the history of Polish veterinary medicine, many of which have now been forgotten.

This method relies on the use of the CaCl₂ solution and enables both the efficient disorganization and amorphization of high-amylose starch granules with low energy consumption and the reinforcement of the starch chain network by starch–metal cation complexation. Specifically, the method involves a simple mixing of a high-amylose starch with the CaCl₂ solution followed by heating the mixture at 80 °C for 5 min. The whole process is completely environmentally benign, without any waste liquid or bioproducts generated. These resulting materials displayed tunable mechanical strength (500–1300 kPa), elongation at break (15–32%), Young’s modulus (4–9 MPa), toughness (0.05–0.26 MJ/m³), and suitable electrical resistivity (3.7–9.2 Ω·m). Moreover, the developed materials were responsive to external stimuli such as strain and liquids, satisfying the requirements for wearable sensor applications. Besides, composed of only starch, CaCl₂, and water, the materials are much cheaper and eco-friendly (can be consumed by fish) compared with other polymer-based conductive hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3acations 3aelectrical resistance 3aenergy 3afish 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogels 3aliquids 3astrength (mechanics) 0astarch-based ionically conductive materials 0agreen biopolymer engineering 0aeco-friendly materials 0awearable sensors 0astrain-responsiveness 0aliquid-responsiveness1 aMa, Cong1 aLi, Ying1 aWang, Liming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9470-21121 aWei, Linjie1 aYan, Yinlei1 aXie, Fengwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2033-082X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 18, v. 8, no. 51 p.19117-19128dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c074733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245009400205300001300299520185900312592002802171596012102199650002802320650001102348650001302359650002002372650001902392650001802411650001802429650002402447650001202471650001002483650001602493650002302509650002002532650001002552653002102562653002002583653002102603653002002624653001802644653001402662700001702676700001802693700001902711773011902730856007902849852000902928655001202937IND60655120720221120133706.0191018e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065512072DNAL7 a10.1093/jmammal/gyy1612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Phoebe D1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3658-514610aAssessing space use in meadow voles: the relationship to reproduction and the stress axis  ap. 4-12.  aVoles are key mammals in understanding how social interactions can affect large-scale population processes. Previous studies have shown that at high population densities, meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) have a lower proportion of breeding animals, higher average corticosterone levels, and can be limited by female territorial spacing. Based on this, we compared corticosterone levels and spatial use between breeding and nonbreeding free-ranging adult meadow voles within populations. We measured intrasexual spatial overlap to examine if breeding females minimize occupying the same areas as other females, and noninvasively assessed corticosterone levels using fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs). We found that female meadow voles have much lower intrasexual spatial overlap than males, even though both sexes have similar range sizes, and that females have generally higher FCM levels than males. However, breeding and nonbreeding females did not differ from one another in spatial use or in FCM levels. Conversely, reproductive classes of males differed greatly in all measures: nonbreeding males had FCM levels that were two times higher than those of breeding males, occupied a smaller range, and had lower spatial overlap, indicating they were moving less widely than breeding males. We additionally validated an enzyme immunoassay for noninvasively measuring FCMs in meadow voles. The assay was successful in detecting an increase in corticosterone stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone injection; however, dexamethasone did not induce negative feedback. FCMs reflect circulating corticosterone levels approximately 5 h prior. These results highlight differences in FCMs and spacing in meadow voles related to sex and reproductive status, and reflect the respective strategies males and females employ during the breeding season.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGPIN-2016-05540cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038 3aMicrotus pennsylvanicus 3aadults 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3acorticosterone 3acorticotropin 3adexamethasone 3aenzyme immunoassays 3afemales 3amales 3ametabolites 3apopulation density 3asocial behavior 3avoles 0aassay validation 0aglucocorticoids 0amicrotine rodent 0asex differences 0asocial stress 0aspace use1 aDean, Erik K1 aPalme, Rupert1 aBoonstra, Rudy0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 100, no. 1 p.4-12dOxford University PresswJournal:11623x1545-15427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyy1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008100168300001600249520156100265592002801826596005401854596008201908596009101990596013702081650002302218650001302241650001902254650002202273650000902295650001002304650001102314650002402325650002002349650001402369650002202383650002102405653001202426653001502438653003802453700001402491700001702505700001702522700001402539700001602553700001402569700001302583773012202596856008502718852000902803655001202812IND60679265320221119103624.0191221e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067926532DNAL7 a10.1080/02705060.2019.16591902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Wenming10aEffects Of Short-Term Aerobic Conditions On Phosphorus Mobility In Sediments  ap. 649-661.  aIn this study, the effects of short-term aerobic conditions on phosphorus (P) mobility in sediment were investigated in the eutrophic lakes. To accomplish this, an indoor cultivation system was established and short-term cultivation (3, 8 and 15 days) was conducted under control and aerobic treatments. High-resolution diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and dialysis (HR-Peeper) techniques were used to determine the mobility patterns of P in sediments. The results showed that: (1) Aerobic treatment significantly increased oxygen concentrations (maximum 17.1%) in overlying water within 15 days, with no significant effects on sediment oxygen penetration depth or redox potential. Additionally, aerobic treatment inhibited soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and DGT-labile P release from sediment to overlying water. (2) Aerobic treatment decreased the pore water SRP and soluble Fe(II) on day 3 with no impact on sediment SRP/DGT-labile P and soluble/DGT-labile Fe on day 8 and 15. (3) Model simulation using DGT Induced Fluxes in Sediments (DIFS) showed that the pore water SRP replenishment ability of sediment particle P was lower in the aerobic group than the control group, and the sediment system equilibration time was elongated after pore water SRP decreased in the aerobic group on day 3. (4) On day 3, SRP and soluble Fe(II), DGT-labile P and DGT-labile Fe showed significant positive correlations (r > 0.888, p < 0.001), indicating that reduced pore water SRP concentration was related to decreased pore water soluble Fe(II).  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC0405205cNational Key R&D Program of China  a41701568, 41301531 and 51279060cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aQYZDJSSWDQC008cKey Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences  aNIGLAS2017GH04c“One-Three-Five” Strategic Planning of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aaerobic conditions 3adialysis 3aeutrophication 3afilms (materials) 3airon 3alakes 3aoxygen 3areactive phosphorus 3aredox potential 3asediments 3asimulation models 3awater solubility 0aAerobic 0aPhosphorus 0aDiffusive gradients in thin films1 aLiu, Ling1 aWu, Tingfeng1 aSong, Lanlan1 aWang, Han1 aLu, Zhanjin1 aLi, Botao1 aZhu, Yan0 tJournal of freshwater ecology.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 34, no. 1 p.649-661dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19692x2156-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2019.16591903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245010600215300001800321500001900339520133700358592002801695650001601723650001101739650002801750650001301778650002901791650001701820650001101837650001201848650001201860700005601872700006401928773011901992856008702111852000902198655001202207IND60740608520221117103708.0210603e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074060852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c006432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuthusseri, Dhanya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8594-268310aRecent Advances in Understanding the Formation and Mitigation of Dendrites in Lithium Metal Batteries  ap. 9187-9208.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLithium (Li) metal battery systems are currently gaining significant attention as the most energy-intensive architectures among the various battery architectures being actively examined at present for multiple emergent applications. Although the cathode chemistries in Li metal systems are fairly simple and far less challenging in liquid electrolytes, the metallic chemistry of the anode poses many challenging problems. The dendrite formation and consequent dead Li formation and short circuiting have rendered the practical realization of these promising battery systems extremely hard. Therefore, the issue of dendrite mitigation has recently triggered hectic research efforts by battery scientists around the globe. The major research thrust of this activity has primarily been on gaining deep insights into the dendrite formation using advanced characterization methods. In this review, we seek to understand the Li dendrite formation as an interplay between the solid electrolyte interphase and surface features. We try to understand the dendrite formation as a consequence of the above two parameters via advanced imaging techniques, like X-ray imaging techniques, X-ray computed tomography, atomic force microscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy. Finally, an outlook is presented suggesting the emergent research directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanodes 3aatomic force microscopy 3acathodes 3acryo-electron microscopy 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aliquids 3alithium1 aWahid, Malik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0904-73371 aOgale, Satishchandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5593-93390 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 May 13, v. 35, no. 11 p.9187-9208dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c006433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003200129040001800161100006000179245011100239300001600350520198300366592002802349596007102377596002402448596005902472650002702531650001402558650001102572650002102583650001502604650001202619650001602631651002302647653002102670653000902691653002002700653002702720653002302747700002002770700002102790773012202811856007902933961001203012852000903024655001203033IND60655120820221120133735.0191018e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065512082DNAL7 a10.1093/jmammal/gyy1622chorus7 a10.1093/jmammal/gyy1622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojas, Vanessa G1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0173-270810aFalse-positive occupancy models produce less-biased occupancy estimates for a rare and elusive bat species  ap. 212-222.  aConfirming presence and distribution of a species is necessary for effective conservation. However, obtaining robust occupancy estimates and confidently identifying factors important to occupancy may be difficult for rare and elusive species. Further, in surveys to assess presence, false-positive detections bias results; however, false-positive occupancy models can resolve this bias and, thus, better support conservation. We assessed the performance of false-positive versus standard occupancy models and important factors predicting presence for a low-density bat population in the southern Appalachian Mountains. From May to August 2013–2015, we surveyed 35 sites for northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) using both mist-net and acoustic methods. We compared AICc values for 13 standard occupancy models and 13 corresponding false-positive occupancy models. In our model comparison, false-positive models received more support, while none of the standard occupancy models were plausible. False-positive occupancy models produced a wider range of probability of occupancy estimates (0.004–0.998) and lower mean occupancy estimate (0.62) than standard models (0.482–0.970, mean = 0.86). Weighted parameter estimates for important predictors in two plausible false-positive occupancy models indicated the probability of occupancy for northern long-eared bats was higher at less-rugged, lower-elevation sites. In contrast, there was more ambiguity regarding the most plausible standard occupancy models and important predictors of occupancy from standard models. Due to low capture rates and the uncertainty of acoustic identifications, we recommend coupling a certain method with uncertain methods when surveying rare and elusive bat species. Applying false-positive occupancy models to our data yielded less-biased site-specific occupancy estimates and informative predictors, and, hence, more reliable predictions to inform conservation management plans.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000202  cUSDA Forest Service  cCherokee National Forest and Southern Research Station 3aMyotis septentrionalis 3aacoustics 3amodels 3anets (equipment) 3aprediction 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aAppalachian region 0aacoustic surveys 0abats 0acapture surveys 0aMyotis septentrionalis 0aoccupancy modeling1 aLoeb, Susan C.,1 aO’Keefe, Joy M0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 100, no. 1 p.212-222dOxford University PresswJournal:11623x1545-15427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyy1623Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle00935naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006800155300001800223520011300241592002800354650000800382650002300390650002300413700001700436773013300453856007400586852000900660655001200669IND60660237820221122060224.0190823e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066023782DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03291h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhiyu10aReporting transient molecular events by DNA strand displacement  ap. 8239-8241.  aTransient formation of DNA triplexes was reported by coupling with a permanent strand displacement reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions1 aMao, Chengde0 tChemical communications.g2014 July 1, v. 50, no. 60 p.8239-8241dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc03291h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245005700172300001400229520100300243592002801246650000801274650001501282650002001297650001501317650001901332650001401351650000901365650001701374650002001391650000901411650001301420653002101433653002101454653002401475653001901499773011001518856008601628852000901714655001201723IND60600237720221121022739.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060023772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTutak, Wojciech10aBioethanol E85 as a fuel for dual fuel diesel engine  ap. 39-48.  aThis study investigates the potential of E85 fuelling in a diesel engine.

The primary aim of the study was to determine the operating parameters of the engine powered on E85 bioethanol fuel in dual fuel system. The parameters that were taken into account are: engine efficiency, indicated mean effective pressure, heat release rate, combustion duration and ignition delay, combustion phasing and exhaust toxicity. With E85 fuel participation, NOx and soot emissions were reduced, whereas CO and HC emissions increased considerably. It was found that E85 participation in a combustible mixture reduced the excess air factor for the engine and this led to increased emissions of CO and HC, but decreased emissions of nitrogen oxides and soot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abioethanol 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aheat 3ahydrocarbons 3anitrogen oxides 3asoot 3atoxicity 0aDual fuel engine 0aExhaust emission 0aCombustion duration 0aIgnition delay0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Oct., v. 86 p.39-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015100173300001800324520171300342592002802055650002302083650001302106650001202119650001102131650002302142650002102165650001302186650002302199700001902222700001702241700001802258700001802276700002302294700002002317773010602337856008602443852000902529655001202538IND60580671820221118043412.0170926e20170926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058067182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b013382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGartner, Thomas
E.10aDomain Spacing and Composition Profile Behavior in Salt-Doped Cyclic vs Linear Block Polymer Thin Films: A Joint Experimental and Simulation Study  ap. 7169-7176.  aHerein, we leveraged lithium salt doping of linear and cyclic block polymers (BPs) in thin film geometries to demonstrate how BP architecture influences self-assembled nanofeature sizes and interfacial widths in nanostructured thin films as a function of segregation strength. To mitigate potential issues with sample-to-sample variability and time-consuming synthesis, we used a single linear BP specimen that was ring-closed to generate an analogous cyclic BP, and we mixed the cyclic and/or parent linear BP with a lithium salt to modulate effective segregation strength (χₑffN). Based on X-ray reflectivity analyses, cyclic polystyrene-block-poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate] BP thin film specimens had ∼20% smaller domain spacings than their linear counterparts at all χₑffNs and lower absolute sensitivities to changes in χₑff at identical molecular weights. We also report the first direct measurements of interfacial widths in cyclic BP assemblies, which quantitatively demonstrated that interfacial mixing in cyclic BPs was greater relative to linear BPs. Furthermore, the trends in domain characteristics with increasing salt concentration qualitatively agreed with results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with increasing χ, despite the fact that salt species were not explicitly included in the MD simulations. Our results underscore the utility of lithium salt doping to explore the BP phase behavior of synthetically challenging macromolecules and demonstrate key architecture/segregation strength relationships in cyclic BP thin films, which provides useful information to further evaluate cyclic BP suitability for nanoscale patterning and templating applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray reflectivity 3ageometry 3alithium 3amixing 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3asalt concentration1 aKubo, Tomohiro1 aSeo, Youngmi1 aTansky, Maxym1 aHall, Lisa M.1 aSumerlin, Brent S.1 aEpps, Thomas H.0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Sept. 26, v. 50, no. 18 p.7169-7176dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b013383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013500170300002000305500001900325520221000344592002802554650004402582650001202626650002902638650002102667650001502688650001802703650002302721650002002744650001302764650001602777650001102793650001902804650001202823650001102835650001302846650001402859650002002873650000902893653002602902653001902928700001902947700003002966700002002996700006303016773014603079856008503225852000903310655001203319IND60721971520221120061250.0201228e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072197152DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c077472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sandeep10aBiphasic Separation Approach in the DES Biomass Fractionation Facilitates Lignin Recovery for Subsequent Valorization to Phenolics  ap. 19140-19154.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, we demonstrate a sustainable technique for quality facile lignin recovery by adopting a biphasic separation approach during the deep eutectic solvent (DES) disintegration of biomass for subsequent valorization. The tetrahydrofuran (THF)/aq NaCl combination influenced the attainment of biphasic layer separation, consequently accelerating the movement of DES-solubilized lignin to the organic phase and allowing for the easy recovery of lignin and solvents (both THF and DES) for reuse. The modified protocol facilitated ∼32% wt lignin per wt of sawdust with a 95% purity (based on a Klason analysis), which was nearly 88% of the lignin extracted to the potential lignin of sawdust. This was achieved through the fractionation of sawdust using a choline chloride and lactic acid combination at a 1:2 molar ratio under modest thermal conditions. The obtained results were ∼2-fold higher than those of the conventional DES protocol, employing the H₂O–EtOH mixture for lignin precipitation using a similar wood substrate. All of the analytical characterization techniques, including ¹³C NMR, Fourier transform infrared, gel permeation chromatography, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), established the relevant structural and morphological characteristics, making the resultant lignin an adequate feedstock for the potential production of aromatic chemicals because of the dominance of the β-O-4 content and the limited residual constituents, including sugars and silica. Upon evaluating its suitability for phenolic chemical synthesis via hydrogenolysis, a ∼48% butylated hydroxytoluene yield was obtained as a dominant phenolic product over heterogeneous Ru@V₂O₅. Overall, the findings indicated that DES is proficient in fractionating lignocellulose for the entire release of lignin (>90%). The maximum recovery of the released lignin was attributed to the superlative performance of the novel THF/aq NaCl combination through the influence of molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and dipole–dipole interactions between the lignin and solvent, thereby establishing an alternative trend for quality lignin extraction for deriving phenolics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiomass 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acholine chloride 3afeedstocks 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3alactic acid 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3asawdust 3asilica 3asolvents 3asynthesis 3atetrahydrofuran 3awood 0adeep eutectic solvent 0ahydrogenolysis1 aSharma, Shelja1 aArumugam, Senthil Murugan1 aMiglani, Chirag1 aElumalai, Sasikumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0285-366X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 8, no. 51 p.19140-19154dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c077473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245009400164500001400258520138900272592002801661650001601689650001201705650001101717650001901728650001401747650001901761651001101780700003401791700003001825700002901855700002701884700002501911700002401936700002701960700002901987700002502016700002202041700002702063700002902090700002802119700002002147700002702167700002602194773012002220856007502340852000902415655001202424IND60711625220221119031516.0200928e20200824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071162522DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100914892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLianou, Daphne  T.12aA Detailed Questionnaire for the Evaluation of Health Management in Dairy Sheep and Goats  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this work was to develop, use and present a detailed questionnaire for the evaluation of health management in dairy small ruminants; it includes 442 questions organised in seven sections: general, infrastructure, animals, production characteristics, health management, nutrition, human resources. Consistency of replies was evaluated in 27 farmers, interviewed twice. Inconsistent replies were given by all farmers to 30 different questions (Cronbach’s coefficient alpha: 0.987). Then, interviews were performed in 444 farms around Greece. Mean duration of an interview was 63.6 min. Clarifications were requested by 273 farmers to 22 different questions (maximum per farmer: 8). The experience of the investigator, the primary language of farmers and asking clarifications by the farmers affected the duration of the interview. The questionnaire can be used for research work in the field, to record details in the farms under study. In accord with the needs of a particular study, it can be modified, by adding more specific questions or omitting others deemed of less importance. Moreover, it can also be used for routine monitoring purposes, as a useful means to record and maintain details of farms during clinical work. To the best of our knowledge, the questionnaire is the most extensive and detailed one available internationally for dairy small ruminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy sheep 3afarmers 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3anutrition 3aquestionnaires 3aGreece1 aChatziprodromidou, Ioanna  P.1 aVasileiou, Natalia  G.

An improved understanding of the dissociation behavior of the CH₄/CO₂ hydrate system is necessary to increase the yield of CH₄ production and CO₂ storage. In this study, CH₄/CO₂ mixed hydrates (in bulk and unconsolidated coarse sand) were dissociated using the multistep cyclic depressurization (MCD) method. Visual and kinetic data were collected using a high-pressure reactor and gas chromatography (GC) setup to study the change in morphology and mole fraction of CH₄ and CO₂ in the released gas. The influence of chemicals (methionine, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and methanol) in the aqueous phase and reservoir temperature (below and above 0 °C) on recovery and storage yield was also investigated. This study reported additional CH₄ recovery below the CH₄ hydrate stability pressure when cyclic depressurization was implemented between CH₄ and CO₂ hydrate stability pressures. A rapid increase in CH₄ mole fraction and a decrease in CO₂ mole fraction were observed due to simultaneous CH₄ hydrate dissociation and CO₂ hydrate reformation. This phenomenon was accelerated at high liquid saturation. CH₄ recovery potential was positively correlated with hydrate saturation and for T > 0 °C conditions. Morphology study showed the expansion of hydrate volume during cyclic depressurization, which confirmed hydrate reformation from released water from dissociation. The chemicals affected the mixed CH₄/CO₂ hydrate synthesis, reformation kinetics, and subsequent CO₂ storage. This study demonstrates a novel application of cyclic depressurization to enhance CH₄ production and improve CO₂ storage. A new hydrate production method is also proposed that includes constant-rate depressurization, kinetic inhibitor-based CO₂ injection, and cyclic depressurization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adissociation 3aenergy 3agas chromatography 3agas hydrate 3aliquids 3amethanol 3amethionine 3asand 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atemperature1 aKarantonidis, Charilaos1 aOuyang, Qian1 avon Solms, Nicolas0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 May 25, v. 35, no. 11 p.9521-9537dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c006853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245009700163300002000260520088700280592002801167650003701195650001501232650001401247650001401261650002101275650002401296650001101320650001301331650001801344650001101362700001801373700002101391700003001412773015001442856007801592852000901670655001201679IND60541615620221117200352.0160822e20150916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054161562DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b044722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Salem, Hesham10aElectrocatalytic Polysulfide Traps for Controlling Redox Shuttle Process of Li–S Batteries  ap. 11542-11545.  aStabilizing the polysulfide shuttle while ensuring high sulfur loading holds the key to realizing high theoretical energy of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries.

Respiratory tract infections are common diseases in yaks caused by various pathogens; however, there have been no reports of bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) infection. This study was conducted to investigate the pathogens and analyze their characteristics from the four yak lung samples with severe respiratory tract infection symptoms in the yak farm. Results showed that out of four lung samples, three were identified as BPIV3-positive by RT-PCR. A BPIV3 strain (10⁶.⁵ TCID₅₀/mL) was successfully isolated from the BPIV3-positive lung samples using Madin–Darby bovine kidney cells. The isolate caused systemic infection in the BALB/c mice and induced pathological changes in the lungs. Moreover, three complete BPIV3 genomes were amplified from the clinical samples. Phylogenetic trees based on the complete genomes, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase subunit protein (L) amino acid sequences showed that the complete BPIV3 genomes belonged to BPIV3 genotype C, and clustered into a large branch with the Chinese strains, although the three yak BPIV3 strains were clustered into a small branch. Compared to known BPIV3 genotype C strains in GenBank, the three genomes of yak BPIV3 showed four identical amino acid mutations in the HN, P and L proteins, suggesting a unique genetic evolution of BPIV3 in yaks. This study first isolated and characterized the BPIV3 from yaks, which contributed to the understanding of the infection and evolution of BPIV3 in yaks in the Tibet Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBos 3aBovine respirovirus 3 3aamino acids 3acattle 3aeconomic resources 3afarms 3agenome 3agenotype 3akidneys 3alungs 3aphosphoproteins 3aphylogeny 3arespiratory tract diseases 3ayaks 3aChina1 aChen, Xi 1 aTang, Cheng 1 aYue, Hua 0 tPathogens.g2022 Aug. 24, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110909623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010800173300001600281520099600297592002801293650001401321650002101335650001901356653002601375653002501401653001901426653002001445653000901465653002501474700002201499773011201521856008601633852000901719655001201728IND60600238020221120054310.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060023802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoroujerdi, A.A.10aInvestigation of a high frequency pulse tube cryocooler driven by a standing wave thermoacoustic engine  ap. 194-203.  aIn this work, a typical thermoacoustically driven pulse tube cooler as a no-moving part device has been investigated by a numerical method. A standing wave thermoacoustic engine as a prime mover in coupled with an inertance tube pulse tube cryocooler has been modeled. Nonlinear equations of unsteady one-dimensional compressible flow have been solved by the finite volume method. The model presents an important step towards the development of nonlinear simulation tools for the high amplitude thermoacoustic systems that are needed for practical use. The results of the computations show that the self-excited oscillations are well accompanied by the increasing of the pressure amplitude. The necessity of implementation of a nonlinear model to investigate such devices has been proven. The effect of APAT length as an amplifier coupler on the performance of the cooler has been investigated. Furthermore, by using Lagrangian approach, thermodynamic cycle of gas parcels has been attained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3anonlinear models 3athermodynamics 0aPulse tube cryocooler 0aStanding wave engine 0aThermoacoustic 0aNumerical model 0aAPAT 0aParallel plate stack1 aZiabasharhagh, M.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Oct., v. 86 p.194-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03865naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001600181245015100197300001800348500001500366506007600381520128500457592002801742506003701770650002101807650003501828650002201863650001601885650002201901650001401923650001401937650001101951650001501962650001201977650002301989650001202012650001502024650001202039650003802051650001002089650002102099650001302120650002802133650004902161650002802210650004202238650005502280650007202335650002602407653002002433653001702453653002002470653002702490653003902517653001502556653002902571653001902600653003602619700001702655700002602672700002702698700002102725700002702746700002002773700002202793700002602815700002502841773012202866856007402988852000903062655001203071IND60118907320221207100637.0141127e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011890732DNAL7 a235678642pmid7 aPMC36388232pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Junwei10aCAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 7 modulates plant growth, reproduction, senescence, and determinate nodulation in the model legume Lotus japonicus  ap. 1967-1981.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStrigolactones (SLs) are newly identified hormones that regulate multiple aspects of plant development, infection by parasitic weeds, and mutualistic symbiosis in the roots. In this study, the role of SLs was studied for the first time in the model plant Lotus japonicus using transgenic lines silenced for CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 7 (LjCCD7), the orthologue of Arabidopsis More Axillary Growth 3. Transgenic LjCCD7-silenced plants displayed reduced height due to shorter internodes, and more branched shoots and roots than the controls, and an increase in total plant biomass, while their root:shoot ratio remained unchanged. Moreover, these lines had longer primary roots, delayed senescence, and reduced flower/pod numbers from the third round of flower and pod setting onwards. Only a mild reduction in determinate nodule numbers and hardly any impact on the colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were observed. The results show that the impairment of CCD7 activity in L. japonicus leads to a phenotype linked to SL functions, but with specific features possibly due to the peculiar developmental pattern of this plant species. It is believed that the data also link determinate nodulation, plant reproduction, and senescence to CCD7 function for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aroot shoot ratio 3agenetically modified organisms 3aplant development 3aArabidopsis 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphenotype 3asymbiosis 3ashoots 3ainternodes 3aflowers 3aplant reproduction 3alegumes 3anodulation 3abiomass 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aroots 3aparasitic plants 3ahormones 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aLotusxenzymologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSymbiosisxphysiology 0aLotus japonicus 0areproduction 0aleaf senescence 0adeterminate nodulation 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) 0asenescence 0ashoot and root branching 0astrigolactone. 0acarotenoid cleavage dioxygenase1 aNovero, Mara1 aCharnikhova, Tatsiana1 aFerrandino, Alessandra1 aSchubert, Andrea1 aRuyter-Spira, Carolien1 aBonfante, Paola1 aLovisolo, Claudio1 aBouwmeester, Harro J.1 aCardinale, Francesca0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 Apr., v. 64, no. 7 p.1967-1981dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245019900172300001800371520131100389592002801700650001601728650002101744650004101765650003301806650001501839650001401854650001301868650001201881700002001893700002401913700001801937700002001955773010101975856007802076852000902154655001202163IND60347094020221122045954.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034709402DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015002052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrett, Christopher A.10aDevelopment of a low‐density‐solvent dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry method for the quantitation of tetrabromobisphenol‐A from dust  ap. 2503-2509.  aThe development of an alternative dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction protocol utilizing a low‐density extraction solvent, toluene, is described here for the extraction of the brominated flame retardant, tetrabromobisphenol‐A, from dust prior to selected ion monitoring analysis by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Method parameters of dispersive solvent type and extraction solvent type were optimized. Excellent recovery (88.9%; n = 5 spike replicates) with good precision was achieved in a spike and recovery study. This developed method was utilized to survey tetrabromobisphenol‐A concentrations in dust sampled from a local electronics recycling facility from the ambient environment and 20 computer towers undergoing recycling. Concentrations of tetrabromobisphenol‐A from dust in computer towers ranged from not detected (n = 2) up to 64 μg/g with a mean value of 11 μg/g and median of 4.1 μg/g tetrabromobisphenol‐A. A composite sample of dust collected from the ambient indoor environment was analyzed with a resulting concentration of 36 μg/g. This is the first application of this novel green method for pre‐concentrating flame retardants from dust and the first report of tetrabromobisphenol‐A concentrations at a U.S.‐based electronics recycling facility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronics 3aflame retardants 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amonitoring 3arecycling 3asolvents 3atoluene1 aOrban, David A.1 aSeebeck, Shannon E.1 aLowe, Luis E.1 aOwens, Janel E.0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 July, v. 38, no. 14 p.2503-2509dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015002053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01460naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011100158300001800269520039200287592002800679650001700707650002300724650002100747650002300768650002900791650001400820650003000834700002900864700002400893773013400917856007401051852000901125655001201134IND60660238220221120140758.0190823e20140722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066023822DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03299c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuo, Tianmeng10aFluoro-glycosyl acridinones are ultra-sensitive active site titrating agents for retaining β-glycosidases  ap. 9379-9382.  aNovel fluorogenic 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosyl acridinone active site titrating reagents were synthesised and kinetic parameters determined for their inactivation of two retaining β-glucosidases, a β-galactosidase, a β-xylosidase and several cellulases.

The HPLC system was equipped with ultraviolet absorption detection using a C18 column with a detection wavelength of 215 nm. The mobile phase (pH 4) was 0.02% phosphoric acid and methanol in the ratio of 90:10 v/v. The retention times were 5.67 min for clavulanic acid and 7.22 min for tazobactam. The method exhibited good linearity for clavulanic acid and tazobactam, with R ² > 0.9988. Recovery ranged from 81.953% to 87.688% for clavulanic acid and from 85.007% to 92.991% for tazobactam. The precision expressed as RSD ranged from 0.975% to 1.248% for clavulanic acid and from 0.872% to 1.650% for tazobactam. A simple and precise HPLC method was developed for the determination of clavulanic acid and tazobactam in bovine milk.

ILG markedly inhibited inflammation, but the effects on the brain inflammation and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet (HFD) are still unknown, so our study intended to investigate its effect on cognitive dysfunction induced by HFD and the relevant mechanisms. ICR mice were treated with HFD diet for 8 weeks to induce peripheral insulin resistance prior to being intervened with rosiglitazone, ILG (30, 60 mg/kg). 4 weeks later, Morris Water Maze (MWM) was used to assess the learning and memory, the insulin resistance index was measured, and the brain inflammation cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α) were assessed. Meanwhile, the p-JNK, p-IRS Ser³⁰⁷ protein expressions in the hippocampus were also detected using the western blot to explore the corresponding mechanisms. Our results suggested that ILG could significantly alleviate the cognitive impairments in the MWM test and attenuate peripheral insulin resistance. The IL-1β, TNF-α levels declined with the administration of ILG, meanwhile the p-IRS Ser³⁰⁷ expression decreased with the inhibition of p-JNK. In conclusion, ILG could improve the spatial learning and memory lesions induced by HFD via the inhibition of TNF-α/JNK/IRS pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycyrrhiza uralensis 3aWestern blotting 3achalcone 3acognition 3aencephalitis 3ahigh fat diet 3ahippocampus 3ainduced resistance 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amemory 3amice 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aHigh-fat diet 0aInsulin resistance 0aIsoliquiritigenin 0aLearning and memory 0aInflammation1 aFang, Fang1 aSong, Meiting1 aMa, Shiping0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 464, no. 4 p.1090-1095dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245004400210300001400254506007600268520082100344592002801165506003701193650001801230650002101248650001101269650000901280650001501289650001601304650001301320700002201333773010901355856008101464852000901545655001201554IND60601684720221207085914.0180706e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060168472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2014.02.0102doi7 aPMC40682382pmcid7 a246673302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPattanayak, Gopal14aThe cyanobacterial clock and metabolism  ap. 90-95.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCyanobacteria possess the simplest known circadian clock, which presents a unique opportunity to study how rhythms are generated and how input signals from the environment reset the clock time. The kaiABC locus forms the core of the oscillator, and the remarkable ability to reconstitute oscillations using purified KaiABC proteins has allowed researchers to study mechanism using the tools of quantitative biochemistry. Autotrophic cyanobacteria experience major shifts in metabolism following a light–dark transition, and recent work suggests that input mechanisms that couple the day–night cycle to the clock involve energy and redox metabolites acting directly on clock proteins. We offer a summary of the current state of knowledge in this system and present a perspective for future lines of investigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyanobacteria 3acircadian clocks 3aenergy 3aloci 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aproteins1 aRust, Michael J.,0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2014 Apr., v. 18 p.90-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2014.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01189naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009700160300001800257520023400275592002800509650002300537650001800560650001400578650001900592700001900611700002000630700002000650773013400670856007400804852000900878655001200887IND60699461820221120174120.0200619e20200618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069946182DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc02506b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirao, Takehiro10aHelicity of a polyacetylene directed by molecular recognition of biscalixarene and fullerene  ap. 6672-6675.  aChiral biscalixarenes and a C₆₀-appended polyphenylacetylene have been synthesized.

Factors affecting microextraction efficiency such as the type and volume of the extraction solvent, sample pH, extraction time, stirring rate, extraction temperature, ionic strength, and sample volume were optimized. Under the optimum conditions (i.e. extraction solvent, 1‐undecanol (40 μL); sample pH, 8.0; temperature, 25°C; stirring rate, 500 rpm; sample volume, 7 mL; potassium chloride concentration, 5% and extraction time, 50 min), the limits of detection for phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and phenytoin were 1.0, 0.1, and 0.3 μg/L, respectively. Also, the calibration curves for phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and phenytoin were linear in the concentration range of 2.0–300.0, 0.3–200.0, and 1.0–200.0 μg/L, respectively. The relative standard deviations for six replicate extractions and determinations of phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and phenytoin at 50 μg/L level were less than 4.6%. The method was successfully applied to determine phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and phenytoin in plasma and urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aionic strength 3amicroextraction 3amixing 3apH 3aphenobarbital 3aphenytoin 3apotassium chloride 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aurine1 aDadfarnia, Shayessteh1 aHaji Shabani, Ali Mohammad1 aabbasi, Bijan0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 July, v. 38, no. 14 p.2510-2516dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015002373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01569naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016700155300001800322520038700340592002800727650001100755650002100766650002300787650002600810650001100836650001300847700001200860700001500872700001900887700001800906700001800924700001700942700001900959773013400978856007401112852000901186655001201195IND60699461920221120184209.0200619e20200618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069946192DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc02620d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Ruoyu10aHighly dispersed nickel anchored on a N-doped carbon molecular sieve derived from metal–organic frameworks for efficient hydrodeoxygenation in the aqueous phase  ap. 6696-6699.  aZIF-8 was employed as a template to synthesize HD-Ni/N-CMS containing highly dispersed Ni at the atomic level anchored on a N-doped carbon molecular sieve for vanillin hydrodeoxygenation.

A key challenge for detecting change in ecosystem composition, structure, and function within these observatories is to obtain a representative sample of habitats. Representative sampling across a continent contributes to ecological validity when analyzing spatially distributed data. However, field resources are limited, and actual representativeness may differ markedly from theoretical expectations. Here, we report a post hoc evaluation of the coverage of environmental gradients as a surrogate for ecological representativeness by a continental‐scale survey undertaken by the Australian Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN). TERN’s surveillance program maintains a network of ecosystem observation plots initially established in the rangelands through a stratification method (clustering of bioregions by environment) and application of the Ausplots survey methodology. Subsequent site selection comprised gap‐filling and opportunistic sampling. We confirmed that environmental coverage was a good surrogate for ecological representativeness. The cumulative sampling of environments and plant species composition over time were strongly correlated (based on mean multivariate dispersion; r = 0.93). We compared environmental sampling of Ausplots to 100,000 background points and a set of retrospective (virtual) sampling schemes: systematic grid, simple random, stratified random, and generalized random‐tessellation stratified (GRTS). Differences were assessed according to sampling densities along environmental gradients, and multivariate dispersion. Ausplots outperformed systematic grid, simple random, and GRTS in coverage of environmental space (Tukey HSD of mean dispersion, P < 0.001). GRTS site selection obtained similar coverage to Ausplots when employing the same bioregional stratification. Stratification by climatic zones generated the highest environmental coverage (P < 0.001), although resulting sampling densities over‐represented mesic coastal habitats. The Ausplots bioregional stratification implemented under practical constraints represented complex environments well, compared to statistically oriented or spatially even samples. Potential statistical power also depends on replication, unbiased site selection, and accuracy of field measurements relative to the magnitude of change. Consistent with previous studies, our stocktake analysis confirmed that environmental, rather than spatial, stratification is required to maximize ecological coverage across continental ecosystem observation networks, and the approach to establishing TERN Ausplots was robust. We recommend targeted gap‐filling to complete sampling.  aPublisher supplied data  cTerrestrial Ecosystem Research Network 3amonitoring 3arangelands 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aWilliams, Kristen J.1 aSparrow, Ben1 aLowe, Andrew J.0 tEcosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 11, no. 12 p.e03307-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.33073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008600167300001800253520126700271592002801538650002001566650001401586650002301600650001301623650001901636650001901655650002101674650001901695650003301714650001101747650001601758700001601774700002701790700001601817700001801833700002301851773010601874856008601980852000902066655001202075IND60580672520221118043316.0170926e20170926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058067252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b014432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Gajin10aRealizing 5.4 nm Full Pitch Lamellar Microdomains by a Solid-State Transformation  ap. 7148-7154.  aA simple method was developed to realize a self-assembled block copolymer (BCP) lamellar microdomain morphology with a full pitch of 5.4 nm through an acid hydrolysis of poly(solketal methacrylate-b-styrene) (PSM-b-PS). The acid hydrolysis transforms PSM-b-PS, having two hydrophobic blocks, into poly(glycerol monomethacrylate-b-styrene) (PGM-b-PS), having one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic block. This transformation markedly increases the segmental interaction parameter such that a phase-mixed PSM-b-PS can be transformed in the solid state into a microphase-separated BCP without the use of any additives. Correlation hole scattering of the PSM-b-PS in the phase mixed state yields a segmental interaction parameter (χ) given by χ = 0.0196 + 4.694/T, where T is the absolute temperature. With the symmetric BCPs used in this study, the ordered lamellar microdomain pitch was determined by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) as a function of the degree of polymerization (16 ≤ N ≤ 1246). For the lamellar microdomains of PGM-b-PS, the scattering profiles show many higher order reflections with an increase in the domain spacing (L₀). The lowest molar mass sample (Mₙ = 2200 g/mol, N = 16) had sub-3 nm microdomains after conversion to PGM-b-PS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3aadditives 3acomposite polymers 3aglycerol 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolids 3atemperature1 aYu, Duk Man1 aMapas, Jose Kenneth D.1 aSun, Zhiwei1 aRzayev, Javid1 aRussell, Thomas P.0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Sept. 26, v. 50, no. 18 p.7148-7154dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b014433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245014500170300001800315500001500333520092600348592002801274650002401302650005301326650002701379650001601406650001101422650003501433653001701468700002401485700002501509773010101534856007801635852000901713655001201722IND60347094720221122060500.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034709472DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015002682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukusamude, Chunyapuk10aInterface‐free two‐dimensional heart‐cutting capillary electrophoresis for the separation and stacking of anionic and neutral analytes  ap. 2532-2537.  a2019-12-05  aInterface‐free two‐dimensional heart‐cutting capillary electrophoresis for two different classes of analytes (anionic and neutral) in a single capillary is presented. Simultaneous sample stacking and orthogonal separation were demonstrated. The anionic species were first analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis in the first dimension. Then, the neutral compounds were separated in the second dimension by micellar electrokinetic chromatography using the common anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate. The first and second dimensions occurred automatically without changing the electrolyte and without polarity switching. Artificial mixtures (five anions and four neutral compounds) were successfully analyzed with sensitivity enhancement factors from 7 to 28. The orthogonal separation was complete within 8 min. Some analytical features and application to a spiked real river water sample were also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3ariver water 3aanions 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 0aelectrolytes1 aSrijaranai, Supalax1 aQuirino, Joselito P.0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 July, v. 38, no. 14 p.2532-2537dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015002683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01355naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013400155300001800289520040100307592002800708650002000736650001400756650002700770650001100797650002300808700001700831773013300848856007500981852000901056655001201065IND60659038920221121043242.0190827e20110809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065903892DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13054d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaik, Chul10aInhibiting olefin cis, trans-photoisomerization and enhancing electron-accepting ability of a diboryl compound by metal chelation  ap. 9432-9434.  aTo examine the impact of metal chelation on cis–trans olefin bond isomerization and the photo-stability of N,C-chelate photochromic boron compounds, a new π-conjugated molecule B-BPY that incorporates a 2,2′-bipy unit, two olefin bonds, and two BMes₂(ppy) chromophores has been synthesized and found to stabilize the molecule toward olefin photoisomerization upon binding with a metal ion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron compounds 3achelation 3achemical communication 3aolefin 3aphotoisomerization1 aWang, Suning0 tChemical communications.g2011 Aug. 9, v. 47, no. 33 p.9432-9434dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc13054d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009800171300001600269520218400285592002802469650001802497650002202515650001502537650001802552653002302570653003802593653002802631653001702659700001602676773011202692856008602804852000902890655001202899IND60600238620221120054157.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060023862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurlibaşa, A.10aFrequency domain design of gain scheduling control for large wind systems in full-load region  ap. 204-215.  aThe paper presents the issue of power control law synthesis, in the case of a large wind system that operates under full-load regime, based on dynamic properties details in frequency domain. Solving this problem involves two phases: the establishment of a linearized model as faithfully as possible in various operating points of the full-load region, and synthesis of the power controller, considered with classic structure, taking into account frequency particularities of the obtained linearized model. Obtained linear model of the controlled process is of order 16 and encloses subsystems for tower fore-aft oscillations damping, and for drive-train torsion oscillations damping. The designed controller contains a PI component and a lag compensator for dynamic correction at high frequencies. It is known that the main features of wind system dynamics generated by the interaction of wind–tower–blade ensemble cause a gap in the gain characteristic of the model and complex conjugate zeros, which can move between right and left half-planes, depending on the average wind speed value. Consequently, for control law synthesis an interactive frequency solution is adopted. This is “transparent” in relation to particularities induced by wind–tower–blade interaction. This solution allows evaluation of the extent to which control law is affected by the subsystem for tower oscillations damping. Given the strong dependence between the model and the mean wind speed value, a gain scheduling control law is designed. At different values of average wind speed, controller synthesis is performed in two ways: one applying the desired values to the stability reserve, and the other requiring the minimization of a performance criterion, aimed at reducing mechanical stress, while the controller parameters are kept in an area that ensures admissible values to the stability reserve. This second way allows obtaining a solution for designing a simple classic controller, dedicated to large wind turbines, to which may be imposed requirements for mechanical fatigue mitigation. The proposed solutions are backed by numerical results obtained through numerical simulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3amechanical stress 3awind speed 3awind turbines 0aLarge wind turbine 0aWind–blade interaction modeling 0aGain scheduling control 0aOptimization1 aCeangă, E.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Oct., v. 86 p.204-215dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007500171300001400246520082700260592002801087650002101115650001501136650001201151650001001163650001101173650002101184650001901205650001501224650001801239650002001257650001301277700006401290773010901354856008101463852000901544655001201553IND60601685120221119211811.0180706e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060168512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2014.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiquelme, Meritxell14aThe Spitzenkörper: a choreographer of fungal growth and morphogenesis  ap. 27-33.  aThe Spitzenkörper (SPK) is a multicomponent pleomorphic structure found at hyphal apices. It is necessary to maintain hyphal growth and morphogenesis in numerous fungal species, including plant and human pathogens. At the turn of the 21st century extraordinary advances in protein tagging technology and live microscopy allowed uncovering the main molecular constituents of the SPK. Distinct layers of macrovesicles and microvesicles, each carrying different cell wall synthetic enzymes, along with the actin cytoskeleton and related proteins are some of the components that make up the SPK. One of the biggest current challenges is to decipher the functional relationship between the SPK components and macromolecular complexes, such as the polarisome and the exocyst, which partially co-localize within the hyphal dome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathogens 3acell walls 3aenzymes 3afungi 3ahyphae 3amicrobial growth 3amicrofilaments 3amicroscopy 3amorphogenesis 3aprotein tagging 3aproteins1 aSánchez-León, Eddy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1571-23610 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2014 Aug., v. 20 p.27-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2014.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013100162300001800293520139500311592002801706650003701734650001501771650001301786650001501799650002001814650002101834650001901855650002301874650001501897650003701912650002301949650003301972650003202005650002002037650001602057700001602073700001402089700001702103700001402120773010102134856007802235852000902313655001202322IND60347094920221122045943.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034709492DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015003082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Licheng10aGraphene oxide decorated with silver nanoparticles as a coating on a stainless‐steel fiber for solid‐phase microextraction  ap. 2439-2446.  aA novel graphene oxide decorated with silver nanoparticles coating on a stainless‐steel fiber for solid‐phase microextraction was prepared. Scanning electron microscopy and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the coating surface and showed that silver nanoparticles were dispersed on the wrinkled graphene oxide surface. Coupled to gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, the extraction abilities of the fiber for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were examined in the headspace solid‐phase microextraction mode. The extraction parameters including adsorption time, adsorption temperature, salt concentration, desorption time and desorption temperature were investigated. Under the optimized condition, wide linearity with low limits of detection from 2 to 10 ng/L was obtained. The relative standard deviations for single‐fiber repeatability and fiber‐to‐fiber reproducibility were less than 10.6 and 17.5%, respectively. The enrichment factors were from 1712.5 to 4503.7, showing the fiber has good extraction abilities. Moreover, the fiber exhibited a good stability and could be reused for more than 120 times. The established method was also applied for determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in two real water samples and the recoveries of analytes ranged from 84.4–116.3% with relative standard deviations less than 16.2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acoatings 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aflame ionization 3agraphene oxide 3aheadspace analysis 3ananosilver 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asalt concentration 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase microextraction 3astainless steel 3atemperature1 aHou, Xiudan1 aLi, Jubai1 aLiu, Shujuan1 aGuo, Yong0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 July, v. 38, no. 14 p.2439-2446dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015003083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003300141245015000174500001900324520166000343592002802003650001102031650001302042650001902055650002202074650002102096650001202117650001602129650001402145650001602159650001002175650001302185650001102198650001202209650002802221650001602249650001602265653002202281653001502303653002602318653002402344700002702368700002702395700002302422700002602445700007302471773011002544856007502654852000902729655001202738IND60701095220221120102042.0200706e20200706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070109522DNAL7 a10.1017/jns.2020.212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Araújo, Gracielle Amaral10aOverweight during lactation and its implications for biometric, nutritional and cardiovascular parameters of young and adult male and female rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLitter size reduction can induce early overnourishment, being an attractive experimental model to study short- and long-term consequences of childhood obesity. Epidemiological data indicate sex differences regarding cardiometabolic disorders and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present study aimed to describe biometric, nutritional and cardiovascular changes related to neonatal overweight promoted by litter size reduction in young and adult Wistar rats of both sexes. Litter adjustment to eight or four pups/mother (1:1 male-to-female ratio) gave, respectively, control and overweight groups. Body mass, food intake, haemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters and cardiorespiratory capacity were evaluated at postnatal days 30 and 150. Diminished litters were correlated with higher body mass and weight gain (12 %) during lactation, validating the experimental model of neonatal overweight. Soon after weaning male (16 %) and female (25 %) offspring of these litters presented a lower food intake than their respective control, without differences in body mass. Adult males from reduced litters presented higher abdominal circumference (7 %), systolic blood pressure (10 %), interventricular septum thickness (15 %) and relative wall thickness (15 %) compared with their respective control. Rats' performance on the maximal effort ergometer test was not affected by neonatal overweight. Data suggest the occurrence of catch-down growth and hypophagia in male and female rats submitted to neonatal overweight. However, only male rats presented haemodynamic and cardiac structural changes. These findings are crucial to personalised/gender medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiometry 3acardiomyopathy 3achildhood obesity 3aechocardiography 3afemales 3afood intake 3alactation 3alitter size 3amales 3amedicine 3amodels 3aprogeny 3asystolic blood pressure 3aundereating 3aweight gain 0aChild development 0aOverweight 0aCardiovascular system 0aSex characteristics1 aFarias, Raysa da Silva1 aPedro, Samuel de Sousa1 aRocha, Nazareth N.1 aBrito, Fernanda C.

Between 2020 and 2021, fecal samples were collected from 180 pigs as well as ear scrapings from 142 pigs. In addition, 34 stool specimens from farmers and their families were analyzed. The collected material was processed by parasitological techniques. Parasites were detected in 86.1% of the pigs, forms of phylum Ciliophora (70.5%), strongylids (56.7%), Strongyloides ransomi (44.4%), coccidia (38.3%) and Ascaris suum (32.2%). Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis were identified in 3.5% of the pigs. An analysis of infections by age group revealed that the general frequency of phylum Ciliophora and strongylid parasites was statistically significant. Other factors also associated with the frequency of the parasites included the type of food fed to the pigs, cleaning of the facilities, care of piglets and type of facility. The frequency of intestinal parasites of farmers themselves was low; however, the high rate of parasite infections detected in pigs highlighted the precarious conditions of hygiene of the farms. Lastly, the farmers’ participation in extension activities was a step forward in actions to improve their farm management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscaris suum 3aCiliophora 3aSarcoptes scabiei 3aStrongylidae 3aStrongyloides ransomi 3aears 3afarm management 3ahygiene 3aintestines 3aparasites 3aswine 3aBrazil1 aSilveira, Renato 1 aFialho, Priscila 1 aSilva, Leticia,1 aLobão, Lucas 1 aAmendoeira, Maria Regina1 aBarbosa, Alynne 0 tPathogens.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110909713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01832naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010300176300001800279520084600297592002801143650001601171650001601187650002401203650001901227650001301246700001901259700001901278700002001297773010601317856008601423852000901509655001201518IND60580672820180731000000.0170926e20170926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058067282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b014882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamzehlou, Shaghayegh10aDynamics of the Particle Morphology during the Synthesis of Waterborne Polymer–Inorganic Hybrids  ap. 7190-7201.  aWaterborne polymer–inorganic hybrids have the potential of both surpassing the performance and targeting applications that are out of reach of conventional polymer dispersions.

Moreover, a mathematical model for the dynamics of the particle morphology during the synthesis of polymer–inorganic hybrids was developed, and its capabilities were checked against the experimental data. It is our hope that this study will help to further elucidate the mechanism involved in the process and to lay the foundations for a fine control of particle morphology of these materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceric oxide 3adispersions 3amathematical models 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aAguirre, Miren1 aLeiza, Jose R.1 aAsua, José M.,0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Sept. 26, v. 50, no. 18 p.7190-7201dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b014883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01375naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245008400151300001800235520030900253592002800562650001600590650002700606650002300633650002300656650001100679700001300690700001300703700001400716700001600730700001700746700001600763700001700779773013300796856007500929852000901004655001201013IND60659039220221121063527.0190827e20110809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065903922DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13062e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, N.12aA novel membrane-permeant cADPR antagonist modified in the pyrophosphate bridge  ap. 9462-9464.  aA concise method for the formation of cyclopyrophosphate of cIDPRE as well as sulfur and selenium-substituted pyrophosphate cIDPRE analogues (P1S-cIDPRE, P1Se-cIDPRE, P2S-cIDPRE and P2Se-cIDPRE) was reported and one of the PS-diastereoisomers, P1S-cIDPRE-1, is a novel membrane-permeant cADPR antagonist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3asulfur1 aJung, K.1 aWang, M.1 aNa, L.

When kept on the soil surface instead of feeding them to livestock, crop residues can contribute to increasing soil fertility and maintaining crop productivity in the short- and the long-term. We explored these trade-offs for smallholder cotton–sorghum farming systems in the semi-arid Zambezi Valley, northern Zimbabwe. The analysis was done using simulation models at three scales, the plot, the farm and the territory, to simulate the effects of different sorghum residue allocations to livestock feeding vs. soil mulching, in combination with different application rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizer on crop productivity. The plot-scale simulations suggest that without N fertilization soil mulching has a positive effect on cotton yields only if small quantities of sorghum residues are used as mulch (average cotton yields of 2.24±0.41kgha−1 with a mulch of 100kgha−1 vs. 1.91±0.29kgha−1 without mulch). Greater quantities of mulch have a negative effect on cotton yield without N fertilization due to N immobilization in the soil microbial biomass. With applications of 100kgNha−1, quantities of mulch up to 3tha−1 have no negative effect on cotton yield. Results at farm-scale highlight the fundamental role of livestock as a source of traction, and the need to feed a greater proportion of sorghum residues to livestock as herd and farm sizes increase. Farmers with no livestock attained maximum crop production when 100% of their sorghum residue remained in the field, as they do not have access to cattle manure. The optimum fraction of crop residue to be retained in the fields for maximum farm crop production varied for farmers with 2 or less heads of cattle (80% retention), with 2–3 heads (60–80%), with 4 or more heads (40–60%). At the scale of the entire territory, total cotton and sorghum production increased with the density of cattle, at the expense of soil mulching with crop residues. The results of our simulations suggest that (i) the optimum level of residue retention depends on the scale at which trade-offs are analyzed; (ii) the retention of all of the crop residue as mulch appears unrealistic and undesirable in farming systems that rely on livestock for traction; and (iii) crop residue mulching could be made more attractive to farmers by paying due attention to balancing C to N ratios in the soil and by promoting small-scale mechanization to replace animal traction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aapplication rate 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acattle 3acattle manure 3acotton 3acrop residues 3acrop yield 3adry season 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aherds 3aimmobilization in soil 3alivestock feeding 3amechanization 3amicrobial biomass 3amulches 3amulching 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asimulation models 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil microorganisms 3aZimbabwe 0aConservation agriculture 0aSimulation model 0aEquity 0aAPSIM1 aDelmotte, Sylvestre1 aCorbeels, Marc1 aHerrera, Juan M.1 aTittonell, Pablo0 tAgricultural systems.g2015 Mar., v. 134 p.97-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2014.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014000166500002200306520147500328592002801803650002701831650001701858650003401875650001101909650003501920650001701955650000901972650001701981650002801998650001602026650001502042651001002057653004202067653001902109653001802128653001002146653002602156653001002182700001602192700001602208700001802224700002002242700001502262700001602277700001502293773010102308856008702409852000902496655001202505IND60669841820221119095856.0190923e20190911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066984182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yunna10aOptimal Location Selection for Offshore Wind-PV-Seawater Pumped Storage Power Plant using a hybrid MCDM approach: A Two-Stage Framework  aPre-press version  aConstructing an economical wind-PV-seawater pumped storage (SPS) plant is crucial to promote the complementarity of wind and PV resources in time and space dimensions and to reduce energy abandonment caused by voltage instability. It is also beneficial to realizing long-time sustainable development objectives for offshore areas and even for the whole country. To select the optimal site of wind-PV-SPS power plants with massive difficulties lying in different attitudes of decision makers to loss risk, uncertainties of decision-making environment and various attributes of evaluation alternatives, a fuzzy multi criteria decision making based a two-stage evaluation mode is proposed. Firstly, two sets of criteria systems, representing veto selection of regional resources and the conditions of sustainable development described by triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs), are established to ensure the scientificality and comprehensiveness of the evaluation process. Then, alternatives are preliminarily selected through veto identification. Afterwards, criteria weights of the second evaluation stage determined by the entropy method are incorporated within TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multiple attribute decision making) to rank potential wind-PV-SPS objects. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a case study in China is conducted and the calculation result shows that Qingtian Bay in Zhou Shan is the best.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3aelectric potential difference 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3apower plants 3arisk 3asolar energy 3asustainable development 3auncertainty 3awind power 3aChina 0aWind-PV-seawater pumped storage plant 0aSite selection 0aOffshore area 0aTIFNs 0aEntropy weight method 0aTODIM1 aZhang, Ting1 aXu, Chuanbo1 aZhang, Buyuan1 aLi, Lingwenying1 aKe, Yiming1 aYan, Yudong1 aXu, Ruhang0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 11, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245012900165520176400294592002802058650002102086650001202107650001102119650002502130650001902155650002402174650001502198650001702213650001802230650002602248650001002274650001002284650001202294650001202306650001602318700002802334700002302362700002302385700002002408773012002428856007802548852000902626655001202635IND60787822320221119185757.0220811e20220728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078782232DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111522492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, Elena,10aElaboration of Cookies Using Oils and Flours from Seeds and Nuts: Effects on Technological, Nutritional and Consumer Aspects  aThe consumption of cookies is widely extended throughout the world, although their formulas contain ingredients such as saturated fats or refined flours that are considered harmful to health. In addition, cookies are generally made from wheat flour, and nowadays there is a growing concern about gluten intolerance, thus the demand for gluten-free products is increasing. In this regard, the aim of the present study is to reformulate traditional cookies by replacing wheat flour and butter by flours and oils from nuts and seeds. Within these seeds, poppy or chia are not commonly consumed ingredients as they can cause rejection by consumers. Thus, a study was performed to evaluate the neophobia level of consumers and the consumer acceptance for the inclusion of these novel ingredients in cookies. The results have been obtained by measuring physical parameters, proximate composition and consumer evaluation of five batches of cookies. By replacing butter and wheat flour with maize flour, almond, walnut, chia or poppy seed flours and oils, an increase of protein, fat and fiber has been observed as well as a decrease in carbohydrate content; thus, the resultant cookies would be a good source of vegetal protein as well as a source of oleic and linoleic acid with potential benefits on health. The cookies in general have similar physical properties and a positive consumer acceptance in texture, taste and external aspect. The Food Neophobia Scale results suggest that non-neophobic consumers gave higher scores than neophobic consumers in all the parameters. The resultant product would be a functional product able to substitute traditional ones not only directed to celiac people but all type of consumers because of their beneficial composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia hispanica 3aalmonds 3abutter 3acarbohydrate content 3aceliac disease 3aconsumer acceptance 3acorn flour 3afood choices 3alinoleic acid 3aproximate composition 3aseeds 3ataste 3atexture 3awalnuts 3awheat flour1 aÁlvarez-Ortí, Manuel 1 aRabadán, Adrián 1 aMillán, Cristina 1 aPardo, José E.0 tFoods.g2022 July 28, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111522493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245013400159520104200293592002801335650002401363650001401387650001301401650001701414650001701431650002301448650001301471650001401484650001001498650001201508700001801520700001901538700001601557700001801573773012001591856007801711852000901789655001201798IND60787822420221119185800.0220811e20220728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078782242DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111522482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ying 10aEffect of High Pressure/Heating Combination on the Structure and Texture of Chinese Traditional Pig Trotter Stewed with Soy Sauce  aIn order to clarify the effect of a high pressure/heating combination on the texture of Chinese traditional pig trotter with soy sauce, textural parameters (springiness, chewiness, hardness, and gumminess), the secondary structures, cross-links, decorin (DCN), glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) levels, and the histochemical morphology of collagen fibers under different treatments (0.1 MPa, 150 MPa, 300 MPa, 0.1 MPa + 50 °C, 150 MPa + 50 °C, and 300 MPa + 50 °C) were assessed. At room temperature, the 150 and 300 MPa treatments increased the hardness and chewiness of the pig trotter with weak denaturation of collagen proteins compared with the control group. Textural parameters were improved at 300 MPa + 50 °C, accompanied by an ultrastructural collapse of collagen fibers, the reduction in cross-links, DCN and GAGs levels, and unfolded triple-helix structure. We concluded that the positive effects on the textural parameters of pig trotters by a combination of treatments could be attributed to the collapse of collagen structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achewiness 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3adenaturation 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahardness 3asoy sauce 3aswine 3atexture1 aSheng, Yanan 1 aZhang, Yuemei 1 aGeng, Fang 1 aCao, Jinxuan 0 tFoods.g2022 July 28, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111522483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03685naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245013000161300001800291520175800309592002802067650002302095650002002118650004402138650002202182650002102204650002202225650002102247650001902268650001502287650002102302650000902323650002102332650001002353650001002363650001502373650004202388650003002430650001102460650002602471650001302497650002102510650001702531650001102548650001502559651001002574700005402584700001702638700005602655700001702711700002202728700002202750700001602772700005602788773013902844856007902983852000903062655001203071IND60642301020221119135916.0190507e20190416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064230102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b069632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Bo-Yu10aBiodegradation of Polystyrene by Dark (Tenebrio obscurus) and Yellow (Tenebrio molitor) Mealworms (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)  ap. 5256-5265.  aYellow mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio molitor, Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) have been proven to be capable of biodegrading polystyrene (PS) products. Using four geographic sources, we found that dark mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio obscurus) ate PS as well. We subsequently tested T. obscurus from Shandong, China for PS degradation capability. Our results demonstrated the ability for PS degradation within the gut of T. obscurus at greater rates than T. molitor. With expanded PS foam as the sole diet, the specific PS consumption rates for T. obscurus and T. molitor at similar sizes (2.0 cm, 62–64 mg per larva) were 32.44 ± 0.51 and 24.30 ± 1.34 mg 100 larvae–¹ d–¹, respectively. After 31 days, the molecular weight (Mₙ) of residual PS in frass (excrement) of T. obscurus decreased by 26.03%, remarkably higher than that of T. molitor (11.67%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated formation of functional groups of intermediates and chemical modification. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested that T. obscurus larvae degraded PS effectively based on the proportion of PS residue. Co-fed corn flour to T. obscurus and wheat bran to T. molitor increased total PS consumption by 11.6% and 15.2%, respectively. Antibiotic gentamicin almost completely inhibited PS depolymerization. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant shifts in the gut microbial community in both Tenebrio species that were associated with the PS diet and PS biodegradation, with changes in three predominant families (Enterobacteriaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Enterococcaceae). The results indicate that PS biodegradability may be ubiquitous within the Tenebrio genus which could provide a bioresource for plastic waste biodegradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aEnterococcaceae 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSpiroplasmataceae 3aTenebrio molitor 3aTenebrio obscurus 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acorn flour 3adepolymerization 3adiet 3adigestive system 3afoams 3afrass 3agentamicin 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alarvae 3amicrobial communities 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apolystyrenes 3awastes 3awheat bran 3aChina1 aSu, Yiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6035-73841 aChen, Zhibin1 aChen, Jiabin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4790-58731 aZhou, Xuefei1 aBenbow, Mark Eric1 aCriddle, Craig S.1 aWu, Weimin,1 aZhang, Yalei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3254-89650 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Apr. 16, v. 53, no. 9 p.5256-5265dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b069633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012700167300001800294500001900312520122200331592002801553650001301581650001401594650001801608650002101626650001901647700005501666700006101721700002201782773012101804856008401925852000902009655001202018IND60711327720221118021458.0200922e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071132772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c001612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Shu-Yao10aConvenient Synthesis of Very-Thick Concentrated Polymer Brushes by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization in an Ionic Liquid  ap. 7936-7943.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVery-thick, concentrated brushes of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were synthesized by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization in N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, an ionic liquid (IL) solvent. Notably, the high polymerization rate in this IL produced 700 nm-thick PMMA brushes, while the grafting density was observed to increase with increasing feed concentration of a deactivator catalyst (Cu(II)Cl₂/ligand), suggesting that grafting density is significantly determined by chain growth during a single activation cycle. A concentrated PMMA brush, with a number-average molecular weight of 1.28 × 10⁶, a polydispersity index of 1.23, a brush-layer thickness of 510 nm, and a grafting density of 0.30 chains nm–², was successfully synthesized by taking advantage of the IL effect that provides a higher propagation rate constant and a lower termination rate constant. Further increases in the brush-layer thickness were achieved by moderately pressurizing the polymerization medium (i.e., by the combined use of the IL solvent and pressure), and an approximately 1 μm-thick concentrated polymer brush was conveniently synthesized at 50 MPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acatalysts 3aionic liquids 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization1 aOhno, Kohji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1812-33541 aSakakibara, Keita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6013-695X1 aTsujii, Yoshinobu0 tMacromolecules.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 53, no. 18 p.7936-7943dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c001613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009800169300001600267520177000283592002802053650002002081650001802101650002002119650002802139650001902167650001902186650002802205650002402233650001902257650001502276650001102291650001502302650001802317650002602335653002902361653003202390653001902422653001502441653003302456653001002489700002202499773012402521856005102645852000902696655001202705IND50085903420221120185430.0140412e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008590342DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2011.5752612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaurav, Vishal10aSTATISTICAL OPTIMIZATION OF SINGLE-CELL PRODUCTION FROM Taxus cuspidata PLANT CELL AGGREGATES  ap. 219-235.  aFlow-cytometric characterization of plant cell culture growth and metabolism at the single-cell level is a method superior to traditional culture average measurements for collecting population information. Investigation of culture heterogeneity and production variability by obtaining information about different culture subpopulations is crucial for optimizing bio-processes for enhanced productivity. Obtaining high yields of intact and viable single cells from aggregated plant cell cultures is an enabling criterion for their analysis and isolation using high-throughput flow cytometric methods. The critical parameters affecting the enzymatic isolation of single cells from aggregated Taxus cuspidata plant cell suspensions were optimized using response-surface methodology and factorial central composite design. Using a design of experiments approach, the output response single-cell yield (SCY, percentage of cell clusters containing only a single cell) was optimized. Optimal conditions were defined for the independent parameters cellulase concentration, pectolyase Y-23 concentration, and centrifugation speed to be 0.045% (w/v), 0.7% (w/v), and 1200 × g, respectively. At these optimal conditions, the model predicted a maximum SCY of 48%. The experimental data exhibited a 72% increase over previously attained values and additionally validated the model predictions. More than 99% of the isolated cells were viable and suitable for rapid analysis through flow cytometry, thus enabling the collection of population information from cells that accurately represent aggregated suspensions. These isolated cells can be further studied to gain insight into both growth and secondary metabolite production, which can be used for bio-process optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaxus cuspidata 3abioprocessing 3acell aggregates 3acell suspension culture 3acell viability 3acentrifugation 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aexperimental design 3aflow cytometry 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3asecondary metabolites 0acentral composite design 0adesign of experiments (doe) 0aflow cytometry 0apaclitaxel 0aresponse-surface methodology 0aTaxus1 aRoberts, Susan C.0 tPreparative biochemistry & biotechnology.g2011 July 1, v. 41, no. 3 p.219-235dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2011.575261  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015500155300001600310520143300326592002801759650001201787650001901799650002101818650001601839650001701855650001801872650002001890650001401910650002601924650001501950650002001965650001501985650002902000650004002029700001502069700001302084700001302097700001502110700001402125700001502139700001202154773013602166856007502302852000902377655001202386IND60765375720221119151749.0220422e20121012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076537572DNAL7 a10.17221/6348-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Y.X.10a&nbsp;Comparative proteomics analysis of plasma proteins during the transition period in dairy cows with or without subclinical mastitis after calving  ap. 481-489.  aThe transition period is the most critical time of the cow&rsquo;s lactation cycle that is associated with the onset of mastitis. In this study, changes of plasma proteins in cows (n = 12) with or without subclinical mastitis after calving were determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), which detected 18 spots with variations in protein spots abundance. These spots were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The changes in protein profile from day 21 before calving to day 1 after calving were similar in cows with or without subclinical mastitis. Abundance of &alpha;1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) and haptoglobin was dramatically increased at parturition, while transthyretin was down-regulated at parturition, and apolipoprotein E and immunoglobulin gamma 1 were up-regulated at postpartum compared with prepartum in periparturient dairy cows. In cows infected with subclinical mastitis, AGP, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A were dramatically increased and continued to be elevated in plasma from day 1 to day 21 after calving compared with cows free of mastitis. Changes of protein in plasma at parturition may serve as an immune system response to parturition and lactation process at the protein level and suggest that these altered proteins would not serve as a potential marker for predicting if the periparturient dairy cows are susceptible to subclinical mastitis. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aanimal science 3aapolipoprotein E 3ablood serum 3ahaptoglobins 3aimmune system 3aimmunoglobulins 3alactation 3aliquid chromatography 3aprealbumin 3aprotein content 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aWang, J.Q.1 aBu, D.P.1 aLi, S.S.1 aYuan, T.J.1 aZhou, L.Y1 aYang, J.H.1 aSun, P.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 57, no. 10 p.481-489dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/6348-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006000171300001400231520078200245592002801027650001401055653000801069653000801077653001001085653001201095653002801107653001801135653002201153653002301175653002801198773009601226856008601322852000901408655001201417IND60628324420221120224605.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062832442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasajus, André10aRelaxations of symmetry and the weighted Shapley values  ap. 75-78.  aWe revisit Kalai and Samet’s (1987) first characterization of the class of weighted Shapley values. While keeping efficiency, additivity, and the null player property from the original characterization of the symmetric Shapley value, they replace symmetry with positivity and partnership consistency. The latter two properties, however, are neither implied by nor related to symmetry. We suggest relaxations of symmetry that together with efficiency, additivity, and the null player property characterize classes of weighted Shapley values. For example, weak sign symmetry requires the payoffs of mutually dependent players to have the same sign. Mutually dependent players are symmetric players whose marginal contributions to coalitions containing neither of them are zero.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 0aC71 0aD60 0a91A12 0aTU game 0aWeighted Shapley values 0aSign symmetry 0aMutual dependence 0aWeak sign symmetry 0aSuperweak sign symmetry0 tEconomics letters.g2019 Mar., v. 176 p.75-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2018.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012900162300001600291520130900307592002801616650001401644650002701658650002701685650002501712650001701737650001201754650002501766650001501791650001701806650001401823650001601837650001301853650001101866650001201877650001901889650001201908650001301920653001901933653002101952653002501973653001401998653002502012700001502037700001602052700001402068773013802082856008002220852000902300655001202309IND60622084520221123023540.0181123e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062208452DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132050527642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunkova, R.10aAnalysis of Plant Extracts Antimutagenicity Using the Ames Test and the Cytogenetic Analysis of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes  ap. 107-112.  aThis work was focused on comparison of antimutagenic effect of selected plant extracts (carrot, paprika, tomato, spinach, onion, kiwi and green tea) analysed by two independent tests of genotoxicity: i) the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and ii) cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes (CAPL). Both methods were proved without and/or with metabolic activation. Samples were allowed to be positive antimutagens based on their ability to inhibit the mutagenic effects of standard mutagens. High positive results (more than 60% of inhibition of mutagenic effect) were obtained with extract from green tea. Extracts from paprika, carrot and spinach as well as solutions of standard alltrans-carotene and some standard flavonoids showed antimutagenic (40-60% of inhibition) or weakly antimutagenic (20-40% of inhibition) effects. Positive antimutagenic effects of extracts from spinach and green tea were determined using CAPL method too. Further, the comparison of antimutagenic activity and antioxidant capacity of tested samples analysed using TRAP (total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter) method was proved. Extract from green tea showed the highest antioxidant as well as antimutagenic capacity, but no correlation was found between these parameters in all tested extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmes test 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantimutagenic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarrots 3acytogenetic analysis 3aflavonoids 3agenotoxicity 3agreen tea 3alymphocytes 3amutagens 3aonions 3apaprika 3aplant extracts 3aspinach 3atomatoes 0aplant extracts 0aantimutagenicity 0aantioxidant capacity 0aAmes test 0acytogenetic analysis1 aMarova, I.1 aPokorna, Z.1 aLojek, A.0 tFood science and technology international.g2005 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.107-112dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132050527643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245015500166300001800321520242500339592002802764650001402792650001102806650001902817650001402836650001402850650001502864650001102879650002302890700002702913700002602940700001502966773012602981856008203107852000903189655001203198IND60567911720180615000000.0170501e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056791172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b119992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAramburu, J.

Our results contradict much of the existing literature where these systems are analyzed within the quasi-JT regime which assumes the usual JT description with a small splitting between b₁g(∼x²–y²) and a₁g(∼3z²–r²) orbitals and also the existence of three nearly equivalent distortions. To clarify this issue we investigate the equilibrium geometry (equatorial, Rₑq, and axial, Rₐₓ, Cu²⁺–F– distances) and optical transitions for CuF₆⁴– units formed in Cu²⁺-doped the tetragonal Ba₂ZnF₆ host lattice. While the experimental d–d transitions cannot be reproduced through the isolated CuF₆⁴– unit at the equilibrium geometry, a reasonable agreement is reached adding in the calculation the internal electric field, ER(r), created by the rest of lattice ions on the electrons confined in the complex. It is shown that this tetragonal field, ER(r), already produces a gap Δ₀ ∼ 0.35 eV between b₁g(∼x²–y²) and a₁g(∼3z²–r²) orbitals of Ba₂ZnF₆:Cu²⁺ when Rₐₓ = Rₑq. Nevertheless, as this internal field leads to a Δ₀ value higher than typical JT barriers it drastically modifies the characteristic pattern of a JT effect. In particular, it prevents the existence of three equivalent distortions as confirmed by experimental EPR data. Furthermore, ER(r) is shown to be the main physical reason behind an unusual compressed ground state with the hole in the a₁g(∼3z²–r²) level while it is always placed in the b₁g(∼x²–y²) level for MX₆ complexes (M = Cu²⁺, Ag²⁺, Ni⁺; X = F–, Cl–) in cubic lattices displaying a static JT effect. While the experimental results of CuF₆⁴– in Ba₂ZnF₆ cannot be understood within the JT framework it is pointed out that a quasi-JT situation can however happen for a d⁹ ion in a cubic lattice under a strain of ∼10–³ in agreement with experimental data. The present results stress the key role played by the internal electric fields for a quantitative understanding of compounds with transition metal cations. Moreover, they also demonstrate that in the interpretation of experimental data the use of a simple model should be avoided unless all its assumptions are well justified.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3acopper 3aelectric field 3aelectrons 3afluorides 3ametal ions 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry1 aGarcía-Fernández, P.1 aGarcía-Lastra, J.

Lignin is considered as a crucial recalcitrance component in biomass utilization. An in-depth understanding of lignin biosynthesis can provide clues to overcoming the recalcitrance. Laccases are believed to play a role in the oxidation of lignin monomers, leading to the formation of higher-order lignin. In plants, functions of only a few laccases have been evaluated, so little is known about the effect of laccases on cell wall structure and biomass saccharification. RESULTS: In this study, we screened a gain-of-function mutant with a significant increase in lignin content from Arabidopsis mutant lines overexpressing a full-length poplar cDNA library. Further analysis confirmed that a Chinese white poplar (Populus tomentosa) laccase gene PtoLAC14 was inserted into the mutant, and PtoLAC14 could functionally complement the Arabidopsis lac4 mutant. Overexpression of PtoLAC14 promoted the lignification of poplar and reduced the proportion of syringyl/guaiacyl. In contrast, the CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutation of PtLAC14 results in increased the syringyl/guaiacyl ratios, which led to integrated enhancement on biomass enzymatic saccharification. Notably, the recombinant PtoLAC14 protein showed higher oxidized efficiency to coniferyl alcohol (precursor of guaiacyl unit) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PtoLAC14 plays an important role in the oxidation of guaiacyl deposition on cell wall. The reduced recalcitrance of the PtoLAC14-KO lines suggests that PtoLAC14 is an elite target for cell wall engineering, and genetic manipulation of this gene will facilitate the utilization of lignocellulose.  aPublisher supplied data  a31800505cthe National Science Foundation of China  a31870657cthe National Science Foundation of China  aXDJK2019C102cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University (CN) 3aArabidopsis 3aPopulus tomentosa 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acDNA libraries 3acell walls 3acomplement 3aconiferyl alcohol 3adigestibility 3aengineering 3aexhibitions 3again-of-function mutation 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3alaccase 3alignification 3alignin 3alignin content 3alignocellulose 3amutants 3aoxidation 3asaccharification1 aFan, Chunfen1 aLi, Xiaohong1 aLi, Yi1 aHu, Jian1 aLi, Chaofeng1 aLuo, Keming0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.197-197dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-020-01843-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245014200178520169800320592002802018650002602046650002202072650002102094650002602115650002702141650002802168650002702196650002902223650002602252650002102278650001202299650001202311650001702323650002202340650001602362650001002378650001802388650001402406650001902420650001902439650001602458650001302474650002302487653002802510653001902538653002902557653001402586700002402600700001602624700002802640700002302668700001802691700002202709773010402731856008702835852000902922655001202931IND60780577920221123042109.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078057792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1126402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisht, Narendra Singh12aA facile synthesis of palladium nanoparticles decorated bismuth oxybromide nanostructures with exceptional photo-antimicrobial activities  aAssessing the interaction between microbes and nanocatalysts for finding an inclusive, proactive and deep understanding of nanoparticles-based toxicity is vital for discovering their broad range of applications. Palladium based photocatalysts owing to their unique fundamental characteristics and brilliant physicochemical potential have gained immense interest in environment remediation as disinfection system. In the present study, we report synthesis of a novel palladium nanoparticles decorated bismuth oxybromide (Pd/BiOBr) nanostructures using an energy efficient solution-based method, having excellent photocatalytic antibacterial action. The synthesized nanomaterials was thoroughly characterized using various analytical techniques. The photocatalytic antibacterial efficiency of Pd/BiOBr was evaluated against some common pathogenic strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas salmonicida, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis). In our results Pd/BiOBr showed excellent photocatalytic disinfection efficacy with > 99.9% bacterial inactivation. A very low concentration of Pd/BiOBr (0.5 µg/mL) effectively inhibited the bacterial growth in response to just 2 h of visible light irradiation, while 1 µg/mL of Pd/BiOBr completely killed all the tested bacterial strains proving their magnificent bactericidal potential. The developed materials with exceptional antibacterial broad range efficiency can be used in different photocatalytic disinfection systems including water purification systems, biofilm exclusion and combating differential antibiotic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas salmonicida 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial growth 3abiofilm 3abismuth 3adisinfection 3aenergy efficiency 3airradiation 3alight 3ananocatalysts 3apalladium 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aremediation 3atoxicity 3awater purification 0aPd/BiOBr nanostructures 0aPhotocatalysts 0aAntibacterial activities 0aPathogens1 aTripathi, Ankita H.1 aPant, Megha1 aKumar Upadhyay, Santosh1 aSahoo, Nanda Gopal1 aMehta, S.P.S.1 aDandapat, Anirban0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept., v. 217 p.112640-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1126403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100004500152245018300197300001600380520099400396592002801390650001301418650001301431650004101444650001101485650001001496650001401506650001501520650002301535650001501558653001301573653001801586653001101604653002301615653002101638653001501659700003101674700002601705700002801731700003301759773010001792856008701892852000901979655001201988IND60611974020221118011833.0200503e20190130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061197402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastilhos, Maurício Bonatto Machado de,10aSensory descriptive and comprehensive GC–MS as suitable tools to characterize the effects of alternative winemaking procedures on wine aroma.

The wines contained higher concentration of acetates (ranging from 303 mg L⁻¹ to 905 mg L⁻¹) and ethyl and methyl esters (ranging from 138 mg L⁻¹ to 415 mg L⁻¹). The BRS Carmem wines were described as fruity due to the higher concentration of esters and BRS Violeta wines were described as vegetal mainly due to the higher concentration of terpenes and methoxyphenols. C6 alcohols also influenced the vegetal notes of BRS Violeta wines from traditional and submerged cap procedures and the pre-dried wines also presented a relevant jam note possibly due to the presence of 2-phenylethyl acetate. The changes in winemaking procedures can possibly lead to changes in the aromatic profile of red wines in a positive way, improving the wine aroma quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrapes 3aodors 3ared wines 3aterpenoids 3avolatile compounds 3awinemaking 0aRed wine 0aSubmerged cap 0aDrying 0aVolatile compounds 0aSensory analysis 0aWinemaking1 aBianchi, Vanildo Luiz del,1 aGómez-Alonso, Sergio1 aGarcía-Romero, Esteban1 aHermosín-Gutiérrez, Isidro0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Jan. 30, v. 272 p.462-470dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014900168520141500317592002801732650001601760650001101776650002001787650001501807650001501822650002501837650001501862650001901877650001901896650002401915650002601939653001801965653002901983653004902012653002202061653001602083700001802099700001802117700001402135700001502149773010402164856008702268852000902355655001202364IND60780578020221123042218.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078057802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1126412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Huiling10aAg nanoparticles/PbTiO3 with in-situ photocatalytic process and its application in an ultra-sensitive molecularly imprinted hemoglobin detection  aAn electrochemical sensor based on loading molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) on the material surface can improve the specificity towards the object. In this work, a T-shaped PbTiO₃ with a high active-exposed (110) facet was prepared by a hydrothermal process. Then, Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) modified T-shaped PbTiO₃ was obtained by in-situ photocatalytic reduced method under UV irradiation, where a hetero-junction was formed with a well lattice matching between the (111) facet of Ag⁰ and the (110) facet of PbTiO₃. A MIPs modified by Ag nanoparticles (NPs)/PbTiO₃ (MAP) electrodes was prepared via electro polymerization process by o-Phenylenediamine (o-PD) in the presence of the template molecule, bovine hemoglobin (BHb), i.e., the detected molecule. The response peak current and concentration of BHb is demonstrated with a good linear relationship in the range of 0.00294–0.41 nM (R² =0.98), and the detection limit at 0.23 pM (S/N = 3). A heterojunction between Ag NPs and high- active facet of PbTiO₃ is beneficial to oxidizing electroactive material ([Fe (CN)₆]³⁻/⁴⁻), generating more BHb-imprinting cavities on the modified electrode and improving the sensitivity of sensor. The electrochemical sensor is with a simple, stable structure and high sensitivity to BHb detection. Furthermore, the sensor was successfully applied to detect BHb in the bovine serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acattle 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3ahemoglobin 3amolecular imprinting 3ananosilver 3aphotocatalysis 3apolymerization 3asensors (equipment) 3aultraviolet radiation 0aLead titanate 0aPhotocatalytic reduction 0aMolecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor 0aBovine hemoglobin 0aSpecificity1 aLiu, Yongguan1 aXie, Wenqiang1 aLin, Xing1 aPan, Haibo0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept., v. 217 p.112641-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1126413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245017100214300001300385520163800398592002802036650001102064650001002075650001602085650001302101650002002114650001802134650002302152653003602175653002802211653004202239700003002281700002202311700002702333700002502360700002202385773011702407856008302524852000902607655001202616IND60611133120221121201532.0190405e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061113312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2018.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Vollenhoven, Elize1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1855-915510aSalivary Glucocorticoid and Fecal Glucocorticoid Metabolite Concentrations in Pony Mares During Transrectal Palpation of the Reproductive Tract by Veterinary Students  ap. 7-12.  aVeterinary schools rely on live animals to assist in teaching veterinary students clinical procedures. The aims of the study were to (1) quantify a potential physiological stress response of teaching mares during veterinary student transrectal palpation of their reproductive tracts using fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) and salivary glucocorticoid concentrations (sGC) and (2) to determine the relationship between the glucocorticoid concentrations and both the ages and palpation experience of the study animals. Twenty-nine, adult, nonpregnant Nooitgedacht mares, which were accustomed to the routine procedure of palpation, were subjected to a palpation of 20 minutes per mare by a single student. Median sGC concentrations before palpation (collected in paddocks) were not significantly different from those determined at 10, 40, and 70 minutes after palpation (χ2 = 1.69, df = 3, P = .64). Median fGCM concentrations before palpation (start of palpation) were not significantly different from those determined at 26 hours after palpation (W = −89.0; P = .34). Neither prepalpation sGC nor postpalpation fGCM concentrations correlated with either age of the mares (Pearson's r = −0.02, n = 28, P = .91; Pearson's r = 0.30, n = 29, P = .11) or practical experience (number of transrectal palpations conducted before the study; Pearson's r = −0.008, n = 28, P = .97; Pearson's r = 0.26, n = 29, P = .18) of the mares, respectively. This study suggested that student transrectal palpations of the reproductive tract in habituated mares did not activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3amares 3ametabolites 3apastures 3astress response 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary schools 0aFecal glucocorticoid metabolite 0aSalivary glucocorticoid 0aStudent transrectal palpation of mare1 aGrant, Catharina Cornelia1 aFletcher, Lizelle1 aSchulman, Martin Lance1 aPage, Patrick Collin1 aGanswindt, André0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2018 Nov., v. 70 p.7-12dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2018.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012600165300001800291520106700309592002801376650003701404650001101441650002101452650001101473650002201484650002201506650001901528700002401547700001901571700002101590700002001611700002201631700002401653773012601677856008201803852000901885655001201894IND60567911920180615000000.0170501e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056791192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b120502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Yongfeng10aInterplay between Structural and Electronic Properties in 1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic Dianhydride Films on Cu(100)  ap. 5050-5057.  aUsing various surface science techniques, we have studied the properties of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA) thin films on a Cu(100) surface. STM investigations suggest the high mobility of the NTCDA molecules over the surface, leading to the formation of large and well-ordered islands. In line with LEED results, two typical domains with different molecular orientations and brick-wall-like structure are revealed in the STM images. On the other hand, a fingerprint of covalent bonding at the NTCDA/Cu interface is obtained from the core level shifts measured by high-resolution XPS. As a consequence, a charge transfer process develops at the interface and enables a total filling of the π*-like lowest unoccupied orbital, which is the signature of the semiconductor character of the NTCDA layer. The carbon K-edge NEXAFS data confirm the chemisorption nature of the interaction between NTCDA and the Cu(100) surface and indicate an evolution from a flat-lying orientation of NTCDA at 1 ML to a straight-up orientation in a thick layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3acopper 3afilms (materials) 3aorganic compounds 3asemiconductors1 aNicolas, François,1 aKubsky, Stefan1 aOughaddou, Hamid1 aSirotti, Fausto1 aEsaulov, Vladimir1 aBendounan, Azzedine0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Mar. 09, v. 121, no. 9 p.5050-5057dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b120503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245008800178300001400266520111300280592002801393650001101421650002301432650001101455650002301466650001201489650002101501650002601522650002201548650001201570650001201582650003301594653002201627653002001649653002101669653003001690700002301720773009801743856008701841852000901928655001201937IND60611974120221118011645.0190402e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061197412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParavisini, Laurianne10aReactive carbonyl species as key control point for optimization of reaction flavors  ap. 71-78.  aThe objective of this work was to characterize Maillard-derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS) involved in the thermal generation of the popcorn smelling compound, 2-acetylpyridine and develop a targeted approach to optimize the RCS composition and reaction yield. Formation of 2-acetylpyridine from the reaction of glucose and proline was investigated using the carbon module labeling technique and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Incorporation of C3 transient carbonyl compounds was identified as the main route of 2-acetylpyridine formation. Further isotope labeling experiments were carried out to characterize the RCS composition of the reaction mixture using liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 1,3-Dihydroxyacetone and acetol, were suggested as key precursors of 2-acetylpyridine. The formation of these specific RCS was subsequently optimized using response surface methodology and a pre-thermal reaction, that ultimately resulted in a 2-fold increase in 2-acetylpyridine. In summary, RCS were demonstrated as a new control point for reaction flavor development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbonyl compounds 3aflavor 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apopcorn 3aproline 3aresponse surface methodology 0aMaillard reaction 0aReaction flavor 0a2-Acetylpyridine 0aReactive carbonyl species1 aPeterson, Devin G.0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 274 p.71-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04206naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011000168300001200278520201700290592002802307596005402335596005802389596005402447596004102501596004402542596007102586596009702657596005502754596002802809650002102837650001802858650002002876650001902896650002902915650001102944650001902955650001702974650002502991650001703016650001103033650001403044650002103058650003203079650002703111650002703138650001503165700002503180700002203205700002303227700001603250700001703266700002303283700001803306700002203324773011303346856008303459961001703542852000903559655001203568IND60719686520221121055537.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071968652DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04487-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Marta G.10aEndochin-like quinolone-300 and ELQ-316 inhibit Babesia bovis, B. bigemina, B. caballi and Theileria equi  ap. 606.  aBACKGROUND: The most common apicomplexan parasites causing bovine babesiosis are Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, while B. caballi and Theileria equi are responsible for equine piroplasmosis. Treatment and control of these diseases are usually achieved using potentially toxic chemotherapeutics, such as imidocarb diproprionate, but drug-resistant parasites are emerging, and alternative effective and safer drugs are needed. The endochin-like quinolones (ELQ)-300 and ELQ-316 have been proven to be safe and efficacious against related apicomplexans, such as Plasmodium spp., with ELQ-316 also being effective against Babesia microti, without showing toxicity in mammals. METHODS: The inhibitory effects of ELQ-300 and ELQ-316 were assessed on the growth of cultured B. bovis, B. bigemina, B. caballi and T. equi. The percentage of parasitized erythrocytes was measured by flow cytometry, and the effect of the ELQ compounds on the viability of horse and bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was assessed by monitoring cell metabolic activity using a colorimetric assay. RESULTS: We calculated the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) at 72 h, which ranged from 0.04 to 0.37 nM for ELQ-300, and from 0.002 to 0.1 nM for ELQ-316 among all cultured parasites tested at 72 h. None of the parasites tested were able to replicate in cultures in the presence of ELQ-300 and ELQ-316 at the maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₁₀₀), which ranged from 1.3 to 5.7 nM for ELQ-300 and from 1.0 to 6.0 nM for ELQ-316 at 72 h. Neither ELQ-300 nor ELQ-316 altered the viability of equine and bovine PBMC at their IC₁₀₀ in in vitro testing. CONCLUSIONS: The compounds ELQ-300 and ELQ-316 showed significant inhibitory activity on the main parasites responsible for bovine babesiosis and equine piroplasmosis at doses that are tolerable to host cells. These ELQ drugs may be viable candidates for developing alternative protocols for the treatment of bovine babesiosis and equine piroplasmosis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2090-32000-039-00DcAgricultural Research Service  a108525-001cInternational Development Research Centre  ai01 BX003312cU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs  aPR181134cU.S. Department of Defense  aAI100569cNational Institutes of Health  aR01AI141412cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  aBX002440cU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development  aBX004522cU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (US)  a14S-RCS001cVA Research 3aBabesia bigemina 3aBabesia bovis 3aBabesia caballi 3aTheileria equi 3aantiprotozoal properties 3acattle 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aequine piroplasmosis 3aerythrocytes 3ahorses 3aimidocarb 3ain vitro culture 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amaximum tolerated dose 3amononuclear leukocytes 3aquinolones1 aBastos, Reginaldo G.1 aStone Doggett, J.1 aRiscoe, Michael K.1 aPou, Sovitj1 aWinter, Rolf1 aDodean, Rozalia A.1 aNilsen, Aaron1 aSuarez, Carlos E.0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.606-606dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04487-33Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245013100161300001600292520125900308592002801567650002401595650001401619650001701633650001801650650002501668650001701693650004301710650002501753650001101778650001901789650002401808650001101832653001801843653002501861653001701886653001401903700001701917700001701934700001601951773013801967856008002105852000902185655001202194IND60622084920221123023600.0181123e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062208492DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132050544212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, A.10aNote: Quantification of Ascorbic Acid and Dehydroascorbic Acid in Fresh Olives and in Commercial Presentations of Table Olives  ap. 199-204.  aAscorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in fresh green olives as well as a diversity of commercial presentations of table olives (based on both Spanish-style green olives and directly brined olives). Fresh green olives (Manzanilla cv.) immediately after harvest contained about 9mg total ascorbic acid/100g f.w., with DHAA representing more than 90% of this amount. During the post-harvest period (till 2 weeks) the total vitamin C remained stable when olives were stored at 6°C, but significant degradation occurred at ambient temperature (~35% loss after 7 days). In commercial presentations of table olives, in general, the main contribution to the total vitamin C level appeared to come from AA added as an antioxidant, the maximum level being found in Manzanilla olives stuffed with anchovy streams (36.1mg/100g f.w.). However, in some samples (e.g. plain olives) that did declare any added AA, very low levels (0.1-0.6mg total AA/100g f.w.) were found. Our hypothesis is that, in those samples, AA would be degraded by lactic acid bacteria and/or yeast from olive fermentation, whereas pasteurisation in other presentations (e.g. stuffed olives) would stabilise added AA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanchovies 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3adehydroascorbic acid 3afermentation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alactic acid bacteria 3aolives 3apasteurization 3astorage temperature 3ayeasts 0aascorbic acid 0adehydroascorbic acid 0atable olives 0avitamin C1 aMontaño, A.1 aGarcía, P.,1 aGarrido, A.0 tFood science and technology international.g2005 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.199-204dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132050544213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169300001600286520098000302592002801282650001801310650001301328650002501341650001701366650002101383650001701404650001501421653002201436653001701458653001801475653002101493653001701514700001601531700001801547700001801565700001801583700001501601700001701616773009101633856008601724852000901810655001201819IND60628974520221120114019.0190404e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062897452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Wen-Li12aA rhodamine-deoxylactam based fluorescent probe for fast and selective detection of nitric oxide in living cells  ap. 436-443.  aNitric oxide (NO) plays vital roles in many physiological process and is closely related to many diseases. So far, a number of fluorescent probes have been constructed for the detection of NO successfully. However, the probes still suffer from long-time reaction and limited selectivity. Herein, a fluorescent probe named dRB-OPD is synthesized and used to recognize NO. The probe contains a deoxy-rhodamine B as fluorophore and o-phenylenediamino as reaction site. dRB-OPD shows fast response to NO within 40 s with 170-fold fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, the probe shows high selectivity towards NO over dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), ascorbic acid (AA), and methylglyoxal (MGO). Particularly, the probe can avoid the serious interference from cysteine (Cys) found in the rhodamine lactam-based fluorescent NO probes (RB-OPD). In addition, the probe is applied for the detection of exogenous and endogenous NO in the HepG2 and RAW 264.7 cells with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acysteine 3adehydroascorbic acid 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3anitric oxide 3arhodamines 0aFluorescent probe 0aNitric oxide 0aFast response 0aHigh selectivity 0aCell imaging1 aLi, Yongfei1 aLiu, Hong-Wen1 aZhou, Dong-Ye1 aOu-Yang, Juan1 aYi, Lanhua1 aLi, Chun-Yan0 tTalanta.g2019 May 15, v. 197 p.436-443dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008400158520159400242592002801836650001801864650002201882650000901904650001201913650001201925650001301937650002301950650002201973650002001995650002102015650001502036650001702051650001302068650001202081650000902093700002102102700001902123700001702142700001702159700001602176773012102192856007402313852000902387655001202396IND60794179320221117095120.0220922e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079417932DNAL7 a10.3390/f130914932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bingwen 10aFoliar Application of Selenium Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Walnut Seedlings  aCadmium (Cd) and selenium (Se) could jointly affect plant growth. To investigate the affect of Se on the Cd accumulation in Juglans regia and the physiological mechanism by which Se regulates Cd-induced oxidative stress, in this study, the effects of different foliar application doses of Se (0 (Se0), 20 (Se20), and 200 (Se200) μM) on J. regia (variety Xinfeng) seedlings under Cd stress (5 mM) were determined. The results show that exogenous application of Se (Se20 and Se200) increased walnut biomass compared with Se0 under Cd stress. Under Cd stress, exogenous application of 20 μM Se increased the catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate oxidase (AAO) activities in walnut roots and the CAT and AAO activities in walnut leaves, and exogenous application of 200 μM Se increased the CAT, POD, and AAO activities in walnut roots. Furthermore, under Cd stress, exogenous application of 20 and 200 μM Se both decreased the contents of superoxide (O₂•⁻), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in walnut roots and the content of MDA in walnut leaves. Moreover, application of 20 and 200 μM Se both reduced the accumulation of Cd in the root, wood, bark, and leaves of walnuts, and application of 200 μM Se enhanced Se concentration in the root, wood, bark, and leaves. Overall, exogenous application of Se, especially 200 μM Se, could reduce Cd accumulation and enhance CAT, POD, and AAO activities in Cd-stressed walnut roots, thus alleviating Cd stress. This study provides technical guidance for reducing the effects of Cd stress on walnut growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuglans regia 3aascorbate oxidase 3abark 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acatalase 3afoliar application 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aselenium 3awalnuts 3awood1 aZhang, Dangquan 1 aWang, Wenfeng 1 aSong, Yukun 1 aLu, Mengfei 1 aDing, Shen 0 tForests.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130914933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012300163300001800286520113100304592002801435650001001463650001101473650000901484650002601493650002701519650002301546650001701569650001601586700001301602700001501615700001501630700001201645700001401657700001501671773012601686856008201812852000901894655001201903IND60567912120221118103249.0170501e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056791212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b121292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Haoyang10aEmploying CdSexTe1–x Alloyed Quantum Dots to Avoid the Temperature-Dependent Emission Shift of Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 5313-5323.  aAs one of the most promising alternatives in liquid-crystal display backlight, quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) exhibit many advantages. However, the inherent thermal sensitivity of quantum dots (QDs) from lattice dilation leads to the temperature-dependent shift of the emission peak, which results in visible color change as great heat is generated during QLED working. To fabricate temperature-independent QLEDs, CdSeₓTe₁–ₓ alloyed QDs are designed and employed as the color conversion materials on GaN LED chips. The key is the adjustment of the energy bandgaps in alloyed QDs. Upon temperature increment, the bandgap between the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) increases, while the energy bandgap between the trap state and CB reduces. As a result, the lowered energy of exciton recombination from QD lattice dilation can be offset by the increased energy of trap-related exciton recombination, thus producing the QDs without temperature-dependent emission shift. The LEDs on the basis of CdSeₓTe₁–ₓ QDs are further fabricated, which decreases the temperature-dependent emission shift.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aenergy 3aheat 3alight emitting diodes 3aliquid crystal display 3aphysical chemistry 3aquantum dots 3atemperature1 aLiu, Min1 aZhou, Ding1 aZhang, Xun1 aLiu, Yi1 aYang, Bai1 aZhang, Hao0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Mar. 09, v. 121, no. 9 p.5313-5323dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b121293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014800171300001600319520121100335592002801546650001401574650002701588650002401615650002001639650001701659650001301676650001701689650001601706650000901722650001101731650001301742650001501755650001401770653000901784653001201793653000901805653000801814653002901822700001501851700001701866700001201883700001501895773009101910856008602001852000902087655001202096IND60628974620221120114100.0190404e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062897462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cengceng10aRatio fluorometric determination of ATP base on the reversion of fluorescence of calcein quenched by Eu(III) ion using carbon dots as reference  ap. 451-456.  aA kind of nitrogen doped carbon dots (NCDs) with excellent stable luminescence performance was prepared by pyrolysis using ethanolamine as precursor. By simply mixing solution of NCDs and calcein-Eu3+, a ratio fluorometric probe with carbon dots as "internal reference" and calcein-Eu3+ as recognition group was constructed for ATP detection. The fluorescence of the calcein can be selectively quenched by Eu3+, and can be restored when ATP was added because Eu3+ ions exhibit higher affinity to the oxygen-donor atoms originated from phosphates than that from carboxylate groups. Meanwhile, fluorescence of NCDs was not affected by Eu3+, calcein or ATP. By adding NCDs as "internal reference" in the above system, a new ratiometric strategy for detecting ATP was conducted. The dynamic linear range for ATP detection was 5.0 × 10−8 mol L−1~ 2.0 × 10−6 mol L−1, and the detection limit was 2.0 × 10−8 mol L−1.The method was successfully applied to detecting ATP in adenosine disodium triphosphate injection. Compared with calcein- Eu3+ probe without NCDs as reference, the ratio fluorometric probe effectively reduced interference and improved the accuracy and sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acarbon quantum dots 3adetection limit 3aethanolamine 3aeuropium 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3aions 3amixing 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3apyrolysis 0aNCDs 0aCalcein 0aEu3+ 0aATP 0aRatio fluorometric probe1 aZhang, Hui1 aYu, Yuanyuan1 aWu, Shu1 aChen, Fang0 tTalanta.g2019 May 15, v. 197 p.451-456dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245006400172300001600236520112600252592002801378650002301406650000901429650001701438650000901455650001101464650001501475650001601490650001701506650001901523653002201542653002601564653002401590653002601614700002101640700002001661700001901681700001901700700002201719700001701741773012001758856008301878852000901961655001201970IND60611133520221121222643.0190405e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061113352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButterfield, Chance14aThe Pretransport Management of Stress in Performance Horses  ap. 145-148.  aThe aim of this study was to ascertain whether DeStress nutritional therapy administration to performance horses before transportation would reduce stress expression in these animals. Ten performance horses were used in the present study offered either control (rice hulls) or treated (DeStress crumbles) diets before transportation. A cross-over design whereby all animals were tested both under control and treatment conditions was used. Orbital eye temperatures determined noninvasively before and after transportation using infrared thermography were used to monitor the efficacy of this nutritional therapy. Baseline eye temperatures before transportation were 34.1 ± 1.1°C for the control group and 34.3 ± 1.2°C for the treatment group (P > .05). After the horses had been transported, the eye temperatures were 35.3 ± 0.32°C for the control group and 34.7 ± 0.8°C for the treatment group (P < .05). These results suggest that providing a nutritional supplement (DeStress) to horses before transportation can reduce the physiological activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis due to that stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-over studies 3adiet 3adiet therapy 3aeyes 3ahorses 3arice hulls 3atemperature 3athermography 3atransportation 0aPerformance horse 0aTransportation stress 0aNutritional therapy 0aInfrared thermography1 aGrumpelt, Bernie1 aKimmel, Darrell1 aPatterson, Rob1 aJones, Krisjan1 aScott, Shannon L.1 aSchaefer, Al0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2018 Oct., v. 69 p.145-148dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2018.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245013500165300001800300520162700318592002801945650002101973650001501994650002402009650001202033650001802045650001402063650001302077650000902090650001102099650001702110650001302127650001502140650001802155650003302173650001002206650001702216650001602233650001202249650001802261700002402279700002102303773012202324856007402446852000902520655001202529IND60681001420221123005407.0200113e20200108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068100142DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07409k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazem, Mohammad Amin10aPreparation and optimization of activated nano-carbon production using physical activation by water steam from agricultural wastes  ap. 1463-1475.  aProduction of activated nano-carbon from agricultural wastes was studied in this work. To obtain the optimum production conditions by a physical activation method, influence of temperature (850, 900, 950 and 1000 °C), activation residence time (30, 60 and 90 min), and mill rotation (200, 300 and 400 rpm) were investigated using three different raw materials including walnut, almond and pistachio shells. To prepare activated nano-carbon, all the samples were heated up to the final activation temperature under a continuous steam flow of 130 cm³ min⁻¹, and at a heating rate of 3 °C min⁻¹, and were held at the different activation temperatures for 30, 60 and 90 minutes. BET surface area of the obtained activated carbons was measured from nitrogen adsorption data in the relative pressure range between 0 to 1. Activated nano-carbon standard indexes were evaluated according to the ASTM standard and the samples were compared. First, the cellulose raw material was heated in the carbonization furnace at 600 °C and then activated in the advanced activation furnace at a temperature between 850 to 1000 °C for 30, 60 and 90 minutes with water vapor. Ash percentage, iodine content, moisture content, specific area, elemental analysis, and FESEM were used for product characterization. The results of the analysis showed that by using the water vapor physical activation method and optimizing the parameters of this process including time and rotation of the mill up to 10 min and 400 rpm, resulted in a significant increase in specific surface area, cavity volume and the iodine number of the final product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aagricultural wastes 3aalmonds 3acarbonization 3acellulose 3afurnaces 3aheat 3aiodine 3aiodine value 3anitrogen 3apistachios 3araw materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asteam 3asurface area 3atemperature 3awalnuts 3awater content1 aZare, Masoud Habibi1 aShirazian, Saeed0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 08, v. 10, no. 3 p.1463-1475dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07409k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008300177300001600260520120800276592002801484650001501512650001601527650001601543650001001559650001601569650001701585650001101602650001801613650000701631650001301638653002701651653002901678653002201707653002001729700003101749700006201780773009101842856008601933852000902019655001202028IND60628974820221120113952.0190404e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062897482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinichev, Andrey V.10aNovel color standards for digital color analysis of optochemical sensor arrays  ap. 638-644.  aThe indicator-based polymeric color standards for color referencing in digital color analysis (DCA) of optical chemical sensors (optodes) are proposed. In the novel standards, the colors referring to the actual absorption bands of the protonated and deprotonated forms of the indicator are mixed in constant proportions. The standards are based on the lipophilic pH-indicators: ETH5350 and ETH2439, commonly used in optodes, and the lipophilic electrolyte TBATBB. The dependence of the standard color on the TBATBB concentration in the optode is established and found to be linear. The standard colors remain unchanged upon varying the solution pH and the nature and the concentration of the electrolyte. Calibration curves of the indicator pH-optodes obtained in horse serum and referenced to the developed standards demonstrate lower error to span ratio, broader span and higher sensitivity as compared to the same data processed with the conventional gray standard. The colorimetric signal of the pH-optodes array measured in serum sample and referenced to the developed standards allowed accurate determination of the sample pH thus demonstrating practical prospects of the proposed color standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablood serum 3acalibration 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aelectrolytes 3ahorses 3alipophilicity 3apH 3apolymers 0aDigital color analysis 0aOptical chemical sensors 0aPolymeric optodes 0aColor standards1 aPokhvishcheva, Nadezhda V.1 aPeshkova, Maria A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3798-74030 tTalanta.g2019 May 15, v. 197 p.638-644dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013800158300001800296520117300314592002801487650002201515650003701537650001501574650001901589650000901608650001801617650001601635650001901651650001901670650001501689650001701704650001901721650002101740650003701761650002601798650003701824700001501861700001401876773012201890856007402012852000902086655001202095IND60681001520221123005447.0200113e20200107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068100152DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07424d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Weidong10aBi₂O₃ and g-C₃N₄ quantum dot modified anatase TiO₂ heterojunction system for degradation of dyes under sunlight irradiation  ap. 1181-1190.  aA facile and feasible method was successfully utilized to incorporate Bi₂O₃ and g-C₃N₄ quantum dots on TiO₂ surface to synthesize a novel composite g-C₃N₄/TiO₂/Bi₂O₃. The photocatalytic activity of the composite g-C₃N₄/TiO₂/Bi₂O₃ for degradation of dyes under sunlight and UV light irradiation was evaluated. It possessed the higher photocatalytic performance than that of pristine TiO₂ or g-C₃N₄ under the same conditions. Under sunlight irradiation, the reaction rate constants of the g-C₃N₄/TiO₂/Bi₂O₃ was about 4.2 times and 3.3 times higher than that of TiO₂ and g-C₃N₄, respectively. The promising photocatalytic performance was attributed to the broader light absorption range and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. Moreover, based on the TEM, XPS, XRD, UV-vis spectrum, radicals scavenging test and Mott–Schottky analysis systematic mechanism for photodegradation process was proposed. This work provides a promising strategy for the modification of TiO₂-based semiconductors by incorporating different quantum dots and promoting the efficiency of the photocatalysts in practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3acarbon nitride 3adyes 3afree radicals 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3aquantum dots 3asemiconductors 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aYang, Chun1 aYu, Jiang0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 07, v. 10, no. 2 p.1181-1190dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07424d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008100164300001800245520084700263592002801110650001701138650002401155650002401179650002401203650002501227650002101252650001801273650001301291700002101304700001601325700001501341700001701356700001901373700005701392773013501449856008001584852000901664655001201673IND60606088520221119091901.0180724e20180208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060608852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b120402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guifeng10aPhase Transition-Promoted Hydrogen Evolution Performance of MoS2/VO2 Hybrids  ap. 2618-2623.  aIn this work, MoS₂/VO₂ hybrids were synthesized using a two-step hydrothermal method.

The VO₂ surface was treated using sulfuric acid to enhance the growth sites for MoS₂ as well as the hydrogen evolution reaction active sites for their hybrids. We demonstrate for the first time that the phase transition of VO₂ at elevated temperature shows significant effect on hydrogen evolution properties of the heterostructures. Upon the phase transition of VO₂, the onset potential and Tafel slope of MoS₂/VO₂ hybrids were dropped from 188 mV and 93 mV/dec to 99 mV and 85 mV/dec, respectively. This was attributed to the enhanced charge transport efficiency as well as interfacial strain effect on modifying the electronic structure of MoS₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aambient temperature 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen production 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aphase transition 3asulfuric acid 3atungsten1 aZhang, Xiaoqiang1 aGuan, Lixiu1 aZhang, Hui1 aXie, Xinjian1 aChen, Shiqiang1 aTao, Junguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0854-58920 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 08, v. 122, no. 5 p.2618-2623dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b120403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245005100162300001600213520106100229592002801290650001301318650001601331650001801347650001301365650001301378650001401391650002101405650001301426650001701439650001301456653001301469653001601482653001201498653001301510700001501523700001501538700001601553700002001569700001801589700002201607773013801629856008001767852000901847655001201856IND60622085320221117162925.0181123e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062208532DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132050549332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatalá, R.10aTitanium-Passivated Tinplate for Canning Foods  ap. 223-227.  aChromium-based treatments are currently used for the passivation of tinplate, which produces a protective surface layer consisting of a mixture of metal chromium and chromium oxide. This passivation film is effective against the formation of tin oxides and corrosion by food media, and offers a good substrate for the adhesion of protective organic coatings. However, there is an increasing concern about environmental and health risks with this passivation treatment. The aim of this paper was to study a new environmental friendly passivation treatment based on a titanium compound, applied on tinplate and afterwards lacquered with a conventional epoxyphenolic lacquer used for food can applications. The mechanical and electrochemical characteristics of the lacquered material and the metallic dissolution in canned sardines in tomato juice and peeled tomato were similar to those obtained with conventional Cr-passivated tinplate.

Significantly, the pore sizes of the NGM can be elaborately regulated by adjusting the thermal exfoliation conditions to simultaneously disperse and anchor Fe–N₄ moieties, ultimately leading to highly loaded Fe single-atom catalysts (SA-Fe-NGM) and a highly exposed morphology. The SA-Fe-NGM is found to deliver a superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in acidic media (half-wave potential = 0.83 V vs RHE) and a high power density of 634 mW cm–² in the H₂/O₂ fuel cell test. First-principles calculations further elucidate the possible catalytic mechanism for ORR based on the identified Fe–N₄ active sites and the pore size distribution analysis. This work provides a novel strategy for constructing highly exposed transition metals and nitrogen co-doped carbon materials (M–N–C) catalysts for extended electrocatalytic and energy storage applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a22005099cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2021M701211cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858  aNAcChina Scholarship Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004543  aKYCX21_0208cJiangsu Provincial Department of Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007166  aJPMJER2003cExploratory Research for Advanced Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009024 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3agraphene 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aporosity1 aXia, Wei1 aTang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-94591 aGao, Yong1 aJiang, Cheng1 aJia, Yining1 aChen, Tao1 aHou, Zhufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0069-55731 aQi, Ruijuan1 aJiang, Dong1 aAsahi, Toru1 aXu, Xingtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2286-43071 aWang, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4045-24341 aHe, Jianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7525-28091 aYamauchi, Yusuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7854-927X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 May 23, v. 144, no. 21 p.9280-9291dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c007193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245011800174300001800292520184800310592002802158650002502186650002002211650001002231650001302241650001402254650001102268650000902279700002302288700002402311700002202335773009702357856009002454990002302544852000902567655001202576IND60095836920221119043304.0141104e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009583692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoo, Peter H.10aComparison of structures of laminar methane–oxygen and methane–air diffusion flames from atmospheric to 60atm  ap. 1990-1998.  aA combined experimental and numerical study was conducted to examine the structure of laminar methane–oxygen diffusion flames in comparison with methane–air flames. Soot measurements made in these flames indicated that the maximum soot yields of methane–air flames are consistently higher than methane–oxygen flames at all pressures. The maximum soot yield of the methane–oxygen flames reaches a peak near 40atm and then starts decreasing as the pressure further increased. The maximum soot yield of the methane–air flames plateaus at about 40atm and does not change much with further increases in pressure. Methane–oxygen flames display a distinct two-zone structure which is visible from atmospheric pressure up to 60atm. The inner zone, similar to hydrocarbon-air diffusion flames, has a yellow/orange colour and is surrounded by an outer blue zone. This outer zone was shown to have a stratified structure with a very steep equivalence ratio gradient. The main reactions in this zone were shown to be the oxidation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced within the inner zone. The methane–air diffusion flames had a thin layer of blue outer zone at atmospheric pressure; however, this zone completely disappeared when the pressure was increased above atmospheric. The presence of the two-zone structure in the methane–oxygen flames was attributed to the intensified penetration of oxygen into the core flow. The higher diffusivities, steeper oxygen concentration gradients, and enhanced entrainment increase the transport of oxygen to the flame. As such, there is sufficient oxygen present near the base of the flame to support the diffusion flame in the inner zone of the methane–oxygen flames. The abundance of oxygen near the centerline, even in the lower portion of the flame, also promotes the oxidation of soot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon monoxide 3acolor 3ahydrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asoot1 aCharest, Marc R.J.1 aGroth, Clinton P.T.1 aGülder, Ömer L.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2013 Oct., v. 160, no. 10 p.1990-1998dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.04.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245013100152300001600283500002000299520173600319592002802055650001302083650001802096650001202114650002002126650002602146650001302172650001502185650002202200650002102222650001902243650002102262650001402283650001002297650002002307650001502327650001002342651001502352651000902367700001502376700001702391773011302408856007302521852000902594655001202603IND60587363120221120182024.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058736312DNAL7 a10.1111/wre.122592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmini, R10aEffects of environmental factors and burial depth on seed germination and emergence of two populations of Caucalis platycarpos  ap. 247-256.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCaucalis platycarpos is a weed species in irrigated and dry land farming systems in East Azerbaijan and Kermanshah provinces of Iran. Experiments were undertaken to compare C. platycarpos seed germination and emergence of a population from each province over a range of environmental factors, burial depth and crop residue treatments. The Azerbaijan population required lower temperatures (20/10°C day/night temperature) for its highest (90%) germination, compared with the Kermanshah population (88% germination at 25/15°C day/night temperature). In both populations, germination was 84–90% over a wide range of light/dark periods (10–24 h light), but considerable reduction (up to 42%) occurred under continuous darkness. The osmotic potential required for 50% inhibition of germination was −0.54 and −0.40 MPa for Azerbaijan and Kermanshah populations respectively. The NaCl concentration of 8.83 and 5.71 dS m⁻¹ caused 50% inhibition of germination in Azerbaijan and Kermanshah populations respectively. The X₅₀ parameter (the burial depth at which emergence is reduced by 50%) for Azerbaijan and Kermanshah population was 2.18 and 2.86 cm respectively. Crop residues had more inhibitory effects on the Azerbaijan than Kermanshah population. Adaptive differentiation of C. platycarpos populations has also resulted in smaller seeds of the Azerbaijan compared with the Kermanshah population and resulted in higher emergence for Kermanshah population seedlings from greater soil depths. These results suggest that differences in germination requirements, drought and salinity tolerance of C. platycarpos populations are correlated with environmental conditions of the habitats of the studied populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaucalis 3acrop residues 3adrought 3adryland farming 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3airrigation 3anight temperature 3aosmotic pressure 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asodium chloride 3asoil depth 3aweeds 3aAzerbaijan 3aIran1 aGholami, F1 aGhanepour, S0 tWeed research.g2017 Aug., v. 57, no. 4 p.247-256dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44597x0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.122593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010100167520163200268592002801900650002401928650001601952650002701968650002801995650001302023650001702036650001302053650003502066650002402101650002402125650001202149650001402161650001102175650001302186650002202199650002902221650001302250650001402263650002902277653001302306653001002319653002202329653001702351653001802368653001602386700002002402700005902422773012502481856008302606852000902689655001202698IND60776547020221118214406.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077654702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2022.1037842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInui, Tomohiro10aMicroRNA let-7 is required for hormonal regulation of metamorphosis in the silkworm, Bombyx mori  aThe heterochronic microRNA let-7, which was first identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, controls the timing of developmental programs, and let-7 triggers the onset of the juvenile-adult transition in bilaterians. The expression of let-7 is strongly induced during the last larval stage of C. elegans and is highly expressed in the late last instar larvae/nymphs of the fly Drosophila melanogaster and the cockroach Blattella germanica. In the silkworm Bombyx mori, the expression of let-7 remarkably increases in the corpus cardiacum-corpus allatum complex (CC-CA) at the beginning of the last larval instar and is maintained at high levels during this instar. To determine the biological function of let-7 in B. mori, we generated a let-7 knockout line and a transgenic UAS-let-7 line. The let-7 knockout larvae were developmentally arrested in the prepupal stage and became pupal-adult intermediates after apolysis. When let-7 was ubiquitously overexpressed under the transcriptional control of an Actin3-GAL4 driver, developmental timing and growth of larvae were severely impaired in the penultimate (L4) instar, and these larvae underwent precocious metamorphosis from L4. Furthermore, our results showed that reception and signaling of ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones (JHs) normally occurred in the absence of let-7, whereas the biosynthesis of ecdysone and JHs were affected by disruption and overexpression of let-7. Together, the present study demonstrates that let-7 is required for the coordination of the biosynthesis of ecdysone and JH to ensure the developmental transition during the metamorphosis of B. mori.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlattella germanica 3aBombyx mori 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aapolysis 3abiosynthesis 3aecdysone 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahormonal regulation 3ainsect biochemistry 3ainstars 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amicroRNA 3amolecular biology 3aprecocious metamorphosis 3aprepupae 3asilkworms 3atranscription (genetics) 0aMicroRNA 0alet-7 0aJuvenile hormones 0aEcdysteroids 0aMetamorphosis 0aBombyx mori1 aSezutsu, Hideki1 aDaimon, Takaaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8382-11320 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2022 June, v. 145 p.103784-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2022.1037843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245007900176300001800255520195600273536029702229592002802526596012902554650001502683650001502698650001402713650001202727650001302739650001302752650001102765653001802776653002502794653002202819653002002841700006102861773012502922856008203047852000903129655001203138IND60785837520221118024207.0220728e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078583752DNAL7 a10.1177/004051752110238122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkinmolayan, Oluwafemi P10aAcoustic characterization of silica nanoparticle-impregnated Kevlar fabric  ap. 2830-2848.  aSilica nanoparticle-impregnated Kevlar (SNK) fabric has better specific ballistic performance in comparison to its neat counterparts. For multifunctional structural applications using lightweight composites, combining this improved ballistic functionality with an acoustic functionality is desirable. In this study, acoustic characterization of neat and SNK samples is conducted using the normal-incidence impedance tube method. Both the absorption coefficient and transmission loss (TL) are measured in the 60–6000 Hz frequency range. The influence of parameters such as number of layers of neat or treated fabric, percentage by weight of nanoparticle addition, spacing between fabric layers, and residual porosity is examined. It is found that while absorption decreases with an increase in nanoparticle addition for frequencies above about 2500 Hz, increasing the number of layers shifts peak absorption to lower frequencies. By introducing an air-gap behind the fabric layer, dominant low-frequency (1000–3000 Hz) absorption peaks are obtained that correlate well with natural modes of mass-equivalent thin plates. Examining the influence of residual porosity by laminating the SNK samples reveals that it contributes to about 30–50% of the total absorption. Above about 1500 Hz, 3–5 dB of TL increase is obtained for SNK samples vis-à-vis the neat samples. TL is found to increase beyond that of the neat sample above a threshold frequency when an air-gap is introduced between two SNK layers. With an increase in the weight of nanoparticle addition, measured TL tends to be closer to mass law predictions. This study demonstrates that SNK fabric could provide improved acoustic performance in addition to its ballistic capabilities, making it suitable for multifunctional applications and could form the basis for the development of simplified models to predict the structural acoustic response of such nanoparticle–fabric composites.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology (OCAST) (grant No. AR-18-078) and Cowboy Technologies LLC.  aPublisher supplied data  aAR-18-078cOklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100008569 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aacoustics 3afabrics 3aporosity 3aresearch 3asilica 0aKevlar fabric 0asilica nanoparticles 0atransmission loss 0amultifunctional1 aManimala, James M1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8047-30830 tTextile research journal.g2022 Aug., v. 92, no. 15-16 p.2830-2848dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/004051752110238123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010700168500001900275520126900294592002801563650002701591650002601618650002101644650001701665650001301682650002101695650002201716650002301738650003101761650001001792650001801802650002101820650001401841650001401855650002101869650002001890650002001910650001401930650002301944653001601967653002001983653001702003653001102020700001702031700001802048700001402066700001702080773012002097856008202217852000902299655001202308IND60724287820221119024239.0210519e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072428782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1007902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuangyan10aTranscriptome analysis of gender-biased CYP genes in gonads of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGender differences in physiological characteristics are widespread in animals. Herein, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in gonads of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus were analysed by transcriptomics, and the results showed that 19,973 genes were commonly expressed in the males and females, 4186 were female-biased, and 2540 were male-biased, 4695 genes were up-regulated in the females and 3436 genes were up-regulated in the males. These DEGs were mainly associated with metabolism, including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, energy metabolism, and cofactor and vitamin metabolism. 29 Cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily genes with gender differential expression were selected, and performed gene identification, phylogenetic, and functional analyses. The results indicated significant roles in multiple metabolic pathways, such as steroid hormone biosynthesis, ovarian steroidogenesis, cortisol synthesis and secretion, arachidonic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and retinol metabolism. The findings provide insight into the molecular characteristics of physiological gender differences in sea cucumbers, and will help lay the foundation for the establishment of effective sea cucumber breeding technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aamino acid metabolism 3aarachidonic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acortisol 3acytochrome P-450 3aenergy metabolism 3agender differences 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alinoleic acid 3alipid metabolism 3aphylogeny 3asecretion 3asteroid hormones 3asteroidogenesis 3atranscriptomics 3avitamin A 3avitamin metabolism 0aGender-bias 0aCYP superfamily 0aSea cucumber 0aGonads1 aZhang, Libin1 aRu, Xiaoshang1 aDing, Kui1 aFeng, Qiming0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 June, v. 38 p.100790-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1007903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245013200180500002200312520163900334592002801973650001502001650002302016650001502039650002402054650002102078650002302099651001102122653001402133653001702147653002602164653001102190653001902201653001702220700002402237700002402261700002002285700002202305700001802327700002202345700002002367773010502387856005102492852000902543655001202552IND60795311520221122034442.0221004e20220924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079531152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2022.1097502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira-Dalland, Luis G.10aConservation gaps for Neotropical vipers: Mismatches between protected areas, species richness and evolutionary distinctiveness  aPre-press version  aThe continuous decline in biodiversity despite global efforts to create new protected areas calls into question the effectiveness of these areas in conserving biodiversity. Numerous habitats are absent from the global protected area network, and certain taxonomic groups are not being included in conservation planning. Here, we analyzed the level of protection that the current protected area system provides to viper species in the Neotropical region through a conservation gap analysis. We used distribution size and degree of threat to set species-specific conservation goals for 123 viper species in the form of minimum percentage of their distribution that should be covered by protected areas, and assess the level of protection provided for each species by overlapping their distribution with protected areas of strict protection. Furthermore, using species richness and evolutionary distinctiveness as priority indicators, we conducted a spatial association analysis to detect areas of special concern. We found that most viper species have <1/4 of their distribution covered by protected areas, including 22 threatened species. Also, the large majority of cells containing high levels of species richness were significantly absent from protected areas, while evolutionary distinctiveness was particularly unprotected in regions with relatively low species richness, like northern Mexico and the Argentinian dry Chaco. Our results provide further evidence that vipers are largely being excluded from conservation planning, leaving them exposed to serious threats that can lead to population decline and ultimately extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aconservation areas 3aextinction 3apopulation dynamics 3aspecies richness 3athreatened species 3aMexico 0aViperidae 0aGap analysis 0aConservation planning 0aSnakes 0aPrioritization 0aBiodiversity1 aAlencar, Laura R.V.1 aTambosi, Leandro R.1 aCarrasco, Paola1 aRautsaw, Rhett M.1 aSigala, Jesus1 aScrocchi, Gustavo1 aMartins, Marcio0 tBiological conservation.g2022 Sept. 24,  p.109750-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109750  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245017000166300001600336520210500352592002802457650002502485650001902510650002402529650002402553650001802577650001102595650001702606650002602623650000902649650002002658653001902678653003902697653002602736653002902762653001802791653002402809653002202833653002002855700001502875700002202890700001902912700001502931773013302946856008603079852000903165655001203174IND60776547320221118213705.0220509e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077654732DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(21)60016-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yi,10aProtein sequence databases generated from metagenomics and public databases produced similar soil metaproteomic results of microbial taxonomic and functional changes  ap. 507-520.  aSoil metaproteomics has excellent potential as a tool to elucidate the structural and functional changes in soil microbial communities in response to environmental alterations. However, soil metaproteomics is hindered by several challenges and gaps. Soil microbial communities possess extremely complex microbial composition, including many uncultured microorganisms without whole genome sequencing. Thus, how to select a suitable protein sequence database remains challenging in soil metaproteomics. In this study, the Public database and Meta-database were constructed using protein sequences from public databases and metagenomics, respectively. We comprehensively analyzed and compared the soil metaproteomic results using these two kinds of protein sequence databases for protein identification based on published soil metaproteomic raw data. The results demonstrated that many more proteins, higher sequence coverage, and even more microbial species and functional annotations could be identified using the Meta-database compared with those identified using the Public database. These findings indicated that the Meta-database was more specific as a protein sequence database. However, the follow-up in-depth metaproteomic analyses exhibited similar main results regardless of the database used. The microbial community composition at the genus level was similar between the two databases, especially the species annotations with high peptide-spectrum match and high abundance. The functional analyses in response to stress, such as the gene ontology enrichment of biological progress and molecular function and the key functional microorganisms, were also similar regardless of the database. Our analysis revealed that the Public database could also meet the demand to explore the functional responses of microbial proteins to some extent. This study provides valuable insights into the choice of protein sequence databases and their impacts on subsequent bioinformatic analysis in soil metaproteomic research and will facilitate the optimization of experimental design for different purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3abioinformatics 3acommunity structure 3aexperimental design 3agene ontology 3agenome 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3asoil 3astress response 0abioinformatics 0adifferentially accumulated protein 0afunctional annotation 0afunctional microorganism 0aMeta-database 0amicrobial community 0amicrobial species 0aPublic database1 aZheng, Lu,1 aMeng, Xiangxiang,1 aSHEN, Ren Fang1 aLan, Ping,0 tPedosphere.g2022 Aug., v. 32, no. 4 p.507-520dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(21)60016-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245010500152300001800257500001100275520242000286592002802706650001502734650001002749650002902759650002202788650002602810650001702836650002502853650002302878650001502901650002602916650002702942650000902969650001502978650004302993650001103036650001203047650001903059700002003078700002203098700002103120773011903141856007303260852000903333655001203342IND60587363620221120170000.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058736362DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.129562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Fen10aPolyunsaturated fatty acids in stream food webs – high dissimilarity among producers and consumers  ap. 1325-1334.  aREVIEW  aStreams and rivers provide crucial sources of long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC‐PUFA, a subset of PUFA with ≥20 C in their acyl chains) for freshwater and terrestrial animals. LC‐PUFA are primarily produced by particular algal taxa and are subsequently transferred to fish and higher consumers, including humans. Although research on the trophic transfer of LC‐PUFA in streams is very limited, studies on the PUFA composition of organisms at various trophic levels within stream food webs are well documented. Here, we systematically analyze the literature to synthesise LC‐PUFA distribution and retention in stream ecosystems. In general, stream food webs are highly enriched in omega‐3 LC‐PUFA, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n‐3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n‐3). Algae from temperate rivers had more EPA compared with algae from subtropical rivers. Stream invertebrates from both temperate and subtropical rivers preferentially retain algal EPA and their PUFA tend to vary with algal PUFA. Invertebrates may be capable of regulating their fatty acid (FA) composition, but this ability is limited, to the extent that they must obtain physiologically important LC‐PUFA primarily from algae. DHA is selectively and highly retained in all fish taxa irrespective of their feeding sites (i.e. temperate or subtropical rivers). However, DHA content is variable among stream fish taxa and is likely linked to resource utilisation and their endogenous metabolism. Freshwater salmonids have a very high DHA content, which suggests they preferentially retain this FA or biosynthesise it from EPA. The PUFA profiles of other fish taxa more closely reflect their dietary PUFA supply. However, so far very few studies have considered the differences in the PUFA biosynthesis of fish taxa in rivers or compared the dietary PUFA effect on different fish taxa. The supply of LC‐PUFA from streams and rivers is known to be affected by altered light availability, greater nutrient inputs and other anthropogenic activities, and any decrease in algal LC‐PUFA production will negatively affect the consumers that are nutritionally dependent on these molecules. Further investigations are needed to understand how environmental changes affect LC‐PUFA production and retention in stream ecosystems, and how to protect streams from threats to this essential ecosystem service.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3aalgae 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic food webs 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abiosynthesis 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afish 3afreshwater 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3arivers 3astreams 3atrophic levels1 aBunn, Stuart E.1 aBrett, Michael T.1 aKainz, Martin J.0 tFreshwater biology.g2017 Aug., v. 62, no. 8 p.1325-1334dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.129563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100007000138245013700208300001800345500002000363520190800383592002802291596005602319650001602375650001702391650002002408650001102428650002202439650001702461650001102478650000902489650001502498651001202513700006202525700006202587700002302649700002102672700005702693700001702750700006302767700002302830700006002853773012202913856007203035852000903107655001203116IND60747831520221120144655.0210820e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074783152DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.36012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntognazza, Caterina Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5344-824510aEnvironmental DNA reveals the temporal and spatial extent of spawning migrations of European shad in a highly fragmented river basin  ap. 2029-2040.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArtificial barriers on lowland rivers impede the spawning migrations of anadromous fishes, preventing access to historical spawning areas. In the cryptic European shads Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax (‘shad’ hereafter), this has resulted in population declines across their range. Conservation programmes aim to facilitate the passage of migrators over these barriers and so require baseline information on the spatial and temporal extent of current migrations. Here, a shad‐specific environmental DNA (eDNA) assay was used to quantify the spatial extent of shad spawning migrations in the River Severn basin, western England. This basin is characterized by the presence of multiple barriers in the lower catchment. In 2017, the eDNA assay was piloted in the River Teme, an important shad spawning tributary, and then applied in 2018 and 2019 across the lower Severn basin. In all years, shad DNA was detected between mid‐May and mid‐June, with the maximum spatial extent of shad distribution being in early June when shad eDNA was detected upstream of weirs that were generally considered as impassable. In 2018, this included the detection of shad above the most upstream weir on the main River Severn that required individual fish to have passed six weirs. Although barriers inhibit the spawning migrations of shad, this eDNA assay showed that some highly vagile individuals might be able to ascend these barriers and migrate considerable distances upstream. This suggests that efforts to increase the permeability of these barriers could result in relatively high numbers of migrating shad reaching upstream spawning areas. These results demonstrate that this eDNA assay could also be used across their range, to further quantify the spatial extent of their spawning, including in highly fragmented rivers and those where shad are believed to spawn only occasionally and are rarely observed.  aPublisher supplied data  aLIFE15/NAT/UK/000219cUnlocking the Severn for LIFE 3aAlosa alosa 3aAlosa fallax 3aanadromous fish 3abasins 3aenvironmental DNA 3apermeability 3arivers 3ashad 3awatersheds 3aEngland1 aBritton, J.

Nanocomposite samples with different gold content have been synthesized and studied with respect to their structure, size and shape of nanocrystals, thermal behavior, surface characteristics and optical properties, as well as their photocatalytic activity. We have found that modification of nanocrystalline ZnO with gold nanocrystals strongly influences the porosity of nanocomposites - less micro- and mesopores are formed, which results in a reduced specific surface area. The synthesized ZnO and Au/ZnO nanocrystals are active photocatalysts for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB), as a model pollutant dye, in the UV region. There is a decrease in photocatalytic activity with an increase of the gold content in the nanocomposite photocatalyst.

Since there is always inherent uncertainty concerning the magnitude of risk/benefit factors their contribution is better represented by a probable range than a single numerical value. With the Expanded Fermi Solution method, random values of the factors are generated within their respective ranges and used to calculate the combined risk or benefit based on the chosen mathematical model. In the case of additive or multiplicative independent factors, the combined risks/benefits so calculated have approximately normal or lognormal distribution, respectively, as anticipated from the Central Limit Theorem. The distribution's mode, i.e., the most frequent value, is considered the risk's best estimate. In interactive factors, the emergence of a specific parametric distribution is not guaranteed, but the histogram of the randomly generated combined risks or benefits can be used to identify the best estimate. This is demonstrated with three abstract interactive risk/benefit models of increasing number of parameters and complexity, whose calculation has been automated and posted on the Internet as freely downloadable interactive Wolfram Demonstration. Also given is a hypothetical but realistic example of dose–response based microbial risk assessment where uncertain bacterial growth parameters are involved, which can be implemented with a new Wolfram Demonstration.

Thus, measuring the response of species to multiple disturbances is a key issue for conservation and environmental management. As it is not practical to assess the response of every species in a community, we compared the performance of trait and taxonomic‐based groupings of species for their abilities to predict species loss in a threatened freshwater fish assemblage. Specifically, we examined responses of a Fijian freshwater fish assemblage to deforestation, placement of anthropogenic barriers (overhanging culverts) and the presence of introduced cichlids. Species grouped by traits showed more consistent responses to disturbances than taxonomic groups. In particular, species belonging to trait groups that were estuary associated favoured medium‐to‐hard substrate, while feeding specialists were highly likely to be absent in catchments with high deforestation and overhanging culverts. The presence of introduced cichlids (Oreochromis mossambicus and O. niloticus) had a smaller effect than deforestation and barriers, but was negatively associated with species richness of diadromous species with climbing ability and positively associated with presences of some piscivores. The trait groups also revealed that detritivores, species favouring soft substrate, and those with a broad dietary range were less sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances. Our study indicates that using traits to predict species loss from disturbed environments can aid in detecting the responses of rare species to disturbance. In addition, we provided a method to estimate the consistency of species’ responses to disturbance. This study may ultimately help managers identify the most effective actions for conserving sensitive species that are seldom recorded in surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3aanthropogenic activities 3aculverts 3adeforestation 3adetritivores 3adiadromous fish 3aenvironmental management 3aestuaries 3afreshwater ecosystems 3afreshwater fish 3amanagers 3apiscivores 3arare species 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aFiji1 aJupiter, Stacy D.1 aJenkins, Aaron P.1 aBrown, Christopher J.0 tFreshwater biology.g2017 Aug., v. 62, no. 8 p.1422-1432dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.129553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006700152245017800219500001400397520149200411592002801903650001501931650001401946650001101960650002301971650002201994650002702016650002302043650001302066650001102079650002902090650002102119650001202140650001102152650002402163650001902187650001802206653004102224653002502265653002902290653002202319653005702341653002302398700002802421700006902449700005702518700002602575700002102601773011602622856008702738852000902825655001202834IND60695384120221123045356.0200607e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069538412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1129172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiptoo, Mark Kipngetich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1590-924710aIntegrated approach for optimal techno-economic planning for high renewable energy-based isolated microgrid considering cost of energy storage and demand response strategies  aNAL-light  aTo realize an efficient energy supply system for an isolated microgrid, a joint design framework that considered the capacity sizing alongside operational planning is essential. In this work, an integrated planning model was developed to investigate the techno-economic performances of a high renewable energy-based standalone microgrid. The approach combines capacity sizing and operation scheduling, considering demand-side management strategies for different system design scenarios. The evaluated scenarios involved the combination of wind turbine, photovoltaic system, diesel generator, with either battery energy storage or pumped thermal energy storage. A demand response program based on instantaneous renewable energy availability is proposed with dynamic pricing economic model for improving the overall system flexibility. Mixed-integer linear programming algorithm on MATLAB® is deployed as the optimization solver. The minimization of the sum of system costs which includes equivalent annual costs of the investments, running costs and costs based on demand-side management strategies is the objective function. The combination of photovoltaic, wind turbine and pumped thermal energy storage is found to be the most techno-economically efficient system configuration for the considered microgrid. More so, the proposed demand response strategy minimizes the mismatch between the generation and the load demand profile effectively, thereby increasing the system flexibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3adesign 3aeconometric models 3aenergy conversion 3agenerators (equipment) 3alinear programming 3aplanning 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3astorage 3asupply 3asystems engineering 3athermal energy 3awind turbines 0aPumped thermal energy storage (PTES) 0aDemand Response (DR) 0aPhotovoltaic (PV) system 0aWind turbine (WT) 0aRenewable generation-based dynamic pricing (RGDP) DR 0aSystem reliability1 aLotfy, Mohammed Elsayed1 aAdewuyi, Oludamilare Bode1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3946-12641 aConteh, Abdul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8463-573X1 aHowlader, Abdul Motin1 aSenjyu, Tomonobu0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 July 01, v. 215 p.112917-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1129173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012600166300001600292520176700308592002802075650003502103650001202138650001302150650003102163650001402194650000902208653002402217653000602241653003302247653002602280653001302306653002302319653002402342700001902366700001402385700001402399700001702413700001802430700001802448700001602466700001802482700002302500700002102523773013302544856008602677852000902763655001202772IND60776547620221118214027.0220509e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077654762DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(21)60048-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYIN, Chang10aInhibition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria promotes the growth of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in ammonium-rich alkaline soils  ap. 532-542.  aDisparities in the substrate affinity and tolerance threshold for ammonia have been believed to play a key role in driving niche differentiation between ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB); however, recent surveys argue that direct competition between AOA and AOB is also important in this phenomenon. Accordingly, it is reasonable to predict that diverse AOA lineages would grow in ammonium (NH₄⁺)-rich alkaline arable soils if AOB growth is suppressed. To test this hypothesis, a microcosm study was established using three different types of alkaline arable soils, in which a high NH₄⁺ concentration (200 μg N g⁻¹ dry soil) was maintained by routinely replenishing urea and the activities of AOB were selectively inhibited by 1-octyne or 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Compared with amendment with urea alone, 1-octyne partially retarded AOB growth, while DMPP completely inhibited AOB. Both inhibitors accelerated the growth of AOA, with significantly higher ratios of abundance of AOA to AOB observed with DMPP amendment across soils. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) indicated that different treatments significantly altered the community structures of both AOA and AOB and AOA OTUs enriched by high-NH₄⁺ amendment were taxonomically constrained across the soils tested and closely related to Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76 and N. garnensis. Given that these representative strains have been demonstrated to be sensitive to high ammonia concentrations, our results suggest that it is the competitiveness for ammonia, rather than disparities in substrate affinity and tolerance threshold for ammonia, that drives niche differentiation between these phylotypes and AOB in NH₄⁺-rich alkaline soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate 3aammonia 3aammonium 3aecological differentiation 3aphylotype 3aurea 0acommunity structure 0a3 0a4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate 0aniche differentiation 0a1-octyne 0asubstrate affinity 0atolerance threshold1 aFan, Xiaoping,1 aCHEN, Hao1 aYE, Mujun1 aYAN, Guochao1 aLI, Tingqiang1 aPENG, Hongyun1 aE, Shengzhe1 aCHE, Zongxian1 aWAKELIN, Steven A.1 aLiang, Yongchao,0 tPedosphere.g2022 Aug., v. 32, no. 4 p.532-542dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(21)60048-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012300168520160200291592002801893650002001921650002001941650001201961650002001973650002701993650001102020650001002031650001602041650002202057653002502079653002102104653001402125653002702139700002302166700001802189700002202207700002402229700002302253700002302276700002302299773012102322856005102443852000902494655001202503IND60795311820221122034516.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079531182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2022.1097542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasale, Paolo10aNew methods to derive sea turtle nester abundance from nest counts: Ground truthing and the bias of current approaches  aAbundance is a key parameter for characterizing animal populations of conservation concern. In sea turtles, annual clutch counts represent the most common population index. When the number of annual nesting females (ANF) is sought, clutch frequency (CF; average number of clutches laid per female) is used as a conversion factor. Here we assess the performance of five current methods for estimating ANF and of two new methods based on the interdependence of nesting activity parameters, investigated through a Monte Carlo approach with generalized additive models. All methods were evaluated on virtual populations and on a unique case of empirical data from a sea turtle population with a known ANF based on genetic identification of clutches (Caretta caretta, Northern Recovery Unit, USA). Results show that current methods produce errors often greater than the simple count of nesting females directly encountered, except for a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) model. One of the new methods takes advantage of both nest count and CMR data and shows the best performance at a wide range of detection probabilities. The second new method is based on nest count data only and can provide at least an approximate estimate of ANF where no CMR data are available. Our findings can dramatically improve sea turtle population abundance estimates worldwide. We recommend abandoning the use of any CF estimate as a direct conversion factor in favor of implementing the CMR model and the new methods to improve current estimates and to provide estimates where limited data have prevented doing so previously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3adetection limit 3afemales 3agenetic testing 3amark-recapture studies 3amodels 3anests 3asea turtles 3aspecies abundance 0aPopulation abundance 0aClutch frequency 0aDetection 0aAnnual nesting females1 aCeriani, Simona A.1 aDodd, Mark G.1 aPate, S.

Polyamide (PA) thin-film composite (TFC) membranes on polymer supports have been widely used in OSN, but the development of solvent resist supports is still a big challenge. Inorganic supports have good solvent resistance, but their applications were hindered by their high price and low solvent permeability. How to enhance the membrane permeability while maintain a high solute rejection is another challenge. Here we report the use of an inexpensive inorganic support made of large alpha-alumina particles. The surface was smoothed by multilayer coatings first with smaller alpha-alumina particles followed by carbon nanotubes. The hierarchical inorganic support is 20 times more permeable than conventional polymer supports. A standard interfacial polymerization process was then used to make a PA TFC membrane on the inorganic supports. As the surface roughness and average pore size decreased with multilayer coatings, the PA layer showed increased size of the “leaf-like” surface structure and thus increased surface area for transport due to the superhydrophilicity of the inorganic support and the ultrafine porous structure of the carbon nanotube layer. The enlarged surface area combined with the highly permeable inorganic support resulted a significant improvement in membrane flux. A high ethanol permeance of 10.6 ± 0.3 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ and a high rhodamine B rejection of 99.8% ± 0.2% were achieved. The membrane permeance is approximately 4–13 times higher than that of conventional PA TFC membranes fabricated on polymer supports. Our results indicate that the potential benefits of inorganic supports are not limited to their good solvent resistance, strong mechanical strength, and high thermal and chemical stabilities and thus desires more attention in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3aethanol 3ahydrophilicity 3amembrane permeability 3ananofiltration 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3aprices 3arhodamines 3asolutes 3asolvents 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurface area 3asurface roughness 3athin film composite membranes 0aInorganic support 0aPolyamide 0aThin-film composite 0aInterfacial polymerization 0aOrganic solvent nanofiltration1 aLu, Dongwei1 aLi, Xiang1 aRehman, Lubna M.1 aRoy, Anirban1 aLai, Zhiping0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 601 p.117932-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1179323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245015000182520166000332592002801992650001302020650001202033650001602045650001402061650000902075650001202084650001102096650001402107650001402121650002102135650002002156653001802176653001402194653002002208653001902228653001302247700003802260700003602298700002502334700006502359700003502424700003502459700003302494700004102527700003102568700003602599773010102635856008502736852000902821655001202830IND60724288520221119022438.0220606e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072428852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1044022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraújo, Cleyton de Almeida10aEffect of reduced of water supply on carcass characteristics, non-carcass components and the volume of digestive compartments of Santa Inês ewes  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reducing water supply for watering of Santa Inês ewes on carcass characteristics, non-carcass components and the volume of digestive compartments. Thirty-two crossbred Santa Inês ewes, with an average body weight of 32.2 ± 7.4 kg, were distributed in a randomized block design with four treatments (different supply levels - 100% (ad libitum), 80%, 60% and 40% ad libitum water intake treatment) and eight repetitions. The animals were confined for 63 days until slaughter. The decrease in water availability promoted a linear decreasing effect for the internal carcass length (P = 0.032). A quadratic effect was found for the volume of the omasum (P = 0.018) and abomasum (P = 0.039), with maximum volumes of 0.305 and 1.636 liters, respectively, for 40% supply. The reticulum yield showed a quadratic effect (P = 0.044) with a maximum point in the supply of 100%, with 0.527%. The reduction in water supply promoted a quadratic effect for the weight (P = 0.016) and yield (P = 0.030) of the bladder, with maximum yields found in the supply of 60%, with 0.067 kg and 0.233%, respectively. There was a quadratic effect for weight (P = 0.042) and yield (P = 0.029) of the diaphragm with higher values found in the supply of 60%m with 0.272 kg and 0.927%, respectively. There was a quadratic effect for kidney yield (P = 0.022) with higher yield for 100% supply. Therefore, the reduction in water supply levels by up to 40% in relation to voluntary intake can be a strategy to be used in cases of water scarcity, as it does not cause negative effects on the Santa Inês ewe carcass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabomasum 3abladder 3abody weight 3adiaphragm 3aewes 3akidneys 3aomasum 3areticulum 3aslaughter 3avoluntary intake 3awater shortages 0aCarcass yield 0aSemi-arid 0aSmall ruminants 0aWater scarcity 0aWatering1 aMagalhães, André Luiz Rodrigues1 ade Araújo, Gherman Garcia Leal1 aCampos, Fleming Sena1 aGois, Glayciane Costa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4624-18251 ade Matos, Maria Helena Tavares1 aQueiroz, Mário Adriano Ávila1 aMenezes, Vanúzia Gonçalves1 aCosta, Claudenilde de Jesus Pinheiro1 ados Santos, Kelly Cristina1 aLeite, Ana Clara Silva Pinheiro0 tLivestock science.g2021 Mar., v. 245 p.104402-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1044023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245016000201520118200361592002801543596005101571650002501622650001201647650001001659650001101669650001401680650001701694650002301711650001101734650002201745650001601767650001301783650001201796650001601808650001601824650001801840700001701858700002001875700002001895700002101915773009601936856007602032852000902108655001202117IND60624018120221121232440.0181203e20180318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062401812DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/72939322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLech, Krzysztof1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6540-527414aThe Effect of Selected Fruit Juice Concentrates Used as Osmotic Agents on the Drying Kinetics and Chemical Properties of Vacuum-Microwave Drying of Pumpkin  aThe study examined the osmotic dehydration of pumpkin slices in chokeberry, flowering quince, and raspberry concentrated juices. Products obtained were subjected to vacuum-microwave finish drying (VMD). The objective of the study was to evaluate the drying kinetics and the chemical properties, that is, total polyphenolics content and antioxidant capacity of the vacuum-microwave-dried pumpkin products. The concentration and temperature of the juices were 40°Brix and 45°C, respectively. The pumpkin slices were pretreated in concentrated juices for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours. Vacuum-microwave finish drying was carried out at the power of magnetrons that ensured the maintenance of the safe temperature (below 90°C) of the slices measured with the use of infrared camera. The results of the study showed that the moisture content of samples during the pretreatment in concentrated juices was decreasing until the equilibrium stage. The logarithmic model was used to describe the drying kinetics of pumpkin during VMD. Osmotic pretreatment resulted in a decrease in colour coordinates, improved the antioxidant activity of dried product, and prolonged the duration of VMD.  aPublisher supplied data  aUMO-2014/15/D/NZ9/0524cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3aantioxidant activity 3acameras 3acolor 3adrying 3aflowering 3afruit juices 3ajuice concentrates 3amodels 3aosmotic treatment 3apolyphenols 3apumpkins 3aquinces 3araspberries 3atemperature 3awater content1 aFigiel, Adam1 aMichalska, Anna1 aWojdyło, Aneta1 aNowicka, Paulina0 tJournal of food quality.g2018 Mar. 18, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/72939323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245012300168300001300291520133600304592002801640650002901668650002901697650001801726650002201744650001001766650001401776650001501790650001601805650001301821700002101834700002401855773010401879856008201983852000902065655001202074IND4455961220221119111451.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445596122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2010.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGbaye, Olajire A.10aLegume type and temperature effects on the toxicity of insecticide to the genus Callosobruchus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae)  ap. 8-12.  aThree bruchid pest species, Callosobruchus maculatus, Callosobruchus chinensis and Callosobruchus rhodesianus, were studied for their response to insecticide toxicity taking into account the separate and interactive effects of temperature and pre-adult food. The food types used were cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and mungbean (Vigna radiata). Callosobruchus maculatus was the most tolerant to malathion and the least affected by temperature change while C. rhodesianus was the least tolerant. Over a 4 °C range (23°, 25°, 27 °C), there was generally a significant impact of temperature on the tolerance of the three species to the insecticide. The food type on which the insects developed influenced considerably the degree of insecticide tolerance. Callosobruchus maculatus and C. chinensis populations reared on mungbean had higher tolerance to malathion than their counterparts reared on cowpea, but the opposite was observed in C. rhodesianus populations. The food influence in this study suggested an ancestral cause or fitness cost depending on the species. The interaction of food-by-temperature had no significant effect on malathion toxicity to this genus. Correlation analysis showed C. chinensis to be relatively less sensitive to insecticide concentration over the range studied compared with the other two species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallosobruchus chinensis 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aVigna radiata 3aVigna unguiculata 3afoods 3amalathion 3amung beans 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aMillard, John C.1 aHolloway, Graham J.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2011 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.8-12dElsevier Ltdx0022-474X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2010.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245012500199300001800324520140600342536027301748592002802021596008902049650001002138650001402148650001202162650001602174650001302190650002302203653001902226653003302245653002902278653003102307700001402338700001502352700005302367700001702420773012502437856008102562852000902643655001202652IND60785838120221118024211.0220728e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078583812DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175219897882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1344-611110aSpectrophotometric color matching for pre-colored fiber blends based on a hybrid of least squares and grid search method  ap. 2569-2579.  aComputer color matching can improve production efficiency and reduce costs in color spun. However, in practice the computer color matching success rate for pre-colored fiber blends has not been good, leading to customers being unsatisfied with the accuracy of the color matching results. Aiming to improve the accuracy, a hybrid of least squares and grid search method has been proposed for spectrophotometric color matching of pre-colored fiber blend based on the improved Kubelka–Munk (K-M) double-constant theory. Two-primary, three-primary, four-primary, and five-primary pre-colored cotton fiber blends were prepared as standard samples to evaluate the color matching accuracy of the proposed method. Compared with the least squares method and the grid search method, the proposed method achieved better color matching effects and greatly shortened the calculation time, respectively. For 42 pre-colored fiber blends, the average color difference between the predicted results obtained by the proposed method, least squares method, and grid search method and the spectrophotometer measurements were respectively 0.29, 0.53, and 0.36 CIE2000 units. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method could predict the formulation of standard samples quickly and effectively, and that it was superior to other methods in providing satisfactory color matching results for the enterprises.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Provence (Grant No. KYCX17_1451).  aPublisher supplied data  aKYCX17_1451cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Provence 3acolor 3acomputers 3afabrics 3alint cotton 3aresearch 3aspectrophotometers 0aColor matching 0aspectrophotometric algorithm 0apre-colored fiber blends 0aK-M double-constant theory1 aPan, Ruru1 aZhou, Jian1 aWang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7700-45311 aGao, Weidong0 tTextile research journal.g2022 Aug., v. 92, no. 15-16 p.2569-2579dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175219897883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01189naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245006500162300001800227520029600245592002800541650002300569650002300592650001500615650001300630700002000643700001900663773013400682856007400816852000900890655001200899IND60617463620221118100034.0181025e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061746362DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc00360b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbott, Andrew P.10aRedox fusion of metal particles using deep eutectic solvents  ap. 3049-3052.  aAlternating anodic and cathodic current pulses have been applied to a metal powder on an electrode surface to fuse the particles together.

Human impact and the ongoing climate change are however reducing the ability of wetlands to provide such important services. Through field surveys, GIS analyses and climate projections, we assessed the status of, and threats to, 38 largest wetlands belonging to the Mediterranean bird flyways in Sardinia and Sicily (Italy). We then combined ten decision criteria about avifaunal diversity and human/climate threats in order to prioritize the studied wetlands from most to least worthy of urgent interventions. Results showed that the main wetlands of these two regions have distinct demands with regard to the kind of actions required, going from the mitigation of tourism pressure to the prevention of climate-induced water shortage in summer. Furthermore, clear priorities for interventions emerged in both regions. Our study has direct implications for managers and researchers attempting to assess wetland conditions and set conservation priorities, thus offering a tool for deciding urgent interventions on the main stopover sites along the Mediterranean bird flyways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3amigratory behavior 3aprioritization 3asummer 3atourism 3awater birds 3awater shortages 3awetlands 3aItaly 3aSardinia 3aSicily 0aAvifauna 0aClimate change 0aHuman impact 0aSea level rise 0aStopover sites 0aWater shortage1 aCelada, Claudio1 aGustin, Marco0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 10, v. 751 p.141556-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1415563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245009200179300001800271520201600289592002802305650002202333650001502355650000902370650001102379650001102390650002502401650001302426700002102439773009702460856009002557990002302647852000902670655001202679IND60095838020221119043905.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009583802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorth, Nicholas A.10aModal dynamics of self-excited azimuthal instabilities in an annular combustion chamber  ap. 2476-2489.  aIn this paper we describe the time-varying amplitude and its relation to the global heat release rate of self-excited azimuthal instabilities in a simple annular combustor operating under atmospheric conditions. The combustor was modular in construction consisting of either 12, 15 or 18 equally spaced premixed bluff-body flames around a fixed circumference, enabling the effect of large-scale interactions between adjacent flames to be investigated. High-speed OH∗ chemiluminescence imaged from above the annulus and pressure measurements obtained at multiple locations around the annulus revealed that the limit cycles of the modes are degenerate in so much as they undergo continuous transitions between standing and spinning modes in both clockwise (CW) and anti-clockwise (ACW) directions but with the same resonant frequency. Similar behaviour has been observed in LES simulations which suggests that degenerate modes may be a characteristic feature of self-excited azimuthal instabilities in annular combustion chambers. By modelling the instabilities as two acoustic waves of time-varying amplitude travelling in opposite directions we demonstrate that there is a statistical prevalence for either standing m=1 or spinning m=±1 modes depending on flame spacing, equivalence ratio, and swirl configuration. Phase-averaged OH∗ chemiluminescence revealed a possible mechanism that drives the direction of the spinning modes under limit-cycle conditions for configurations with uniform swirl. By dividing the annulus into inner and outer annular regions it was found that the spin direction coincided with changes in the spatial distribution of the peak heat release rate relative to the direction of the bulk swirl induced along the annular walls. For standing wave modes it is shown that the globally integrated fluctuations in heat release rate vary in magnitude along the acoustic mode shape with negligible contributions at the pressure nodes and maximum contributions at the pressure anti-nodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemiluminescence 3acombustion 3aheat 3amodels 3asounds 3aspatial distribution 3aspinning1 aDawson, James R.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2013 Nov., v. 160, no. 11 p.2476-2489dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.04.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010900157300001600266500001100282520095200293592002801245596005501273596007301328596003301401596002801434596002501462650001001487650000901497650002301506700005901529700001601588700005401604700005601658773012101714856007301835852000901908655001201917IND60747832020221121054413.0210820e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074783202DNAL7 a10.1111/acv.126742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssersohn, K.10aWhy do eggs fail? Causes of hatching failure in threatened populations and consequences for conservation  ap. 540-551.  aREVIEW  aReproductive failure is ubiquitous. However, research on the mechanisms underpinning reproductive failure is still lacking in most species. This gap in our understanding has particularly strong repercussions for threatened species and it hinders our ability to establish effective interventions to improve survival. In this review, we focus on why eggs fail to hatch – one of the most critical and understudied aspects of bird reproduction. We identify the main drivers of hatching failure in threatened populations of birds and the key mechanisms that cause failure at different stages of development inside the egg. We then discuss the importance of management interventions aimed at reducing hatching failure in species of conservation concern. Our review highlights the need for a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of hatching failure in non‐model bird species and identifies the methodological tools necessary to achieve this.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/S00713X/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/L002485/1cZSL CASE/London Natural Environmental Research Council  aRGF\R1\180101cRoyal Society  aDH160200cRoyal Society  cInstitute of Zoology 3abirds 3aeggs 3athreatened species1 aMarshall, A.

Every social sector uses particular symbolic meanings to express contrasting viewpoints, concerns and claims related to wolves and sharing the landscape with this species. Although distinctive particularities may exist in each specific context, common elements can be observed in social conflicts around the presence of wolves across its range. In this contention, every social group tends to impose its vision of what our relationship with wolves should be. In this essay, we synthesized several symbolic meanings and social constructs around wolves. We argue that, under the current wolf debate, the complex symbolic burden of the animal must be acknowledged, in order to properly address social conflicts around the species. This requires promoting communication strategies that facilitate a change in the symbolism and meanings of the wolf.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3alandscapes 3asocial class 3avision 3awolves 0aAnthrozoology 0aHuman-wildlife interactions 0aConservation 0aWolf 0aSymbol 0aCoexistence1 aFerrández, Trinitario1 aLópez-Bao, José Vicente0 tBiological conservation.g2022 Sept. 27,  p.109756-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109756  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245009800206300001800304506007600322520149500398592002801893506003701921650001601958650001101974650001701985650001202002651000902014700002002023700002402043700001702067700002202084773017302106856008302279852000902362655001202371IND4481671320221207111715.0120502e20120124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448167132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11190091092doi7 aPMC32682732pmcid7 a222039842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirch, Patrick V.10aInterpolity exchange of basalt tools facilitated via elite control in Hawaiian archaic states  ap. 1056-1061.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEthnohistoric accounts of late precontact Hawaiian archaic states emphasize the independence of chiefly controlled territories (ahupua‘a) based on an agricultural, staple economy. However, elite control of unevenly distributed resources, such as high-quality volcanic rock for adze production, may have provided an alternative source of economic power. To test this hypothesis we used nondestructive energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) analysis of 328 lithic artifacts from 36 archaeological features in the Kahikinui district, Maui Island, to geochemically characterize the source groups. This process was followed by a limited sampling using destructive wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) analysis to more precisely characterize certain nonlocal source groups. Seventeen geochemical groups were defined, eight of which represent extra-Maui Island sources. Although the majority of stone tools were derived from Maui Island sources (71%), a significant quantity (27%) of tools derived from extraisland sources, including the large Mauna Kea quarry on Hawai‘i Island as well as quarries on O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, and Lāna‘i islands. Importantly, tools quarried from extralocal sources are found in the highest frequency in elite residential features and in ritual contexts. These results suggest a significant role for a wealth economy based on the control and distribution of nonagricultural goods and resources during the rise of the Hawaiian archaic states.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-radiation 3abasalt 3afluorescence 3aislands 3aMaui1 aMills, Peter R.1 aLundblad, Steven P.1 aSinton, John1 aKahn, Jennifer G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Jan. 24, v. 109, no. 4 p.1056-1061dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11190091093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100005900183245012100242506007600363520116800439592002801607506003701635650001501672650002501687650001701712650002201729650001401751650004301765650001301808700006001821700002301881700002201904773012101926856007702047852000902124655001202133IND60624018320221207104928.0181203e20180130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062401832DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/73706512doi7 aPMC58318722pmcid7 a296292132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMowaka, Shereen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8418-484410aDifferent Spectrophotometric Methods for Simultaneous Determination of Trelagliptin and Its Acid Degradation Product  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNew spectrophotometric and chemometric methods were carried out for the simultaneous assay of trelagliptin (TRG) and its acid degradation product (TAD) and applied successfully as a stability indicating assay to recently approved Zafatek® tablets. TAD was monitored using TLC to ensure complete degradation. Furthermore, HPLC was used to confirm dealing with one major acid degradation product. The proposed methods were developed by manipulating zero-order, first-derivative, and ratio spectra of TRG and TAD using simultaneous equation, first-derivative, and mean-centering methods, respectively. Using Spectra Manager II and Minitab v.14 software, the absorbance at 274 nm–260.4 nm, amplitudes at 260.4 nm–274.0 nm, and mean-centered values at 287.6 nm–257.2 nm were measured against methanol as a blank for TRG and TAD, respectively. Linearity and the other validation parameters were acceptable at concentration ranges of 5–50 μg/mL and 2.5–25 μg/mL for TRG and TAD, respectively. Using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the optimized methods were compared and proved to be accurate for the simultaneous assay of TRG and TAD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorbance 3aanalysis of variance 3achemometrics 3acomputer software 3aequations 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol1 aAyoub, Bassam M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3265-15671 aHassan, Mostafa A.1 aZaghary, Wafaa A.0 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2018 Jan. 30, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/73706513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012200167500001900289520201200308592002802320650002002348650002702368650001002395650001602405650001602421650002302437650002502460650001402485650001402499650001002513653003402523653002402557653004302581700001602624700001802640700001302658700001402671773011902685856008802804852000902892655001202901IND60707422820221120124952.0210320e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070742282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1415582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fan10aMolecular-level transformation characteristics of refractory organics in landfill leachate during ozonation treatment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMacromolecular refractory organics in landfill leachate are extremely complex compounds. This study examined the molecular-level transformation characteristics of refractory organics in biologically-treated landfill leachate (i.e., membrane bioreactor (MBR) leachate) during ozonation treatment. Results indicated that higher ozone dosage and longer reaction time enhanced organics removal. When ozone dosage was 32.16 mg/min and reaction time was 30 min, the efficiencies of removing color number, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were 95.16%, 51.13%, and 26.40%, respectively. Furthermore COD / DOC decreased from 3.38 to 2.24, and the content of aromatic substances and macromolecular humic substances (e.g., humic- and fulvic-like substances) substantially decreased. The MBR-treated leachate mainly contained phenolic compounds (82%, aromatic index ≤ 0.50 and H/C < 1.5), and the major elements within the dissolved organic matter in the MBR-treated leachate were C, H, O, N, and S. The CHOS and CHONS compounds in the leachate indicated that it would have a much greater biorefractory property than the natural organic matter (i.e., technical grade humic acid). After the MBR-treated leachate was treated by ozonation for 10 min, the CHO, CHON, CHOS and CHONS compounds were greatly degraded and removed, and the oxidation degree of dissolved organic matter was significantly increased owing to the strong oxidation ability of ozone. At 30 min of ozonation, CHON, CHOS and CHONS compounds were further degraded, and CHOS and CHONS compounds (as the biorefractory substances) were almost completely removed. It was noteworthy that some CHO compounds that mainly contained phenolic compounds (m/z = 250–300, carbon number > 20, and double bond equivalent < 6) with a higher bioavailability and higher saturation degree accumulated. This study provides beneficial references for practical application of landfill leachate treatment using the ozonation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achemical oxygen demand 3acolor 3aenvironment 3ahumic acids 3alandfill leachates 3amembrane bioreactors 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 0aBiologically-treated leachate 0aRefractory organics 0aUltrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry1 aHuang, Yuyu1 aZhuo, Xiaocun1 aHe, Chen1 aLi, Qibin0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 749 p.141558-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1415583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245010300194300001800297500002000315520147600335592002801811650002201839650001501861650001401876650001401890650001301904650002301917650001101940650001101951650001101962651002101973651001501994700001902009700005602028700001802084773013102102856007702233852000902310655001202319IND60789634920221118170613.0220822e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078963492DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0129162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9427-212710aSeasonal cycle of hydrography on the eastern shelf of the Filchner Trough, Weddell Sea, Antarctica  ap. 6437-6453.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNew 2 year long records from three moorings, located at 76°S along the eastern flank and shelf of the Filchner Trough, give insight in the seasonal cycle of hydrography to a region where Modified Warm Deep Water (MWDW) enters the southern Weddell Sea continental shelf, possibly reaching the Filchner Ronne Ice Shelf, the biggest ice shelf (by volume) in Antarctica. A persistent northward flow of Ice Shelf Water (ISW) is found along the eastern flank of the trough at 400 m depth, while the data on the eastern shelf indicate a seasonal cycle, characterized by four phases. A distinct warm inflow period (separated in two phases), with maximum temperatures of −1°C, appears to be related to the seasonal heaving of the Antarctic Slope Front thermocline along the continental shelf break further north and a seasonal extension of the ISW layer onto the eastern shelf. The density gradients between the ISW in the trough and the MWDW on the adjacent shelf drive the southward flow during these phases. A flow reversal is found in winter, ceasing the southward flow along the eastern flank of the trough. Weaker density gradients between the trough and the shelf during winter allow a westward flow, partly driven by a N‐S density gradient, existing across the eastern shelf during this time. From spring through to summer, the ISW layer in the trough extends onto the eastern shelf where it occupies the bottom layer at our moorings, associated with northward flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontinental shelf 3ageophysics 3ahydrology 3aice shelf 3aresearch 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aHattermann, T.1 aDarelius, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3060-03171 aSchröder, M.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Aug., v. 122, no. 8 p.6437-6453dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0129163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009500169300001600264520128500280592002801565650000801593650001901601650002101620650001501641650002001656650003101676650001001707650001101717650000801728650001201736650001301748650001401761650001901775650002401794650002201818650001501840650001801855650002001873653003001893653001601923653001801939653001201957700001801969700001401987700001802001700002402019700001802043773009302061856008302154852000902237655001202246IND60530713120221118054944.0170320e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053071312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gdata.2015.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dingxiao10aDeep RNA-Seq analysis reveals unexpected features of human prostate basal epithelial cells  ap. 318-320.  aProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among American men [1]. The prostate gland mainly contains basal and luminal cells, which are constructed as a pseudostratified epithelium. Annotation of prostate epithelial transcriptomes provides a foundation for discoveries that can impact disease understanding and treatment. Here, for the first time, we describe a whole-genome transcriptome analysis of human benign prostatic basal and luminal populations by using deep RNA sequencing (GSE67070) [2]. Combined with comprehensive molecular and biological characterizations, we show that the differential gene expression profiles account for their distinct functional phenotypes. Strikingly, in contrast to luminal cells, basal cells preferentially express gene categories associated with stem cells, neural and neuronal development, and RNA processing. Of clinical relevance, the treatment failed castration-resistant and anaplastic prostate cancers molecularly resemble a basal-like phenotype. We also identified genes associated with patient clinical outcome. Therefore, we provide a gene expression resource for understanding human prostate epithelial lineages, and link the cell-type specific gene signatures to subtypes of prostate cancer development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acarcinogenesis 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3amen 3aneurons 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprostate gland 3aprostatic neoplasms 3asequence analysis 3astem cells 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aProstate epithelial cells 0aBasal cells 0aLuminal cells 0aRNA-seq1 aPark, Daechan1 aLü, Yue,1 aShen, Jianjun1 aIyer, Vishwanath R.1 aTang, Dean G.0 tGenomics data.g2016 Mar., v. 7 p.318-320dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23221x2213-59607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gdata.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005100142245013700193300001800330520077500348592002801123596006201151596010701213596008001320596010101400650001601501650002001517650002701537650001001564650002801574700001701602700001901619700006201638773014601700856007701846852000901923655001201932IND60778900120221123002636.0220601e20220519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077890012DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c019512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0134-557210aVersatile Palladium-Catalyzed Approach to Acyl Fluorides and Carbonylations by Combining Visible Light- and Ligand-Driven Operations  ap. 9413-9420.  aWe describe the development of a general palladium-catalyzed carbonylative method to synthesize acyl fluorides from aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, and functionalized organic halides. Mechanistic analysis suggests that the reaction proceeds via the synergistic combination of visible light photoexcitation of Pd(0) to induce oxidative addition with a ligand-favored reductive elimination. These together create a unidirectional catalytic cycle that is uninhibited by the classical effect of carbon monoxide coordination. Coupling the catalytic formation of acyl fluorides with their subsequent nucleophilic reactions has opened a method to perform carbonylation reactions with unprecedented breadth, including the assembly of highly functionalized carbonyl-containing products.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcMcGill Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008582  aNAcNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  aNAcCanada Foundation for Innovationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000196  aNAcFonds de Recherche du Qu?bec - Nature et Technologiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003151 3aLewis bases 3acarbon monoxide 3aheterocyclic compounds 3alight 3aphotochemical reactions1 aZhou, Cuihan1 aJiang, Meijing1 aArndtsen, Bruce A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4915-92610 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 May 19, v. 144, no. 21 p.9413-9420dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c019513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012700167500001400294520145000308592002801758650003001786650001701816650002201833650000901855650001001864650001301874650001301887650001001900653003801910653002701948653002301975653001601998700001502014700001702029700001602046700001302062700001802075700001302093773011602106856008702222852000902309655001202318IND60695384720221121021443.0200607e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069538472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1129282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xin10aPerformance analysis of a multi-stage humidification–dehumidification desalination system with different salinity levels  aNAL-light  aHumidification–dehumidification (HDH) technology is an innovative desalination technology that is inexpensive and reliable for small-scale applications. With the development of research, increasing scholars are beginning to adopt a closed-water cycle configuration to improve the HDH system efficiency. The resulting problems of salt accumulation and salinity regulation have not yet been effectively addressed. This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of a closed-water multi-stage HDH desalination system with different salinity levels. The increase in salinity results in a decrease in the water productivity (~0.75% per 1% increase in the salinity) and maximum energy efficiency (in an average of 11.44% for 20% salinity). It is suggested that the salinity level in the system should be kept below 15% to prevent the maximum energy efficiency of the system lower than that of the open-water system. Additionally, the parameter referred to as the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio is introduced to assess the system performance with different salinity levels. The energy efficiency is maximised when the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio of the 1st-stage dehumidifier is equal to unity at any salinity level. Meanwhile, the effect of salinity on energy efficiency can be judged as an enhanced or diminished role based on whether the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio of the 1st-stage dehumidifier is less or greater than unity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3adesalination 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3apaper 3aresearch 3asalinity 3awater 0aHumidification–dehumidification 0aThermodynamic analysis 0aSalinity influence 0aMulti-stage1 aWang, Hang1 aLiu, Weihong1 aLing, Xiang1 aLi, Yang1 aWang, Yichuan1 aLi, Juan0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 July 01, v. 215 p.112928-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1129283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002600190245007200216300001400288506007600302520117200378592002801550506003701578650001301615650001301628650001701641650001401658650000901672650002001681650001201701650002201713650001501735650001401750650001301764650003301777650003501810650001901845651001101864653001001875653001301885653002601898653002201924653003901946700003101985700002802016700002902044700006702073700002902140700002202169700002102191773009102212856008302303852000902386655001202395IND60530713220221207141729.0170320e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053071322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gdata.2015.11.0022doi7 aPMC47785912pmcid7 a269813572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArteaga, María Clara10aGenomic variation in recently collected maize landraces from Mexico  ap. 38-45.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present dataset comprises 36,931 SNPs genotyped in 46 maize landraces native to Mexico as well as the teosinte subspecies Zea maiz ssp. parviglumis and ssp. mexicana. These landraces were collected directly from farmers mostly between 2006 and 2010. We accompany these data with a short description of the variation within each landrace, as well as maps, principal component analyses and neighbor joining trees showing the distribution of the genetic diversity relative to landrace, geographical features and maize biogeography. High levels of genetic variation were detected for the maize landraces (HE=0.234 to 0.318 (mean 0.311), while slightly lower levels were detected in Zea m. mexicana and Zea m. parviglumis (HE=0.262 and 0.234, respectively). The distribution of genetic variation was better explained by environmental variables given by the interaction of altitude and latitude than by landrace identity. This dataset is a follow up product of the Global Native Maize Project, an initiative to update the data on Mexican maize landraces and their wild relatives, and to generate information that is necessary for implementing the Mexican Biosafety Law.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3abiosafety 3acorn 3adata collection 3afarmers 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3alandraces 3alatitude 3aprincipal component analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3awild relatives 3aMexico 0aMaize 0aTeosinte 0aMaize SNP50K BeadChip 0aMexican landraces 0aProyecto Global de Maíces Nativos1 aMoreno-Letelier, Alejandra1 aMastretta-Yanes, Alicia1 aVázquez-Lobo, Alejandra1 aBreña-Ochoa, Alejandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5905-96271 aMoreno-Estrada, Andrés,1 aEguiarte, Luis E.1 aPiñero, Daniel,0 tGenomics data.g2016 Mar., v. 7 p.38-45dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23221x2213-59607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gdata.2015.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245009900170300001800269520075300287592002801040650001501068650001001083650000901093700001701102700002101119700002801140773009701168856009001265990002301355852000901378655001201387IND60095838420221119043730.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009583842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lei10aMeasurements of sooting tendency in laminar diffusion flames of n-heptane at elevated pressure  ap. 2507-2516.  aThis research focuses on the effects of an increasing pressure on the soot formation during combustion of vaporized liquid fuel.

The soot volume fraction in the diffusion flames has been measured using Laser-Induced Incandescence (LII) calibrated by means of the Line Of Sight Attenuation (LOSA) technique. The values of the calibration factors between LII intensities and soot volume fraction from LOSA are slightly varied for different pressure. The integral soot volume fractions show power law dependence on pressures, being proportional to pⁿ, with n being 3.4±0.3 in the pressure range of 1.0–3.0bar.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3afuels 3asoot1 aDam, Nico J.1 aBoot, Michael D.1 ade Goey, L.

This study aims to examine whether exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 or PM10 was associated with PTB (<37 weeks) and near term birth (37–38 weeks).We established a birth cohort with 1,280,524 singleton pregnancies who delivered from Dec 1st, 2013 to Nov 30th, 2014 and matched their home address to PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations which were predicted with machine learning methods based satellite remote sensing, meteorological and land use information. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the associations between PTB and exposure of PM2.5 or PM10, after controlling for individual level covariates.Exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 during pregnancy increases the risk of PTB and near term birth [e.g., Hazard ratios: 1.09 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.10), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.08), 1.01 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.02), and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.10) for each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester and over the entire pregnancy, respectively]. The effects appeared to be stronger among women who come from rural areas, worked as farmers, were overweight before conception, whose mate was smoking during pregnancy, and conceived in autumn.This study provides clear evidence that exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 during pregnancy increases the risk of PTB and near term birth. Public policies regarding improvement of air quality would produce great health benefit by reducing the burden of preterm birth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aartificial intelligence 3acohort studies 3aconception 3afarmers 3aland use 3aoverweight 3aparticulates 3apollution 3apregnancy 3apremature birth 3apublic policy 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3arural areas 3asatellites 3awomen 3aChina 0aSatellite-based PM2.5 and PM10 predictions 0aBirth cohort 0aPreterm birth1 aWang, Yuan-yuan1 aGuo, Yuming1 aZhou, Hong1 aWang, Xiaobin1 aWang, Qiaomei1 aShen, Haiping1 aZhang, Yiping1 aYan, Donghai1 aZhang, Ya1 aZhang, Hongguang1 aLi, Shanshan1 aChen, Gongbo1 aLin, Lizi1 aZhao, Jun1 aHe, Yuan1 aYang, Ying1 aXu, Jihong1 aWang, Yan1 aPeng, Zuoqi1 aWang, Hai-Jun1 aMa, Xu0 tEnvironment international.g2018 Dec., v. 121 p.1128-1136dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03851naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013300158300001800291500002000309520255300329592002802882650002702910650001002937650001802947650002602965650001602991650001303007650002003020650001303040650002103053650001503074650001603089650001103105650001903116650002003135700001803155700002303173700002003196773011903216856007303335852000903408655001203417IND60587364420221120165838.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058736442DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.129582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBray, Jonathan10aEcological eustress? Nutrient supply, bloom stimulation and competition determine dominance of the diatom Didymosphenia geminata  ap. 1433-1442.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNuisance proliferations of the invasive benthic alga Didymosphenia geminata (Bacillariophyceae) are of major concern in many temperate regions due to their severe effects on river habitats and communities. Proliferations result from the production of basal stalk material, stimulated by phosphorus limited, high light conditions. An unresolved disconnect occurs where nitrogen and phosphorus are observed to stimulate D. geminata cell division, but, within a realised niche, disappearance or establishment failure occurs where dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations occur above c. 2–5 μg/L. Our aims were to examine the mechanisms behind D. geminata bloom stimulation and absence/disappearance. We examined: (1a) whether prolonged nitrogen (NaNO₃ – N) and phosphorus (NaH₂PO₄ – P) addition would stimulate cell division, and (1b) whether subsequent nutrient limitation stimulated stalk production; (2) whether the mechanism behind D. geminata absence at >5 μg/L DRP, occurred either as (2a) a deleterious consequence of prolonged N + P exposure or (2b) was associated with increasing densities of co‐occurring algae; and (3) whether water velocity stimulated D. geminata cell division thereby influencing outcomes. Didymosphenia geminata cell densities, frequencies of dividing cells, stalk production and densities of competing algae were examined in flow‐through channel mesocosms over 8 weeks. Treatments included: Waitaki River water (control); N + P amended water; and two treatments in which nutrient amendments were changed over time, these being N + P to N, and N + P to Waitaki water. Continued N + P amendment was positively correlated with D. geminata cell densities. N‐replete P‐limited channels, however, accrued greatest densities of D. geminata cells, stalk fragments and dividing cells. Results suggest that within a realised niche short term N + P amendment followed by chronic P limitation could either hasten and/or worsen bloom development. Water velocity influenced community successional trajectories and D. geminata fitness outcomes. Across all nutrient and velocity treatments, a decline in D. geminata cell densities and cell division was correlated with increasing densities of competing algae. Phosphorus limitation stimulating stalk production appears to be an example of physiological stress resulting in increased fitness (known as eustress) and D. geminata dominance. This contrasts with a general pattern of competitive exclusion as nutrient concentrations increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDidymosphenia geminata 3aalgae 3acell division 3acompetitive exclusion 3acorrelation 3ahabitats 3alight intensity 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3ariver water 3arivers 3asodium nitrate 3atemperate zones1 aKilroy, Cathy1 aGerbeaux, Philippe1 aHarding, Jon S.0 tFreshwater biology.g2017 Aug., v. 62, no. 8 p.1433-1442dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.129583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04145naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008800168300001600256520264400272592002802916650002202944650002802966650001502994650000903009650002003018650002203038650001103060650001503071650002403086650001703110650001203127650001203139651001103151653002803162653004103190653001803231653003303249653003103282700002403313700002303337700001603360700002903376700001803405773013303423856008603556852000903642655001203651IND60776548220221118214319.0220509e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077654822DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(21)60055-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHANG, Yakun10aComparison of sampling designs for calibrating digital soil maps at multiple depths  ap. 588-601.  aDigital soil mapping (DSM) aims to produce detailed maps of soil properties or soil classes to improve agricultural management and soil quality assessment. Optimized sampling design can reduce the substantial costs and efforts associated with sampling, profile description, and laboratory analysis. The purpose of this study was to compare common sampling designs for DSM, including grid sampling (GS), grid random sampling (GRS), stratified random sampling (StRS), and conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). In an agricultural field (11 ha) in Quebec, Canada, a total of unique 118 locations were selected using each of the four sampling designs (45 locations each), and additional 30 sample locations were selected as an independent testing dataset (evaluation dataset). Soil visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectra were collected in situ at the 148 locations (1 m depth), and soil cores were collected from a subset of 32 locations and subdivided at 10-cm depth intervals, totaling 251 samples. The Cubist model was used to elucidate the relationship between Vis-NIR spectra and soil properties (soil organic matter (SOM) and clay), which was then used to predict the soil properties at all 148 sample locations. Digital maps of soil properties at multiple depths for the entire field (148 sample locations) were prepared using a quantile random forest model to obtain complete model maps (CM-maps). Soil properties were also mapped using the samples from each of the 45 locations for each sampling design to obtain sampling design maps (SD-maps). The SD-maps were evaluated using the independent testing dataset (30 sample locations), and the spatial distribution and model uncertainty of each SD-map were compared with those of the corresponding CM-map. The spatial and feature space coverage were compared across the four sampling designs. The results showed that GS resulted in the most even spatial coverage, cLHS resulted in the best coverage of the feature space, and GS and cLHS resulted in similar prediction accuracies and spatial distributions of soil properties. The SOM content was underestimated using GRS, with large errors at 0–50 cm depth, due to some values not being captured by this sampling design, whereas larger errors for the deeper soil layers were produced using StRS. Predictions of SOM and clay contents had higher accuracy for topsoil (0–30 cm) than for deep subsoil (60–100 cm). It was concluded that the soil sampling designs with either good spatial coverage or feature space coverage can provide good accuracy in 3D DSM, but their performances may be different for different soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aalgorithms 3aclay 3adata collection 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3aprediction 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3asubsoil 3atopsoil 3aQuebec 0a3D digital soil mapping 0aconditioned Latin hypercube sampling 0agrid sampling 0aquantile random forest model 0astratified random sampling1 aSAURETTE, Daniel D.1 aEASHER, Tahmid Huq1 aJi, Wenjun,1 aAdamchuk, Viacheslav I.,1 aBiswas, Asim,0 tPedosphere.g2022 Aug., v. 32, no. 4 p.588-601dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(21)60055-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02057naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010500163300001800268520115400286592002801440650001601468650002101484650001101505650002801516650001801544773013401562856007401696852000901770655001201779IND60617464020221118100115.0181025e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061746402DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc00372f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirjafari, Arsalan10aIonic liquid syntheses via click chemistry: expeditious routes toward versatile functional materials  ap. 2944-2961.  aSince the introduction of click chemistry by K. B. Sharpless in 2001, its exploration and exploitation has occurred in countless fields of materials sciences in both academic and industrial spheres. Click chemistry is defined as an efficient, robust, and orthogonal synthetic platform for the facile formation of new carbon–heteroatom bonds, using readily available starting materials. Premier examples of click reactions are copper(i)-catalyzed azide–alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (CuAAC) and the thiol–X (X = ene and yne) coupling reactions to form C–N and C–S bonds, respectively. The emphasis of this review is centered on the rapidly expanding area of click chemistry-mediated synthesis of functional ionic liquids via CuAAC, thiol–X and oxime formation, and selected examples of nucleophilic ring-opening reactions, while offering some thoughts on emerging challenges, opportunities and ultimately the evolution of this field. Click chemistry offers tremendous opportunities, and introduces intriguing perspectives for efficient and robust generation of tailored task-specific ionic liquids – an important class of soft materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3achemical bonding 3acopper 3acycloaddition reactions 3aionic liquids0 tChemical communications.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 54, no. 24 p.2944-2961dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc00372f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008600165300001600251520128400267592002801551650001501579650001601594650001001610650000901620650001301629650001501642650002401657650002301681700001601704700001801720700001401738700001601752773013601768856007801904852000901982655001201991IND60765373420221119152024.0220904e20180927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076537342DNAL7 a10.17221/63/2017-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuik-Lindsaar, H.10aHow do herd’s genetic level and milk quality affect performance of dairy farms?  ap. 379-388.  aThe effects of genetic level and output quality characteristics on technical efficiency (TE) of dairy farms were studied. The average total relative breeding value (RBV) at herd level was considered a parameter of the genetic level and production potential of the main input (dairy cows), while somatic cell count (SCC) and milk composition characterise the quality of the main output (milk) of dairy farms. The analysis was carried out in two stages: data envelopment analysis was used in the first stage and fractional regression model in the second stage, combining the data collected by the Estonian Farm Accountancy Data Network with the data from the Estonian Livestock Performance Recording Ltd. The results showed that the TE of fully efficient dairy farms is positively affected by the total RBV (P < 0.05), number of dairy cows in the herd (P < 0.05), and negatively affected by the SCC (P < 0.001) and costs of purchased feed per kg of produced milk (P < 0.01). Among the inefficient farms, the TE was positively affected by the lifetime daily milk yield (P < 0.05), and average milk fat (P < 0.1) and protein (P < 0.05) contents. The results confirm our hypothesis that the genetic level of dairy herd and milk quality have a positive effect on the TE of dairy farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3adairy herds 3afarms 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3aregression analysis 3asomatic cell count1 aViira, A.H.1 aViinalass, H.1 aKaart, T.1 aVärnik, R.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 63, no. 10 p.379-388dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/63/2017-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013300170300001400303500001500317520137700332592002801709650001101737650002001748650001501768650001501783650002001798650001501818650001701833650001201850650001601862650002901878650003101907650001601938650001101954653001201965653001101977653001801988653001602006653001502022653002102037653003602058653002902094653002002123700001802143700001902161773012302180856008702303852000902390655001202399IND60112737720221121124442.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011273772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2012.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFellman, J.B.10aLeaf litter age, chemical quality, and photodegradation control the fate of leachate dissolved organic matter in a dryland river  ap. 30-37.  a2019-12-04  aWe used biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254, indicator of aromatic carbon content) and laboratory experiments to determine the bioavailability and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from fresh leaves and litter aged on a seasonally dry floodplain for 2, 4, and 6 months. Our objective was to elucidate how litter age and solar radiation affect the bacterial utilization of DOM released from floodplain leaf litter when inundated. Leachate percent BDOC ranged from 22 to 47% for three different leaf species and significantly decreased (p < 0.05) with increasing litter age. However, total BDOC (mg C L−1) was unrelated to litter age. Bacterial utilization of DOM leachate collected from litter aged on the floodplain for four and six months significantly increased following 48 h of irradiation for all species but there was no difference for leachate from fresh and two month old litter. The photo-mediated increase in percent BDOC was concomitant with a decrease in aromatic carbon content, as SUVA254 values decreased on average 9 ± 6% for light exposure experiments. Our findings demonstrate that sunlight moderates the degradation of plant litter in the terrestrial environment through the photo-mediated shift in DOM composition and its bioavailability in streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3aarid lands 3aabsorbance 3abioavailability 3aphotolysis 3aplant litter 3astreams 3afloodplains 3adissolved organic carbon 3alaboratory experimentation 3airradiation 3aleaves 0aPilbara 0acarbon 0aDryland river 0aLeaf litter 0aFloodplain 0aPhotodegradation 0aSpecific ultraviolet absorbance 0aDissolved organic matter 0aBioavailability1 aPetrone, K.C.1 aGrierson, P.F.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2013 Feb., v. 89 p.30-37dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2012.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245009100179300001600270520134200286592002801628650001201656650001101668650001501679650001701694650001301711650002401724650001901748650001801767650002301785650001301808650001401821650002901835650001001864650001701874650001801891650002501909650001101934653001501945653001401960653001701974653001301991653001802004653001602022700001902038700001702057773009702074856008502171852000902256655001202265IND60644297120221116232332.0190628e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064429712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasertcharoensuk, Phuet10aGasification of waste biomass for hydrogen production: Effects of pyrolysis parameters  ap. 112-120.  aUnderstanding the behaviour of pyrolysis is crucial in gasification of high volatile content lignocellulosic material. In this study, parameters affecting the properties of volatiles and char that are feedstock for the gasification step were studied to determine and optimize operating conditions in pyrolysis for high quality syngas/hydrogen production. A uniform temperature profile was obtained at particle sizes up to 0.5 cm3. Pyrolysis temperatures in the range 600–900 °C significantly influence the char properties, i.e. increasing surface area and total pore size up to 2.5–3 times when increasing temperature, which in turn enhances the gas-solid reactions occurring in the gasification process. Increasing pyrolysis temperatures, i.e. above 700 °C fully decomposed unstable compounds, i.e. levoglucosan and their derivatives, but promoted the formation of phenolic compounds. Around 41% reduction in surface area and total pore volume of the char was observed when increasing particle size from 0.5 to 2 cm3. At pyrolysis temperatures above 800 °C and particle size of 0.5–1 cm3 with a controlled amount of steam, i.e. 5.7 steam to carbon in biomass (S/C) molar ratio, the H2 content in the gas phase increased to 67 mol% from 49 mol% and the aromatic compounds in the gas stream decreased up to 50.6%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3afeedstocks 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alignocellulose 3aparticle size 3aphenolic compounds 3aporosity 3apyrolysis 3arenewable energy sources 3asteam 3asurface area 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature profiles 3awastes 0aWaste wood 0aPyrolysis 0aGasification 0aHydrogen 0aParticle size 0aTemperature1 aBull, Steve J.1 aPhan, Anh N.0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Dec., v. 143 p.112-120dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245013800168520182100306592002802127650002102155650002502176650001802201650002602219650002502245650002402270650002902294650000902323650001702332650002302349650002202372650001102394650002102405650001902426651001902445651001502464651001902479700002302498700002002521700002302541700002002564700002002584700002402604700001702628773012102645856007402766852000902840655001202849IND60794176320221117095659.0220922e20220912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079417632DNAL7 a10.3390/f130914662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachava-António, Vilma 12aA Comparison of Mangrove Forest Structure and Ecosystem Services in Maputo Bay (Eastern Africa) and Príncipe Island (Western Africa)  aMangroves are critical to maintaining human well-being and global biodiversity. Eastern and western African shores present major environmental contrasts that reflect on mangrove forests’ structure and the ecosystem services they provide to human communities. This study compares the mangrove forest structure and condition, ecosystem services, and uses of resources in Maputo Bay (Mozambique in eastern Africa) and Príncipe Island (São Tomé and Príncipe in western Africa). Five mangrove species were identified in Maputo Bay, Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata, and Xylocarpus granatum, and the importance value index was higher for A. marina. Mangroves in Príncipe were exclusively dominated by Rhizophora harrisonii. In Maputo Bay, a weak regeneration characterized by a low quantity of seedlings was observed, although in Príncipe the sites were characterized by a low regeneration rate but well-established forests. The comparison of the mangrove structure between Maputo Bay and Príncipe Island presented statistically significant differences for mean DBH and height, whereas the trees in Príncipe presented higher values for both parameters. Strong human disturbance (through cutting) was identified in almost all sites in Maputo Bay but was rarely observed on Príncipe Island. In Maputo Bay, more than 90% of the coastal human community is involved in activities related to the surrounding mangroves, with a diversified exploitation of forest resources. On Príncipe Island, the exploitation of mangroves targets only tannin from the mangrove bark to dye fishing nets and small boats. The economic value of mangroves in Maputo Bay has subsistence and commercial importance, in contrast to Príncipe, which revealed no major economic value to the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia marina 3aBruguiera gymnorhiza 3aCeriops tagal 3aRhizophora harrisonii 3aRhizophora mucronata 3aXylocarpus granatum 3aanthropogenic activities 3abark 3abiodiversity 3aeconomic valuation 3ahuman communities 3ahumans 3amangrove forests 3asocial welfare 3aEastern Africa 3aMozambique 3aWestern Africa1 aFernando, Alberto 1 aCravo, Mariana 1 aMassingue, Mágda 1 aLima, Hamilton 1 aMacamo, Célia 1 aBandeira, Salomão 1 aPaula, Jose,0 tForests.g2022 Sept. 12, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130914663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01613naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014300161300001600304520047700320592002800797650002300825650001300848650002100861650001500882650001200897650002200909650001300931650001300944650001600957700002200973700002200995700002101017773013001038856007401168852000901242655001201251IND60680998620221122135824.0200113e20200107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068099862DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc08550e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraley, Sarah E.10aElectrode-adsorption activates trans-[Cr(cyclam)Cl₂]⁺ for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction [Erratum: April 2021, Vol.57(35), p.4332]  ap. 603-606.  aCyclic voltammetry reveals that aqueous trans-[Cr(cyclam)Cl₂]⁺ is reversibly reduced at a mercury electrode, with a small prewave suggesting an adsorptive interaction between the complex and electrode surface.

Forty samples adulterated with CMR (0.25–10 ppm) and forty with EVA (0.25–10%) were prepared from pure vanilla extracts and characterized by MID-FTIR spectroscopy to develop chemometric models. Additionally, six commercial vanilla samples were analyzed. A soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) model was developed to identify and classify the purity from EVA-adulterated or CMR-adulterated samples. Prediction models for CMR or EVA content were developed using the principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares with single y-variables (PLS1), and with multiple y-variables (PLS2) algorithms. Moreover, the predictions of the best quantification chemometric model were compared with the results of a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) method to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction. The PLS1 algorithm had better performance using 3 and 8 factors for EVA and CMR, respectively. The SIMCA model showed 100% recognition and rejections rates. The results demonstrate that adulteration of pure vanilla with EVA and CMR could be successfully predicted by the developed technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3aalgorithms 3achemometrics 3acoumarin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aprediction 3aspectroscopy 3avanillin 0aVanilla extracts 0aCoumarin 0aEthyl vanillin 0aAdulteration 0aChemometrics 0aMID-FTIR1 aHernández-Martínez, Diana Maylet1 aOsorio-Revilla, Guillermo1 aTapia-Ochoategui, Adriana Patricia1 aDávila-Ortiz, Gloria1 aGallardo-Velázquez, Tzayhri0 tTalanta.g2019 May 15, v. 197 p.264-269dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245009800195300001800293500001500311520125100326592002801577650002601605650000901631650001601640650002001656650000901676650002001685650001901705650002401724650001101748650001901759650001101778650001401789650002801803650001901831650001601850650002001866650001101886650002401897650002901921651001101950653001901961653001501980700002501995700001702020700002002037700001902057700001902076700001902095773011802114856004802232852000902280655001202289IND50068976320221121181838.0130903e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006897632DNAL7 a236253522pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-013-3170-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeramitsoglou, Iphigenia10aHeat wave hazard classification and risk assessment using artificial intelligence fuzzy logic  ap. 8239-8258.  a2019-12-06  aThe average summer temperatures as well as the frequency and intensity of hot days and heat waves are expected to increase due to climate change. Motivated by this consequence, we propose a methodology to evaluate the monthly heat wave hazard and risk and its spatial distribution within large cities. A simple urban climate model with assimilated satellite-derived land surface temperature images was used to generate a historic database of urban air temperature fields. Heat wave hazard was then estimated from the analysis of these hourly air temperatures distributed at a 1-km grid over Athens, Greece, by identifying the areas that are more likely to suffer higher temperatures in the case of a heat wave event. Innovation lies in the artificial intelligence fuzzy logic model that was used to classify the heat waves from mild to extreme by taking into consideration their duration, intensity and time of occurrence. The monthly hazard was subsequently estimated as the cumulative effect from the individual heat waves that occurred at each grid cell during a month. Finally, monthly heat wave risk maps were produced integrating geospatial information on the population vulnerability to heat waves calculated from socio-economic variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3asocioeconomic factors 3arisk 3afuzzy logic 3aair temperature 3aheat 3arisk assessment 3aclimate change 3asurface temperature 3asummer 3aclimate models 3acities 3adatabases 2aArtificial Intelligence 2aClimate Change 2aFuzzy Logic 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aModels, Theoretical 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 3aGreece 0anew technology 0atechnology1 aKiranoudis, Chris T.1 aMaiheu, Bino1 aDe Ridder, Koen1 aDaglis, I.

Employing Jaimovich–Rebello preferences our results highlight a constraint on the preference parameter needed to target the steady-state Frisch elasticity. This leads to a lower bound for the latter that cannot be reconciled empirically with external habit, but the introduction of a labor wedge solves the problem. We also propose a dynamic Frisch inverse elasticity measure and examine its business cycle properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness cycles 3aelasticity of substitution 3alabor 3autility functions 0aE21 0aE24 0aJaimovich–Rebello preferences 0aHabit in consumption 0aLabor supply 0aDynamic Frisch elasticity 0aLabor wedge1 aLevine, Paul1 aSwarbrick, Jonathan0 tEconomics letters.g2018 July, v. 168 p.132-137dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2018.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245018200167300001600349520110700365592002801472650003401500650003101534650002201565650001701587650002101604650001601625650001601641650001501657650001301672650001301685650001701698650001801715650002101733650001601754650001401770650002701784650001401811650001601825650001001841650002001851650000901871650002001880650003901900650001301939650001601952650001701968650002501985650001602010653001702026653003802043653001802081653001602099653001602115700001702131700002002148700002902168700001902197700005302216773010002269856008702369852000902456655001202465IND60611972620221119142750.0200503e20190130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061197262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Juan12aA value-added approach to improve the nutritional quality of soybean meal byproduct: Enhancing its antioxidant activity through fermentation by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SWJS22  ap. 396-403.  aThe action of β-glucosidase and protease of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SWJS22 in the fermentation of soybean meal caused a significant increase 1): in total phenolic and flavonoid contents with two-fold or higher, largely associated with daidzein, glycitein, genistein, protocatechuic, and p-hydroxybenzoic, gallic acids; 2): the amount of peptides <3 kDa, maillard reaction intermediate and maillard reaction product with five-, three- and twenty-one-fold, respectively. The significant increase in the amount of antioxidant components in the lyophilised fermented soybean meal supernatant (LFSMS) was associated with the improved antioxidant activity. Namely, the DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity of the LFSMS generally increased, and LFSMS (at doses >250 mg/kg body weight) improved the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and total antioxidant capacity, and inhibited the formation of malondialdehyde in mouse serum and liver (p < 0.05).

Here, the activities of four enzymes associated with carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling after organic mulching were investigated in the rhizosphere and bulk soil of a 15-year-old Ligustrum lucidum urban forest. The enzymatic activities in the rhizosphere were closely correlated to those in bulk soil, however, they were more strongly affected by organic mulching and exhibited faster C and nutrient cycling. Moreover, the activity of urease in the rhizosphere and peroxidase in the bulk soil in autumn, as well as invertase in the rhizosphere in spring, decreased. Microbial C and N were most responsible for the observed increase in invertase activity in spring, during which microorganisms exhibited rapid growth and the highest activities, whereas soil organic C regulated urease activity in winter. Additionally, the activity of dehydrogenase increased by up to 75%; the degree of increase was typically dependent on the mulching amount. Generally, invertase and dehydrogenase activity increased with the abundance of dissolved organic matter and microbial biomass, whereas peroxidase exhibited the opposite trend. Taken together, these findings indicate that organic mulching efficiently increases enzymatic activity, particularly within the rhizosphere, thus accelerating soil C and N cycling. Hence, mulching may represent an effective measure for urban forest management and soil conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLigustrum lucidum 3aautumn 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3adissolved organic matter 3aenzyme activity 3aforest management 3aforest soils 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3aperoxidase 3aplant residues 3arhizosphere 3asoil conservation 3asoil organic carbon 3aspring 3aurban forests 3aurease 3awinter1 aYe, Yuqian 1 aLiao, Jiahui 1 aSoromotin, Andrey V.1 aSmirnov, Pavel V.1 aKuzyakov, Yakov 0 tForests.g2022 Aug. 25, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130913523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01286naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008200154300001600236520014600252592002800398650002300426650002300449650001900472650002600491650001800517700001700535700001500552700001500567700001700582700001600599700001600615700002400631700001900655700001300674773013000687856007400817852000900891655001200900IND60680998820221122135818.0200113e20200107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068099882DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc08692g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Namin13aAn enzyme-initiated DNAzyme motor for RNase H activity imaging in living cell  ap. 639-642.  aIn this work, we have developed a novel DNAzyme motor initiated by endogenous enzyme for sensitive imaging of intracellular RNase H activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aimage analysis 3aintracellular enzymes 3aribonucleases1 aWang, Yafang1 aLiu, Chang1 aHe, Manman1 aNie, Cunpeng1 aZhang, Juan1 aYu, Qiaoqin1 aZhao, Chuan,d1967-1 aChen, Tingting1 aChu, Xia0 tChemical communications.g2020 Jan. 7, v. 56, no. 4 p.639-642dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc08692g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007300175300001600248520063700264592002800901650001500929650001300944650001800957650001400975650001400989653001101003653001801014653002101032653001601053653002701069653002901096700001301125773015301138856008601291852000901377655001201386IND60539236520221119224051.0190215e20140121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053923652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2013.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Cheng William10aTapping the treasure of intracellular oncotargets with immunotherapy  ap. 350-355.  aIt is commonly believed that antibodies are too large (∼150kDa) to access the intracellular compartment. Therefore, therapeutic antibodies have been traditionally used to target cell surface receptors or soluble proteins in the circulation, leaving a large intracellular treasure of potential cancer-specific targets untapped. This review offers new perspectives on our recently proposed concept that antibodies can be used to target intracellular tumor antigens for anti-cancer therapy.

In addition, most importantly, the biosensor could accurately determine the amounts of target c-miRNA in total c-miRNAs isolated from human serums and human cancer cell lines, which confirms that the biosensor could be used to quantify c-miRNAs in complex biological samples and for the clinical early diagnosis of cancers based on c-miRNAs detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adyes 3aearly diagnosis 3afluorescence 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 0aSerum circulating microRNAs 0aDuplex specific nuclease 0aRolling circle amplification 0aBiosensor 0aSYBR gold dye1 aMao, Yu1 aLiu, Feng1 aZhang, Wei1 aLin, Jin-Shun1 aYin, Jingxian1 aTan, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2957-01651 aHuang, Xiaoting1 aJiang, Yuyang0 tTalanta.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 200 p.480-486dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01618naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245007200165300001600237520071700253592002800970650001500998650001901013650001201032650001301044650001501057650002101072651000901093773012801102856007701230852000901307655001201316IND60765373920221119110123.0220904e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076537392DNAL7 a10.17221/63/2019-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrnejad, M.

The size of this industry has gradually increased and the pistachio nut production in Iran is now the largest worldwide, although it has declined over last few years due to long periods of harsh drought, the mismanagement of water resources and the impact of climate change. Research on pests and diseases was started in the 1940s due to the demands of the growers who were facing economic damage by herbivorous insects. Much research has been undertaken over the last 75 years to improve production procedures and the present article summarises the available information on pistachio pests, their natural enemies and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthropods 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aindustry 3apistachios 3aplant protection 3aIran0 tPlant Protection Science.g, v. 56, no. 4 p.231-260dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21418x1212-25807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/63/2019-pps3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245007500168520146700243592002801710650002301738650002001761650002801781650001001809650002001819650001401839650001101853650001801864650001201882650001001894650000901904650001601913651001301929700002301942773012101965856007402086852000902160655001202169IND60794176820221117095226.0220922e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079417682DNAL7 a10.3390/f130914702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedliačiková, Mariana 10aAre Consumers Interested in Colored Beech Wood and Furniture Products?  aThe beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is the most represented tree from the deciduous trees in Slovakia. This paper deals with the issue of color tones of steamed beech wood and furniture products made of it. The main objective of this paper was to identify the interest of Slovak consumers in colored beech wood and furniture made of it. An empirical survey was used to map the issue, while the basic set was the population of Slovakia. The representativeness of the sample set was verified through the chi-square test. The results showed that Slovak consumers are highly interested in buying beech wood and products made of it. In addition to the price and quality of the wood raw material, the color of the wood is also an important factor for them. The majority of respondents stated that they were not interested in buying wood and furniture products in the native color of beech wood. On the contrary, Slovaks especially prefer deep brown-red tones of beech wood. The results of the conducted survey are up to date and take into account consumers’ behavior after the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the current economic crisis. This information will help woodworking and furniture enterprises operating in the Slovak business environment to better adapt their offer of products for the end consumers. At the same time, it will help in working efficiently with wood raw material, which is becoming a short commodity from a global point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aFagus sylvatica 3achi-square distribution 3acolor 3aeconomic crises 3afurniture 3aprices 3araw materials 3asurveys 3atrees 3awood 3awoodworking 3aSlovakia1 aMoresová, Mária 0 tForests.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130914703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016200165300001600327520128200343592002801625650002201653650002601675650001101701650001301712650001701725650002101742650000901763650001501772653003201787653003101819653003501850653001701885653003901902700001401941773009101955856008602046852000902132655001202141IND60628972120221120104233.0190404e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062897212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu12aA ratiometric fluorescent sensor with dual response of Fe3+/Cu2+ based on europium post-modified sulfone-metal-organic frameworks and its logical application  ap. 291-298.  aIn this work, a sulfone-functionalized metal organic frameworks (MOFs) (CAU-11) formulated as [Al(OH)(SDBA)]·0.25DMF (H2SDBA = 4, 4′-sulfonyldibenzoic acid) has been successfully constructed under solvothermal conditions. Next, a europium ion post-functionalized compound (Eu3+@CAU-11) with bright red fluorescence has been obtained by postsynthetic modification (PSM). Because of its excellent luminescence and robust framework, we design this compound as a ratiometric fluorescent probe (IL/IEu) for sensing application. In the investigation process, what is surprising is that Fe3+ can quench the fluorescence of Eu3+@CAU-11 both in aqueous solutions and in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) while Cu2+ can only quench the fluorescence of it in DMF. It represents a rare example of a sensor based on a metal-organic framework which can dually sense and distinguish two quenching metal ions in different solutions simultaneously. To better explain this phenomenon, the probable sensing mechanism of the two metal ions has also been discussed in this paper. More importantly, we have designed this ratiometric fluorescent sensor as a combinational molecular logic gate for further logical application because of its sample synthesis process and favorable luminescent properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3aeuropium 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3airon 3ametal ions 0aSulfone-functionalized MOFs 0aPostsynthetic modification 0aRatiometric fluorescent sensor 0aDual sensing 0aCombinational molecular logic gate1 aYan, Bing0 tTalanta.g2019 May 15, v. 197 p.291-298dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245009500178520125900273592002801532650001101560650001201571650001701583650001101600650001301611650002301624653002401647653002101671653001301692653001301705653001001718653001001728653001201738653002901750773010601779856008701885852000901972655001201981IND60780575820221120182718.0220906e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078057582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtersack, Christoph10aModeling of type II high-resolution sorption isotherms: Evaluation of different approaches  aSeveral classical sorption isotherm equations were fitted to experimental high-resolution data for type II multilayer isotherms. Both the models and the experimental data (sorption of Ar (87 K), N₂ (77 K), H₂O (303 K), n-pentane (298 K), neopentane (273 K) on macroporous silica are taken from the literature. Further data include N₂ sorption on nonporous functionalized silica and α-alumina. The following equations are tested: Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), its modification by Anderson, Aranovich, the ζ-isotherm, Harkins-Jura, Frenkel-Halsey-Hill (FHH), that of de Boer and Zwikker manifesting itself in later work of Fuller, Condon, and Adolphs, the dual-site Langmuir equation with monolayer clustering recently presented by Calzaferri et al., and at last the general cluster sorption isotherm (GCSI, Micropor. Mesopor. Mater. 316 (2021) 110909). The GCSI describes all experimental data with high accuracy, not only for homogeneous but also for heterogeneous surfaces with a Gaussian energy distribution. All other models fail more or less, depending on the initial slope of the experimental isotherm. Besides theoretical considerations, the quality of each isotherm modeling is evaluated by the pure statistical Akaike criterion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3apentane 3aporous media 3asilica 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 0aAdsorption isotherm 0aNonporous silica 0aModeling 0aNitrogen 0aArgon 0aWater 0aPentane 0aHigh resolution isotherm0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 650 p.129489-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011400165300001400279520158700293592002801880650001401908650002501922650001401947650001201961650001001973650003001983650002202013650001102035650000902046653002602055653002502081653001202106653002802118700001302146700001802159773010902177856008702286852000902373655001202382IND60112738320221121160740.0190318e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011273832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2012.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, W.M.10aChronic wind and plant communities in dunes: Total biomass, inter-specific competition, and species abundance  ap. 69-76.  aChronic wind is an important ecological factor, but its direct roles in shaping plant communities remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that chronic wind can modulate community productivity, inter-specific competition, and species abundance in inland dunes. We conducted an experiment with three shrubs (Artemisia ordosica, Caragana intermedia, and Hedysarum laeve) common to semi-arid sandlands, set up seven kinds of plant communities (i.e. Artemisia monoculture, Caragana monoculture, Hedysarum monoculture, Artemisia–Caragana mixture, Artemisia–Hedysarum mixture, Caragana–Hedysarum mixture, and Artemisia–Caragana–Hedysarum mixture), and communities subjected to two levels of wind exposure: shielded (by means of fencing) or exposed (no fencing). We measured total biomass per plot, competitive effects, and relative species abundance. Wind exposure did not significantly affect the total biomass of monocultures but increased their root weight ratio. However, wind exposure enhanced the total biomass of three-species mixtures but not two-species mixtures, and had no effects on root weight ratio of all mixtures. Wind exposed condition increased the competitive ability and relative abundance of Artemisia, decreased the competitive ability of Hedysarum but had no effects on its abundance, and did not affect the competitive ability of Caragana but decreased its abundance. These results suggest that chronic wind, as an environmental filter, can directly modulate plant communities through altering competitive outcomes and thus affect community functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aCaragana korshinskii 3aHedysarum 3abiomass 3adunes 3ainterspecific competition 3aplant communities 3ashrubs 3awind 0aCommunity composition 0aCompetitive outcomes 0aDryland 0aEnvironmental filtering1 aXi, W.M.1 aAnten, N.P.R.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2013 Mar., v. 90 p.69-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2012.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03800naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010000181300001400281500001500295520193500310592002802245650001702273650001202290650002502302650001202327650002802339650001902367650001202386650002002398650003202418650002002450650001202470650002402482650001402506650002102520650002502541650001602566650001802582650002002600650001902620650003602639650001302675650001602688650001202704650002502716653002002741653002602761653002002787653002402807653001702831653001902848653001602867700002702883700002702910700002302937773010702960856008603067852000903153655001203162IND60525882520221116162711.0190319e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052588252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2016.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoleimani Aghdam, Morteza10aAlleviation of postharvest chilling injury in anthurium cut flowers by salicylic acid treatment  ap. 70-76.  a2019-12-06  aDue to the sensitivity of anthurium flowers to chilling injury, its optimum temperature storage is 12.5–20°C. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during postharvest chilling stress leads to loss of membrane integrity which can be coincided with phenols oxidation by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, the enzyme responsible for browning. Higher phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity, the enzyme responsible for phenols accumulation, under chilling stress, can act as a defense mechanism overcome chilling stress. In this experiment, the impact of 0, 1, 2 and 4mM salicylic acid (SA) treatment applied by postharvest stem-end dipping (15min at 20°C) on chilling injury of Anthurium andraeanum cv. Sirion cut flowers storage at 4°C for 21 days were investigated. SA treatment delayed spathe browning and retards electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) increase. The SA treated anthurium cut flowers exhibited significantly higher PAL enzyme activity, associated with lower PPO activity, which were coincided with higher total phenol accumulation and higher DPPH scavenging activity during storage at 4°C for 21 days. Also, higher DPPH scavenging activity in anthurium cut flowers treated with SA can be results from higher antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity. Also, SA treatment enhanced endogenous proline and glycine betaine (GB) accumulation in anthurium cut flowers during storage at 4°C, which was coincided with higher spathe relative water content (RWC). These results suggested that SA treatment can be used as a useful technology for the alleviation of postharvest chilling injury in anthurium cut flowers by enhancing total phenol, proline, and GB accumulation coincide with enhancing antioxidant system activity leading to higher membrane integrity showed by lower electrolyte leakage and MDA content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3adipping 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aphenols 3areactive oxygen species 3asalicylic acid 3abetaine 3achilling injury 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3amalondialdehyde 3aproline 3astorage temperature 3aoxidation 3acatechol oxidase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acut flowers 3awater content 3aenzyme activity 3aacid treatment 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3acold stress 3aflowers 3aAnthurium andraeanum 0aChilling injury 0aAnthurium cut flowers 0aGlycine betaine 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aantioxidants 0aSalicylic acid 0aPostharvest1 aJannatizadeh, Abbasali1 aSheikh-Assadi, Morteza1 aMalekzadeh, Parviz0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 202 p.70-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2016.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245009600170520101400266592002801280650002001308650002701328651000901355700001901364773012901383856007501512852000901587655001201596IND60757935720221121124341.0211125e20211117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075793572DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132246202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarzanegan, Mohammad Reza10aLifting of International Sanctions and the Shadow Economy in Iran—A View from Outer Space  aWith the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2016, Iran experienced a short period without international sanctions which resulted in an annual increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) in the following two years. However, it was not just the formal economy that was affected by the sanctions. Previous studies have shown that sanctions can negatively affect the shadow (or informal) economy and may even have a larger impact on the informal economy than on the formal economy. Nighttime lights (NTL) data allow us to study shadow economy activities that are not reported in the official GDP. This study uses a panel of NTL (the DMSP/OLS and VIIRS/DNB harmonized dataset) from 1992 to 2018 for 31 Iranian provinces to investigate the association between the lifting of sanctions and the growth of the shadow economy. The empirical results suggest an increase in shadow economy activity with the lifting of sanctions while controlling for other drivers of informal activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3agross domestic product 3aIran1 aFischer, Sven 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 17, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132246203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010200181300001600283520044800299592002800747650001400775653000800789653000800797653002800805653003000833653002600863653001800889700001600907700002000923773009800943856008501041852000901126655001201135IND60628322320221121181653.0190129e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062832232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarasawa-Ohtashiro, Yukio10aAdmiration is a source of multiple equilibria and indeterminacy: A comment on Chen and Hsu (2007)  ap. 141-143.  aThe aim of this note is to revise and correct the properties of steady state(s) obtained in Chen and Hsu (2007).

We investigated the effect of sex on the nutritional value and chemical composition of the house cricket (Acheta domestica L.). Both sexes were rich in protein and lipids. The proximate composition was partly influenced by sex; females contained a significantly higher amount of lipids (18.3–21.7 vs 12.9–16.1 g/100 g dry matter, p = 0.0001) and fewer proteins than males (61.2–64.9 vs 66.3–69.6 g/100 g dry matter, p = 0.0001). Males contained more chitin (p = 0.0015) and nitrogen chains (p = 0.0003) than females. Only the ash (p = 0.4314) and nitrogen-free extract (p = 0.4871) were uninfluenced by sex. Furthermore, nutrient quality expressed as essential amino acid (72.3–77.1), thrombogenicity (1.22–1.45), and atherogenicity indices (0.53–0.58) did not differ between sexes (p > 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcheta domesticus 3aEuropean Union 3achitin 3aessential amino acids 3afemales 3ainsects 3alipids 3amales 3anitrogen 3anovel foods 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aproteins 3aproximate composition 0aInsects 0aNovel food 0aProtein 0aLipid 0aAmino acids 0aFatty acids 0aNutritional value1 aKouřimská, Lenka1 aPlachý, Vladimír1 aBožik, Matěj1 aAdámková, Anna1 aVrabec, Vladimír0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Jan. 30, v. 272 p.267-272dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01302naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005100171300001400222520043500236592002800671650001400699653000800713653000800721653000800729653002100737653002400758653002800782773009600810856008500906852000900991655001201000IND60628322720221121142638.0190129e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062832272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlunover, Doron12aA note on rent dissipation in lottery contests  ap. 90-93.  aRent dissipation is a measure of the social loss in rent-seeking contests and therefore is the main source of interest in the rent-seeking literature.

Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation among various variables using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Data were collected from the close-ended question questionnaires; sample size (n = 626). SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 22.0 for Windows were used as tools for analysis. The results are as follows: the perception of tourists on climate change exerts a significant positive effect on attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, which, in turn, exerts significant positive effects on climate change adaptation intentions. Furthermore, climate change adaptation intentions exert a significant positive influence on the behavioral patterns of PEB. Finally, political trust exerts a moderating effect on the relationship between subjective norms and climate change adaptation intentions and between perceived behavioral control and climate change adaptation intentions. Our findings indicate that it is necessary to encourage awareness of climate change, and that it is also very important to increase the value of political trust when making environmental policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aeducation 3aequations 3aforest recreation 3apolitics 3asample size 3aTaiwan1 aGuo, Hongyu,1 aChen, Han-Shen 0 tForests.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130914763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012700206300001200333520101200345592002801357596007601385650002001461650002501481650002201506650000901528650002301537650001701560650001001577650001601587650001501603650001401618650001501632650001301647650002401660651001001684700001901694700001601713700001401729700001701743700001601760700001201776773011701788856008301905852000901988655001201997IND60719685120221121063840.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071968512DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02694-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Si-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1452-129910aFirst report on the prevalence of Fasciola hepatica in the endangered Père David’s deer (Elaphurus davidianus) in China  ap. 473.  aBACKGROUND: Fasciola hepatica is an important zoonotic parasite that causes fasciolosis in a broad range of animals. No information is available about the prevalence of F. hepatica in Père David’s deer (Elaphurus davidianus), an endangered species in the world. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of fasciolosis in Père David’s deer in the Dafeng Elk National Natural Reserve, Jiangsu province, China. RESULTS: In this study, 142 fecal samples from Père David’s deer were analyzed for F. hepatica by microscopy and nest-PCR. Only one sample was positive for F. hepatica according to microscopy examination, while 18 of 142 (12.68, 95%CI: 2.841–22.45%) samples were positive for F. hepatica according to nest-PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of prevalence of F. hepatica in Père David’s deer. The prevalence data indicated that F. hepatica was also present in this endangered animal, which may cause a potential threat to this precious species.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0501200cJiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program 3aAnemone (plant) 3aElaphurus davidianus 3aFasciola hepatica 3aelks 3aendangered species 3afascioliasis 3afeces 3ainformation 3amicroscopy 3aparasites 3aprevalence 3asampling 3aveterinary medicine 3aChina1 aGong, Jing-Zhi1 aRen, Yi-Jun1 aPan, Ming1 aCai, Wei-Min1 aFan, Yi-Min1 aYao, Na0 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.473-473dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02694-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002100097024005100118040001800169100002000187245006900207300001600276500000900292520148100301592002801782650001601810650001401826650001701840650001501857650002001872650002401892651000901916700001601925700001901941700001801960773012201978852000902100856011202109856009802221961001302319655001202332991618570750742620221121000223.0191122e198709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870790062DNAL7 a10113/327672hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci1987.0011183X002700050020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWehrmann, V.

Merr.] cultivars. This study was conducted to evaluate a backcross strategy for transferring genes for high seed protein from a low-yielding plant introduction to high-yielding lines with a average protein content. Pando, a plant introduction with low yield and about 480 g kg⁻¹ of seed protein was crossed to three high-yielding lines with an average protein content about 400 g kg⁻¹. Selection for high protein was practiced between two generations of backcrossing to the high-yielding parent. After two backcrosses, 95 random BC₂F₂-derived lines from each population were evaluated for seed yield, protein, and oil content in Iowa. None of the BC₂F₂-derived lines equaled the protein content of Pando, but an average of 72% of the lines from the three populations had significantly higher protein than the recurrent parent. On average, about 19% of the BC₂F₂-derived lines with a protein content significantly different (α = 0.05) from the recurrent parent in seed yield. The results indicated that when a low-yielding, high-protein donor parent is utilized. selection for high protein between two backcross generations would effectively increase the seed protein in the backcross progeny above that of the high-yielding recurrent parent and still result in some progeny having a seed yield not significantly different from that parent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3acultivars 3abackcrossing 3acrop yield 3aprotein content 3arecurrent selection 3aIowa1 aFehr, W.

However, in certain areas river discharges play also a principal role. The exploitation of the hydrokinetic resource in such areas has its own peculiarities, dictated by the combined influence of the two driving agents. The objective of this paper is to investigate the exploitation of hydrokinetic energy in the Miño Estuary, the largest estuary in NW Spain and N Portugal, with a focus on the site-specific performance of hydrokinetic energy converters (HECs) and its intra-annual variability. A state-of-the-art hydrodynamics numerical model is implemented and successfully validated based on field data. A third-generation HEC—to be more specific, the new Smart Freestream Turbine (SFT)—is considered, and its performance at the location with the greatest potential is assessed by means of: (i) site-specific efficiency, (ii) availability factor, and (iii) capacity factor. We find that, whereas the site-specific efficiency does not vary significantly, the availability and capacity factors do experience substantial intra-annual (seasonal) variability. In summer and autumn, river discharges are low, and the tide dominates the hydrokinetic resource. In contrast, during winter and spring, the river discharges significantly contribute to the resource, leading to a considerable increase in the availability and capacity factors. More generally, the results imply that in areas subject to combined fluvial and tidal influences the performance of HECs may depart significantly from that in tide-dominated areas, and this departure must be carefully weighed in assessing a project.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3aenergy conversion 3aestuaries 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydroelectric power 3amathematical models 3ariver flow 3arivers 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aHydrokinetic energy 0aTidal stream energy 0aRiver discharge 0aSeasonal variability 0aHydrokinetic energy converter1 aCarballo, R.1 aRamos, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5507-09951 aIglesias, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2719-16630 tRenewable energy.g2019 Dec., v. 143 p.558-568dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05492naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009500171300001600266520350200282592002803784650003503812650001703847650001203864650001203876650001303888650001103901650001103912650002003923650002803943650000803971650000903979650000903988650001403997650001104011650001804022650001404040650000704054650000904061650001304070650001304083650001104096650001104107650000904118651001504127653001704142653001304159653003604172653002304208653001404231653001404245700006304259700002404322700002704346700005804373700002804431700002004459700001904479700002704498700002304525700006004548773009104608856008604699852000904785655001204794IND60628972920221120104258.0190404e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062897292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWuttig, Kathrin10aCritical evaluation of a seaFAST system for the analysis of trace metals in marine samples  ap. 653-668.  aA seawater preconcentration system (seaFAST) with offline sector-field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) detection was critically evaluated for ultra-low trace elemental analysis of Southern Ocean samples over a four-year period (2015–2018). The commercially available system employs two Nobias PA1 resin columns for buffer cleaning and sample preconcentration, allowing salt matrix removal with simultaneous extraction of a range of trace elements. With a primary focus on method simplicity and practicality, a range of experimental parameters relevant to oceanographic analysis were considered, including reduction of blank levels (over weeks and years), instrument conditioning, extraction efficiencies over different pH ranges (5.8–6.4), and preconcentration factors (~10–70 times). Conditions were optimised for the analysis of ten important trace elements (Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ga, Mn, Ni, Pb, Ti and Zn) in open ocean seawater samples, and included initial pre-cleaning and conditioning of the seaFAST unit for one week before each separate analytical sequence; a controlled narrow buffer pH of 6.20 ± 0.02 used for extraction; and a sample preconcentration factor of 10 for (relatively) concentrated rainwater or sea ice, 40 for typical seawater samples, and up to 67 times for seawater samples collected in the remote open ocean such as the Southern Ocean.Method accuracy (both short – days to weeks - and long term – months to years) were evaluated through extensive analysis of a range of oceanographic standard reference samples including SAFe D1 (n = 20), D2 (n = 3), S (n = 15), GEOTRACES GD (n = 6), GSC (n = 42) and GSP (n = 42), as well as NASS-6 (n = 6). Measured values for oceanographic samples were found to agree with consensus values to within ± 6% for Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn. Offsets were noted for Co (labile fraction only; no UV oxidation), Mn (difference also noted in other recent studies) and Ti (limited reference values). No consensus values currently exist for Ga. Iron and Mn in Southern Ocean samples were also independently verified via flow injection analysis methods (R2 = 0.95, n = 244 (Fe) and 0.92, n = 85 (Mn), paired t-test, p ≪0.05). Precisions over four years were evaluated through analysis of community seawater samples as well as a range of bulk in-house seawaters (3 sources, each n~100) and acid blanks (n = 250), and were typically found to be within 5–8%, depending on analyte and concentration.Values presented here represent one of the largest independent data sets for these reference samples, as well as the most documented comprehensive suite of GSP and GSC values currently available (consensus values have not yet been released). Samples covering a range of salinities (0–60) were investigated to demonstrate method versatility, with excellent recoveries noted using the seaFAST Nobias PA1 column (>98% for most elements, with 70–80% for Ga and Ti). By way of example, data is presented showing the application of the method to samples collected on the Kerguelen plateau in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (HEOBI voyage, January-February 2016) and in land-fast ice and brine collected near Davis station, Antarctica, in austral summer 2015 (with a salinity range from 0 to 73 g kg−1). Finally, a range of recommendations for successful implementation of a seaFAST system are provided, along with considerations for future investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abuffer index 3abuffers 3acadmium 3acleaning 3acobalt 3acopper 3adata collection 3aflow injection analysis 3aice 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3anormal values 3aoxidation 3apH 3arain 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asummer 3at-test 3azinc 3aAntarctica 0aTrace metals 0aSeawater 0aSeaFAST preconcentration system 0aSea ice and brines 0aSF-ICP-MS 0aGEOTRACES1 aTownsend, Ashley T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2972-26781 avan der Merwe, Pier1 aGault-Ringold, Melanie1 aHolmes, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8061-43251 aSchallenberg, Christina1 aLatour, Pauline1 aTonnard, Manon1 aRijkenberg, Micha J.A.1 aLannuzel, Delphine1 aBowie, Andrew R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5144-77990 tTalanta.g2019 May 15, v. 197 p.653-668dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245010500180300001600285520086500301592002801166650001801194650003501212650001501247650002001262650001501282650001001297650002201307650001101329650003901340650002501379650001101404650002701415653001101442653003001453653002501483653002501508700002001533700002401553773012501577856005101702852000901753655001201762IND50085902320221120054234.0140412e20110318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008590232DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2011.5442302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlerena-Suster, Carlos R.10aSODIUM TETRATHIONATE EFFECT ON PAPAIN PURIFICATION FROM DIFFERENT Carica papaya LATEX CRUDE EXTRACTS  ap. 107-121.  aPapain from latex of Carica papaya was purified up to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry homogeneity by salt precipitation from two different crude extract sources: a refined preparation obtained in our laboratory and a commercial one.

The anti-hyperuricemic function of tuna flesh hydrolysate (TPH) produced using Alcalase 2.4L was confirmed in potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemic rats. TPH was separated using 80 wt% aqueous ethanol. The ethanol-soluble fraction (ESF) abundant in small peptides (<1000 Da) afforded the highest XO inhibition. Separation of ESF by Sephadex G-15 and UPLC/MS/MS revealed 13 di-/tri-peptides (12 are newly identified XO inhibitors). Their XO inhibitory activities were assessed using corresponding synthetic peptides via an improved HPLC method. Results indicate that Phe-containing peptides were more potent XO inhibitors than Trp-containing peptides, with Phe-His having the highest XO inhibitory activity (IC₅₀ = 25.7 mM). Molecular docking studies revealed the importance of two hydrogen bonds and one π-π stacking interaction with Phe-914 in XO for XO-peptide inhibitor binding. Phe-containing di-/tri-peptides could be potent XO inhibitors against hyperuricemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme inhibition 3aethanol 3afoods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysates 3ahyperuricemia 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amolecular models 3apotassium 3aprotein hydrolysates 3arats 3asubtilisin 3asynthetic peptides 3atuna 3axanthine oxidase 0aHyperuricemic mice 0aXanthine oxidase inhibition 0aStructure–activity relationship 0aDi-/tri-peptide 0aMolecular docking1 aSu, Guowan1 aSun-Waterhouse, Dongxiao1 aWaterhouse, Geoffrey I.N.1 aZhao, Mouming1 aLiu, Yang0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Jan. 30, v. 272 p.453-461dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005700170300001600227520064700243592002800890650002300918650001100941653000800952653000800960653002400968653001100992653001701003773009801020856008501118852000901203655001201212IND60628323320221120050935.0190129e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062832332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.04.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStahl, Dale O.10aBoundedly rational search with positive search costs  ap. 138-140.  aThere is substantial evidence that humans make mistakes, and that this deviation from perfect rationality can have profound behavioral consequences. Since search theory plays a central role in economic models, it is imperative that the consequences of bounded rationality for search be studied. In this paper, worker bounded rationality is modeled as probabilistic choice, while employers are assumed to be perfectly rational. We find that worker welfare is non-monotonic in the precision of the workers. Offers are higher, and workers are better off with moderate levels of precision than with very low or with very high levels of precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3ahumans 0aD01 0aD83 0aBounded rationality 0aSearch 0aLabor market0 tEconomics letters.g2018 July, v. 168 p.138-140dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2018.04.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013900168300001600307520130800323592002801631650004401659650003701703650001901740650002201759650002001781650002201801650004101823650000901864650001701873650001901890650001301909650002701922653001001949653000701959653000901966653000801975653000901983653001001992653000702002653000702009653001002016653000902026653000702035653000802042653000802050653000902058653000802067653000902075653000802084653000902092653000902101653000802110653001802118653001102136653000802147653001302155653001602168653002702184653002702211653003002238653005602268700001702324700001702341700002002358700002002378773009102398856008602489852000902575655001202584IND60628973120221120104104.0190404e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062897312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyunsuk10aSolid-phase extraction of nerve agent degradation products using poly[(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)trimethylammonium chloride] thin films  ap. 500-508.  aIn this study, a simple solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique was developed to extract organophosphonic acids as degradation products of nerve agents from aqueous samples for identification by instrumental analyses such as FT-IR, TOF-SIMs and GC-MS. To selectively extract the organophosphonic acids, we synthesized an anion exchange polymer film on a gold plate using surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization with 2-[(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride. Extraction of the organophosphonic acids onto the plates was successfully confirmed by polarized angle fourier transformation-infra red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses. The limit of detection of the developed SPE method satisfied the detection limit of Chemical Warfare Agents verification criteria by FT-IR analysis. After optimization, the detection limit values were found to be between 0.1 and 0.4 µg mL−1, and the recovery ranged from 50% to 110% in aqueous solution containing various interference. In addition, the SPE process was successfully applied to the detection of pinacolyl methylphosphonic acid, the degradation product of soman, in the 35th Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons proficiency test sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanion exchange 3aaqueous solutions 3adetection limit 3afilms (materials) 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agold 3anerve agents 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asolid phase extraction 0aBSTFA 0aCE 0aCMPA 0aDSA 0aEMPA 0aFT-IR 0aIC 0aGC 0aGC-MS 0aIMPA 0aLC 0aLOD 0aMCT 0aMETA 0aMPA 0aOPCW 0aPEG 0aPMPA 0aSAGA 0aSAM 0aSI-ARGET ATRP 0aSI-CRP 0aSPE 0aToF-SIMS 0aNerve agent 0aChemical warfare agent 0aSolid-phase extraction 0aSurface functionalization 0aSurface-initiated controlled radical polymerization1 aYi, Pong-su,1 aLee, Yonghan1 aLee, Jungkyu K.1 aChoi, Insung S.0 tTalanta.g2019 May 15, v. 197 p.500-508dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007500174300001600249520119100265592002801456650002301484650002501507650001501532650001301547650002301560650003001583650002701613650002501640650002801665653002301693653002201716653003001738653001601768653002001784700003301804700003001837700002401867773010901891856008602000852000902086655001202095IND60525883320221116162631.0190319e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052588332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2016.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Eugenia A.10aQTLs detection and mapping for yield-related traits in globe artichoke  ap. 156-164.  aThe genetic basis of yield-related traits in Cynara cardunculus L. was studied in a F1 population derived from an inter-botanical varietal cross between wild cardoon and “Estrella del Sur FCA” globe artichoke. The aim of this work was identify and localize QTLs (Quantitative Trait Loci) associated with yield-related traits as a first step to marker-assisted selection. Sixty-eight polymorphic markers (SSR) were used to analyze the segregating population by ANOVA approach. A second analysis based in previous linkage maps of the species was conducted in two seasons by SIM (Simple Interval Mapping) procedure. A total of 66 QTLs associated with seven morphological traits were detected and mapped in the first evaluated season, of these 42 were validated among both seasons. All QTLs identified are major QTLs (explain >10% of phenotypic variation) and 27 of these are responsible for >20% of phenotypic variation. This work represents an initial platform for the dissection of a complex trait, such as yield in the species. Although the QTLs detected need to be more precisely mapped, they will be targets in breeding programs of globe artichoke to improve yield-related traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynara cardunculus 3aanalysis of variance 3aartichokes 3acardoons 3achromosome mapping 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 0aCynara cardunculus 0aMolecular markers 0aQuantitative traits locus 0aLinkage map 0aHead production1 aCravero, V.

The socio-psychological measures were constructed from quality of life domains taken from selected years of the General Social Surveys [General Social Surveys, 1972-1993: Cumulative Code Book. Principal Investigator, James A. Davis; Director and Co-Principal Investigator, Tom W. Smith--Chicago: National Opinion Research Center, 1993. (National Data Program for the Social Sciences Series, no. 13).]. The Quality of Life Indices (QLI) indices are regressed on selected socio-demographic variables using quadratic, Cobb-Douglas, square root, and semilog functional forms. QLI is much influenced by income, education, and health. As measured here, QLI is not much influenced by year of measurement, sector, or by region of residence. Much variability in the QLI is unique to individuals, and our results are suited to predict group, rather than individual well-being. Practitioners computing the benefit-cost ratio for a public program, project, or policy can weight dollars by income groups with marginal utilities derived from this study. That methodology will matter: even the 'conservative' quadratic equation indicates that the marginal utility of income (MUI) for families with very low incomes is half as large as for families with median incomes. 3aquality of life 3asocial welfare 3awelfare economics 3ademography 3apsychosocial factors 3aequations 3autility functions 3aincome 0acobb-douglas functions 0aaggregate data 0afactor analysis 0amarginal analysis 0aquadratic functions 0asemilog equations 0asquare root functions1 aTweeten, L.0 tAgricultural economics.g1997 Aug., v. 16, no. 3 p.155-169aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle03384naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008500145300001600230500002400246520190300270650002102173650002602194650001602220650001302236650001602249650001502265650001102280650001102291650001602302650003002318650001202348650004402360650003602404650004202440650002302482650006102505650003702566650002002603650000902623650002202632650001702654650001002671700001602681700001502697700002002712773013702732852000902869655001202878IND4464289620221120062803.0121010s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446428962DNAL7 a126616452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, M.S.10aStrategies to reduce feedlot cattle heat stress: Effects on tympanic temperature  ap. 649-661.  aIncludes references  aThree experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of different management strategies on body temperature of feedlot steers finished in the summer months. In Exp. 1, 24 crossbred steers were chosen to assess the effect of altered feed intake and feeding time on tympanic temperature (TT) response. Managed feeding (MF) treatments were applied for 22 d only and provided 1) ad libitum access to feed at 0800 (ADLIB), 2) feed at 1600 with amount adjusted so that no feed was available at 0800 (BKMGT), 3) feed at 1600 at 85% of predicted ad libitum levels (LIMFD). During heat stress conditions on d 20 to 22 of MF, LIMFD and BKMGT had lower (P < 0.05) TT than ADLIB from 2100 through 2400. A carryover effect of limit-feeding was evident during a severe heat episode (d 36 to 38) with LIMFD steers having lower (P < 0.05) TT than ADLIB. In Exp. 2, TT were obtained from 24 crossbred steers assigned to three treatments, consisting of no water application (CON), water applied to feedlot mound surfaces from 1000 to 1200 (AM) or 1400 to 1600 (PM). From 2200 to 0900 and 1200 to 1400, steers assigned to morning sprinkling treatment had lower (P < 0.05) TT than steers assigned to afternoon sprinkling treatment. In Exp. 3, 24 steers were utilized in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with factors of feeding time [0800 (AMF) and 1400 (PMF)] and sprinkling (WET and DRY). Tympanic temperatures were monitored under hot environmental conditions on d 30 to 32 and 61 to 62. A feeding time × sprinkling interaction (P < 0.001) was evident on d 30 to 32, although AMF/DRY steers had the highest (P < 0.05) TT. On d 61 to 62, TT of PMF steers was higher (P < 0.05) than AMF between 1500 to 1800. Use of sprinklers can effectively reduce TT of feedlot cattle, whereas shifting to an afternoon vs morning feeding time was most beneficial when bunks were empty several hours prior to feeding. 3abody temperature 3aenvironmental factors 3afeed intake 3afeedlots 3aheat stress 3asprinklers 3asteers 3asummer 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperature Regulationxphysiology 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCattle Diseasesxprevention & control 2aEatingxphysiology 2aHeat Stress Disordersxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aHot Temperaturexadverse effects 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 2aWater1 aMader, T.L.1 aHolt, S.M.1 aParkhurst, A.M.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.649-661dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001800162245015500180300001600335520154300351650003701894650002901931650001501960650001401975650001001989650001601999650002302015650001002038650001002048651001002058700001402068700001402082700001502096773008702111852000902198856008502207930003302292945002502325946001102350655001202361IND4368087620221120053708.0050331e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436808762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-004-0728-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Counts of >10(5) cells g(-1) were recorded in root and stem samples. The leaves contained a smaller population (<10(3) g(-1)). The typical dark-orange colonies which developed on LGIP agar plates were purified. Identification was performed with the API microtube systems: API 20E for Enterobacteriaceae and API 20NE for non-Enterobacteriaceae. API profiles of the local isolates were closely related to those of the type culture Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus (ATTC 49037). The isolates successfully reduced C2H2 and produced appreciable amounts of ethylene in the presence of cane juice. This suggested that the local isolates are closely related to the type strain G. diazotrophicus. Wheat seedlings were inoculated with a number of isolates under gnotobiotic conditions. Both optical and scanning electron microscopy showed that endophytic Gluconacetobacter spp. were present in all the samples tested. They were observed in apparently intact and enlarged epidermal root cells, and also in stem tissues, indicating that the bacterium was able to migrate upward into the shoot tissues. Although Gluconacetobacter inoculation did not stimulate the growth of the cereal plant, the results obtained are particularly interesting because this bacterial species was capable of colonizing the internal tissues of wheat, not considered a natural host until now. 3aGluconacetobacter diazotrophicus 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aendophytes 3asugarcane 3awheat 3ahost plants 3acolonizing ability 3aroots 3astems 3aEgypt1 aFayez, M.1 aMonib, M.1 aHegazi, N.0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2004 May, v. 39, no. 6 p.391-397x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-004-0728-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20050816b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/06/13  aNon-US 7aarticle01726naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008200128300001600210520061100226650001600837650002500853650002400878650001800902650002000920650001600940650002300956650002000979650002500999650001701024650002301041650001901064651001101083653001801094700002101112773012901133852000901262930003301271945001301304946001101317655001201328IND2054668520221120053659.0961228e199602  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205466852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeinerman, E.10aIntroducing socioeconomic characteristics into production analysis under risk  ap. 149-161.  aA theoretical framework is developed to study the effects of socioeconomic factors on farmers' risk attitudes and production decisions. No maintained assumptions about the individual's utility are required. A key element in this framework is the categorization of socioeconomic factors by their effect on the farmer's risk attitudes. A simple methodology for this categorization, based on the equivalence between the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion and the probability of winning demanded, is proposed.

  1 aRovira, Pablo J.10aMicrobial Populations on Hides of Grazing Steers in a Forage-Based Production System in Uruguay  ap. 1919-1921.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of the study was to evaluate the microbiological status of hides of grazing steers in a typical forage-based system in Uruguay. The study was conducted on a single farm with samples taken on 3 days during the spring of 2007. Four anatomical hide sites (perineum area, flank, back, and shoulder) of 10 steers were individually swabbed each sampling day at the farm environment (n = 120). Each sample was analyzed by the Laboratorio Tecnológico del Uruguay for aerobic plate counts (APC), total coliform counts (TCC), and Escherichia coli counts (ECC). Mean log values for APC, TCC, and ECC on external animal hide surfaces, across all sampling sites, were 5.52, 1.89, and 1.70 log CFU/cm2, respectively. There were no significant differences among bacterial counts from the four hide surface locations. Mean log values for APC, TCC, and ECC were 1.49, 1.15, and 1.12 log CFU/cm2 lower, respectively, on sampling day 2 than on sampling day 3. Microbial populations on hides of grazing steers are highly variable and dependent on climatic and environmental conditions. To our knowledge this is the first study published evaluating the hygienic conditions of grazing livestock operations in Uruguay and their potential implications on the red meat chain. 3acoliform bacteria 3abacterial contamination 3amicrobial load 3acattle feeding 3ahides and skins 3aindicator species 3agrazing 3abeef cattle 3aplate count 3asteers 3aforage 3afood pathogens 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aaerobes 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBacteria, Aerobicxisolation & purification 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnterobacteriaceaexisolation & purification 2aEscherichia colixisolation & purification 2aMale 2aPoaceae 2aSkinxmicrobiology 3aUruguay 0aUruguay 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aVelazco, José I.0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 Sept., v. 71, no. 9 p.1919-1921x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20081027b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/24  aOther US 7aarticle02996naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002400146245007600170300001800246500001500264520112500279650002201404650001001426650002201436650002601458650001901484650001601503650002701519650002301546650001801569650002601587650001601613650002401629650002701653650001101680650005001691650002801741650003301769650002201802650002501824650001101849650002501860650002001885650003201905650005601937650002401993651001302017651001302030653002102043653001902064700002502083700002302108700002802131700002002159773008702179852000902266930003302275945002502308946001302333655001202346IND4410602820221120053647.0080926e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441060282DNAL7 a188108822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPoapolathep, Amnart10aDetection of Deoxynivalenol Contamination in Wheat Products in Thailand  ap. 1931-1933.  a2019-12-04  aA total of ninety samples in three kinds of wheat products (30 noodle, 30 bread, and 30 cereal samples) were collected from the supermarkets in Bangkok, Thailand, from February to April 2007. The occurrence of deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination in wheat products was investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a UV light detector. The extraction method was performed using a multifunctional cleanup column. The limit of quantification was 0.10 μg x g-1 from the range obtained in a linear calibration. The survey found almost 94% of the DON-contaminated samples below 1 μg x g-1, which corresponds to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory level. DON was detected in 18.9% (17 of 90) of all samples, in 6.67% (2 of 30) and 16.67% (5 of 30) of noodle and bread samples at levels from 0.17 to 0.35 and 0.14 to 1.13 μg x g-1, respectively, while it was in 33.33% (10 of 30) of cereal samples at levels from 0.13 to 0.39 μg x g-1. The results suggest that the exposure to DON from the consumption of wheat products, especially noodles, bread, and cereal, is at a very low risk level. 3afood intoxication 3apasta 3atoxigenic strains 3aquantitative analysis 3adeoxynivalenol 3awheat flour 3amaximum residue limits 3afood contamination 3amolds (fungi) 3asecondary metabolites 3afood grains 3amicrobial detection 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3abreads 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aFusariumxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aRisk Assessment 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTrichothecenesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aTriticumxchemistry 3aThailand 0aThailand 0atoxic substances 0awheat products1 aPoapolathep, Saranya1 aKlangkaew, Narumol1 aSugita-Konishi, Yoshiko1 aKumagai, Susumu0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 Sept., v. 71, no. 9 p.1931-1933x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20081027b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/24  aOther US 7aarticle02808naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001500162245010600177300001600283500001500299520149800314650002001812650001501832650002401847650001401871650001901885650001501904650001501919650003001934650002301964650002101987650001502008650002402023650001402047653002402061653002602085773008802111852000902199856008502208930003302293945002502326946001102351655001202362IND4366257620221120040937.0041228e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436625762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-004-0782-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The intestinal content of Collembola arising from cultures on different soil types was observed, and two experimental cultures of H. nitidus were run: (1) a culture performed on an inert substrate supplied either with earthworm casts or with soil as food resource, (2) an experiment using microcosms with cores of two humus forms (moder and calcic mull), in the presence or absence of earthworms. The observation of gut contents revealed that H. nitidus feeds on excrements, the composition of which (ratio organic matter/mineral matter) varies according to the humus form where it lived. Slightly aged (10-15 days) organo-mineral casts of earthworms appeared to be a better food than calcic mull aggregates or organic material from moder. Densities of H. nitidus cultured in cores of calcic mull were higher than in moder, except when cores of moder were inhabited by an anecic earthworm for 2 months. The humus form strongly influenced populations of H. nitidus, firstly because densities of predators were higher in moder than in calcic mull, and probably also because of soil macroporosity. It was concluded that earthworms would affect predation on H. nitidus by creating a network of interconnected macropores in which Collembola can move and find shelter. 3asoil arthropods 3aCollembola 3asoil organic matter 3apredators 3asoil structure 3aworm casts 3asoil types 3ainterspecific competition 3apopulation density 3afeeding behavior 3aearthworms 3apopulation dynamics 3aexcretion 0aHeteromurus nitidus 0atrophic relationships0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2004 Oct., v. 40, no. 5 p.323-333x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-004-0782-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050217b20050301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02687naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007600173300001600249520151300265650001101778650001501789650002801804650001201832650000901844650002001853650001601873650001501889653001501904653001601919653001701935700002201952700002101974700002501995773014002020852000902160856007602169930003302245946001102278655001202289IND4383297220221120032444.0060903e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438329722DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0765.2006.00080.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHANAYAMA, Susumu10aEffect of vegetation on the convection of ponded water in a paddy field  ap. 579-583.  aTo investigate the effect of vegetation on the convection of ponded water in a paddy field, the temperature profile of ponded water and the amount and spectral energy distribution of solar radiation were measured using lysimeters located in plots with and without dense paddy rice vegetation. In the vegetated plot, the water-surface temperature was higher than that of the soil surface in the daytime, and the temperature difference reached a maximum of 1.7°C at approximately 12:00 hours, indicating no convection of ponded water. However, when the amount of solar radiation in the unvegetated plot was experimentally reduced to vegetated-plot levels using shade cloth, the temperature difference between the water and soil surfaces was approximately 0°C in the daytime, indicating that convection had occurred. In the shaded unvegetated plot, the amount of visible radiation 10 cm above the water surface was greater than that of near-infrared radiation. However, in the vegetated plot, the amount of visible radiation was lower than that of near-infrared radiation. Visible radiation passes through ponded water and increases the soil-surface temperature. In contrast, near-infrared radiation is absorbed at the water surface and increases the water-surface temperature. The reduction of visible radiation by vegetation affects the temperature profile in ponded water. Thus, vegetation altered the spectral energy distribution of solar radiation, reducing the convection of ponded water during the day. 3aenergy 3alysimeters 3anear infrared radiation 3apaddies 3arice 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3avegetation 0aconvection 0apaddy field 0aponded water1 aNATSUGA, Motoyasu1 aANNAKA, Takeyuki1 aKasubuchi, Tatsuaki.0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2006 Oct., v. 52, no. 5 p.579-583dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0038-07687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0765.2006.00080.x3electronic resource  a20060903b20061003c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01965naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245015500157300001800312520075800330650000801088650001501096650003301111650001301144650001301157650002101170650001501191650001301206650002201219650002101241650001601262700001601278700002101294700002201315773014201337852000901479856007801488946001301566655001201579IND4442124820221120023605.0100903e20101001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444212482DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.242022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuda, Hitoshi10aPoly(arylene thioether)s containing 9,9′-spirobifluorene moieties in the main chain: Masked dithiol-based synthesis and excellent optical properties  ap. 4192-4199.  aPoly(arylene thioether)s (PTEs) containing 9,9′-spirobifluorene moieties were synthesized in high yields from 9,9′-spirobifluorene-2,2′-bis(N,N-dimethylcarbamothioate) 4 as the masked dithiol and various difluoroarenes as electrophilic monomers.

For their synthesis, a preferential route has involved in the successive sol-gel process of acrylate trialkoxysilane precursors followed by radical photopolymerization. In contrast, this work presents an original one-step synthesis based on the association of two different photoinitiators (PIs) in the same formulation: the photolysis of a hydroxyphenylketone (radical PI) affords polyacrylate chains while that of a diaryl iodonium salt (cationic PI) generates powerful superacids catalyzing the sol-gel reactions of the alkoxy functions. The behavior of methacrylate and acrylate trimethoxysilane precursors was compared to highlight the effect of the organic moiety functionality on the reaction kinetics (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and the film microstructure (¹³C and ²⁹Si solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance). Interestingly, evidence of local organization in these hybrid films was also given by X-ray analysis. In a last part, their thermomechanical properties were discussed thoroughly using a range of techniques: DSC, scratch-resistance test, nanoindentation. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3acoatings 3afilms (materials) 3amicrostructure 3ananocomposites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotolysis 3apolymers 3areaction kinetics 3asol-gel processing1 aChemtob, Abraham1 aCroutxé-Barghorn, Céline1 aRigolet, Séverinne1 aLe Houérou, Vincent1 aGauthier, Christian0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Oct. 01, v. 48, no. 19 p.4150-4158dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.241823Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02177naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245013400155300001800289520094300307650000801250650001501258650001101273650002301284650001701307650001801324650001601342650002301358650002101381650001901402650001701421700001801438700001601456700001701472700002001489700001601509773014201525852000901667856007801676946001301754655001201767IND4442124520221120022512.0100903e20101001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444212452DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.241972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Wennan10aSynthesis of cationic diacetylene-co-carbazole-co-fluorene polymers and their sensitive fluorescent quenching properties with DNA  ap. 4168-4177.  aTwo neutral precursor conjugated copolymers based 2,7-diethynylfluorene and 3,6-diethynylcarbazole units in the main chain (PFC and PF2C) were prepared by Hay coupling polymerization.

For comparison, neutral conjugated homopolymers of 2,7-diethynylfluorene (PF), 3,6-diethynylcarbazole units (PC) and their cationic polymers (CPF and CPC) were also prepared with the same method. A comparative study on the optical properties of cationic polymers CPFC and CPF2C in DMF and DMF/H₂O showed that they underwent water-induced aggregation. The spectral behaviors of CPFC and CPF2C with calf thymus DNA showed that a distinct fluorescent quenching took place with minute addition of CT DNA (3.3 x 10⁻¹³ M).

When nest relocation becomes necessary, it is important to efficiently evaluate alternative nest sites to choose the one most suitable under current conditions. However, if time is limiting, species may experience a speed-versus-accuracy trade-off when searching for a new home. We examined nest site selection under duress (in the form of flooding) in two species of ants: Linepithema humile and Tapinoma sessile. We predicted that if ants are able to assess and evacuate to the most suitable location, colonies should move to higher elevation, relative to their current nest site, in response to flooding. To test for a speed-versus-accuracy trade-off, we presented colonies with new nest chambers that were either higher, lower, or at the same height as their current nest and examined if their ability to efficiently choose a new site was influenced by the rate of flooding. When flooding rates were slow, both species favored the highest nest site and nearly always moved their entire nest to the same chamber. However, when the rate of flooding was doubled, colonies of T. sessile less often chose the highest nest site and were also more likely to split their nests between two of the available chambers. These results demonstrate a trade-off between speed and accuracy in nest site selection for odorous house ants, while L. humile retained their ability to adequately assess new nest sites under the conditions we presented. These patterns may arise from differences in exploratory behavior and activity between the two species. Despite having identical colony sizes, L. humile had approximately ten times more workers exploring the alternate nest sites 30 min into the experiment than did T. sessile. 3aLinepithema humile 3aTapinoma sessile 3anesting sites 3anests1 aSuarez, A.

Data from 4,262 purebred animals and 577 sires having complete three-generation pedigrees from the 1991 to 2001 National Barrow Show Progeny Tests were utilized in this study. Existing loin muscle pH data were converted to their original H+. Numerical changes in values occurred across all fixed effects and in the case of breed and test, changes in differences among subclasses occurred. These changes may result in differing inferences that can be made depending on whether pH or H+ is used as the dependent variable. Heritability estimates for pH and H+ were 0.52 ± 0.074 and 0.62 ± 0.078, respectively. The Pearson correlation between pH and H+ breeding values was −0.92. Spearman Rank correlation of −0.91 between pH and H+ breeding values was calculated and indicates that sires do not rank the same when ordered by breeding values for each trait. When pH is the selection objective, the selection differential reduction in H+ from these data ranges from 3.8 to 9.1%. Additionally, only 77.7% of the estimated genetic progress per generation in H+ is realized when selection (5% selected) is based on pH. The genetic correlation between pH and H+ was −0.96. Changes in the absolute values of the genetic correlations between various pork quality indicator traits and pH or H+ concentration were 0.04 or less. Differences in pH and H+ results could impact decisions made by swine breeders and meat processors who are concerned about pork quality. This, combined with the greater heritability and biochemical reality for H+, indicates that H+ rather than pH is the more appropriate trait breeders and processors should focus on when attempting to improve pork quality. 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic merit 3aheritability 3ameat 3ameat quality 3apH 3apedigree 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3aprotons 3apurebreds 3asires 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethods 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMeatxanalysisxstandards. 2aModels, Genetic 2aModels, Theoretical 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSwinexgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aSaxton, A.M.1 aMiller, R.K.1 aGoodwin, R.N.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.611-616dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245019400156300001800350520143900368650002201807650001301829650002501842650002301867650003801890650001401928650001001942650002301952650003301975650004402008650002302052650002402075650002202099650002102121700001802142700001902160700001802179773014202197852000902339856007802348946001302426655001202439IND4442126120221117160210.0100903e20101001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444212612DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.242202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErol, Ibrahim10aSynthesis and characterization of novel methacrylate copolymers based on sulfonamide and coumarine: Monomer reactivity ratios, biological activity, thermal stability, and optical properties  ap. 4323-4334.  aThe free radical copolymerization of 2-oxo-2-[(4-sulfamoylphenyl)amino]ethyl-2-methylpropenoate (SAEMA) with 4-methyl-2-oxo-2H-chromen-7-yl-2-methylpropenoate (MCMA) has been carried out in 1, 4-dioxane at 65 °C ± 1 °C and the copolymers were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared, ¹H-NMR, ¹³C-NMR and gel permeation chromatography. ¹H-NMR and elemental analysis was used to determine the molar fractions of SAEMA and MCMA in the copolymers. The monomer-reactivity ratios were calculated according to the general copolymerization equation using Kelen-Tüdõs and Fineman-Ross linearization methods. The reactivity ratios indicated a tendency toward random copolymerization. The polydispersity indices of the polymers, determined with gel permeation chromatography, suggested a strong tendency for chain termination by disproportionation. The thermal behaviors of copolymers with various compositions were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The glass-transition temperature of the copolymers increased with increasing MCMA content in the copolymers. Also, the apparent thermal decomposition activation energies were calculated by the Ozawa method with a Shimadzu TGA 60 thermogravimetric analysis thermobalance. All the products showed moderate activity against different strains of bacteria and fungi. The photochemical properties of the polymers were investigated by UV spectra. 3aactivation energy 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aequations 3afungi 3agel chromatography 3aglass transition temperature 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoptical properties 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aSanli, Gülay1 aDİlek, Meltem1 aOzcan, Levent0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Oct. 01, v. 48, no. 19 p.4323-4334dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.242203Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02567naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009900167300001800266500002400284520139400308650001401702650001201716650001601728650001001744650001201754650001101766650002301777650001001800650002001810653002301830653002501853653001701878653002101895653001701916700002901933773011301962852000902075856008502084655001202169IND4393055920221117160127.0070715s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439305592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-007-0383-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReaney, Leeann T.10aTemporal constraints and female preference for burrow width in the fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi  ap. 1515-1521.  aIncludes references  aWe studied sampling behaviour and mate choice in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. Once a female selects a mate, she copulates in his burrow and remains there until releasing her aquatic larvae. U. mjoebergi occurs in habitats that are inundated only by the highest amplitude spring tides. Females can only release their larvae during these tides, and release before or after will result in complete failure of reproductive effort. Matings occur over a 5-day period near the end of neap tides. Our results suggest that within the mating period, females adjust their larval developmental rates by selecting specific burrows in which to incubate their clutches. We found that at the start of the mating period, females chose larger males as mates. Since male size was positively correlated to burrow width, females were selecting wide burrows and effectively incubating at lower temperatures. This would slow down the developmental rates of larvae. In contrast, females that mated late in the mating period selectively chose small males. By incubating in narrower, warmer burrows, these females may increase the developmental rates of larvae. We propose that females are selecting burrows to influence incubation rate and ensure timely release of their larvae. Female U. mjoebergi appear to adjust their preference for the direct benefits of mate choice to increase their reproductive success. 3aburrowing 3aburrows 3acorrelation 3acrabs 3afemales 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amales 3amating behavior 0aFemale mate choice 0aTemporal constraints 0aBurrow width 0aDevelopment time 0aFiddler crab1 aBackwell, Patricia R.

The flavanone glycosides, ascorbic acid (AA) content and antioxidant capacity were determined during storage. Minimal processing had almost no effect on the main chemical constituents, but ascorbic acid decreased significantly in "Minneola" and "Salustiana" segments, with values ranging from 1.63 to 5.10 mg per gram of dry matter, although only in the last samples taken. One of the three juices (Salustiana) also showed a decrease in AA content. The segments and juices showed different behaviour during storage with regard to the flavonoid content, which ranged from 0.77 mg to 8.32 mg/g dry matter in Palazzelli mandarin and Red blush grapefruit, respectively. A significant increase in total flavonoids (mainly hesperidin) was found in the segments, while the juices showed a diminution in flavonoid content . Antioxidant capacity increased significantly in "Red blush" grapefruit juices and "Salustiana" orange segments, decreased in "Salustiana" juices and "Minneola" tangelo segments and remained constant in the other samples. The antioxidant capacity, moreover, was clearly correlated (r=0.968 and r=0.889 in segments and juices, respectively) with the ascorbic acid content rather than with the presence of flavanone glycosides. 3aCitrus 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3achemical composition 3acultivars 3agrapefruit juice 3agrapefruits 3ahesperidin 3atangelos1 aPiga, Antonio1 aVacca, Vincenzo1 aAgabbio, Mario0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.99-105dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00180-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01660naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136245004300154300001600197520081600213650001401029650001501043650001301058650001001071700001601081700001701097700002301114773018101137856005501318852000901373655001201382IND60619175920221123013947.0181031e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061917592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2004.00310.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aCarnivores, biases and Bergmann's rule  ap. 579-588.  aStudies of Bergmann's rule may encompass a non-random subsample of extant homeotherms.

Significant positive correlation between skull length and latitude was found in 50% of carnivore species, while significant negative correlation was found in only 11% of species. These results indicate that the occurrence of Bergmann's rule in the Carnivora is less frequent than earlier published data suggest. Publication bias is not detected in published data. Therefore, previous studies of geographical size variation might be biased in favour of species known to follow Bergmann's rule. 3aCarnivora 3acarnivores 3alatitude 3askull1 aMeiri, Shai1 aDayan, Tamar1 aSimberloff, Daniel0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2004 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.579-588dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2004.00310.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245006700168300001500235520121000250650001901460650002501479650002701504650001101531650001301542650001501555650001201570650001601582651002701598651001401625653001701639653001001656653001401666653001601680700002001696700001401716700001301730700001701743700001801760700001701778700001401795700001501809700001701824773011501841852000901956856009201965930003302057946001102090655001202101IND4403650820221123014119.0080328e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440365082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-1795.2007.00152.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGowan, A.10aDown but not out: marine turtles of the British Virgin Islands  ap. 92-103.  aWe present the result of a multi-annual assessment of the spatio-temporal patterns of marine turtle nesting, and foraging in the Eastern Caribbean archipelago state of the British Virgin Islands. Despite exploitation over several centuries, three species (leatherback Dermochelys coriacea, green Chelonia mydas and hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata turtles) are still nesting and green and hawksbill turtles are found foraging. Leatherback turtles are showing signs of a recovery co-incident with the implementation of an effective moratorium on adult take. When compared with historical data we demonstrate an apparent reduction in nesting levels in green and hawksbill turtles and a nesting range contraction in green turtles. Despite current conservation steps, it will be a decade or more before evidence of recovery can be expected in the two hard-shelled species. Coupled with wider biological knowledge, our findings offer insights into the relative resilience of the different species to exploitation pressure. Additionally, the intra-annual temporal and spatial spread of nesting demonstrated underlines the difficulties of monitoring such a multi-species assemblage in such a diffuse archipelago. 3aChelonia mydas 3aDermochelys coriacea 3aEretmochelys imbricata 3aadults 3aforaging 3amonitoring 3anesting 3asea turtles 3aBritish Virgin Islands 3aCaribbean 0aconservation 0agreen 0ahawksbill 0aleatherback1 aBroderick, A.C.1 aFrett, G.1 aGore, S.1 aHastings, M.1 aPickering, A.1 aWheatley, D.1 aWhite, J.1 aWitt, M.J.1 aGodley, B.J.0 tAnimal conservation.g2008 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.92-103dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1367-94307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2007.00152.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03034naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001800146245012500164300001600289500001500305520139600320650002201716650002801738650001501766650002601781650001301807650001901820650003001839650002101869650001401890650001401904650002001918650002101938650001301959650004301972650002502015650002102040650002202061651001302083651001502096653002202111653003302133653001102166653001302177700001902190700001502209700001902224773007102243852000902314856008602323930003302409945001302442946001302455655001202468IND2060666220221122235414.0971125e199706  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206066622DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.6.6772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDillard, H.R.13aAn assessment of fungicide benefits for the control of fungal diseases of processing tomatoes in New York and New Jersey  ap. 677-681.  a2019-12-04  aConcurrent studies on the benefits of fungicide use for control of fungal diseases of processing tomatoes were conducted in New York and New Jersey in 1993 and 1994. Fungicides (chlorothalonil at 2.5 kg/ha or mancozeb at 1.68 kg/ha) were applied at 7-, 10-, or 14-day intervals to processing tomatoes for control of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum coccodes, early blight caused by Alternaria solani, and Septoria leaf spot caused by Septoria lycopersici. The New Jersey trial included an additional treatment using the disease-warning system TOM-CAST. All fungicide treatments significantly reduced foliar disease severity (in New York) and anthracnose incidence (New York and New Jersey) in the 2 years of study. Yield of usable fruit was significantly increased by all fungicide treatments with the exception of the TOM-CAST treatment using the cultivar Brigade in 1994 in New Jersey. In New York, usable yield and financial benefit were consistently the highest in plots treated with chlorothalonil on a 7-day interval. In New Jersey, the highest usable yields and the greatest financial benefits occurred in the chlorothalonil 7- and 10-day interval treatments in 1993. At both locations, the yield and financial benefit associated with the fungicide treatments was primarily due to suppression of anthracnose and other fruit rots. Suppression of foliar diseases was less important. 3aAlternaria solani 3aColletotrichum coccodes 3acrop yield 3acost benefit analysis 3atomatoes 3achlorothalonil 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease severity 3aincidence 3afrequency 3adisease control 3aproduction costs 3amancozeb 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSeptoria lycopersici 3achemical control 3adisease incidence 3aNew York 3aNew Jersey 0acosts and returns 0aplant diseases and disorders 0atiming 0aefficacy1 aJohnston, S.A.1 aCobb, A.C.1 aHamilton, G.H.0 tPlant disease.g1997 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.677-681x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.6.6773Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03399naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245010500169300001400274500002400288520204100312650001802353650002502371650001702396650001802413650002902431650001302460650000902473650001002482650002002492650002402512650000902536650000902545650001302554650001402567650002002581650000702601650001902608650001602627650001702643650001302660650001402673650001402687700001702701773012302718852000902841856005502850655001202905IND4402235520221122225951.0080302e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440223552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.2007.00182.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarr, Fallou10aEffects of acidification on PE activity, color and antioxidant properties of cold break tomato juice  ap. 34-47.  aIncludes references  aTurbidity maintenance, high antioxidant activity and attractive red color are important attributes of good tomato juice. Acidification was found effective in pectin esterase (PE) inactivation and turbidity maintenance. However, no information related to the changes of antioxidant properties after enzyme inactivation by acidification has been reported. In this article, acidification of cold break tomato juice to pH 2 or 3 was conducted after extraction. The changes of antioxidant properties (content and activity) and their correlation with PE activity and color in the juice were studied. Results indicated that acidification enhanced the viscosity of tomato juice by decreasing its PE activity. Significant increases of the main antioxidant contents (lycopene, polyphenols and vitamin C) and antioxidant activities (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging, ferrous ion chelating ability [FICA] and reducing power), as well as red color, were also found. In addition, the acidified cold break tomato juice exhibited better FICA and reducing power than butylated hydroxyanisole andα-tocopherol. This finding reveals the possibility of producing tomato juice with high antioxidant capacities by acidification. The consumers' demand for healthy products with high quality toward fresh and health has increased remarkably these years. Tomato is one of the most popular vegetable juices, and its important quality aspects are color, stability and antioxidant capacity. Pectin esterase is the principal agent responsible for tomato juice stability. In addition, the goal of tomato juice processors is to optimize processing conditions by prevention of heat and oxidative damages on antioxidant components. Our results indicated that acidification may stabilize tomato juice and improve its color characteristics and main nutritional factors. Therefore, the acidification treatment could be used as a tool for providing the attractive color and enhancing the nutritional value and health-promoting properties of cold break tomato juice. 3aacidification 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abutylated hydroxyanisole 3achelates 3acold 3acolor 3aconsumer demand 3aenzyme inactivation 3aheat 3aions 3alycopene 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3apH 3apectinesterase 3apolyphenols 3atomato juice 3atomatoes 3aturbidity 3aviscosity1 aTsai, Pi-Jen0 tJournal of food quality.g2008 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.34-47dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2007.00182.x 7aarticle03414naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245011500191300001800306500002400324520177300348650002802121650002502149650000902174650001202183650002002195650003102215650001002246650000902256650001402265650002302279650001502302650002002317650002102337650001602358650001202374650005102386650001602437650003102453650001802484650002302502653003602525653001502561653002802576653001402604700001802618700001802636773011702654852000902771856009202780655001202872IND4392602720221122220705.0070624s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439260272DNAL7 a175842552pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01326.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSØRENSEN, J.G.10aGene expression profile analysis of Drosophila melanogaster selected for resistance to environmental stressors  ap. 1624-1636.  aIncludes references  aHere, we report a detailed analysis of changes in gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster selected for ecologically relevant environmental stress resistance traits. We analysed females from seven replicated selection regimes and one control regime using whole genome gene expression arrays. When compared with gene expression profiles of control lines, we were able to detect consistent selection responses at the transcript level in each specific selection regime and also found a group of differentially expressed genes that were changed among all selected lines. Replicated selection lines showed similar changes in gene expression (compared with controls) and thus showed that 10 generations of artificial selection give a clear signal with respect to the resulting gene expression profile. The changes in gene expression in lines selected for increased longevity, desiccation and starvation resistance, respectively, showed high similarities. Cold resistance-selected lines showed little differentiation from controls. Different methods of heat selection (heat survival, heat knock down and constant 30 °C) showed little similarity verifying that different mechanisms are involved in high temperature adaptation. For most individual selection regimes, and in the comparison of all selected lines and controls, the gene expression changes were exclusively in one direction, although the different selection regimes varied in the direction of response. The responses to selection restricted to individual selection regimes can be interpreted as stress specific, whereas the response shared among all selected lines can be considered as a general stress response. Here, we identified genes belonging to both types of responses to selection for stress resistance. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aartificial selection 3acold 3afemales 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat 3alongevity 3aselection response 3astarvation 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGenes, Insect 2aSelection, Genetic 0aenvironmental stress resistance 0agene array 0ageneral stress response 0aselection1 aNIELSEN, M.M.1 aLOESCHCKE, V.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2007 July, v. 20, no. 4 p.1624-1636dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01326.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01936naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010700129300001600236520075500252650001401007650001401021650001601035650002001051650001001071650000901081650002301090650001801113650001301131650002101144650001501165650001401180650001501194650001501209700001701224700003101241773009201272852000901364856010901373939003301482946001101515655001201526IND4461857020221122220820.0110928s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446185702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanguly, Subha10aApplication and Effectiveness of Immunostimulants, Probiotics, and Prebiotics in Aquaculture: A Review  ap. 130-138.  aImmunostimulants, also called immunomodulators, adjuvants, or biological response modifiers, stimulate the immune system.

The best growth, yolk sac consumption, and alevin wet weight were obtained in 4 ppt salinity. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aabsorption 3aaquaculture 3abenzocaine 3aeggs 3aformaldehyde 3afreshwater 3ahatching 3aheat sums 3alarvae 3asalinity 3ayolk sac0 tIsraeli journal of aquaculture Bamidgeh.g2010, v. 62, no. 2 p.116-121x0792-156X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.siamb.org.il/article-1290,944-Contents-of-62-2-2010.aspx3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110928  aNon-US 7aarticle02551naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009100166300001600257520124400273650001501517650001401532650001801546650002401564650001101588650001101599650001101610650001301621650001501634650002301649650001001672651001301682653001601695653002601711653001901737653003401756653002501790700001801815700001701833773010501850852000901955856008501964930003302049946001102082655001202093IND4409114620221122152910.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440911462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-008-9094-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Helena 10aQuantitative forecasting of olive yield in Northern Portugal using a bioclimatic model  ap. 141-150.  aIn this work the objective was to develop a bioclimatic model to forecast olive yield based on airborne pollen, soil water content, and favourable conditions for phytopathological attacks. Olive airborne pollen was sampled from 1998 to 2006 using Cour traps installed in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro region, in the provinces of Valença do Douro and Vila Nova de Foz-Côa. Meteorological data from a meteorological station located in Pinhão, near the pollen samplers, was used to calculate other independent variables. According to the bioclimatic model, at the flowering stage 63% of regional olive production can be predicted from the regional pollen index, with an average deviation between observed and predicted production of 10%. The variable soil water content enabled an increase in forecasting accuracy of about 30%, and a reduction in the average deviation between observed and predicted production of 6%. The final regression with all three variables tested showed that the bioclimatic model was able to predict the annual variability of regional olive fruit production with an accuracy of 97%, the average deviation between observed and predicted production being 3% for internal validation and 6% for external validation. 3acrop yield 3aflowering 3afruit growing 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aolives 3apollen 3asamplers 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atraps 3aPortugal 0aForecasting 0aRegional pollen index 0aPost-flowering 0aPrincipal-components analysis 0aMultiple regressions1 aCunha, Mario.1 aAbreu, Ilda 0 tAerobiologia.g2008 Sept., v. 24, no. 3 p.141-150dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0393-59657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-008-9094-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02683naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245012300168300001600291500002400307520164600331650002401977650002902001650001002030650002202040650001902062650002002081650002202101650001402123700003202137773009002169852000902259856008902268655001202357IND4463961120221122152915.0120824s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446396112DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00194-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSefa-Dedeh, S.10aStarch structure and some properties of cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium and Colocasia esculenta) starch and raphides  ap. 435-444.  aIncludes references  aStudies were conducted on the structure and rheological properties of three cocoyam varieties [Xanthosoma sagittifolium (red-flesh), Xanthosonia sagittifolium (white-flesh) and colocasia esculenta] starches and raphides in an attempt to characterize them. The microstructures of starch granules and raphide sizes, which were obtained from the distal, middle and apical sections of the raw cocoyam samples, were examined using a light microscope. Evaluations of the rheological properties of the cocoyam species were also conducted, using a Brabender viscoamylograph. No distinct variation was observed in starch granule sizes of the two Xanthosoma species. Starch granules sizes in the ranges of 0.74-1.19 and 0.74-1.10 μm were obtained for the Xanthosoma species (red-flesh) and Xanthosoma species (white-flesh), respectively. Significantly smaller sizes (0.05-0.08 μm) of starch granules were observed for Colocasia esculenta. Microstructures of raphide sizes which were obtained from the distal section of the cocoyam species showed significant differences (P<0.05) among the varieties, with the Colocasia species having more pronounced needle-like structures. Evaluation of the rheological properties of the cocoyam flours, using the Brabender viscoamylograph, showed considerable variations among the varieties, especially between the Xanthosoma species and the Colocasia species. The C. esculenta showed lower hot paste viscosity but higher thermal stability than the Xanthosoma species. Peak viscosity was highest in the X. sagittifolium (red-flesh) variety while the white-flesh variety showed the least tendency to retrogradation. 3aColocasia esculenta 3aXanthosoma sagittifolium 3aflour 3alight microscopes 3aretrogradation 3astarch granules 3athermal stability 3aviscosity1 aSackey, Emmanuel Kofi-Agyir0 tFood chemistry.g2002 Dec., v. 79, no. 4 p.435-444dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00194-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02380naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008800129300001600217520105000233650002601283650001601309650001101325650001801336650002001354650001401374650002001388650002301408650000901431650001401440650001901454650001001473650001801483650001401501650001201515650001001527650001301537650002001550650002001570650001201590700002201602700002001624773009201644852000901736856010901745939003301854946001101887655001201898IND4461857220221122152853.0110928s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446185722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlawski, Hanno10a15N: an Indicator of the Assimilation of Dietary Proteins for Oreochromis niloticus  ap. 146-154.  aThe potential of enriched stable isotopes (15N) for protein digestion and assimilation studies in juvenile fish was evaluated. Fishmeal and maggot meal were enriched with 15N, incorporated into two diets (crude protein 30.2%). Four groups of ten Oreochromis niloticus (47.5±8.3 g) were fed an experimental diet at the same starting time. After 15 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h, five fish were selected, the stomach and gut were extracted, and the liver, kidney, gills, and musculus lateralis magnus were sampled. Concentrations of 15N in the stomach 2-6 h after feeding indicate that fishmeal passed through the stomach faster than maggot meal. Differences in digestive tract passage between protein sources were probably due to the hard digestible chitin present in the maggot meal. In the liver, kidney, gills, and musculus lateralis magnus, 15N in fishmeal and maggot meal nitrogen was assimilated at similar speeds. Results indicate that 15N can provide comprehensive information about protein digestion and assimilation in fish nutrition studies. 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquaculture 3achitin 3acrude protein 3adietary protein 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3aexperimental diets 3afish 3afish meal 3afish nutrition 3agills 3ainsect larvae 3ajuveniles 3akidneys 3aliver 3anitrogen 3aprotein sources 3astable isotopes 3astomach1 aGotz, Klaus-Peter1 aSchulz, Carsten0 tIsraeli journal of aquaculture Bamidgeh.g2010, v. 62, no. 3 p.146-154x0792-156X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.siamb.org.il/article-1290,953-Contents-of-62-3-2010.aspx3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110928  aNon-US 7aarticle02606naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002400136245014300160300001600303520144500319650001701764650001501781650001701796650001501813650000901828650001301837650002201850650001301872650002901885650001301914700002101927700002501948700002301973700001701996773011102013852000902124856007602133946001102209655001202220IND4442136020221122152943.0100903e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444213602DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.17752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Mathias Q.10aFragmentation behavior of a thiourea-based reagent for protein structure analysis by collision-induced dissociative chemical cross-linking  ap. 880-891.  aThe fragmentation behavior of a novel thiourea-based cross-linker molecule specifically designed for collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS experiments is described. The development of this cross-linker is part of our ongoing efforts to synthesize novel reagents, which create either characteristic fragment ions or indicative constant neutral losses (CNLs) during tandem mass spectrometry allowing a selective and sensitive analysis of cross-linked products. The new derivatizing reagent for chemical cross-linking solely contains a thiourea moiety that is flanked by two amine-reactive N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) ester moieties for reaction with lysines or free N-termini in proteins. The new reagent offers simple synthetic access and easy structural variation of either length or functionalities at both ends. The thiourea moiety exhibits specifically tailored CID fragmentation capabilities--a characteristic CNL of 85 u--ensuring a reliable detection of derivatized peptides by both electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem mass spectrometry and as such possesses a versatile applicability for chemical cross-linking studies. A detailed examination of the CID behavior of the presented thiourea-based reagent reveals that slight structural variations of the reagent will be necessary to ensure its comprehensive and efficient application for chemical cross-linking of proteins. 3acrosslinking 3adesorption 3adissociation 3aionization 3aions 3apeptides 3aprotein structure 3aproteins 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athiourea1 aDreiocker, Frank1 aIhling, Christian H.1 aSchäfer, Mathias.1 aSinz, Andrea0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2010 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.880-891dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.17753Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02237naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245006400172300001600236500002400252520124300276650001701519650001401536650002101550650002501571650001701596650001801613650002901631650000901660700001901669700002301688773009001711852000901801856008901810655001201899IND4463961520221122152858.0120824s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446396152DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00219-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, David M.10aOat avenanthramides exhibit antioxidant activities in vitro  ap. 473-478.  aIncludes references  aAvenanthramides are a group of alkaloids that consist of an anthranilic acid derivative linked to a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative by a pseudo peptide bond, which are constituents of oat (Avena sativa L.) grain. The three most abundant avenanthramides, N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxycinnamoyl)-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (Bf), N-(4'-hydroxycinnamoyl)-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (Bp), and N-(3',4'-dihydroxycinnamoyl)-5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (Bc), were synthesized and purified. These were tested for antioxidant activity using two in vitro systems: inhibition of β-carotene bleaching and reaction with the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Each avenanthramide displayed antioxidant activity in both systems. Bc had greater activity than Bp and Bf. Bc was nearly as active as the standard synthetic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in the β-carotene system. In the DPPH system, Bc and Bf were more active than 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox®). The relative activities of the avenanthramides corresponded to those determined for their component hydroxycinnamic acid moieties using an aqueous DPPH system or in a lipophilic system that measured the autoxidation of methyl linoleate. 3aAvena sativa 3aalkaloids 3aanthranilic acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aautoxidation 3abeta-carotene 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3aoats1 aHahn, Matha J.1 aEmmons, Cheryld L.0 tFood chemistry.g2002 Dec., v. 79, no. 4 p.473-478dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00219-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01569naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003700145245009600182300001600278520067500294650001600969650001100985651001400996653002701010773011601037852000901153856008501162930003301247946001101280655001201291IND4406559820221122081743.0080606e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440655982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0969-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsper Angillieri, María Yanina 10aMorphometric analysis of Colangüil river basin and flash flood hazard, San Juan, Argentina  ap. 107-111.  aThis work analyzes various morphometric characteristics of the Colangüil river basin in order to evaluate flash flood hazards.

A sensitivity factor (SF) is defined and introduced for the first time to quantitatively compare the efficiency of the IL-based aggregates by SPME-GC-MS and to evaluate the partitioning strength of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to the three IL-aggregates. The ILs HDBIm-Br and HDMIm-Br have been used successfully to extract seven PAHs from the certified reference sediment BCR-535 using focused microwave-assisted extraction followed by SPME-GC-MS. Average recoveries for six of the seven certified PAHs were 84.6% for HDMIm-Br and 101% for HDBIm-Br, with relative standard deviation values (RSDs) lower than 19%. The overall extraction method requires short extraction times (around 7min for the microwave step) and avoids the use of organic solvents. 3agas chromatography 3aionic liquids 3amass spectrometry 3amicrowave treatment 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediments 3asolid phase microextraction1 aPino, Verónica.1 aAnderson, Jared L.1 aAfonso, Ana M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Dec. 19, v. 1214, no. 1-2 p.23-29dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.10.0843Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02887naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011000129300001600239500001500255520179600270650002402066650001602090650002002106650001902126650002402145650002002169650001902189650001702208651001302225653001102238653001502249700002302264700001702287773013102304852000902435930003302444945001302477946001102490655001202501IND2163830120221122081749.0980903e199712  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216383012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaliba, A.R.M.12aA stall-feeding management for improved cattle in semiarid central Tanzania: factors influencing adoption  ap. 133-146.  a2019-12-05  aThis study's objectives were to determine factors influencing smallholder farmers' adoption of a stall-feeding management system for improved dairy cattle in semiarid Tanzania and other related technology packages. Heckman's two-stage procedure was used to determine factors influencing participation in the project and the adoption of recommended management practices. Stall-feeding technology is particularly attractive to those households with fewer resources particularly those that are female heads. Wealthier farmers, as measured by area of land cultivated, are less likely to adopt the stall-feeding technology. Household labour is found to be important in determining the degree to which the technology and associated management practices were adopted. Age of the household head has a positive impact on the size of the intensive feed gardens. Different measures of extension-related contact are significant in influencing the potential for adopting stall-fed technology, the number of stall-fed cattle kept, the probability of growing water melons, and the site of intensive feed gardens. The implications are that research and extension messages with reference to the stall-feeding management system need to be targeted to specific types of households (e.g., female farmers, those with children to provide labor, and limited resource farms). This supports the notion that technology development and dissemination need to be sensitive not only to the characteristics of the biophysical environment but also to the socioeconomic environment, which is often neglected. The study also demonstrates that in the poorer parts of the world where land is very limited, a strategy for improving ecological sustainability can be linked closely to one for increasing agricultural productivity. 3amathematical models 3asmall farms 3aprobit analysis 3acattle feeding 3ainnovation adoption 3afarm management 3asemiarid zones 3adairy cattle 3aTanzania 0astalls 0atechnology1 aFeatherstone, A.M.1 aNorman, D.W.0 tAgricultural economics.g1997 Dec., v. 17, no. 2/3 p.133-146aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle03013naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011600160300001800276520185100294650002002145650001402165650001402179650002202193650001702215650001402232653001102246653002302257653003302280700001902313700001302332700001902345700001602364773010902380852000902489856008502498930003302583946001102616655001202627IND4408465920221122045746.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440846592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-008-1032-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuppi, P. 10aHuman C-peptide antagonises high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction through the nuclear factor-κB pathway  ap. 1534-1543.  aAims/hypothesis Endothelial dysfunction in diabetes is predominantly caused by hyperglycaemia leading to vascular complications through overproduction of oxidative stress and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Many studies have suggested that decreased circulating levels of C-peptide may play a role in diabetic vascular dysfunction. To date, the possible effects of C-peptide on endothelial cells and intracellular signalling pathways are largely unknown. We therefore investigated the effect of C-peptide on several biochemical markers of endothelial dysfunction in vitro. To gain insights into potential intracellular signalling pathways affected by C-peptide, we tested NF-κB activation, since it is known that inflammation, secondary to oxidative stress, is a key component of vascular complications and NF-κB is a redox-dependent transcription factor. Methods Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were exposed to 25 mmol/l glucose in the presence of C-peptide (0.5 nmol/l) for 24 h and tested for expression of the gene encoding vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Secretion of IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was measured by ELISA. NF-κB activation was analysed by immunoblotting and ELISA. Results Physiological concentrations of C-peptide affect high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction by: (1) decreasing VCAM-1 expression and U-937 cell adherence to HAEC; (2) reducing secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1; and (3) suppressing NF-κB activation. Conclusions/interpretation During hyperglycaemia, C-peptide directly affects VCAM-1 expression and both MCP-1 and IL-8 HAEC secretion by reducing NF-κB activation. These effects suggest a physiological anti-inflammatory (and potentially anti-atherogenic) activity of C-peptide on endothelial cells. 3aatherosclerosis 3ac-peptide 3acytokines 3aendothelial cells 3ainflammation 3amonocytes 0aNF-κB 0aNuclear factor κB 0aVascular smooth muscle cells1 aCifarelli, V. 1 aTse, H. 1 aPiganelli, J. 1 aTrucco, M. 0 tDiabetologia.g2008 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.1534-1543dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-008-1032-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03124naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245016600151300001800317500002400335500002300359500001500382520160200397650002501999650001602024650001702040650001402057650005202071650001102123650002702134650003002161650001202191650002102203650002302224650001102247653001002258700001602268700001602284700001802300700001802318700002002336700002002356700002302376700001602399773013102415852000902546856007502555655001202630IND4438578920221122035655.0100615s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443857892DNAL7 a10.1139/G10-0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhi-Guo10aGenes encoding the α-carboxyltransferase subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Brassica napus and parental species: cloning, expression patterns, and evolution  ap. 360–370.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aHeteromeric acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase), a rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis in dicots, is a multi-enzyme complex consisting of biotin carboxylase, biotin carboxyl carrier protein, and carboxyltransferase (α-CT and β-CT). In the present study, four genes encoding α-CT were cloned from Brassica napus, and two were cloned from each of the two parental species, B. rapa and B. oleracea. Comparative and cluster analyses indicated that these genes were divided into two major groups. The major divergence between group-1 and group-2 occurred in the second intron. Group-2 α-CT genes represented the ancestral form in the genus Brassica. The divergence of group-1 and group-2 genes occurred in their common ancestor 12.96–17.78 million years ago (MYA), soon after the divergence of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica (15–20 MYA). This time of divergence is identical to that reported for the paralogous subgenomes of diploid Brassica species (13–17 MYA). Real-time reverse transcription PCR revealed that the expression patterns of the two groups of genes were similar in different organs, except in leaves. To better understand the regulation and evolution of α-CT genes, promoter regions from two sets of orthologous gene copies from B. napus, B. rapa, and B. oleracea were cloned and compared. The function of the promoter of gene Bnα-CT-1-1 in group-1 and gene Bnα-CT-2-1 in group-2 was examined by assaying β-glucuronidase activity in transgenic A. thaliana. Our results will be helpful in elucidating the evolution and regulation of ACCase in oilseed rape. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3afatty acids 3abiosynthesis 3aevolution 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3abiotin 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aleaves 0agenes1 aYin, Wei-Bo1 aKwok, Woon.1 aSong, Li-Ying1 aChen, Yu-Hong1 aGuan, Rong-Zhan1 aWang, Jing-Qiao1 aWang, Richard R.C.1 aHu, Zan-Min0 tGenome =.g2010 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.360–370-360–370dNRC Research Press, National Research Council Canadax0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/G10-0113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02223naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245004900157300001600206500002400222520117100246650001601417650001001433650001501443650002501458650001801483650001501501651001001516653001901526653002501545653002401570653001001594700001901604700001801623700001901641773008301660852000901743856008501752655001201837IND4438532520221120073442.0100611s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443853252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10201-010-0310-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Hui10aChemical and thermal stratification in lakes  ap. 251-257.  aIncludes references  aAn index that shows chemical stratification strength [IC-i; i = water quality item such as chlorophyll-a (Chl.a) and soluble phosphorus (SP)] was proposed and compared with one of thermal stratification strength indices, Schmidt's stability index (SSI), in Shiozu Bay and Lake Biwa, Japan. The proposed indices of IC-i can be easily calculated with at least one set of each water quality data in both the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. The SSI was shown to be consistent with the traditional thermocline index of thermocline strength index (TSI), but SSI is used as the stability index of the whole lake, whereas TSI is used as the stability index near the thermocline. Analyses showed that chemical stratification strength is determined largely by thermal stratification strength. Totally different characteristics of IC-Chl.a and IC-phosphate (PO₄) at high SSI in the main North Basin of Lake Biwa and in Shiozu Bay were possibly due to the difference in their volumes and hydrodynamic conditions. The proposed index and relationships are especially useful to roughly determine thermal and chemical stratification when only few water quality data are available. 3achlorophyll 3alakes 3aphosphorus 3atemperature profiles 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aJapan 0aStratification 0aThermocline strength 0aChemocline strength 0aIndex1 aTsuno, Hiroshi1 aHidaka, Taira1 aJiao, Chunmeng0 tLimnology.g2010 Dec., v. 11, no. 3 p.251-257dSpringer Japanx1439-86217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-010-0310-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02484naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245009000161300001400251500002800265520145600293650001701749653001801766653002601784653001901810653002701829653002501856700001801881700002201899773013201921852000902053856008502062946001102147655001202158IND4405513320221122035458.0080509s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440551332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-007-9876-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, C.

The river receives toxic substances through a large number of tributaries and drains flowing in the catchment of the river. The toxic substances of particular interest are heavy metals derived from urban runoff as well as municipal sewage and industrial effluents. Heavy metals entering the river get adsorbed onto the suspended sediments, which in due course of time settle down in the bottom of the river. In this study fractionation of metal ions has been carried out with the objective to determine the eco-toxic potential of metal ions. Although, in most cases (except iron) the average trace/heavy metal concentrations in sediments were higher than the standard shale values, the risk assessment code as applied to the present study reveals that only about 1-3% of manganese, <1% of copper, 16-19% of nickel, 4-20% of chromium, 1-4% of lead, 8-13% of cadmium and 1-3% of zinc exist in exchangeable fraction and therefore falls under low to medium risk category. According to the Geo-accumulation Index (GAI), cadmium shows high accumulation in the river sediments, rest of other metals are under unpolluted to moderately polluted class. 3aheavy metals 0aRiver Narmada 0aSequential extraction 0aTessier scheme 0aGeo-Accumulation Index 0aRisk assessment code1 aGupta, Harish1 aChakrapani, G.

Large testes (300 to 400 g) are pink to light red and small testes (100 g) are dark maroon with color gradations for weights in between. It was hypothesized that this color most likely represented an iron protein. Chromatographic analysis of testicular tissue indicated that the Fe was associated primarily with ferritin, and immunohistochemistry showed that Leydig cells were the primary location of ferritin storage within the testes. Concentrations of Fe and ferritin were higher in small testes and decreased as testes weight increased (P < 0.05). As testicular Fe concentrations increased, daily sperm production (DSP) and total DSP declined (P < 0.05). Genotyping six generations of Meishan × White composite boars (n = 288) for a quantitative trait locus that is indicative of elevated FSH and small testes in boars indicated that the Meishan genotype had elevated testicular iron concentrations and darker color in conjunction with reduced total DSP (P < 0.01). It is not thought the elevated iron concentrations affect testicular weights but are probably a result of elevated FSH and FSH inducement of Fe transport. The storage of Fe in Leydig cells may provide a reservoir of Fe for easy access by Sertoli and germ cells, but still provide a degree of protection to germ cells from ionic iron. 3aLeydig cells 3aMeishan 3aboars 3acolor 3aferritin 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3airon 3aquantitative trait loci 3ared light 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aFerritinsxmetabolism 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexblood 2aGenotype 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aIronxmetabolism 2aLeydig Cellsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aOrgan Sizexphysiology 2aPigmentation 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSpermatogenesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSwinexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTestisxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxphysiology. 2aX Chromosome1 aLunstra, D.D.1 aRohrer, G.A.1 aFord, J.J.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.503-511dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002300183245012700206300001800333500002400351506007600375520105700451506003701508650002501545650002001570650001701590650001801607650001901625650001901644650003101663650001001694650001501704650000901719650001201728650001301740650002901753650001701782650002401799650001201823650002601835650005901861650001801920650001601938650002001954650001301974650001001987650000901997650002802006650001802034650003502052650003402087650003902121700001802160700002202178700001902200700002702219700002002246700002302266700001902289700002002308700001902328773010902347852000902456856008202465856003002547655001202577IND4385168320221207122124.0061112e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438516832DNAL7 a170126012pmid7 aPMC16266252pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.106.0438692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshizumi, Takeshi10aINCREASED LEVEL OF POLYPLOIDY1, a Conserved Repressor of CYCLINA2 Transcription, Controls Endoreduplication in Arabidopsis  ap. 2452-2468.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEndoreduplication is a type of cell cycle in which DNA replication continues without cell division. We have isolated several dominant mutants from Arabidopsis thaliana activation tagging lines by flow cytometry. One of the mutants, increased level of polyploidy1-1D (ilp1-1D), showed increased polyploidy in both light- and dark-grown hypocotyls. The corresponding gene of ilp1-1D encodes a protein homologous to the C-terminal region of mammalian GC binding factor. We demonstrate that this protein functions as a transcriptional repressor in vivo. The expression of all members of the CYCLINA2 (CYCA2) family was reduced in an ILP1 overexpressing line, and the mouse (Mus musculus) homolog of ILP1 repressed cyclin A2 expression in mouse NIH3T3 cells. T-DNA insertion mutants of ILP1 showed reduced polyploidy and upregulated all CYCA2 expression. Furthermore, loss of CYCA2;1 expression induces an increase in polyploidy in ARABIDOPSIS: We demonstrate that this protein regulates endoreduplication through control of CYCA2 expression in ARABIDOPSIS:0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA replication 3aMus musculus 3acell division 3aendopolyploidy 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahypocotyls 3amice 3amutants 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer DNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA Replication 2aDarkness 2aLight 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNIH 3T3 Cells 2aRepressor Proteinsxphysiology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Geneticxphysiology1 aTsumoto, Yuko1 aTakiguchi, Tomoko1 aNagata, Noriko1 aYamamoto, Yoshiharu Y.1 aKawashima, Mika1 aIchikawa, Takanari1 aNakazawa, Miki1 aYamamoto, Naoki1 aMatsui, Minami0 tplant cell.g2006 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.2452-2468dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.0438693Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/ 7aarticle02152naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245010200148300001600250300002100266520104300287650001501330650001001345650002001355650001801375650000901393650001201402650001501414650005901429650003101488650002001519650000901539650001301548650001401561650002701575700001701602773007001619852000901689939003301698946001101731655001201742IND9004585820221122005841.0900919e19900802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900458582DNAL7 a19740362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinkelstein, R.14aThe orthodenticle gene is regulated by bicoid and torso and specifies Drosophila head development  ap. 485-488.  ap. 485-488. ill.  aIn the Drosophila embryo, cell fate along the anterior-posterior axis is determined by maternally expressed genes. The activity of the bicoid (bcd) gene is required for the development of larval head and thoracic structures, and that of maternal torso (tor) for the development of the unsegmented region of the head (acron). In contrast to the case of thoracic and abdominal segmentation, the hierarchy of zygotically expressed genes controlling head development has not been clearly defined. The bcd protein, which is expressed in a gradient, activates zygotic expression of the gap gene hunchback (hb), but hb alone is not sufficient to specify head development. Driever et al. proposed that at least one other bcd-activated gene controls the development of head regions anterior to the hb domain. We report here that the homeobox gene orthodenticle (otd), which is involved in head development, could be such a gene. We also show that otd expression responds to the activity of the maternal tor gene at the anterior pole of the embryo. 3aDrosophila 3agenes 3agene expression 3aembryogenesis 3ahead 2aAnimals 2aBlastoderm 2aDrosophilaxanatomy & histologyxembryologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Homeobox 2aHead 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aPerrimon, N.0 tNature.g1990 Aug. 2, v. 346, no. 6283 p.485-488x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02573naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245011400166300001600280500001500296520135800311650001701669650001901686650001101705650001101716650001201727650001501739650002601754650000901780650001401789651001301803653001701816653001301833653001801846653001301864700001901877773008901896852000901985856008601994930003302080945001302113946001302126655001202139IND2062280420221121234514.0980306e199708  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206228042DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.8.8552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKommineni, K.V.13aAn anatomical study of prune brown line disease and immuno-localization of tomato ringspot virus in plum bark  ap. 855-861.  a2019-12-04  aBark from the graft union of tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV) infected plum, symptomatic for brown line disease, showed anatomical changes characteristic of the wound response process. The wound tissue consisted of necrotic cells demarcated by pinkish purple necrophylactic periderm, whose function is to protect living tissues from detrimental effects associated with necrosing cells. However, formation of gray exophylactic periderm led to the sloughing off of the wound tissue and the necrophylactic periderm, resulting in discontinuity of the exophylactic periderm and secondary virus invasion into the wound site. The changes seen in the bark suggest that the hypersensitive response in plum rootstock bark to ToRSV is slow, allowing a systemic movement of the virus and development of a brown line (BL) along the scion and rootstock union. Necrophylactic periderm was not seen in the bark from the graft union of a healthy plum tree. In the graft union of a plum tree without a BL, but testing ToRSV-positive in the roots, localized areas of wound tissue with pinkish purple necrophylactic periderm developed only in the rootstock portion of the tree. Silver-enhanced protein A-colloidal gold immunolabeling was seen on the cell wall and in the cytoplasm of bark tissue from the BL region of scion and rootstock and leaves from the rootstock suckers. 3aimmunoassays 3awound periderm 3aPrunus 3ascions 3aviruses 3arootstocks 3aTomato ringspot virus 3abark 3ainfection 3aMichigan 0alocalization 0asymptoms 0aplant anatomy 0agrafting1 aRamsdell, D.C.0 tPlant disease.g1997 Aug., v. 81, no. 8 p.855-861wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.8.8553Available from publisher's Web site  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle04357naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245011500144300001600259500002400275520246100299650000902760650001902769650001202788650001902800650001002819650002302829650001102852650001702863650002402880650001702904650001102921650001502932650001002947650000902957650001202966650001102978650002202989650001203011650001103023650006103034650003703095650003703132650001603169650005503185650003003240650002003270650002403290650001003314650004403324650002003368651001803388700001503406700001703421700001803438700001503456700001703471700001703488700001603505700001603521773013703537852000903674655001203683IND4464265920221121224739.0121005s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446426592DNAL7 a126434882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyle, A.M.10aEffectiveness of the SmartMV prototype BeefCam System to sort beef carcasses into expected palatability groups  ap. 441-448.  aIncludes references  aThis study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the SmartMV prototype BeefCam Video Imaging System (prototype BeefCam) for classifying beef carcasses into palatability (“certified” or “not certified” as palatable) groups. Carcasses (n = 769) were selected from four beef-packing plants to represent three USDA quality grade groups (Top Choice, TC; Low Choice, LC; and Select, SE). Following chilling, a prototype BeefCam image of the longissimus muscle was obtained for each carcass. Strip loins were collected from the left side of each carcass and aged for 10 d; Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF; n = 769) values and consumer panel ratings (hedonic, end-anchored, 9-point ratings for overall like/dislike; n = 500 carcasses) were obtained for cooked steaks. Using information from the images, two regression models were developed to predict the first principal component of WBSF and consumer panel ratings for sorting carcasses based on expected eating quality. Model I used only prototype BeefCam output, whereas Model II used prototype BeefCam output and a coded value for quality grade group. For both models, carcasses with a predicted value of less than 0.0 were certified as producing palatable beef. Additional carcasses (n = 292) were evaluated at a fifth and separate packing plant by prototype BeefCam to validate Models I and II. A strip loin was collected from each carcass and WBSF was measured after 14 d of aging. The percentages of validation carcasses that generated tough (WBSF ≥ 4.5 kg) steaks were 6.5, 5.8, 10.7, and 7.9% for, TC, LC, SE, and all carcasses, respectively. Use of Model I certified 51.9, 47.6, 43.8, and 47.3% of TC, LC, SE, and all carcasses, respectively. Of the carcasses certified by use of Model I, 0.0, 0.0, 4.1, and 1.4% of TC, LC, SE, and all carcasses, respectively, generated tough steaks. Use of Model II certified 59.7, 47.6, 25.0, and 42.1% of TC, LC, SE, and all carcasses, respectively. Of the carcasses certified by use of Model II, 2.2, 0.0, 3.6, and 1.6% of TC, LC, SE, and all carcasses, respectively, generated tough steaks. For both models, the frequency of carcasses that produced tough steaks in the certified group was lower (P < 0.05) for all validation carcasses sampled compared with that of the original carcass population. Based on the decrease in the frequency of carcasses that produced tough steaks, further development of a commercial BeefCam system is warranted. 3abeef 3abeef carcasses 3acooling 3aimage analysis 3aloins 3alongissimus muscle 3amodels 3apalatability 3aregression analysis 3ashear stress 3asteaks 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aConsumer Behavior 2aCooking 2aHumans 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assistedxmethodsxstandards. 2aMeatxclassificationxstandards. 2aMeat-Packing Industryxstandards 2aMiddle Aged 2aMuscle, Skeletalxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aQuality Control 2aRegression Analysis 2aTaste 2aUnited States Department of Agriculture 2aVideo Recording 0aUnited States1 aVote, D.J.1 aRoeber, D.L.1 aCannell, R.C.1 aBelk, K.E.1 aScanga, J.A.1 aGoldberg, M.1 aTatum, J.D.1 aSmith, G.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.441-448dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245010800176300001600284520175700300650001502057650001302072650001402085650001302099650001102112650001602123650001002139650000902149650002902158650001802187650001802205650002502223653004202248653000702290653002302297653002602320700002202346700001902368700002302387773014002410852000902550856007602559930003302635946001102668655001202679IND4381210520221121205934.0060620e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438121052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0765.2006.00035.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOBAYASHI, Takayuki10aVertical distribution of chloroform-extractable green fraction in several Andosol and Cambisol profiles  ap. 274-283.  aThe vertical distribution of the content of the chloroform-extractable green fraction (CEGF) in the soil profiles of four Japanese Andosols, one Japanese Cambisol and one Nepalese Cambisol was examined using a colorimetric method with an ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer. In addition, the relationship between the CEGF content and the soil chemical properties was examined by statistical analysis. CEGF was detected in all the soil samples, and the content ranged from 0.02 to 1.16 g kg⁻¹. The CEGF content in the surface A horizon of the Andosol tended to be higher than in the Cambisol. The vertical distribution of the CEGF content in three soil profiles (two Andosol profiles and one Nepalese Cambisol) revealed maximum values in the subsurface horizon. In the Japanese Cambisol, the content of the CEGF was highest in the surface horizon. In the remaining two Andosol profiles containing a buried humus horizon, the content of the CEGF was highest in the buried humus horizon and the distribution was considerably different from that of organic carbon. Statistical analysis showed that the content of the CEGF displayed a significant positive correlation (P < 0.001, n = 36) with the contents of dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate-extractable Al (Ald), and with oxalate-oxalic acid-extractable Fe and Al (Feo and Alo, respectively). Furthermore, the content of the CEGF showed a significant positive correlation with the content of Alo (r = 0.944, P < 0.01, n = 6) in the soil with the highest content of CEGF in the profile. It was, therefore, suggested that CEGF is actively produced in humus-rich soils like Andosols, and that Ald, Feo and, in particular, Alo were associated with the vertical distribution of CEGF in the soil profiles. 3aA horizons 3aAndosols 3aCambisols 3aaluminum 3acarbon 3acolorimetry 3ahumus 3airon 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3astatistical analysis 0achloroform-extractable green fraction 0aPg 0asoil green pigment 0avertical distribution1 aWatanabe, Makiko.1 aOHTA, Hiroyuki1 aFUJITAKE, Nobuhide0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2006 June, v. 52, no. 3 p.274-283dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0038-07687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0765.2006.00035.x3electronic resource  a20060620b20060702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03497naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008400204300002000288506007600308520186100384506003702245650001602282650001502298650001002313650001502323650001802338650001202356650002202368650002302390650002402413650002802437650001902465650001902484650002402503650001102527650001702538700002002555700002102575700002502596700002402621700002002645773017602665852000902841856008302850930003302933946001302966655001202979IND4427458020221207124229.0091016e20091013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442745802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08095131062doi7 aPMC27651632pmcid7 a198051262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoengi, Michael10aGABA uptake-dependent Ca²⁺ signaling in developing olfactory bulb astrocytes  ap. 17570-17575.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe studied GABAergic signaling in astrocytes of olfactory bulb slices using confocal Ca²⁺ imaging and two-photon Na⁺ imaging. GABA evoked Ca²⁺ transients in astrocytes that persisted in the presence of GABAA and GABAB receptor antagonists, but were suppressed by inhibition of GABA uptake by SNAP 5114. Withdrawal of external Ca²⁺ blocked GABA-induced Ca²⁺ transients, and depletion of Ca²⁺ stores with cyclopiazonic acid reduced Ca²⁺ transients by approximately 90%. This indicates that the Ca²⁺ transients depend on external Ca²⁺, but are mainly mediated by intracellular Ca²⁺ release, conforming with Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release. Inhibition of ryanodine receptors did not affect GABA-induced Ca²⁺ transients, whereas the InsP₃ receptor blocker 2-APB inhibited the Ca²⁺ transients. GABA also induced Na⁺ increases in astrocytes, potentially reducing Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange. To test whether reduction of Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange induces Ca²⁺ signaling, we inhibited Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange with KB-R7943, which mimicked GABA-induced Ca²⁺ transients. Endogenous GABA release from neurons, activated by stimulation of afferent axons or NMDA application, also triggered Ca²⁺ transients in astrocytes. The significance of GABAergic Ca²⁺ signaling in astrocytes for control of blood flow is demonstrated by SNAP 5114-sensitive constriction of blood vessels accompanying GABA uptake. The results suggest that GABAergic signaling is composed of GABA uptake-mediated Na⁺ rises that reduce Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange, thereby leading to a Ca²⁺ increase sufficient to trigger Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release via InsP₃ receptors. Hence, GABA transporters not only remove GABA from the extracellular space, but may also contribute to intracellular signaling and astrocyte function, such as control of blood flow.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantagonists 3aastrocytes 3aaxons 3ablood flow 3ablood vessels 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3acyclopiazonic acid 3aextracellular space 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aimage analysis 3aolfactory bulb 3aryanodine receptors 3asodium 3atransporters1 aHirnet, Daniela1 aCoulon, Philippe1 aPape, Hans-Christian1 aDeitmer, Joachim W.1 aLohr, Christian0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Oct. 13, v. 106, no. 41 p.17570-17575dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08095131063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091016b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03366naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100002400201245010200225300002000327500001500347506007600362520163400438506003702072650001802109650002502127650003102152650003202183650001902215650002602234650002902260650001902289650001102308650001002319650001402329653002702343653001702370700001902387700002202406700002502428700002102453700002302474773017602497852000902673856008302682930003302765945002502798946001302823655001202836IND4427458420221207132411.0091016e20091013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442745842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09092391062doi7 aPMC27536392pmcid7 a198050752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the range of viruses influenced by actin for movement and the mechanism of this transport are poorly understood. Here we determine the importance of microfilaments and myosins for the sustained intercellular movement of a group of RNA-based plant viruses. We demonstrate that the intercellular movement of viruses from different genera [tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), potato virus X (PVX), tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV)], is inhibited by disruption of microfilaments. Surprisingly, turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV), a virus from the same genus as TMV, did not require intact microfilaments for normal spread. To investigate the molecular basis for this difference we compared the subcellular location of GFP fusions to the 126-kDa protein and the homologous 125-kDa protein from TMV and TVCV, respectively. The 126-kDa protein formed numerous large cytoplasmic inclusions associated with microfilaments, whereas the 125-kDa protein formed few small possible inclusions, none associated with microfilaments. The dependence of TMV, PVX, and TBSV on intact microfilaments for intercellular movement led us to investigate the role of myosin motors in this process. Virus-induced gene silencing of the Nicotiana benthamiana myosin XI-2 gene, but not three other myosins, inhibited only TMV movement. These results indicate that RNA viruses have evolved differently in their requirements for microfilaments and the associated myosin motors, in a manner not correlated with predicted phylogeny.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant viruses 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aTurnip vein-clearing virus 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aPotato virus X 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aTomato bushy stunt virus 3amicrofilaments 3amyosin 3aactin 3ainfection 0aintercellular movement 0acytoskeleton1 aPark, Jong-Won1 aSasaki, Nobumitsu1 aBallard, Kimberly D.1 aMaule, Andrew J.1 aNelson, Richard S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Oct. 13, v. 106, no. 41 p.17594-17599dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09092391063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/11/18  aOther US 7aarticle01927naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245012100165300001600286500002400302520090000326650001601226650001201242650001201254650001401266650002001280650002101300650002301321700001801344700001901362700002001381773009001401852000901491856008901500655001201589IND4463965320221121140353.0120824s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446396532DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00513-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondyli, E.10aLipolysis and volatile compounds in low-fat Kefalograviera-type cheese made with commercial special starter cultures  ap. 203-209.  aIncludes references  aTwo commercially available starter culture systems, Alp DIP and a mixture of Alp DIP D and Joghurt V1, were compared with a regular starter culture, CH-1, for their effects on lipolysis and volatile compounds in a low-fat (9.5%), high moisture (49.6%) Kefalograviera-type cheese during aging.

Soils were pre-labelled by applying 15N fertiliser to soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] and common bean [Phaseolus vulgaris L.] crops. Additional 14N plots which received unlabelled fertiliser were also established in the same way. The above-ground biomass from all four plots was harvested, stored and the plots left to over-winter. In the following summer 15N-labelled residues were added to the unlabelled soils and unlabelled residues were added to the 15N-labelled soils at a rate of 150 kg N ha(-1). All plots were cultivated and sown with maize (Zea mays L.). Control plots that did not receive residue application or any additional fertiliser N were also set up. The plots were harvested in late autumn. Maize derived 37 kg N ha(-1) and 31 kg N ha(-1) from the added soybean residues, estimated using the direct and indirect approach, respectively, in plots previously sown to soybean. N derived from the added common bean residues was estimated as 26 kg N ha(-1) and 24 kg N ha(-1) from the direct and indirect methods, respectively. In the plots previously sown to common bean, N derived from added soybean residue was 32 kg N ha(-1) using the direct method and 33 kg N ha(-1) using the indirect method. N derived from common bean residues was 22 kg N ha(-1) and 21 kg N ha(-1) estimated using the direct and indirect approaches, respectively. It was concluded that the modified indirect technique allows a reasonable estimate of N derived from residues and that this will enable further experiments to be conducted in which N derived from more complex matrices, such as manure or sewage sludge, can be determined. 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3aorganic matter 3anitrogen 3acrop residues 3anutrient uptake 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3ameasurement 3astable isotopes 0amethodology 0anutrient sources 0aevaluation0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2001 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.156-161x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0037401003883Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle03537naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002300157245008400180300001800264500002400282500001500306520183200321650001302153650001702166650001602183650001402199650001802213650001302231650002402244650002402268650001502292650002002307650001602327650002102343650001402364650001302378650001202391650003202403650002602435650001102461650002802472650002502500650001602525650001402541650006202555650004202617653001102659653000902670700002502679700002302704700001902727773011402746852000902860856007802869655001202947IND4391662220221121164947.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439166222DNAL7 a174310232pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchröder, Roland.10aReduction of ethylene emission from Scots pine elicited by insect egg secretion  ap. 1835-1842.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPinus sylvestris L. is known to activate indirect defence in response to attack by an herbivorous sawfly. Egg deposition by the sawfly Diprion pini L. induces pine to release, three days after egg laying, locally and systemically terpenoid volatiles that attract parasitoids to kill the eggs. The elicitor of the pine's response is located in the sawfly's oviduct secretion enveloping the eggs after deposition. Application of this secretion on twigs with artificially conducted ovipositional woundings mimics the effects of egg deposition. Furthermore, jasmonic acid (JA) induces a volatile pattern similar, but not identical, to the one induced by egg deposition. To gain deeper insight into the transduction of plant signals induced by herbivore egg deposition, it was investigated whether ethylene emission from pine is affected by sawfly egg deposition. Systemically induced ethylene emission from differently treated pine twigs was monitored for a period of 3 d after treatment. Ethylene emissions from untreated control twigs were compared with those from twigs treated as follows: (i) sawfly egg secretion [= oviduct secretion (OVI)] was transferred on artificially wounded pine needles (attractive volatiles), (ii) needles were artificially wounded (non-attractive volatiles), and (iii) the twig was supplied with JA (attractive volatiles). Ethylene emission from systemically OVI-induced twigs was significantly lower than from untreated controls, whereas artificial wounding had no detectable effect. JA-treated twigs released much more ethylene and showed higher variability of ethylene emission than artificially wounded twigs and OVI-treated ones. Ethylene emissions from pine after the various treatments studied here are discussed with respect to known effects of insect feeding on ethylene release from plants. 3aethylene 3aDiprion pini 3aoviposition 3asecretion 3ajasmonic acid 3asawflies 3asignal transduction 3aethylene production 3aherbivores 3aconifer needles 3ainsect eggs 3aPinus sylvestris 3aemissions 3aoviducts 2aAnimals 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHymenopteraxphysiology 2aOviductsxmetabolism 2aOviposition 2aOxylipins 2aPinus sylvestrisxdrug effectsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 0aplants 0aeggs1 aCristescu, Simona M.1 aHarren, Frans J.M.1 aHilker, Monika0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 May, v. 58, no. 7 p.1835-1842dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm0443Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02426naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245014200191300001600333520115400349650001901503650002201522650001501544650003101559650004201590653003101632653003701663653003101700653003301731700002001764700001701784773010601801852000901907856009201916930003302008946001102041655001202052IND4406135620221121140423.0080530e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440613562DNAL7 a185036702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.02003.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aENGELBERG, D.L.14aThe influence of low-strain thermo-mechanical processing on grain boundary network characteristics in type 304 austenitic stainless steel  ap. 435-444.  aGrain boundary engineering of austenitic stainless steel, through the introduction of plastic strain and thermal annealing, can be used to develop microstructures with improved resistance to inter-granular degradation. The influence of low-strain thermo-mechanical processing on grain boundary network development, with systematic variations of annealing treatments, has been investigated. Three stages of the microstructure development during grain boundary engineering in low-strain processing conditions are identified, and correlated with changes in grain boundary character and deviation distributions. Low-energy connected length segments at triple junctions, which have been proposed to be responsible for crack bridging during inter-granular stress corrosion cracking, can be influenced by the choice of the annealing treatment parameters. The development of individual grain boundary length segments of different character showed consistent trends with increasing grain size. Crack length predictions are consistent with the beneficial effect of designing microstructures with high fractions of twin grain boundaries and smaller grain size. 3amicrostructure 2aAlloysxchemistry 2aElasticity 2aMaterials Testingxmethods 2aStainless Steelxanalysisxchemistry. 0aAustenitic stainless steel 0aelectron backscatter diffraction 0agrain boundary engineering 0athermo-mechanical processing1 aHUMPHREYS, F.J.1 aMARROW, T.J.0 tJournal of microscopy.g2008 June, v. 230, no. 3 p.435-444dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-27207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.02003.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080530b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02723naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010200145300001600247500002400263520134400287650001501631650001501646650003501661650001701696650001101713650001501724650001201739650002101751650005801772650004701830650003301877650002801910650000901938650002801947650002201975650002401997650002802021650001602049700001602065700001802081700002002099773013702119852000902256655001202265IND4464265520221121140429.0121005s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446426552DNAL7 a126434842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, E.O.10aAggressive behavior is reduced in bulls actively immunized against gonadotropin-releasing hormone  ap. 411-415.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this research was to compare the frequency of aggressive behaviors in beef bulls actively immunized against gonadotropin-releasing hormone relative to contemporary nonimmunized control bulls and surgically castrated steers. Eight males were assigned to each of these treatments in each of 4 yr. Immunized males were treated with a GnRH-keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate at approximately 4 mo of age. A secondary (booster) immunization was administered at 12 mo. Steers were castrated at 4 mo of age. Animals in each treatment in each year were housed as a single group prior to testing. At approximately 16 mo of age, each group of eight animals was placed in a 10- × 16-m enclosure for 20 min on five occasions at 2 to 3 d intervals. An observer recorded butts initiated by each animal as well as participation in bouts of sparring. Relative to control bulls, immunocastration reduced the frequency of butts initiated (P < 0.05) and participation in sparring bouts (P < 0.05) to levels typically observed in steers (P > 0.05). These observations indicate that active immunization against GnRH reduces the incidence of aggressive behavior in male beef cattle and are consistent with our postulate that immunoneutralization of GnRH is an effective alternative to surgical castration in the management of beef cattle. 3aaggression 3abeef bulls 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aimmunization 3asteers 2aAggression 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentximmunologyxphysiology. 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormoneximmunology 2aImmunity, Activeximmunology 2aImmunization, Secondary 2aMale 2aOrchiectomyxveterinary 2aRandom Allocation 2aTestosteronexblood 2aVaccinationxveterinary 2aWeight Gain1 aAdams, T.E.1 aHuxsoll, C.C.1 aBorgwardt, R.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.411-415dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04073naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002700129245008700156300001600243500002400259520235000283650000902633650001502642650001802657650002002675650001102695650001202706650001102718650002402729650001202753650001702765650000902782650001402791650001202805650002402817650001002841650001302851650001202864650001402876650001602890650001502906650001202921650005502933650001102988650002402999650002503023650000903048650002003057650002603077650001103103650001403114650003403128650003303162650003203195650001203227700001803239700001803257700002003275773011903295852000903414655001203423IND4464265320221121104109.0121005s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446426532DNAL7 a126434822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Velazquez, G.10aGenetic relationships between scrotal circumference and female reproductive traits  ap. 395-401.  aIncludes references  aRecords for yearling scrotal circumference (SC; n = 7,580), age at puberty in heifers (AP; n = 5,292), age at first calving (AFC; n = 4,835), and pregnancy, calving, or weaning status following the first breeding season (PR1, CR1, or WR1, respectively; n = 7,003) from 12 Bos taurus breeds collected at the Meat Animal Research Center (USDA) between 1978 and 1991 were used to estimate genetic parameters. Age at puberty (AP) was defined as age in days at first detected ovulatory estrus. Pregnancy (calving or weaning) status was scored as one for females conceiving (calving or weaning) given exposure during the breeding season and as zero otherwise. The final model for SC included fixed effects of age of dam at breeding (AD), year of breeding (Y), and breed (B) and age in days at measurement as a covariate. Fixed effects in models for AP and AFC were AD, Y, B, and month of birth. Fixed effects in models for PR1, CR1, and WR1 included AD, Y, and B. For all traits, random effects in the model were direct genetic, maternal genetic, maternal permanent environmental, and residual. Analyses for a three-trait animal model were carried out with SC, AP, and a third trait (the third trait was AFC, PR1, CR1, or WR1). A derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood algorithm was used to estimate the (co)variance components. Direct and maternal heritability estimates were 0.41 and 0.05 for SC; 0.16 and 0.03 for AP; 0.08 and 0.00 for AFC; 0.14 and 0.02 for PR1; 0.14 and 0.03 for CR1; and 0.12 and 0.01 for WR1. Genetic correlations between direct and maternal genetic effects within trait were −0.26, −0.63, −0.91, −0.79, −0.66, and −0.85 for SC, AP, AFC, PR1, CR1, and WR1, respectively. Direct genetic correlations between SC and AP and between those traits and AFC, PR1, CR1, and WR1 ranged from −0.15 (between SC and AP) to 0.23 (between AP and WR1). Estimates of heritability indicate that yearling SC should respond to direct selection better than AP, AFC, PR1, CR1, and WR1. Variation due to maternal genetic effects was small for all traits. No strong genetic correlations were detected between SC and female reproductive traits or between AP and the other female traits. These results suggest that genetic response in female reproductive traits through sire selection on yearling SC is not expected to be effective. 3aUSDA 3aalgorithms 3aanimal models 3abreeding season 3abreeds 3acalving 3aestrus 3agenetic correlation 3aheifers 3aheritability 3ameat 3apregnancy 3apuberty 3areproductive traits 3asires 3avariance 3aweaning 3ayearlings 2aAge Factors 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aCattlexanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aScrotumxanatomy & histology 2aSexual Maturationxgenetics 2aWeaning1 aGregory, K.E.1 aBennett, G.L.1 aVan Vleck, L.D.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.395-401dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245006200148300001800210500002400228520155300252650001601805650001001821650002001831650001201851650001301863650000801876650001401884650001001898650001201908650001901920650001701939650001201956650000701968650001901975650001001994650001202004650002702016650001202043650001002055650002702065650001302092650003102105650000902136650002002145650002002165650001002185650001702195700001502212700001702227700001702244773013902261852000902400655001202409IND4464305320221121034518.0121011s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446430532DNAL7 a128174942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpringer, M.P.10aAccelerated chilling of carcasses to improve pork quality  ap. 1464-1472.  aIncludes references  aOur objectives were to determine the optimal accelerated chill time immediately postmortem necessary to improve the quality of pork muscle and to decrease the incidence of pale, soft, and exudative pork. Carcasses from 81 market hogs were cooled either by conventional chill (CC) at 2°C or by accelerated chill (AC) at −32°C for 60, 90, 120, or 150 min, and then placed into a 2°C cooler for the remainder of the 24-h chill period. Loin muscle pH was higher (P < 0.05) for the carcasses that were accelerated chilled longer than 60 min. Although loin visual color, texture, and firmness scores increased (P < 0.05) with AC time, no improvements were noted beyond 60 min. Color, pH, texture, firmness, and CIE L*a*b* values of fresh ham muscles were not (P > 0.05) affected by AC. In addition, AC did not (P > 0.05) affect purge, drip, or thaw loss of fresh products, sensory scores of loins or processed hams (except initial juiciness; P < 0.05), water-holding capacity of processed hams, or processing characteristics of hams. Cooking loss and Warner-Bratzler shear values for hams and loins were not (P > 0.05) affected by AC. Accelerated chilling caused loins to be darker (lower L* value; P < 0.05) and to have lower (P < 0.05) b* values (less yellow) than CC loins. Accelerated chilling increased water-holding capacity in fresh hams, bound water being the greatest (P < 0.05) in the 120- and 150-min AC groups. These results demonstrate that improvements in pork loin quality can be made using freezer-accelerated chilling for carcasses. 3abound water 3acolor 3acooking quality 3acooling 3afirmness 3aham 3ajuiciness 3aloins 3amarkets 3ameat carcasses 3ameat quality 3amuscles 3apH 3ashear strength 3aswine 3atexture 3awater holding capacity 2aAnimals 2aColor 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFreezing 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aQuality Control 2aSwine 2aTime Factors1 aCarr, M.A.1 aRamsey, C.B.1 aMiller, M.F.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.1464-1472dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001400141245011000155300001500265500001500280520127500295650001801570650001601588650001801604650002101622650001801643650001301661650001801674650002301692650002901715650001401744650001501758650001701773650001601790650002001806650001301826650001501839653001901854653001201873653001501885700002001900700002101920773008701941852000902028856008102037930003302118945001302151946001102164655001202175IND2325756920221121023503.0020302e200108  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232575692DNAL7 a10.1007/s0037401003822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarth, G.10aInfluence of soil parameters on the effect of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole-phosphate as a nitrification inhibitor  ap. 98-102.  a2019-12-04  aNitrification inhibitors specifically retard the oxidation of NH4+ to NO2- during the nitrification process in soil. In this study, the influence of soil properties on the nitrification-inhibiting effect of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole-phosphate (DMPP), a newly developed nitrification inhibitor, has been investigated. Based on short-term incubation experiments, where the degradation of DMPP could be largely disregarded, the oxidation of the applied NH4+ was more inhibited in sandy soils compared with loamy soils. The influence of soil parameters on the relative NO2- formation could be described by a multiple regression model including the sand fraction, soil H+ concentration and soil catalase activity (R(2)=0.62). Adsorption studies showed that the binding behaviour of DMPP was influenced markedly by soil textural properties, viz. the clay fraction (r(2)=0.61). The adsorption of DMPP was found to be an important factor for the inhibitory effect on NH4+ oxidation in a short-term incubation (r(2)=0.57). It is concluded that the evaluated soil properties can be used to predict the short-term inhibitory effect of DMPP in different soils. The significance of these results for long-term experiments under laboratory and field conditions needs further investigation. 3asand fraction 3asandy soils 3aclay fraction 3aapplication rate 3ahydrogen ions 3acatalase 3anitrification 3aammonium compounds 3anitrification inhibitors 3aoxidation 3aloam soils 3asoil texture 3adegradation 3aenzyme activity 3anitrites 3aadsorption 0asoil chemistry 0abinding 0aevaluation1 aTucher, S. von.1 aSchmidhalter, U.0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2001 Aug., v. 34, no. 2 p.98-102x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0037401003823Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle03878naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008500145300001800230500002400248520216400272650001002436650001002446650001102456650001202467650001602479650000902495650001402504650001802518650003702536650001802573650000902591650002402600650002802624650001502652650001202667650002102679650002402700650001002724650001202734650001902746650001202765650003402777650001902811650001102830650001702841650003702858650000902895650003202904650002802936650002202964650002302986650001603009700001503025700001603040700001703056700001903073773013903092852000903231655001203240IND4464304620221121015200.0121011s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446430462DNAL7 a128174872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, J.F.10aEvaluation of maternal performance of daughters from high and low milk EPD sires  ap. 1406-1413.  aIncludes references  aAngus bulls (n = 24) were selected for either high or low milk EPD, but with similar growth EPD and mated within location (n = 6) at random to Angus cows. Daughters from these matings were bred to calve first at 2 yr of age to common reference sires across locations. Lactation records for 192 daughters were used to evaluate 12-h milk yield, percentage of milk fat and protein, and weaning weight of offspring. Milk production was measured four times during the lactation at regular intervals within location. Dams were separated from their calves the night before milking and milked with a portable milking machine the next morning to estimate 12-h milk yield. A sample of the milk was collected from each cow and analyzed for percentages of milk fat and protein. Data were analyzed as repeated records of the dam. Fixed effects were location, genetic line of sire, gender of calf within location, and milking period, with postpartum interval used as a covariate. Fixed effects and the random effects of sire of dam nested within line, sire of calf, and year were estimated by REML. Genetic line was an important source of variation for milk yield (P < 0.01) and percentage of milk fat (P = 0.03) but not for percentage of milk protein (P = 0.49). Location was significant for all three milk variables (P < 0.01), but the interactions between line and location were not significant. Gender of calf was significant for milk yield (P = 0.04) but not for percentage of milk fat or protein. Line (P = 0.02), location (P = 0.01), calf gender (P = 0.01), and age at weaning (P = 0.01) were significant sources of variation for weaning weight but the interaction of line and location was not (P = 0.69). The correlation coefficient between the sire’s milk EPD and 12-h milk yield was significantly different from zero (r = 0.56). The difference between the least squares means for high and low lines for milk yield was 0.66 kg/12 h and the difference was 15.3 kg for weaning weight. The results indicate that there was not evidence for a genotype by environment interaction in milk production for daughters from divergent sires selected for high or low milk EPD. 3aAngus 3abulls 3acalves 3acalving 3acorrelation 3acows 3adaughters 3agenetic lines 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aleast squares 3amilk 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 3amilking 3amilking machines 3apostpartum interval 3asires 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHybrid Vigor 2aLactationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aRandom Allocation 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSex Factors1 aBoyd, M.E.1 aBrown, A.H.1 aFranke, D.E.1 aThompson, C.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.1406-1413dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009400127300001800221520146400239650001101703650001201714650001501726650001401741650001101755650002401766650002401790650001101814650001401825650001801839650001301857650001301870650001601883700001801899700003301917700001301950700001501963773009501978852000902073856012202082939003302204946001302237655001202250IND4461871820221121015128.0110929e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446187182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanitkar, A.10aMicrowave-Assisted Extraction of Soybean and Rice Bran Oil: Yield and Extraction Kinetics  ap. 1387-1394.  aMicrowave-assisted solvent extraction has the potential to replace traditional solvent extraction of oils and fats from a variety of feedstock. The purpose of this study was to optimize oil extraction parameters for a batch microwave system from two feedstocks: soybeans and rice bran. Solvent-feedstock mixtures were exposed to microwave radiation for different time-temperature combinations ranging from 60°C to 120°C for up to 20 min with simultaneous magnetic stirring. The solvent (ethanol) to feedstock ratio used was 3:1. After extraction, solid-liquid separation was performed in a vacuum filter, and ethanol was evaporated from the filtrate in a vacuum centrifuge. Results showed that the oil yield changed with temperature and achieved a maximum value in a relatively short time (order of minutes). Continuous exposure after this time did not increase the oil yield. The results compared well with traditional solvent extraction, especially when accounting for the extremely short extraction times (min vs. h). Maximum oil yields of 17.3% and 17.2% at 20 min and 120°C were achieved by microwave extraction as compared to 11.3% and 12.4% using control extraction for soybeans and rice bran, respectively. The major advantage of microwave-assisted solvent extraction is the reduced time of extraction required to obtain approximately 95% of total recoverable oil, with corresponding reduction in energy consumption costs per unit of oil extracted. 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afiltrates 3alipids 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3amixing 3arice bran 3arice bran oil 3asolvents 3asoybeans 3atemperature1 aSabliov, C.M.1 aPālacuppiramaṇiyan̲, Es.1 aLima, M.1 aBoldor, D.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2011 , v. 54, no. 4 p.1387-1394wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=54&issue=4&conf=t&orgconf=t20113Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110929  aOther US 7aarticle03422naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245007400168300001600242520201200258650002002270650001102290650001502301650002102316650002702337650001602364650002902380650001202409650002302421650001302444650002502457650001802482650001402500650001202514650000902526650000902535653002102544653002102565653001302586653001502599700001602614700001302630773014002643852000902783856009202792930003302884946001102917655001202928IND4393776220221121023508.0070805e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439377622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0765.2007.00153.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCAI, Zucong10aEffects of nitrogen fertilization on CH₄ emissions from rice fields  ap. 353-361.  aNitrogen fertilization is essential for achieving high rice yields and is widely practiced in rice cultivation. There is an ongoing discussion on the possible effects of N application on CH₄ emission from rice fields. CH₄ emission is a net consequence of CH₄ production, oxidation and transport from the soil in which the CH₄ is produced to the atmosphere, and the interactions among these processes. Nitrogen influences all the processes of CH₄ emission from rice fields either directly or indirectly and the effects are either negative or positive at the ecosystem, microbial and biochemical level. Because of this complexity and counter-balance among the effects, it is difficult to assess the net N effect on CH₄ emissions from rice fields on a national or global scale. Field measurements also show a contradiction in that positive, negative and no effects of N application on CH₄ emissions have been observed. Nevertheless, it is clear that the effect of N application on CH₄ emission is N-form dependent. Nitrate-based fertilizers are able to mitigate CH₄ emission, but they are rarely applied to rice fields and generally not practicable to mitigate CH₄ emission because of their low use efficiency and stimulatory effect on N₂O emission. In contrast, the application of organic N stimulates CH₄ emission because additional organic carbon is supplied for CH₄ production. However, it is not sufficient to conclude that CH₄ emission intensity would have been decreased by the replacement of organic N, which dominated traditional rice cultivations, with chemical N fertilizers, which are used in current rice cultivations, because the fertilizer replacement has also enhanced rice yields, which in turn affects CH₄ production, oxidation and transport. Establishing quantitative relationships between N status in soil and CH₄ production, oxidation and transport is essential to assess the effects of chemical N fertilizer application on CH₄ emissions from rice fields. 3aadverse effects 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3aemissions factor 3afertilizer application 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidation 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil 0aCH₄ production 0amethane emission 0aN effect 0arice field1 aSHAN, Yuhua1 aXu, Hua.0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2007 Aug., v. 53, no. 4 p.353-361dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0038-07687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0765.2007.00153.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02677naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003400184245009300218300002000311506007600331520118700407506003701594650001301631650001401644650001301658650001401671650002401685650001901709700002001728700001601748700002101764700001901785700002301804700002101827700001401848700002201862700002101884773017601905852000902081856008302090930003302173946001302206655001202219IND4427457720221207121408.0091016e20091013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442745772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09055021062doi7 aPMC27626592pmcid7 a198155312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArancibia-Cárcamo, I.

The trafficking of GABAARs within the endocytic pathway is a key determinant of surface GABAAR number and is altered in neuropathologies, such as cerebral ischemia. However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate this trafficking are poorly understood. Here, we report the subunit specific lysosomal targeting of synaptic GABAARs. We demonstrate that the targeting of synaptic GABAARs into the degradation pathway is facilitated by ubiquitination of a motif within the intracellular domain of the γ2 subunit. Blockade of lysosomal activity or disruption of the trafficking of ubiquitinated cargo to lysosomes specifically increases the efficacy of synaptic inhibition without altering excitatory currents. Moreover, mutation of the ubiquitination site within the γ2 subunit retards the lysosomal targeting of GABAARs and is sufficient to block the loss of synaptic GABAARs after anoxic insult. Together, our results establish a previously unknown mechanism for influencing inhibitory transmission under normal and pathological conditions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aischemia 3alysosomes 3amutation 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3aubiquitination1 aYuen, Eunice Y.1 aMuir, James1 aLumb, Michael J.1 aMichels, Guido1 aSaliba, Richard S.1 aSmart, Trevor G.1 aYan, Zhen1 aKittler, Josef T.1 aMoss, Stephen J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Oct. 13, v. 106, no. 41 p.17552-17557dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09055021063Available from publisher's Web site  a20091016b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02180naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245006200156300001600218500001500234520102400249650002201273650001501295650002101310650002301331650002301354650002401377650002201401650001901423650001501442653002401457653001601481653001901497700001901516773008801535852000901623856008101632930003301713945001301746946001101759655001201770IND2325690120221120231522.0020228e200106  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232569012DNAL7 a10.1007/s0037401003632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoulas, G.10aModelling of microbial degradation of pesticides in soils  ap. 551-557.  a2019-12-04  aBecause the primary factor controlling the persistence of pesticides in soil is microbial transformation, its mathematical modelling deserves attention. Soil persistence and leaching models are very sensitive to the parameters governing sorption and degradation. As a first part of this paper, we will present currently used rate laws for pesticide degradation in soils, essentially based on first-order reaction kinetics. We will discuss how recent knowledge on pesticide microbiology and practical observations like accelerated and stimulated degradation can be included in the description of the degradation process. We discuss the influence of spatial variability and parameter uncertainty on the distribution of the model output. In the last part of the paper, we suggest methodological approaches for studying and describing temperature and moisture effects and for obtaining more realistic values for the first-order rate constant or other biokinetic parameters, which control persistence of pesticides in soils. 3asimulation models 3ametabolism 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3apesticide residues 3asoil microorganisms 3aspatial variation 3abiodegradation 3apesticides 0amathematical models 0apersistence 0amicroorganisms1 aLagacherie, B.0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2001 June, v. 33, no. 6 p.551-557x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0037401003633Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02258naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245014800163300001600311500001500327520092400342650001401266650000901280650001001289650001701299650002001316650001101336650002801347650001401375650002401389650001101413650002301424650001501447650001401462650002701476650001301503653004301516700001601559773007101575852000901646856008601655930003301741945001301774946001301787655001201800IND2060966720221120213041.0971218e199707  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206096672DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.7.7912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPernezny, K.10aEpiphytic populations of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria on pepper: relationships to host-plant resistance and exposure to copper sprays  ap. 791-794.  a2019-12-04  aEpiphytic populations of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria were monitored on leaves and in buds of resistant and susceptible pepper cultivars over five seasons. Epiphytic populations were higher on the susceptible cultivar Jupiter than on the resistant cultivar Boynton Bell in four of the five seasons. In copper-sprayed plots, populations in buds of Jupiter plants were consistently higher than on leaves. In one test, copper sprays reduced X. campestris pv. vesicatoria populations by 99% on leaves, compared with only a 51% reduction in buds. In another test on a commercial pepper farm, no differences were found between populations on resistant and susceptible plants spaced as close as 1.2 m. However, combined data on buds for the three cultivars showed populations were higher than those on leaves on three of four sampling dates. These differences were attributed to the heavy use of copper on this farm. 3acultivars 3abuds 3amaneb 3aepidemiology 3aCapsicum annuum 3acopper 3aXanthomonas vesicatoria 3aepiphytes 3avarietal resistance 3aleaves 3apopulation density 3apopulation 3aincidence 3aenvironmental exposure 3abacteria 0aXanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria1 aCollins, J.0 tPlant disease.g1997 July, v. 81, no. 7 p.791-794x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.7.7913Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03511naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245011600163300001600279500001500295520203800310650001902348650001502367650001102382650004702393650001402440650002302454650001302477650001802490650002002508650002102528650001902549653001602568653002002584653002002604653003702624653002102661653001102682653001202693653001702705653001402722700001502736700001702751773007102768852000902839856008602848930003302934945001302967946001302980655001202993IND2060970520221122035558.0971218e199707  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206097052DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.7.8092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiser, W.J.10aAscochyta fabae and A. lentis: host specificity, teleomorphs (Didymella), hybrid analysis, and taxonomic status  ap. 809-816.  a2019-12-04  aIsolates of Ascochyta fabae from faba bean (Vicia faba) and A. lentis from lentil (Lens culinaris) collected from different countries were used in this study. The Didymella teleomorph (sexual state) of each fungus was induced to develop and mature on inoculated sterile lentil stems. Both fungi were heterothallic, with two mating types, designated MAT1-1 and MAT1-2. When certain isolates of A. fabae and A. lentis were crossed, hybrid pseudothecia developed. Growth, sporulation, colony appearance, morphology, and pathogenicity of the hybrid progeny frequently differed greatly from the parent isolates. Inoculations with single-ascospore progeny from matings among compatible isolates of A. fabae caused disease in faba bean but not in lentil; inoculations with single-ascospore progeny from matings among compatible isolates of A. lentis incited disease in lentil but not in faba bean. Inoculations with single-ascospore progeny from crosses between faba bean and lentil isolates did not induce disease in either host. Asci from crosses between A. fabae and A. lentis mostly contained fewer than eight ascospores that were, on average, larger than those from eight-spored asci. Matings among certain isolates of A. fabae resulted in production of pseudothecia with ascospores considerably larger than is typical for D. fabae. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) banding patterns of Ascochyta isolates from faba bean and lentil are clearly different, and banding patterns from hybrid progeny from crosses between A. fabae and A. lentis confirmed hybridity. RAPD markers proved useful in supporting identifications of ascospore isolates from faba bean to known Ascochyta species.

The pathogenicity tests, morphological characteristics, and RAPD markers indicate that A. fabae and A. lentis represent distinct taxa. D. lentis, with its anamorph, A. lentis, is proposed as a new species that is distinct from D. fabae, with its anamorph, A. fabae. 3afungal anatomy 3aVicia faba 3ablight 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aDidymella 3astrain differences 3acrossing 3apathogenicity 3aAscochyta fabae 3ahost specificity 3aLens culinaris 0acomparisons 0aasochyta blight 0aasochyta lentis 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0ataxonomic status 0agrowth 0astrains 0amating types 0aAscochyta1 aWang, B.C.1 aRogers, J.D.0 tPlant disease.g1997 July, v. 81, no. 7 p.809-816x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.7.8093Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01933naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010400162300001600266500002300282520105600305650002201361650002901383650001101412651001701423773010201440852000901542856004801551939003301599946001101632655001201643IND8500766120221120182952.0850301e198409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850076612DNAL7 a10.1080/026266684094909482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, D.A.13aAn isolated event model based upon direct runoff calculations using an implicit source area concept  ap. 311-325.  aSummary in French.  aAn isolated event flood model is described that is based upon the concept of expanding source areas using an S-curve function to relate the proportion of rainfall that becomes stormflow to the moisture status of the catchment. Some features of the Flood Studies Team IEM4 model (NERC, 1975) are included in the model presented here. The model has been calibrated on a number of observed flood events in semiarid and sub-humid catchments of South Africa. In reviewing the results, the paper assesses not only the level of correspondence between observed and simulated stormflows, but also the stability of the parameters between storms on the same catchment as well as the differences in parameter values between catchments with different physiographic and climatic characteristics. The results are promising and indicate that the model is able to simulate double or multi-peaked hydrographs. Further work is required to test the wider applicability of the model and to investigate the question of parameter estimation when calibration is not possible. 3ahydrologic models 3aatmospheric disturbances 3arunoff 3aSouth Africa0 tHydrological sciences journal.g1984 Sept., v. 29, no. 3 p.311-325wJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626668409490948  a00000000b19850301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02289naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009400143300001600237300002100253520096900274650001101243650001201254650001001266650002001276650003001296650002401326650001801350650004501368650003101413650001901444650001501463650001201478650002101490650002001511650003101531650003401562650005701596650001301653700001401666700001601680773007001696852000901766939003301775946001101808655001201819IND9002037620221120182754.0900507e19900405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900203762DNAL7 a23201272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, S.10aRegulation of mitosis by cyclic accumulation of p80cdc25 mitotic inducer in fission yeast  ap. 549-552.  ap. 549-552. ill.  aThe coordination of somatic cell division with cell size must be accomplished by the accumulation of mitotic inducers or the dilution, in the course of cell growth, of mitotic inhibitors. In fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), cell size at mitosis is determined by expression of the cdc25+ and nim1+ inducer genes and of the inhibitor gene wee1+, which between them regulate the M-phase protein kinase p34cdc2. We now report that both the phosphoprotein product of cdc25+ (p8Ocdc25, with apparent relative molecular mass 80,000) and the corresponding messenger RNA increase in concentration as cells proceed through interphase, peaking at mitosis. We propose that the cell-cycle timing of mitosis in somatic cells is regulated by the cyclic accumulation of the cdc25 mitotic inducer, which on reaching a critical level results in activation of p34cdc2 protein kinase. Accumulation of this inducer could play a part in coordinating cell division with growth. 3ayeasts 3amitosis 3agenes 3agene expression 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 2aCell Cycle Proteins 2aCell Division 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aImmunoblotting 2aInterphase 2aMitosis 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhosphorylation 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSaccharomycetalesxmetabolism 2aSchizosaccharomycesxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aras-GRF11 aNurse, P.1 aRussell, P.0 tNature.g1990 Apr. 5, v. 344, no. 6266 p.549-552x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02413naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010700127300001600234500008900250500001500339520124300354650002301597650001001620650002601630650001401656650001101670650001601681650002001697651002801717651000901745653002801754653002601782653002501808773012801833852000901961930003301970945001302003946001102016655001202027IND2044283420221120182902.0950126e199306  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204428342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, K.M.10aChallenges of trade and agricultural development for East/Central Europe and states of the former USSR  ap. 401-420.  aIn the special issue: Trade and development / edited by M.

The greatest impact will be indirect, through agriculture's contribution to general economic reform and acceleration of regional and global growth. The direct impact on trade in food and fiber will in aggregate consist of a fall in net imports. Most of the decline in net imports will derive from reduction in demand and improved utilization. Potential for productivity increase is substantial, but not all of the increased productivity will be reflected in the traditional supply response of increased production. Instead marginal resources will shift out of farming, and producers will restructure and adopt new technologies in pursuit of lower costs. Shifts in the commodity composition of trade will occur, and the changes in grain and livestock markets will be greatest. If the reform is successful, the former Soviet Union could become a modest net grain exporter instead of a large importer. Wheat would be the leading export grain, and levels of wheat exports and corn imports could become quite sensitive to relative prices on world markets. 3adevelopment policy 3atrade 3aagricultural industry 3alivestock 3agrains 3aagriculture 3aeconomic impact 3aCentral European region 3aUSSR 0aagricultural adjustment 0aagricultural products 0aeconomic development0 tAgricultural economics.g1993 June, v. 8, no. 4 p.401-420aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle03744naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009100130300001600221500008900237500001500326520263900341650002502980650002503005650002603030650001603056650002403072651000903096653001803105653001003123653002503133653003003158773012803188852000903316930003303325945001303358946001103371655001203382IND2044282820221120182945.0950126e199306  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204428282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaustista, R.M.10aTrade and agricultural development in the 1980s and the challenges for the 1990s: Asia  ap. 345-375.  aIn the special issue: Trade and development / edited by M. Petit and A.S.P. Brandao.  a2019-12-05  aAsian developing countries have had varying experiences in trade and agricultural development in the 1980s, attributable in part to their differing stages of economic development and structural characteristics. Other important influences relate to the external economic environment and the policy choices made by their governments not only during the period but also in the preceding decade. The achievements of Asian developing countries under the adverse external conditions of the 1980s are discussed in terms of their macroeconomic and agricultural growth, the commodity structure of agricultural growth their food production and trade, the expansion and diversification of their agricultural exports, and the policy and nonpolicy factors affecting them. Special attention is given to the role of policy reforms implemented in China and the South Asian countries, following similar policy developments in Northeast and Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, toward greater openness in their trade regime and increased private-sector participation in the economy. These reforms have contributed to the observed acceleration in GDP, agricultural, and export growth in the 1980s. However, macroeconomic imbalances have emerged that threaten the sustainability of economic liberalization in those countries. The major challenges for the 1990s also differ among the Asian developing countries. In the industrially advanced Northeast economies of Taiwan and South Korea, the primary need is to ease the transition of the remaining rural population as farm incomes continue to fall and workers move to industrial and service activities. This challenge has to be addressed in the context of growing external pressure to further open their domestic market for agricultural imports. Among the Southeast and South Asian countries, there is a need to reduce the existing policy biases against agriculture, particularly against export crop production. Moreover, China and the South Asian countries face the additional challenges of continuing to deregulate their trade regime and internal markets, and of promoting macroeconomic stability. Despite the external trend recently toward regionalism, Asian developing countries generally seem committed to an open trading system, on which in fact their past impressive economic performance has been predicated. An important challenge for them in the 1990s is to play an active role in arresting and reversing any protectionist tendencies arising from the formation of regional trading blocs and to support multilateral initiatives such as the Uruguay Round that promote global trade liberalization. 3atrade liberalization 3adeveloping countries 3aagricultural products 3aagriculture 3aagricultural policy 3aAsia 0aexternalities 0atrade 0aeconomic development 0ainternational comparisons0 tAgricultural economics.g1993 June, v. 8, no. 4 p.345-375aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01891naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007100168300001600239500002400255520085300279650002701132650001101159650002601170650001001196650001201206650001301218650001901231650000901250650001801259700001801277700001701295700002301312773010001335852000901435856008501444655001201529IND4413457520221120182744.0081205s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441345752DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617080601432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolyanskaya, L.

The central nervous system is formed subsequently from the neurogenic region of the ectoderm, in which progenitor cells of the neuroblasts and ventral epidermis are intermingled. Two classes of genes govern the segregation of neuroblasts and peripheral sensory organs. The pro-neural class of genes, for example, the achaete-scute complex, participates in the initial decision to make each uniquely positioned neuroblast or sensory organ, but are initially expressed in groups of cells. The segregation of a neuroblast or sensory organ from an equivalent group of equipotential cells involves a mechanism of lateral inhibition whereby the future epidermal cells are prevented from engaging in the primary dominant neural fate. In the absence of this inhibitory signal, all cells of the group will become neural by default. The neurogenic class of genes is thought to mediate these cell interactions. Here we report that cells in embryos mutant for shaggy which are unable to adopt any of the early initial fates, instead develop neural characteristics. 3aDrosophila 3amutants 3aembryogenesis 3acentral nervous system 3acells 2aAnimals 2aDrosophilaxembryologyxgenetics. 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aLarva 2aMutation 2aNervous Systemxcytologyxembryology. 2aPhenotype 0aepidermis 0aneuroblasts1 aHeitzler, P.1 aEl Messal, M.1 aSimpson, P.0 tNature.g1989 Oct. 5, v. 341 p.442-444x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02015naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013300166300001600299500002400315520084400339650001801183650001101201650001501212650001801227650001501245650001001260650002501270650001401295650001801309650002601327700002301353700001801376700002101394700002001415773010001435852000901535856008501544655001201629IND4413457120221120170115.0081205s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441345712DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617080601062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikhodyuk, O.

It was shown that strain Z-M001, unlike all other known cultured and uncultured organisms of the Euhalothece group, is extremely natronophilic, and it was named accordingly “Euhalothece natronophila”. In its ecophysiological characteristics, it is comparable to extremely alkaliphilic organotrophic natronobacteria, which is essential for soda ecosystems, because cyanobacteria belong to primary producers. E. natronophila exhibits considerable morphological variability depending on the concentration of carbonates in the medium. The polymorphism of “ E. natronophila” is primarily connected to limitation by utilizable forms of carbon. 3aCyanobacteria 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3aecophysiology 3aecosystems 3alakes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3atrophic relationships1 aGerasimenko, L.

This difference is perhaps unexpected given the similarity in behaviours relating to price levelling in this market, the high cross-price elasticities of demand between these meats, and the relatively greater degree of concentration in the pork market. 3abeef 3apork 3ademand elasticities 3alamb meat 3aAustralia 0awholesale prices 0aretail prices1 aPiggott, N.E.0 tAgricultural economics.g1994 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.307-316aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01915naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012000127300001400247520069200261650002400953650001800977650001900995650002801014650002601042650002401068650002201092650002201114650002401136650001801160650001701178651001501195653001501210653001101225653001601236653002601252653002101278773012801299852000901427930003301436945001301469946001101482655001201493IND2044260620221120160308.0950124e199409  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204426062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaslim, M.A.13aAn analysis of population growth, Green Revolution and terms of trade in the presence of cropsharing in agriculture  ap. 19-28.  aThis explores the welfare effects of some persistent trends in some developing countries on different groups of farmers. It takes a general equilibrium approach in modelling a representative developing economy comprising a manufacturing sector and an agricultural sector where both self-cultivating landlords and tenants carry on production. It is shown that while population growth tends to depress welfare of both the tenant and the landlord, Green Revolution has the opposite effect such that when both trends are present, peasants may or may not be better off. An adverse movement in the agricultural terms of trade reduces welfare of the landlord, but the tenant is made better off. 3aprofits and margins 3asharecropping 3aland ownership 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aagricultural industry 3ainnovation adoption 3awelfare economics 3apopulation growth 3amathematical models 3amanufacturing 3alabor market 3aBangladesh 0aproduction 0atrends 0acomparisons 0arural urban relations 0agreen revolution0 tAgricultural economics.g1994 Sept., v. 11, no. 1 p.19-28aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02436naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010000126300001400226520146100240650002301701650001601724650002401740650003001764650002401794650001901818650002001837650002401857651001101881653001201892773012801904852000902032930003302041945001302074946001102087655001202098IND2044261420221120160123.0950124e199409  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204426142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrisley, W.10aFarmer-to-farmer transfer of new crop varieties: an empirical analysis on small farms in Uganda  ap. 43-49.  aFarmer-to-farmer transfer or dissemination of technologies is a neglected area of research even though successful diffusion of many researcher and farmer-developed technologies is highly dependent upon farmers' private initiatives. This is particularly true in many developing countries where formal market mechanisms used in dissemination are often ineffective. Successful dissemination of new technologies to marginal farmers require greater knowledge and use of indigenous dissemination methods. The determinants of farmer-to-farmer transfer of new bean varieties experimented with by small-scale farmers in Uganda are investigated. Farmers were experimenting with new varieties received through earlier on-farm trials and were transferring small quantities of grain to other farmers for experimental purposes. On-farm trials may thus be an effective, but limited method for diffusing new varieties. Factors directly associated with the transfer decision were farm size and variables identifying a willingness to experiment with new varieties. The Production risk reducing strategies of intercropping and sowing of a larger number of non-climbing bean varieties were negatively associated with the probability to transfer grain. The quantity of grain available to transfer was not associated with the transfer decision. Farmers were not transferring grain of the five varieties at different rates even though significant differences in yield were found. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3asmall farms 3atechnology transfer 3ainformation dissemination 3ainnovation adoption 3avariety trials 3adecision making 3amathematical models 3aUganda 0aacreage0 tAgricultural economics.g1994 Sept., v. 11, no. 1 p.43-49aAgricultural economics (Amsterdam, Netherlands)x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02415naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012300164300001600287500002400303520112700327650001101454650001901465650002901484650002601513650002301539650002601562650001901588650001901607650002801626650001801654650001301672650002001685650001801705700001801723700002101741700001901762700001801781773010001799852000901899856008501908655001201993IND4413457420221120160139.0081205s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441345742DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617080601312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPimenov, N.

As a rule, a more pronounced carbon isotope fractionation (resulting from the metabolism of phytoplankton and anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria) was revealed in the zones of enhanced oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Carbon isotope fractionation at the border between oxidized and reduced waters depends both on the activity of microbial communities and on the dominant species of phototrophic microorganisms. Analysis of the distribution profiles of the isotopic composition of suspended organic matter and dissolved mineral carbon revealed active mineralization of the organic matter newly formed via anoxygenic photosynthesis in the monimolimnion by microbial communities, resulting in the release of isotopically light carbon dioxide. Mineral carbon in the anaerobic zones of highly productive meromictic water bodies is therefore enriched with the light ¹²C isotope. 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adissolved organic matter 3aisotope fractionation 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3astable isotopes 3asurface water1 aLunina, O.

Discriminant function analysis on whole body: water concentration factors (CFs) separated dogfish and turbot in two independent experiments. Classification functions grouped the perciform teleosts, seabream (Sparus aurata) and seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), with turbot and grouped the chondrichthyans, undulate ray (Raja undulata; Rajiformes) and spotted torpedo (Torpedo marmorata; Torpediniformes), with dogfish, thus supporting our hypothesis. Hierarchical classificatory, multi-dimensional scaling and similarity analyses based on the CFs for the nine radiotracers, also separated all three teleosts (that aggregated lower in the hierarchy) from the three chondrichthyan species. The three chondrichthyans were also more diverse amongst themselves compared to the three teleosts. Particular trace elements that were more important in separating teleosts and chondrichthyans were Cs-134 that was elevated in teleosts and Zn-65 that was elevated in chondrichthyans, these differences being due to their differential rates of uptake rather than loss. Chondrichthyans were also higher in Cr-51, Co-60, Ag-110m and Am-241, whereas teleosts were higher only in Mn-54. These contrasts in bioaccumulation patterns between teleosts and chondrichthyans are interpreted in the context of both proximate causes of underlying differences in physiology and anatomy, as well as the ultimate cause of their evolutionary divergence over more than 500million years before present (MyBP). Our results and interpretation point to the possibility that radiation exposure regimes may be influenced by phylogeny, with implications for the adequacy of the marine reference organism approach in marine environmental protection. 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3abioaccumulation 3aphysiology 3amarine environment 3aphylogeny 3adivergent evolution 3aturbot 3atrace elements 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aRajiformes 3aSparus aurata 3aseawater 3aenvironmental protection 3aTorpedo 3aScyliorhinus canicula 2aAnimals 2aCluster Analysis 2aDiscriminant Analysis 2aFishesxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aSeawater 2aTrace Elementsxmetabolism 0aPsetta maxima1 aOberhansli, Francois1 aTeyssie, Jean-Louis0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 July 15, v. 408, no. 16 p.3200-3210dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04572naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100002600192245009600218300001800314500002400332500001500356506007600371520206800447506003702515650001102552650002102563650001302584650000902597650002202606650001902628650001302647650002002660650004002680650003202720650001702752650001602769650002402785650003102809650002002840650003102860650002802891650001302919650002702932650001102959650001502970650001602985650001403001650002203015650002003037650002603057650002403083650001203107650002103119650004203140650003303182650002003215650003703235650001503272650002303287650002403310650006803334650004103402653001603443653003103459700002903490700002403519700002003543773011503563852000903678856009103687655001203778IND4438669020221207134128.0100618s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443866902DNAL7 a204353392pmid7 aPMC34781322pmcid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilvestre, Frédéric12aA proteomic analysis of green and white sturgeon larvae exposed to heat stress and selenium  ap. 3176-3188.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTemperature and selenium are two environmental parameters that potentially affect reproduction and stock recruitment of sturgeon in the San Francisco Bay/Delta Estuary. To identify proteins whose expression is modified by these environmental stressors, we performed a proteomic analysis on larval green and white sturgeons exposed to 18 or 26°C and micro-injected with Seleno-L-Methionine to reach 8µgg⁻ ¹ selenium body burden, with L-Methionine as a control. Selenium and high temperature induced mortalities and abnormal morphologies in both species, with a higher mortality in green sturgeon. Larval proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and differential abundances were detected following spot quantitation and hierarchical cluster analysis. In green sturgeon, 34 of 551 protein spots detected on gels showed a variation in abundance whereas in white sturgeon only 9 of 580 protein spots were differentially expressed (P <0.01). Gel replicates were first grouped according to heat treatment. Fifteen of these spots were identified using MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Proteins involved in protein folding, protein synthesis, protein degradation, ATP supply and structural proteins changed in abundance in response to heat and/or selenium. 40S ribosomal protein SA, FK506-binding protein 10, 65kDa regulatory subunit A of protein phosphatase 2, protein disulfide isomerase, stress-induced-phosphoprotein 1, suppression of tumorigenicity 13 and collagen type II alpha 1, were differentially expressed in high temperature treatment only. Serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 1, creatine kinase, serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 5 and HSP90 were sensitive to combined temperature and selenium exposure. Valosin-containing protein, a protein involved in aggresome formation and in protein quality control decreased more than 50% in response to selenium treatment. Potential use of such proteins as biomarkers of environmental stressors in larval sturgeons could indicate early warning signals preceding population decline.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aserine 3acluster analysis 3aselenium 3agels 3amass spectrometry 3aheat treatment 3asturgeon 3aquality control 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase 3areproduction 3aheat stress 3astructural proteins 3agene expression regulation 3aprotein folding 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aAcipenser transmontanus 3acollagen 3aadenosine triphosphate 3alarvae 3aproteomics 3atemperature 3amortality 3aprotein synthesis 3acreatine kinase 3aAcipenser medirostris 3aprotein degradation 2aAnimals 2aCluster Analysis 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFishesxgrowth & development 2aHot Temperature 2aLarvaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aProteomics 2aSeleniumxtoxicity 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0arecruitment 0ahigh temperature treatment1 aLinares-Casenave, Javier1 aDoroshov, Sergei I.1 aKültz, Dietmar0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 July 15, v. 408, no. 16 p.3176-3188dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02197naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009000126300001800216520124500234650001401479650001801493650002101511650001301532700001701545700001601562700002501578700001501603773009501618852000901713856011501722939003301837946001301870655001201883IND4461868520220225000000.0110928e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446186852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArana, J.I.12aA Proposal to Improve the SAE Standard and OECD Code 4 Standard Code for Testing ROPS  ap. 1189-1197.  aThe great increase in maximum laden mass and recent fatal accidents involving tractors having ROPS tested in accordance with a specific standard have led to the need to evaluate the validity of the current standards for testing ROPS. A ROPS able to meet the requirements of the current tests, but without a rollover safety margin, has been designed. This means that it is possible to manufacture ROPS without sufficient safety but that could still be successfully tested in accordance with the current standards. A proposal has been developed to improve the standards by using the maximum laden mass as the reference mass as well as modifying the coefficients in their formulae. The proposed methodology recognizes the validity of the current Code 4 and SAE J2194 formulae for tractors with additional ballast mass that is less than 35% of their unladen mass. The proposed methodology would provide adequate and homogeneous safety for all tractors, equivalent to the safety provided by the current Code 4 standard for tractors whose maximum laden is 135% of their unladen mass. If the current formulae are not modified, then their validity should be limited to a safety margin of maximum laden mass equivalent to 135% of the reference mass. 3aaccidents 3amanufacturing 3amargin of safety 3atractors1 aAlfaro, J.R.1 aArazuri, S.1 aPonce de León, J.L.1 aJarén, C.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2011 , v. 54, no. 4 p.1189-1197wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/azdez.asp?JID=3&AID=39017&CID=t2011&v=54&i=4&T=13Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110928  aOther US 7aarticle03016naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002200170245013800192300001800330500002400348520157300372650002401945650002301969650001501992650001302007650002202020650001102042650001702053650002002070650002202090650001802112650001302130650001202143650005002155650003902205650002402244650001302268700001702281700002302298700002202321773011502343852000902458856009102467655001202558IND4438668920221120055421.0100618s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443866892DNAL7 a204347562pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeggel, Sebastian10aSublethal toxicity of commercial insecticide formulations and their active ingredients to larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)  ap. 3169-3175.  aIncludes references  aToxic effect concentrations of insecticides are generally determined using the technical grade or pure active ingredient. Commercial insecticide formulations, however, contain a significant proportion (>90%) of so-called inert ingredients, which may alter the toxicity of the active ingredient(s). This study compares the sublethal toxicity of two insecticides, the pyrethroid bifenthrin, and the phenylpyrazole fipronil, to their commercial formulations, Talstar® and Termidor®. Both insecticides are used for landscape treatment and structural pest control, and can be transported into surface water bodies via stormwater and irrigation runoff. We used larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), to determine effects on growth and swimming performance after short-term (24h) exposure to sublethal concentrations of pure insecticides and the respective formulations. Significantly enhanced 7d growth was observed at 10% of the 24h LC₁₀ (53μgL⁻ ¹) fipronil. Swimming performance was significantly impaired at 20% of the 24h LC₁₀ (0.14μgL⁻ ¹) of bifenthrin and 10% of the 24h LC₁₀ of Talstar® (0.03μgL⁻ ¹). Fipronil and Termidor® led to a significant impairment of swimming performance at 142μgL⁻ ¹ and 148μgL⁻ ¹ respectively, with more pronounced effects for the formulation. Our data shows that based on dissolved concentrations both formulations were more toxic than the pure active ingredients, suggesting that increased toxicity due to inert ingredients should be considered in risk assessments and regulation of insecticides. 3aPimephales promelas 3aactive ingredients 3abifenthrin 3afipronil 3ainert ingredients 3alarvae 3apest control 3arisk assessment 3arunoff irrigation 3asurface water 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCyprinidaexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aSwimming1 aWerner, Inge1 aConnon, Richard E.1 aGeist, Juergen P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 July 15, v. 408, no. 16 p.3169-3175dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02752naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126300001800221520154400239650001001783650001101793650001301804650001201817650001401829650001501843650001001858650002401868650001101892650001301903650000901916650001201925650001801937700001701955700001901972700001901991700001602010700002002026773009502046852000902141856012202150939003302272946001302305655001202318IND4461869220221120055354.0110928e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446186922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, J.R.10aTransport of Trace Elements in Runoff from Unamended and Pond-Ash Amended Feedlot Surfaces  ap. 1269-1279.  aThe use of pond ash (fly ash that has been placed in evaporative ponds for storage and subsequently dewatered) for feedlot surfaces provides a drier environment for livestock and furnishes economic benefits. However, pond ash is known to have high concentrations of trace elements, and the runoff water-quality effects of feedlot surfaces amended with pond ash are not well defined. For this study, two experimental units (plots) were established in eight feedlot pens. Four of the pens contained unamended soil surfaces, and the remaining four pens had pond-ash amended surfaces. Before each test, unconsolidated surface material was removed from four of the plots for each of the amendment treatments, resulting in eight unamended plots and eight pond-ash amended plots. Concentrations for 23 trace elements were measured in cattle feedlot surface material and in the runoff water from three simulated rainfall events. Trace element concentrations in surface material and runoff did not differ between surface consolidation treatments. Amending the feedlot surface material with pond ash resulted in a significant increase in concentration for 14 of the 17 trace elements. Runoff concentrations for 21 trace elements were affected by pond-ash amendment. Sixteen of 21 trace element concentrations that differed significantly were greater in runoff from unamended soil surfaces. Concentrations in runoff were significantly correlated with concentrations in feedlot surface material for boron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and uranium. 3aboron 3acattle 3afeedlots 3afly ash 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3aponds 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3aselenium 3asoil 3auranium 3awater quality1 aGilley, J.E.1 aCottrell, G.L.1 aWoodbury, B.L.1 aBerry, E.D.1 aEigenberg, R.A.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2011 , v. 54, no. 4 p.1269-1279wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=54&issue=4&conf=t&orgconf=t20113Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110928  aOther US 7aarticle03209naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010000129300001800229520207000247650001402317650001302331650001002344650001702354650001102371650001102382650002602393650001502419650001002434650001602444650001802460650001102478650001502489700002002504700001502524773009502539852000902634856012202643939003302765946001302798655001202811IND4461869020221120033037.0110928e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446186902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, B.10aAircraft Calibration for Pest Eradication Operations Using Pesticides Formulated as Solid Baits  ap. 1245-1254.  aThe objective of any aerial (or ground-based) pesticide application is to achieve a biological objective while minimizing costs and environmental and social impacts. A requirement for achieving this objective is to spread the material at a preset rate and at an acceptable uniformity while minimizing the total aircraft travel distance and operation time, which equates to cost. The aircraft calibration procedure is an important step in developing operational parameters to meet these criteria. Many factors influence the variability of pesticide deposition during a calibration procedure. However, the calibration process is actually designed to minimize much of this variation. Therefore, pesticide deposit variation during an operation is likely to be significantly higher than expected from the calibration process. The consequence of variable deposition is overdosing and underdosing. Underdosing is a particular concern for a pest eradication operation because survivors could re-establish the population. A new modeling approach proposed for aircraft calibration more accurately quantifies the level of deposit variability likely to result from different operational specifications. Using an operational mosquito eradication program as a case study, the new analysis highlighted that, for this scenario, the proportion of the target area underdosed was not extremely sensitive to either the sampling area size or the lane separation. Nevertheless, reducing the lane separation to 18 m from the current specification of 20 m reduced the predicted underdosed area by about 2% to 3% depending on the target area size (sample area). Without further analysis, the trade-off between a 2% to 3% reduction in underdosing (i.e., the probability of eradication) versus an increased operational cost from increased flying time is a subjective decision. A significant result was the very high sensitivity of the underdosed area to the standard deviation of wind speed. This result means there is a large advantage in maintaining a low wind speed during the application. 3aCulicidae 3aaircraft 3abaits 3acase studies 3aflight 3amodels 3apesticide application 3apesticides 3apests 3aprobability 3asocial impact 3atravel 3awind speed1 aKimberley, M.O.1 aGous, S.F.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2011 , v. 54, no. 4 p.1245-1254wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=54&issue=4&conf=t&orgconf=t20113Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110928  aOther US 7aarticle02941naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245010700181300001600288500002400304500001500328520160100343650001401944650001001958650002301968650001401991650002602005650002402031650001902055650001202074650000702086650001702093650001802110650001102128650001502139650001202154651001002166653001902176700002302195700002402218700002402242700002502266773011602291852000902407856005502416655001202471IND4402585820221120033111.0080309e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440258582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.01004.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-C.alviño, D.10aCopper distribution and acid-base mobilization in vineyard soils and sediments from Galicia (NW Spain)  ap. 315-326.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn northern Spain and elsewhere in the world, many vineyards are located on steep slopes and are susceptible to accelerated soil erosion. Contaminants, notably Cu, originating from repeated application of copper-based fungicides to the vines to prevent mildew, are transported and stored in the sediments deposited close to valley bottoms. In this study, the contents and distribution of Cu in 17 soil samples and 21 sediment samples collected from vineyard stands were determined. In addition, the effect of pH on Cu release from vineyard soils and sediments was quantified. The total Cu content (CuT) in the soils varied between 96 and 583 mg kg⁻¹, and was between 1.2 and 5.6 times greater in sediment samples. The mean concentration of potentially bioavailable Cu (CuEDTA) in the sediments was 199 mg kg⁻¹ (46% of CuT), and was 80 mg kg⁻¹ (36% of CuT) in the soils. Copper bound to soil organic matter (CuOM) was the dominant fraction in the soils (on average, 53% of the CuT), while in sediment samples CuOM values varied between 37 and 712 mg kg⁻¹ and were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than in the soils. Copper associated with non-crystalline inorganic components (CuIA) was the second most important fraction in the sediments, in which it was 3.4 times greater than in the soils. Release of Cu due to changes in the pH followed a U-shaped pattern in soils and sediments. The release of Cu increased when the pH decreased below 5.5 due to the increased solubility of the metal at this pH. When the pH increased above 7.5, Cu and organic matter were released simultaneously. 3asediments 3avines 3asediment transport 3avineyards 3apesticide application 3asoil organic matter 3avineyard soils 3avalleys 3apH 3asoil erosion 3asoil sampling 3ametals 3asolubility 3amildews 3aSpain 0aorganic matter1 aPateiro-M.oure, M.1 aLópez-P.eriago, E.1 aArias-E.stévez, M.1 aNóvoa-M.uñoz, J.C.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2008 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.315-326dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.01004.x 7aarticle03164naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001400146245013100160300001600291500001500307520162400322650001101946650001401957650000901971650003001980650001802010650001902028650001102047650002502058650002302083650001202106650001902118650001402137650001102151651001202162651001202174653001402186653001802200653001702218653001502235653002002250653003702270653001902307653001002326700002002336700002802356773007202384852000902456856008602465930003302551945001302584946001302597655001202610IND2062729420221120023558.0980325e199709  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206272942DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.9.9832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, W.10aPathogenicity of a species of Phomopsis causing a shoot blight on peach in Georgia and evaluation of possible infection courts  ap. 983-989.  a2019-12-04  aA species of Phomopsis was isolated consistently from blighted shoots of peach trees in Georgia and Alabama. Isolates of the fungus caused characteristic cankers on current season's shoots of Babygold-7 peach trees when wounded or nonwounded dormant buds, breaking buds, and natural or artificially-created leaf scars were inoculated with conidia of the fungus. Mean canker length for the isolates was 35 mm 30 days after inoculation. No disease developed on control trees. There was no significant difference between the canker length on inoculated wounded dormant buds (59 mm) and nonwounded breaking buds (54 mm). However, cankers from both sites of inoculation were significantly longer than those resulting from inoculated artificially-created leaf scars (33 mm), natural leaf scars (33 mm), and non-wounded dormant buds (30 mm). There was no significant difference in virulence among the 5 isolates of Phomopsis sp. tested, and multi-locus DNA fingerprint analysis resulted in a similarity coefficient of 0.94 among the isolates. Additionally, results of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions sequence comparisons for the isolates were consistent with the multi-locus polymerase chain reaction profiles, and the nucleotide sequences of the ITS region were identical for all 5 isolates. This is the first documentation of the pathogenicity of a Phomopsis sp. associated with shoot blight of peach in Georgia. Rapid development of disease in breaking buds indicates that they may be the primary site of invasion by the fungus. Natural leaf scars and dormant buds may also serve as possible infection courts. 3ablight 3ainfection 3abuds 3afungal diseases of plants 3apathogenicity 3aPrunus persica 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3aDNA fingerprinting 3astrains 3afungal anatomy 3aDiaporthe 3ashoots 3aAlabama 3aGeorgia 0aPhomopsis 0abreaking buds 0adormant buds 0aleaf scars 0ainfection sites 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0asymptomatology 0ascars1 aStevenson, K.L.1 aPardo-Schultheiss, R.A.0 tPlant disease.g1997 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.983-989x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.1997.81.9.9833Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02809naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245010500178300001600283500002400299500001500323520109800338650000901436650001601445650001001461650001001471650001401481650001301495650001101508650000901519650002001528650001801548650002501566650000901591650001001600650002701610650001401637650001001651650002501661650001401686650001201700650002801712650001901740650003701759650002601796650002201822650003501844650001001879650004101889653001701930700001401947700001301961700001501974773011201989852000902101856008502110655001202195IND4413467520221120021338.0081205s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441346752DNAL7 a187094932pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-008-8198-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, D.

The groups received the same basal diet supplemented with 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg lead, respectively. The malondialdehyde and glutathione levels, antioxidant enzymes activities, and zinc/copper superoxide dismutase (Zn/Cu SOD) mRNA content in the liver were determined to evaluate the lead hepatic intoxication caused by the lead. Results showed the increased lipid peroxides level and the reduced glutathione content, along with a concomitant decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Moreover, the level of hepatic Zn/Cu SOD mRNA was also significantly reduced. We suggest potential mechanism for lead intoxication in liver as follows: lead causes parallel decrease in Zn/Cu SOD mRNA and activities of antioxidant enzymes, leading to the declined ability of scavenging free radicals with excessive production of lipid peroxides, which seriously damages the hepatic structure and function. 3adiet 3aglutathione 3aboars 3aliver 3alandraces 3acatalase 3acopper 3alead 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3asuperoxide dismutase 3azinc 3aDuroc 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aperoxides 3agenes 3aantioxidant activity 3apoisoning 2aAnimals 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aLeadxtoxicity 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPeroxidesxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgenetics 2aSwine 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 0aantioxidants1 aLi, W.

Specifically, the virulent (velogenic) NDV is aparticular threat because it has now occurred frequently worldwide. The outbreaks caused by highly virulent NDV in waterfowl and especially in goose flocks, have led to greater concern in recent years as aquatic birds were previously resistant to most virulent NDV strains from chickens. The molecular determinants of host tropism, virulence and emergence of NDV isolated from diseased goose flocks are poorly understood. In the present study, we rescued a highly virulent NDV isolated from a goose using the reverse genetics approach. Infectious virus was successfully generated by cotransfection of a full-length cDNA clone of the NDV strain ZJ1 with helper plasmids. The recombinant NDV was indistinguishable from the parental wild-type virus with respect to its growth kinetics in cell culture as well as its biological properties. A recombinant NDV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated, and GFP was subsequently detected in cells and various organs from the infected chickens. 3achickens 3aNewcastle disease 3agreen fluorescent protein 3acomplementary DNA 3acell culture 3aflocks 3ageese 3aplasmids 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aviruses 3awaterfowl 3avirulence 3apathogens 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aChick Embryo 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aNewcastle disease virusxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aPoultry 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgenetics 2aViral Vaccinesxgenetics 2aVirulencexgenetics 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aHu, S.

The kinetics data showed that degradation of caffeine, theobromine, and 7-methylxanthine followed Michealis-Menten kinetics. The values of K m are low for caffeine and 7-methylxanthine and high for theobromine. Degradation of caffeine and theobromine was enhanced in the presence of NADH and NADPH, whereas the degradation of 7-methylxanthine was unaffected. Among the various metal ions tested, Fe²⁺ was found to enhance the rate of degradation for all three substrates, whereas Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ inhibited the degradation of caffeine and theobromine but not 7-methylxanthine. The differences in kinetic parameters and cofactor requirement suggest the possibility of the involvement of more than one N-demethylases in the caffeine catabolic pathway in Pseudomonas sp. The induced cells can serve as effective biocatalysts for the development of biodecaffeination techniques. 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aPseudomonas 3acaffeine 3acopper 3airon 3ametal ions 3atheobromine 3azinc 2aCaffeinexmetabolism 2aCoenzymesxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aMetalsxpharmacology 2aNADxpharmacology 2aNADPxpharmacology 2aPseudomonasxmetabolism 2aTheobrominexmetabolism 2aXanthinesxmetabolism1 aGummadi, Sathyanarayana N.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2007 July, v. 55, no. 1 p.56-60dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-006-0588-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04424naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012300185300001400308500002400322520199900346650000802345650001102353650001602364650001302380650001602393650001302409650001302422650002202435650003702457650003802494650001002532650001902542650001102561650003002572650003702602650001402639650001702653650001702670650001602687650001402703650001502717650001002732650000902742650004002751650003102791650001002822650002102832650002902853650004202882650002202924650003102946650002702977650008603004650006103090650004003151650001103191650003203202650001103234650001103245650002003256650003003276650003203306651001203338651002703350700002303377700002203400700002103422773009303443852000903536856008503545655001203630IND4393276520221123041213.0070722s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439327652DNAL7 a175544692pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-006-0572-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Gallas, Nazek10aGenotypic and Phenotypic Profiles of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli Associated with Acute Diarrhea in Tunis, Tunisia  ap. 47-55.  aIncludes references  aNo past studies of acute diarrhea in Tunisia have examined the phenotypic and genotypic profiles of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) isolates. We determined 65 ETEC isolates derived from a total of 327 E. coli isolates collected from a previous study (acute diarrheal and healthy persons, children and adults n = 214) and 32 E. coli isolates derived from an acute diarrheal outbreak in Kabaria-Ennour city, Tunis. All E. coli isolates were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ETEC virulence genes: sta (heat-stable toxin gene) and elt (heat-labile toxin gene). Seventy-two percent (47 of 65) of ETEC strains expressed the sta gene only, 21.5% (14 of 65) expressed the elt gene and 6.1% (4 of 65) expressed both genes. For the outbreak isolates, the elt gene was predominant (10 isolates out of 14). Ganylioside GM1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (GM1-ELISA) was used to validate the PCR results and this was confirmed by dot blot assay. The same results were obtained. The most common colonization factors (CFs) were CFA/I (44.6%) and coli surface antigen 6 (CS6) (11%), and 44.6% of the isolates showed no association with either CFAs. Resistance of ETEC isolates to tetracycline (38.5%), streptomycin (26%), and β-lactam agents (ticarcillin 26%, amoxicillin 24.6%, cephalotin 21.5%) was common. Regarding serotypes, the majority of ETEC isolates serotyped as O86:H- (n = 16), O128:H2 (n = 11), and O127:H21 (n = 10). Other serotypes found were O111:H- (n = 6) and O126: H- (n = 5). DNA macrorestriction fragment analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the XbaI enzyme was conducted to investigate the epidemiological clonal relationship among ETEC isolates. Major patterns were identified among which some of outbreak ETEC isolates belonged. These data suggest that a proportion of acute diarrhea in Tunis represents the confluence of small epidemics by clonality-related ETEC isolates that are transiently introduced or that persist in our community. 3aDNA 3aadults 3aamoxicillin 3aantigens 3acephalothin 3achildren 3adiarrhea 3adisease outbreaks 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3aheat stability 3apeople 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aserotypes 3astreptomycin 3atetracycline 3aticarcillin 3avirulence 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDiarrheaxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aEnterotoxinsxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFimbriae Proteinsxanalysis 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aVirulence Factorsxgenetics 3aTunisia 0aTunisiaxepidemiology.1 aAbbassi, Saleh Med1 aHassan, Assia Ben1 aAissa, Ridha Ben0 tCurrent microbiology.g2007 July, v. 55, no. 1 p.47-55dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-006-0572-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02732naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245009800188300001400286500002400300520137200324650002701696650001801723650001301741650001701754650004001771650004801811650007401859650004201933650003201975650002302007650002502030650003602055650003102091700002502122773009302147852000902240856008502249655001202334IND4393276220221123041236.0070722s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439327622DNAL7 a175345612pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-006-0543-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhleifat, Khaled M.10aEffect of Some Nitrosative Agents on the Growth of vgb-bearing Enterobacter aerogenes Strains  ap. 30-35.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of transnitrosation intermediate between S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (NACysNO) and cysteine on the growth of vgb-bearing Enterobacter aerogenes was investigated using three parameters: the ratio of the specific growth rates, the inhibition zone, and α-amylase synthesis for the culture exposed to stressors to that of the same stressor-free cultures. The effect of NACysNO/cysteine on the growth of Enterobacter strains was distinctive as compared with the CysNO, NACysNO, and their combination. At a higher concentration (2 mM), the extents of inhibition based on the μNACysNO/cysteine/μno stress ratio for these cultures were 57%, 62%, and 68% for VHb-expressing, parental, and pUC9-harboring cells, respectively. The inhibition caused by 2 mM NACysNO in the presence of 1 mM cysteine in all bacterial strains was almost twofold that achieved by NACysNO alone. Based on the diameter of the inhibition zone and α-amylase productivity, the four compounds (NACysNO/Cysteine, CysNO, NACysNO, and their combinations) affected the E. aerogenes strains in a concentration-dependent and negative manner. This negative effect was lower in vgb-bearing than vgb-lacking strains. Thus, sulfur-to-sulfur transnitrosation was an efficient NO release and significantly (P < 0.05) affects the growth of Enterobacter strains, to a lesser extent in vgb-bearing strains. 3aEnterobacter aerogenes 3aalpha-amylase 3acysteine 3anitric oxide 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aEnterobacter aerogenesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aHemeproteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aModels, Biological 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aNitroso Compoundsxpharmacology 2aalpha-Amylasesxmetabolism1 aAl-Mustafa, Ahmed H.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2007 July, v. 55, no. 1 p.30-35dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-006-0543-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04708naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245016600151300001600317500002400333520255300357650001302910650002102923650001802944650002802962650001102990650001803001650002003019650001203039650002303051650002003074650001203094650002203106650001303128650000703141650001903148650002303167650001103190650004003201650001603241650004703257650001203304650002803316650002103344650002203365650005303387650001803440650002103458650004303479650003003522650003603552650001703588650003103605650001903636650000903655650002003664650002203684650001203706651001303718651000903731700001703740700001903757700001903776700001603795700001703811773013703828852000903965655001203974IND4464294720221123030754.0121010s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446429472DNAL7 a127230712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoonmaker, J.P.10aEffect of source of energy and rate of growth on performance, carcass characteristics, ruminal fermentation, and serum glucose and insulin of early-weaned steers  ap. 843-855.  aIncludes references  aSeventy-three crossbred steers (initial BW = 170.5 ± 5.5 kg) from The Ohio State University (Exp. 1) and 216 crossbred steers (initial BW 135.4 ± 4.4 kg) from the University of Illinois (Exp. 2) were used to determine the effect of source of energy and rate of growth on performance, carcass characteristics, and glucose and insulin profiles on early-weaned steers. Effects of the diets used in Exp. 1 and 2 on ruminal pH and VFA concentrations were quantified using ruminally fistulated steers (Exp. 3). Cattle were weaned at an average age of 119 d in all experiments and were allotted by age, BW, and breed to one of four diets: high-concentrate, fed ad libitum (ALCONC), high-concentrate fed to achieve a gain of either 1.2 kg/d (1.2CONC) or 0.8 kg/d (0.8CONC), or high-fiber, fed ad libitum (ALFIBER). At 218 d of age, all steers were placed on the ALCONC diet until slaughter. Steers were implanted with Compudose at the initiation of all experiments and with Revalor-S when they were estimated to be 100 d from slaughter. When steers in Exp. 1 averaged 181 and 279 d of age, serum samples were collected to determine glucose and insulin concentrations. Steers were slaughtered when a fat thickness of 1.27 cm was reached (Exp. 1) or after 273 d on feed (Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, days in the feedlot (P < 0.01) and age at slaughter (P < 0.01) were lowest for ALCONC and ALFIBER steers, and greatest for 0.8CONC steers. Overall, ADG was greatest for ALCONC and lowest for 0.8CONC steers; feed efficiency was lowest (P < 0.01) for ALFIBER steers. Final BW did not differ (P > 0.57) among treatments. At 181 and 218 d of age, serum insulin was increased (P < 0.10) and intramuscular fat percentage was greatest (P < 0.07), respectively, for ALCONC steers. In Exp. 2, overall ADG (P < 0.06) and final BW (P < 0.04) were greatest for ALCONC and lowest for 1.2CONC and 0.8CONC steers. Overall feed efficiency was greatest for 0.8CONC and lowest for ALFIBER (P < 0.01). Growing phase diet did not affect marbling score at 218 d of age or at slaughter (P > 0.81). In Exp. 3, differences in ruminal pH after feeding may have been a consequence of increasing acetate (ALFIBER), propionate (ALCONC), or a combination of VFA (0.8CONC and 1.2CONC), respectively (diet × time after feeding, P < 0.10). Controlling growth by limit- feeding a high-concentrate diet for only 100 d does not extend the growth curve of early-weaned steers or enhance intramuscular fat deposition at slaughter compared to ad libitum intake of a high-concentrate or high-fiber diet. 3aacetates 3aage at slaughter 3ablood glucose 3acarcass characteristics 3aenergy 3afat thickness 3afeed conversion 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3ahigh fiber diet 3ainsulin 3aintramuscular fat 3amarbling 3apH 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3asteers 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histology 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Composition 2aBody Constitution 2aCattlexbloodxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEdible Grain. 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysis 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aWeaning 3aIllinois 3aOhio1 aCecava, M.J.1 aFaulkner, D.B.1 aFluharty, F.L.1 aZerby, H.N.1 aLoerch, S.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.843-855dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010300147300001600250500002400266520150900290650001401799650002501813650001401838650001201852650002201864650000901886650001601895650001201911650001901923650003001942650001201972650004301984650003702027650001102064650002002075650001302095650001602108650001402124650004502138650001602183650001202199651001002211700001802221773013702239852000902376655001202385IND4464296820221122230621.0121010s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446429682DNAL7 a127230852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, A.K.10aFender design and insulation of farrowing huts: Effects on performance of outdoor sows and piglets  ap. 955-964.  aIncludes references  aTwo studies assessed sow and litter performance when design features of farrowing huts varied. A fender is a structure that extends out the front of the hut to create a veranda that prevents young piglets from leaving. In Exp. 1, 206 lactating sows and their litters were used to assess litter performance and the time required to process litters for two fender designs (short wooden [WS] vs. tall metal with a board front [MT-b]) and insulation status (insulated [IN] vs. uninsulated [UN]) farrowing huts. A significant fender × insulation interaction was observed for total litter weaning weight. Lighter litters weaned (P = 0.013) from WS fenders with UN huts compared with the other treatments. Fender design did not (P > 0.05) influence the time required to process a litter with one stockperson. Less total time (P = 0.001) was required to process a litter when two people were present (10.60 ± 0.74 min) compared with one stockperson (14.52 ± 0.74 min). There were no (P > 0.05) differences between IN and UN huts for temperature and relative humidity measurements. In Exp. 2, 331 lactating sows and their litters were used to determine sow and litter performance when using one of two fender front designs (boards [MT-b] vs. roller [MT-r]). The front design of the fender did not influence (P > 0.05) most litter performance measures. We conclude that fender design, fender fronts, and insulation effects did not have large influences on sow and litter performance in a West Texas environment. 3afarrowing 3ainsulating materials 3alactation 3apiglets 3arelative humidity 3asows 3atemperature 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxgrowth & development 2aFacility Design and Construction 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aHumidity 2aLitter Size 2aPregnancy 2aSwinexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTemperature 2aWeaning 3aTexas1 aMcGlone, J.J.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.955-964dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007100125300001400196500001500210520147700225650001301702650002401715650001801739650001801757650001201775651001501787653001001802653001101812653001501823773008801838852000901926939003301935946001301968655001201981IND9200837720221122230838.0920218s1989    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920083772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, J.13aAn analysis of the California market for organically grown produce  ap. 22-27.  a2019-12-05  aThe market value for organically grown produce in California was estimated to be at least 34 to 68 million dollars at wholesale prices in 1987. This market is rapidly growing. A 41 percent increase in the value of organically grown produce was observed in 1987. When this analysis was completed in early 1988, it was estimated that the wholesale value of the market could exceed $300 million by 1992. A sample analysis of 1986-1987 price and volume for organically grown broccoli showed relatively steady prices and a volume increase of over 50 percent, indicating a similar growth in market demand. Prices for organically grown produce are significantly higher than for conventional produce; however, in spite of high weekly volume volatility, organic prices appear to be less volatile than prices for conventional produce. This paper proposes that the collection, reporting, and analysis of organic produce market data be continued and improved and that new sources of data be integrated to ensure continued availability of timely market information. Availability of more market information should increase efficiency and aid the development of the organic produce industry. The paper also proposes that overall trends in the organic produce industry be systematically monitored by Federal-State Market News and that the increased use of market information by organic growers, growers considering the transition, and other interested parties in the industry be promoted. 3abroccoli 3awholesale marketing 3amarket prices 3aorganic foods 3amarkets 3aCalifornia 0afruit 0atrends 0avegetables0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g1989, v. 4, no. 1 p.22-27x0889-18937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03794naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245014300147300001600290500002400306520229900330650001402629650001902643650001502662650001502677650001602692650000902708650001502717650002602732650001202758650004002770650002302810650004202833650001102875650001102886650006002897650003802957650003702995650003103032650005603063650001703119700001503136700001703151700001603168773011903184852000903303655001203312IND4464296720221122230718.0121010s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446429672DNAL7 a127230842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerskin, M.S.12aA laser-based method to measure thermal nociception in dairy cows: Short-term repeatability and effects of power output and skin condition  ap. 945-954.  aIncludes references  aTo validate a laser-based method to measure thermal nociception in dairy cows (e.g., for the use in studies on stress-induced analgesia), we performed three experiments to observe the behavioral responses to a computer-controlled CO2 laser beam applied to the skin on the caudal aspect of the metatarsus. In Exp. 1, effects of power output (0, 1.3, 1.8, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 W) on nociceptive responses were examined using 18 dairy cows kept and tested in tie stalls. Increasing the power output affected the latencies to respond (decreasing latencies, P ≤ 0.01), types of response (less nonresponding and more kicking, P < 0.0001), and behavior during (increasing frequency of tail flicking, P = 0.003) and between single laser exposures (increasing frequency of kicking, P = 0.02). Therefore, behavioral responses to a laser stimulus seem to be a valid measure of nociception in dairy cows. Repeatability within 15 min was investigated in Exp. 2 using n = 36 dairy cows kept and tested in tie stalls and a power output of 1.8 W. The variables’ latency to move the exposed leg and frequency of tail flicking during laser exposure showed the highest level of repeatability (0.50 and 0.38, respectively). However, retesting at t = 15 min led to increased responses in terms of shorter latencies to respond (P ≤ 0.05), increased kicking (P = 0.05), and tail flicking (P = 0.02), which probably can be explained by sensitization. Effects of power output (1.0 vs. 1.8 W) and skin condition (naked vs. intact) were examined in Exp. 3 on 11 group-housed dairy cows, tested just outside their home pen. Increasing the power output and shaving off hair led to increased responses as seen by shorter latencies to respond (P < 0.0001), less nonresponding (P < 0.0001), and increased kicking (P = 0.0003), as well as reduced intra- and interindividual variability (P ≤ 0.04). In conclusion, the results of these experiments suggest that behavioral responses to laser stimulation are a valid and reliable measure of nociception in dairy cows, especially when applied on naked skin, both in the home environment and just outside a group pen. The fact that repeated testing in itself at t = 15 min led to increased responses means that the test will be a conservative measure of stress-induced analgesia. 3aanalgesia 3acarbon dioxide 3adairy cows 3ametatarsus 3anociception 3atail 3atie stalls 2aAnalgesiaxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxradiation effects 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aFemale 2aLasers 2aPain Measurementxinstrumentationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPain Thresholdxradiation effects 2aReaction Timexradiation effects 2aReproducibility of Results 2aStress, Physiologicalxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aTime Factors1 aMuller, R.1 aSchrader, L.1 aLadewig, J.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.945-954dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009500145300001600240500002400256520194200280650001602222650001502238650001402253650002302267650002402290650000902314650002302323650001802346650001402364650002002378650001002398650001502408650001202423650001502435650003502450650004002485650003102525650002302556650002302579650004302602650004302645650005502688650002502743650005402768700001702822700001702839700001702856773013702873852000903010655001203019IND4464297020221122180839.0121010s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446429702DNAL7 a127230872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca, S.10aSlow fiber cluster pattern in pig longissimus thoracis muscle: Implications for myogenesis  ap. 973-983.  aIncludes references  aRecent evidence implicates fiber type proportions as playing a role in meat eating quality, and in pigs it has been suggested that the slow oxidative fibers contribute to both juiciness and tenderness. The fiber distribution in pigs is different from that found in most other species, in which the various types of skeletal muscle fiber are distributed in a “checkerboard” pattern, because in pigs the slow oxidative fibers have a clustered distribution. The initial processes leading to fiber clustering are likely to occur during myogenesis, but the precise mechanistic aetiology of this patterning and whether the slow oxidative fiber clusters occur in a random or ordered fashion is unknown. In the present study longissimus thoracis muscle from Large White crossbred pigs was sampled at the 10th rib, 48 h postmortem. Transverse cryo-sections were cut and histochemically stained to allow the identification of the main muscle fiber types: slow oxidative, fast glycolytic, and fast oxidative glycolytic. Images of the sections were captured and analyzed using point processes and Voronoi Tesselations to examine the randomness and spatial distribution of the clusters of slow oxidative fibers found in pig longissimus thoracis muscle. The results showed that an assumption of complete spatial randomness can be rejected and that a mathematical model incorporating a minimum distance of 1.7 to 2.0 μm between cluster centers produced fiber patterns similar to those observed in the original transverse sections of the muscle. In addition, if it assumed that the central fiber in each cluster is derived from primary myoblast progenitors, these results suggest that there may be some degree of repulsion between the primary fibers during the initial stages of cluster formation. The mechanistic basis of such repulsion is not clear, but it is speculated that secreted factors, such as sonic hedgehog or myostatin may play a role. 3aLarge White 3aglycolysis 3ajuiciness 3alongissimus muscle 3amathematical models 3ameat 3amuscle development 3amuscle fibers 3amyostatin 3askeletal muscle 3aswine 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aGlycolysis 2aHistocytochemistryxveterinary 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aMeatxanalysisxstandards. 2aModels, Biological 2aMuscle Development 2aMuscle Fibers, Fast-Twitchxphysiology 2aMuscle Fibers, Slow-Twitchxphysiology 2aMuscle, Skeletalxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aPoisson Distribution 2aSwinexanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development.1 aWilson, I.J.1 aHorgan, G.W.1 aMaltin, C.A.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.973-983dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002400141245004200165300001600207500001500223520106200238650002101300650001301321650001601334650002301350650001901373650001901392650001301411650003201424650001601456653001601472653001601488700002401504700002001528700001801548773008801566852000901654856008101663930003301744945001301777946001101790655001201801IND2325689520221122180738.0020228e200106  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232568952DNAL7 a10.1007/s0037401003682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiren-Lehr, S. von.10aDegradation of isoproturon in biobeds  ap. 535-540.  a2019-12-04  aThe fate of isoproturon [N,N-dimethyl-N'-[4-(1-methylethyl)phenyl]urea] in biobeds with and without inoculation with the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was studied.

The decrease was even larger in biobeds inoculated with the white rot fungus P. chrysosporium. After 28 days, total extractable isoproturon decreased by 78%, and after 100 days >99% had disappeared in the inoculated biobeds. However, the studies with 14C-isoproturon showed that 30% of the initially recovered 14C-isoproturon remained in the non-inoculated biobeds as non-extractable residues. As no studies with 14C-isoproturon were performed in inoculated biobeds, it is unclear if the higher rate of disappearance was due to higher biodegradation or higher formation of bound residues. 3aisotope labeling 3asorption 3aisoproturon 3aherbicide residues 3abioremediation 3abiodegradation 3aextracts 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3ametabolites 0adegradation 0ainoculation1 aCastillo, M. del P.1 aTorstensson, L.1 aScheunert, I.0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2001 June, v. 33, no. 6 p.535-540x0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0037401003683Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle03068naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245008300144300001600227500002400243520158400267650001401851650001601865650001201881650002001893650002401913650001001937650001701947650001801964650002001982650001502002650001002017650003002027650001202057650001302069650003402082650003602116650001102152650001802163650002302181650002002204650002402224650002302248650002602271650001402297650003002311650001402341651001102355700001402366773013702380852000902517655001202526IND4464296520221122160127.0121010s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446429652DNAL7 a127230822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhocas, F.10aEvaluation models and genetic parameters for calving difficulty in beef cattle  ap. 933-938.  aIncludes references  aCalving difficulty was analyzed under threshold and linear models considering either a fixed or random herd-year effect. The aim of the study was to compare models for predicting breeding values according to the size of herd-year groups. When simulating data sets with small herds, in order to obtain an unbiased evaluation under a nonrandom and negative association of sire and herd effects, the best model for a practical evaluation was the fixed linear model. Field data included 246,576 records of the largest Charolais herds in France. Models were compared using the correlations of estimated breeding values between the different models. Although the best model from a theoretical point of view was a threshold model with a fixed herd-year effect, a linear model with a fixed herd-year effect was the best choice from a practical point of view for predicting direct effects for calving difficulty in beef cattle and was a sufficient choice for predicting the associated maternal effects for data set with large herds. Correlations between direct estimated breeding values under the reference model and the fixed linear model and the random threshold model were 0.94 and 0.91, respectively.

C2H2-reducing activity in samples from either an anaerobic glucose-limited or an O2-limited diazotrophic chemostat culture was completely inhibited by exposure to a dissolved O2 concentration (DOC) of 1.5 micromolars or above. Subsequently, under anaerobic conditions, C2H2-reducing activity returned in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. The amount of activity returning never reached 100% of the initial anaerobic activity before O2 treatment. The degree of reversibility was inversely proportional to the log of DOC during exposure and was decreased by increasing the time of exposure to O2 (about 60% reversibility occurred after a 20 min exposure to 6 micromolars-O2). The failure to obtain complete recovery of activity was apparently not due to inactivation of the very O2-sensitive pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase (nifJ product) which provides electrons for nitrogenase activity in vivo. Samples from the O2-limited culture behaved similarly to those limited by glucose. Thus, 'training' of the organism to use O2 during growth does not influence the tolerance of nitrogenase to O2. Since the behaviour towards O2 reported here for K. pneumoniae differs from that known to occur in Azotobacter, the mechanism of protection of nitrogenase from O2 damage may differ in these organisms. 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anitrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3aoxygen 3aanaerobes 3adissolved oxygen 0ainhibition1 aHill, S.0 tJournal of general microbiology.g1993 June, v. 139, no. pt. 6 p.1307-1314x0022-12877nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle01635naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245004300143300001600186520088000202650001301082650004401095650002301139653001701162700002001179773008001199852000901279930003301288945001301321946001101334655001201345IND2057611120221122031431.0970611e199610  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205761112DNAL7 a89225882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWajant, H.10aHydroxynitrile lyases of higher plants  ap. 611-617.  aRelease of HCN from cyanogenic glycosides is due to the cleavage of the carbohydrate moiety by beta-glucosidases to yield the corresponding alpha-hydroxynitrile, which dissociates spontaneously into HCN and a carbonyl compound, or by action of an alpha-hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL). A short review of the regulation of the catabolism of cyanogenic glycosides during cyanogenesis and germination of cyanogenic plants is given. The major biochemical properties of HNLs purified from various species of higher plants are summarized. Thereafter the phylogenetic relationship, molecular structure and catalytic mechanism of these enzymes are discussed. Finally we give an overview of recent progress in the use of HNLs as biocatalysts for the synthesis of optically active alpha-hydroxynitriles which are important building blocks in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. 3anitriles 2aAldehyde-Lyasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxenzymology 0acyanohydrins1 aEffenberger, F.0 tBiological chemistry.g1996 Oct., v. 377, no. 10 p.611-617x1431-67307nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02157naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245018600132300001600318520134200334650002101676650002301697700001401720700001401734773007701748852000901825930003301834945001301867946001101880655001201891IND2060568720221122004545.0971118e199703  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206056872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesserschmidt, A.10aImplications for the catalytic mechanism of the vanadium-containing enzyme chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis by X-ray structures of the native and peroxide form  ap. 309-315.  aImplications for the catalytic mechanism of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis have been obtained from the crystal structure of the native and peroxide forms of the enzyme. The X-ray structures have been solved by difference Fourier techniques using the atomic model of the azide chloroperoxidase complex. The 2.03 angstroms crystal structure (R = 19.7%) of the native enzyme reveals the geometry of the intact catalytic vanadium center. The vanadium is coordinated by four non-protein oxygen atoms and one nitrogen (NE2) atom from histidine 496 in a trigonal bipyramidal fashion. Three oxygens are in the equatorial plane and the fourth oxygen and the nitrogen are at the apexes of the bipyramid. In the 2.24 angstrom crystal structure (R = 17.7%) of the peroxide derivate the peroxide is bound to the vanadium in an eta 2-fashion after the release of the apical oxygen ligand. The vanadium is coordinated also by 4 non-protein oxygen atoms and one nitrogen (NE2) from histidine 496. The coordination geometry around the vanadium is that of a distorted tetragonal pyramid with the two peroxide oxygens, one oxygen and the nitrogen in the basal plane and one oxygen in the apical position. A mechanism for the catalytic cycle has been proposed based on these X-ray structures and kinetic data. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry1 aPrade, L.1 aWever, R.0 tBiological chemistry.g1997 , v. 378, no. 3/4 p.309-315x1431-67307nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02361naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009100125300001400216500013200230520107200362650001201434650001001446650001201456650001101468650001201479650000901491650001401500650001401514650002101528650001301549650002601562650002301588650001401611650000901625650001101634650001301645650000901658700001601667700001501683700001501698773014301713856005001856852000901906655001201915IND4502465620221121235422.0150511e20150112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450246562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnes, J.10aCharacterization of nutrient disorders of Fuchsia Ã hybrid 'Gartenmeister Bonstedt'  ap. 49-57.  aPaper presented at the International Conference and Exhibition on Soilless Culture, held January 12, 2015, Singapore, Singapore  aFuchsia Ã hybrida âGartenmeister Bonstedtâ plants were grown in silica sand culture to induce and photograph nutritional disorder symptoms.

We bioassayed winter and summer bees for aggressive and non-aggressive individuals. Bees in winter could not be distinguished by task group, but bees in summer were segregated into nurses and guards. JH titers were correlated with aggressive behavior at two levels. First, winter bees and summer nurses, known to have lower JH titers, both showed less aggression toward foreign bees than did summer guards. Second, aggressive individuals had significantly higher JH titers than did non-aggressive bees within each colony. Inter-colonial variation in aggressiveness was maintained during summer and winter, suggesting a genetic basis for these differences. An alarm pheromone test further substantiated the existence of inter-colonial differences. We found significant variation in JH titers among different colonies, but this variation was not significantly associated with colony-level aggressiveness. The correlation between JH and levels of aggressiveness within a colony suggests a regulatory role for JH, but variation among colonies involves factors other than JH. 3aApis mellifera 3ahoney bee colonies 3acolony defense 3ajuvenile hormones 3ahormonal regulation 3aseasonal variation 3aworker honey bees 0aguard honey bees 0ahoney bee division of labor1 aHuang, Z.Y.1 aBreed, M.D.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2001 Nov., v. 47, no. 11 p.1243-1247x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01273naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006600128300001600194520056300210650002800773650002900801700001700830700001700847773007700864852000900941930003300950945001300983946001100996655001201007IND2060567720221120190433.0971118e199703  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206056772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeuefeind, T.10aPlant glutathione S-transferases and herbicide detoxification  ap. 199-205.  aGlutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and reactive endogenous compounds.

Here, we have determined the importance of PDI to both spore germination and vegetative cell division. To vary the concentration of PDI in the ER, we used plasmids that direct the expression of rat PDI fused at its N terminus to either the alpha-factor pre-pro segment or the alpha-factor pre sequence, and fused at its C terminus to either the mammalian (KDEL) or the yeast (HDEL) ER retention signal. Classical yeast genetic (tetrad) analyses, and plasmid loss and plasmid shuffling experiments were used to evaluate the ability of these constructs to complement haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in which the endogenous PDI1 gene had been deleted. We find that basal levels of PDI in the ER are sufficient for vegetative growth. In contrast, high levels of PDI in the ER are required for efficient spore germination. Thus, catalysis of the unscrambling of nonnative disulfide bonds in cellular proteins is more important during spore germination than during vegetative cell division. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aAnimals 2aCell Divisionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxenzymology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxgenetics 2aHaploidy 2aImmunoblotting 2aIsomerasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOligopeptidesxgenetics 2aPlasmids 2aProtein Disulfide-Isomerases 2aProtein Sorting Signals 2aRats 2aReceptors, Peptidexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSpores, Fungalxenzymologyxphysiology.1 aSturley, S.L.1 aRaines, R.T.0 tBiological chemistry.g1997 May, v. 378, no. 5 p.431-437x1431-67307nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02582naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245007800142300001600220520165900236650001301895650002801908650005001936650001101986650001901997650003802016650002802054650002902082773007902111852000902190930003302199945001302232946001102245655001202256IND2059868720221120170809.0970924e199708  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205986872DNAL7 a93774722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun, V.10aAvoidance of iron toxicity through regulation of bacterial iron transport  ap. 779-786.  aUnder oxic conditions and at pH 7, ferric iron is insoluble, and complex formation of Fe3+ with ligands is required to supply cells with iron. Bacteria and fungi synthesize and secrete low-molecular-weight compounds, termed siderophores, that bind Fe3+. Certain human pathogens take up iron from human transferrin, lactoferrin, hemoglobin, and heme. The ferric siderophores are actively transported into bacterial cells by highly specific transport systems. In Gram-negative bacteria, the ferric siderophores and iron released from the host proteins are actively transported across the outer membrane (OM). The electrochemical potential of the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) energizes transport across the outer membrane, which requires an energy-transducing device, consisting of the proteins TonB, ExbB and ExbD, from the CM to the OM. Active transport across the CM is energized by ATP hydrolysis. Transport is regulated at the level of gene transcription. In Gram-negative bacteria, this is controlled by the Fur protein, in most gram-positive bacteria, by the DtxR protein. Fur and DtxR act as repressors when loaded with Fe2+. In the cytoplasm, iron is released from the siderophores by reduction to Fe2+, and the siderophores are either inactivated or secreted. The intracellular iron is built into heme and non-heme iron proteins, and a small proportion is incorporated into bacterioferritin, but most of the iron is present in a poorly defined state. Iron overload results in iron toxicity, mainly due to the formation of hydroxyl radicals that strongly react with all kinds of biomolecules, of which DNA damage has the most deleterious consequences. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aIronxtoxicity 2aIron Chelating Agentsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSiderophoresxmetabolism0 tBiological chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 378, no. 8 p.779-786x1431-67307nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02229naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002300138245013200161300001600293520089900309650001201208650002301220650003001243650001501273650001001288650001001298650001701308650003601325650002501361650001101386650001901397651001001416653001901426700001701445700001701462700002001479700002301499700001601522773008701538852000901625856007801634930003301712945001301745946001301758655001201771IND2326756920221120095637.0020426e200110  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232675692DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028717152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarēndr̲an, Ke.,10aNontimber forest product extraction, utilization and valuation: a case study from the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, southern India  ap. 528-538.  aWe evaluated the diversity, social, and economic aspects of nontimber forest product (NTFP) collection in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR), in southern India. The NBR is a region known for its floral andfaunal diversity, as well as an area with increasing human pressure. Fifty to 75% of the households (HH) in rural areas gather a diversity of forest products. Dominant NTFPs contributed 25–60% of the average annual per capita household income from NTFPs. The mean annual per capita household income from NTFPs ranges between Rs. 134 and Rs. 4955. The mean annual income per hectare ranges from Rs. 93 in the montane zone to Rs. 3780 in the moist deciduous. NTFPs contribute 15–50% of the annual per capita income of rural households. Ethnicity plays an important role in the collection of NTFPs and ethnic tribes derive a large proportion of their annual per capita income from NTFPs. 3aforests 3aconservation areas 3anontimber forest products 3aharvesting 3aflora 3afauna 3abiodiversity 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aindigenous knowledge 3aincome 3asocioeconomics 3aIndia 0asustainability1 aMurthy, I.K.1 aSuresh, H.S.1 aDattaraja, H.S.1 aRavindranath, N.H.1 aSukumar, R.0 tEconomic botany.g2001 , v. 55, no. 4 p.528-538wJournal:jnl44652x0013-00017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028717153Available from publisher's Web site  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01877naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245007600209300001600285520071800301592002801019650002501047650003301072650001801105650001501123650001701138653001401155653001601169653001701185653001601202653001901218700005801237773013501295856008801430852000901518655001201527IND60622928520221117073501.0190131e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062292852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrzes, Guido1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7740-388510aReshoring and environmental sustainability: An unexplored relationship?  ap. 481-482.  aOffshoring manufacturing activities to low-cost countries has been an industry mantra for decades. Some companies have started to re-think this supply chain configuration choice; bringing production back home. Reshoring or backshoring production has seen increased interest. This evolution poses a major question for sustainable supply chain management scholars: what is the relationship between reshoring, or global supply chain reconfiguration, and environmental sustainability at firm, country, and global levels? In this paper we propose a set of potential research directions facing this question. Main aspects of reshoring, including motivations, implementation and impact are all discussed in this context.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aenvironmental sustainability 3amanufacturing 3amotivation 3asupply chain 0aReshoring 0aBackshoring 0aSupply Chain 0aEnvironment 0aSustainability1 aSarkis, Joseph1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0143-804X0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Feb., v. 141 p.481-482dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001800172245012000190300001800310520114700328592002801475650001801503650002701521650002001548650002201568650001201590650001101602650002301613650000901636650001501645650001901660650001601679650000901695650000901704650001001713650002201723650001401745650001201759650002001771650001201791650001601803650000901819650001201828650000901840650003601849650003201885650004501917650003801962650002602000650001602026700001902042700002102061700002202082700001902104700002402123773008602147856008902233852000902322655001202331IND4466550620221117235844.0141110e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446655062DNAL7 a223568582pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuinot, Diana10aLong-term effect of temperature on bioaccumulation of dietary metals and metallothionein induction in Sparus aurata  ap. 1215-1221.  aPrevious studies have demonstrated that the commercial feed of aquacultured fish contains trace amounts of toxic and essential metals which can accumulate in tissues and finally be ingested by consumers. Recently rising temperatures, associated to the global warming phenomenon, have been reported as a factor to be taken into consideration in ecotoxicology, since temperature-dependent alterations in bioavailability, toxicokinetics and biotransformation rates can be expected. Sparus aurata were kept at 22°C, 27°C and 30°C for 3months in order to determine the temperature effect on metallothionein induction and metal bioaccumulation from a non-experimentally contaminated commercial feed. A significant temperature-dependent accumulation of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb) and iron (Fe) was found in liver, together with that of manganese (Mn), Fe and Zn in muscle. Hg presented the highest bioaccumulation factor, and essential metal homeostasis was disturbed in both tissues at warm temperatures. An enhancement of hepatic metallothionein induction was found in fish exposed to the highest temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3abioaccumulation factor 3abioavailability 3abiotransformation 3acadmium 3acopper 3afeed contamination 3afish 3afish feeds 3aglobal warming 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3alead 3aliver 3along term effects 3amanganese 3amercury 3ametallothionein 3amuscles 3atemperature 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aLiverxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aMetallothioneinxmetabolism 2aMetalsxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aMusclesxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aSea Breamxmetabolism 2aTemperature1 aUreña, Rocío1 aPastor, Agustín1 aVaró, Inmaculada1 aRamo, Jose del1 aTorreblanca, Amparo0 tChemosphere.g2012 June, v. 87, no. 11 p.1215-1221dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04147naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001700154245010000171300001600271500002000287500001500307520235200322592002802674650002302702650001502725650001502740650002202755650002602777650001202803650002602815650001502841650001802856650001902874650002202893650002202915650002602937650001902963650002302982650002203005650001703027650001403044650004903058650004003107650002203147650002403169650001203193650001303205650002403218651001503242651001203257653001703269653002203286700002003308700001703328773009603345852000903441856007103450655001203521IND4398120320221120215412.0170626e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439812032DNAL7 a175367012pmid7 a10.1890/05-01442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorpinen, S.10aEffects of nutrients, herbivory, and depth on the macroalgal community in the rocky sublittoral  ap. 839-852.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aWe studied the interacting roles of nutrient availability and herbivory in determining the macroalgal community in a rocky littoral environment. We conducted a factorial field experiment where we manipulated nutrient levels and herbivory at two sublittoral depths and measured macroalgal colonization and the following young assemblage during the growing season. At the community level, grazing reduced algal colonization, though the effect varied with depth and its interaction with nutrient availability varied in time. In shallow water, the total density of macroalgae increased in response to nutrient enrichment, but the ability of grazers to reduce macroalgal density also increased with the nutrient enrichment, and thus, the community could not escape from the top‐down control. In deep water, the algal density was lower, except in July when nutrient enrichment caused a very dense algal growth. Grazing at the greater depth, though effective, was generally of smaller magnitude, and in July it could not limit algal recruitment and growth. Species richness peaked at the intermediate nutrient level in deep but not in shallow water during most of the growing season. Grazing had no effect on diversity of the algal community at either depth and only a minor effect on species richness at the greater depth. Opportunistic and ephemeral algae benefited from the nutrient enrichment but were also grazed to very low densities. Slowly growing and/or perennial species colonized poorly in the nutrient enriched treatments, and depending on the species, either suffered or indirectly benefited from herbivory. For all species, effects of nutrients on colonization depended on depth; usually both nutrient and herbivory effects were more pronounced at the shallow depth. We conclude that grazers are able to reduce macroalgae over a large range of nutrient availabilities, up to 12‐fold nutrient enrichment in the current experiment, and that the sublittoral depth gradient generates variation in the algal community control exerted by both herbivory and nutrient availability. Thus temporal and spatial variability in both top‐down and bottom‐up control and in their interaction, especially along the depth gradient, may be crucially important for producer diversity and for the successional dynamic in a rocky sublittoral environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3amacroalgae 3aperennials 3aplant communities 3anutrient availability 3agrazing 3abotanical composition 3aherbivores 3aplant density 3agrowing season 3aplant competition 3aspatial variation 3afield experimentation 3aeutrophication 3acolonizing ability 3aFucus vesiculosus 2aBiodiversity 2aEcosystem 2aEukaryotaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aPlant Development 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSeasons 2aSeawater 2aSpecies Specificity 3aBaltic Sea 3aFinland 0aplant growth 0aspecies diversity1 aJormalainen, V.1 aHonkanen, T.0 tEcology.g2007 Apr., v. 88, no. 4 p.839-852dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/05-01443Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03180naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245011600167300001500283520161100298592002801909650001101937650001901948650001401967650002901981650001302010650002202023650001802045650001102063650002402074650001702098650002302115651001002138651001102148651002102159653003002180653002502210653004302235653002202278653002002300700001302320700005202333700002202385700006302407773011902470856008802589852000902677655001202686IND60622928620221117073507.0190131e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062292862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Wen14aThe impact of cap-and-trade mechanism and consumers’ environmental preferences on a retailer-led supply Chain  ap. 88-100.  aGovernments and consumers are paying more attention to environmental protection. China, Korea, and several European countries have implemented market-based cap-and-trade systems to reduce carbon emissions. At the same time, consumers are willing to pay more for low-carbon products. The decisions of manufacturers and retailers may be impacted by these factors. This paper considers a scenario with a model economy under the effects of a cap-and-trade policy, with consumers who prefer low-carbon products, and develops an evolutionary game (EG) model to examine the evolution of behaviors for powerful retailers (such as Amazon, Gome, Walmart, etc.) and manufacturers in a retailer-led supply chain. In such a supply chain, the retailers can choose whether or not to promote low-carbon products and manufacturers can choose whether or not to reduce carbon emissions. A Stackelberg game structure is used to identify the optimal decisions for manufacturers and retailers. A model is developed to investigate the stability of the equilibrium solutions of the evolutionary game. System dynamics is used to simulate and analyze dynamic and transient behaviors, and is used to simulate the evolutionary game in a Chinese appliance industry. The simulation results show that the emissions cap, the market price of carbon credits, and the consumers’ preferences for low-carbon products are key factors influencing the retailers’ and manufacturers’ behavior. To increase long-term profits for both retailers and manufacturers, the retailers and the manufacturers should make sustainable decisions in tandem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3aemissions 3aenvironmental protection 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amarket prices 3amodels 3aprofits and margins 3asupply chain 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 3aEurope 3aKorean Peninsula 0aRetailer-led supply chain 0aCap-and-trade system 0aConsumers’ environmental preferences 0aEvolutionary game 0aSystem dynamics1 aMu, Dong1 aZhao, Fu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5195-868X1 aMendis, Gamini P.1 aSutherland, John W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2118-09070 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Mar., v. 142 p.88-100dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009400174300001800268520144900286592002801735650001201763650001301775650001901788650001501807650002501822650001201847650002501859650002301884650001401907650002001921650001901941650001401960650001401974650001001988650001501998650001502013650001002028650001502038700002202053700002102075700002202096773009502118856008502213852000902298655001202307IND60113969820221118205423.0141112e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011396982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2011.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Iaconi, Claudio10aBio-chemical treatment of medium-age sanitary landfill leachates in a high synergy system  ap. 2322-2329.  aMunicipal landfill leachates are considered to be one of the types of wastewater with the greatest environmental impact because of the high concentrations of ammonium, organic matter and salts which characterize them. The most critical steps are usually the removal of recalcitrant pollutants and ammonia. A recently developed process based on ozone enhanced biological degradation, carried out in an aerobic granular biomass system (SBBGR – Sequencing Batch Biofilter Granular Reactor), was tested at lab-scale for treating a typical medium-age landfill leachate. The results have shown that ozonation greatly improves the biological treatment's effectiveness, allowing the current limits for discharging into the sewer system to be met by using a specific ozone dose of 600mg O₃/Lᵢₙfₗᵤₑₙₜ; an operating cost of about 4€ per m³ of leachate was obtained. A strong synergy between chemical and biological oxidation was observed with an O₃cₒₙₛᵤₘₑd/CODᵣₑₘₒᵥₑd ratio as low as 0.24. Molecular analysis allowed the microbial composition of the granular biomass to be defined and showed the establishment of stable nitrogen-removing bacterial populations throughout the SBBGR operation. Moreover, the study further confirmed the SBBGR's ability to effectively overcome the problem of filamentous bacteria overgrowth, which, in contrast, dramatically affects the effluent quality in conventional systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiofilters 3abiological treatment 3abiomass 3aenvironmental impact 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3aoperating costs 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3apollutants 3apopulation 3asalts 3awastewater1 aDe Sanctis, Marco1 aRossetti, Simona1 aMancini, Annalisa0 tProcess biochemistry.g2011 Dec., v. 46, no. 12 p.2322-2329dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245013600185300001600321520133700337592002801674650001601702650002101718650002801739650001801767650001701785650001501802650001001817650001001827650002601837650002101863650001201884650001301896650001401909650001201923650002901935650001401964650002201978650001202000650003502012650003102047650003302078650008502111650002702196650001102223650004302234650005402277650001802331650003002349650003902379650003002418650000902448650002402457650002402481650002502505650001202530650003402542650002202576650004402598650001402642650001702656700003002673700001702703700002502720700002502745700001902770700002402789700002702813700002002840700002502860700002502885700002102910700003202931773010002963856008103063852000903144655001203153IND4480932720221117235814.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448093272DNAL7 a206738062pmid7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2010.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKmetzsch, Lívia14aThe GATA-type transcriptional activator Gat1 regulates nitrogen uptake and metabolism in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans  ap. 192-199.  aNitrogen uptake and metabolism are essential to microbial growth. Gat1 belongs to a conserved family of zinc finger containing transcriptional regulators known as GATA-factors. These factors activate the transcription of Nitrogen Catabolite Repression (NCR) sensitive genes when preferred nitrogen sources are absent or limiting. Cryptococcus neoformansGAT1 is an ortholog to the Aspergillus nidulansAreA and Candida albicans GAT1 genes. In an attempt to define the function of this transcriptional regulator in C. neoformans, we generated null mutants (gat1Δ) of this gene. The gat1 mutant exhibited impaired growth on all amino acids tested as sole nitrogen sources, with the exception of arginine and proline. Furthermore, the gat1 mutant did not display resistance to rapamycin, an immunosuppressant drug that transiently mimics a low-quality nitrogen source. Gat1 is not required for C. neoformans survival during macrophage infection or for virulence in a mouse model of cryptococcosis. Microarray analysis allowed the identification of target genes that are regulated by Gat1 in the presence of proline, a poor and non-repressing nitrogen source. Genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, iron uptake, cell wall organization and capsule biosynthesis, in addition to NCR-sensitive genes, are Gat1-regulated in C. neoformans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aCandida albicans 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aanimal models 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3adrugs 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amicrobial growth 3amutants 3anitrogen 3apathogens 3aproline 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence 3azinc finger motif 2aAnimals 2aAspergillus nidulansxgenetics 2aCandida albicansxgenetics 2aCryptococcosisxmicrobiology 2aCryptococcus neoformansxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGATA Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aMacrophagesxmicrobiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMicroarray Analysis 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRegulon 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVirulence 2aZinc Fingers1 aStaats, Charley Christian1 aSimon, Elisa1 aFonseca, Fernanda L.1 aOliveira, Débora L.1 aJoffe, Luna S.1 aRodrigues, Jessica,1 aLourenço, Rogério F.1 aGomes, Suely L.1 aNimrichter, Leonardo1 aRodrigues, Marcio L.1 aSchrank, Augusto1 aVainstein, Marilene Henning0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2011 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.192-199dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2010.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014400163300001600307520149600323592002801819596011901847596005501966596005802021596007502079650002402154650002002178650002402198650001402222650002402236650004302260650002302303650001102326650001602337650001702353650001002370650001802380650002302398650001902421650001602440650001002456650000902466650001102475700002002486700001102506700002002517700001602537700001902553700001602572700001902588700002202607700001902629773012802648856008202776852000902858655001202867IND60660381320221122060410.0190823e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066038132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-019-04136-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bao10aIdentification of phytotoxic metabolites released from Rehmannia glutinosa suggest their importance in the formation of its replant problem  ap. 439-454.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The yield and quality of medicinal tubers of Rehmannia glutinosa are seriously restricted by replanting problems. However, the origin and identification of the potential allelochemicals associated with this issue have not been well described. Therefore, in a series of related studies, we aimed to identify the key phytotoxic metabolites released from R. glutinosa. METHODS: R. glutinosa residues were harvested and extracted for metabolic profiling and bioassay-directed identification. Metabolites in the leaf, tuber, and soil surrounding R. glutinosa roots were profiled using high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole/time of flight mass spectormeter. A Petri dish-filter paper and modified Parker bioassay were used to evaluate the phytotoxicity of plant residues and candidate allelochemicals. RESULTS: Seventeen metabolites specific to R. glutinosa were identified/annotated using non-targeted metabolic profiling combined with known standards. Assay results suggested an iridoid glycoside and several phenylethanoid glycosides as key allelochemicals originating from R. glutinosa. CONCLUSION: Identification of bioactive metabolites in planta and in the rhizosphere has increased our understanding of the phytochemistry of R. glutinosa. Further evaluation of the soil persistence and ecological functions of these bioactive compounds will be important for determination of the specific mechanisms associated with R. glutinosa replanting issues.  aPublisher supplied data  a324-1122yb028cThe Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University  a81603243cThe National Science Foundation of China  a2017YFC1700705cThe National Key R&D Program of China  a2017J01804cThe Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China 3aRehmannia glutinosa 3aallelochemicals 3abioactive compounds 3abioassays 3aecological function 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airidoid glycosides 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3apaper 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant residues 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil 3atubers1 aWeston, Paul A.1 aGu, Li1 aZhang, Bingyong1 aLi, Mingjie1 aWang, Fengqing1 aTu, Wanqian1 aWang, Jianming1 aWeston, Leslie A.1 aZhang, Zhongyi0 tPlant and soil.g2019 Aug., v. 441, no. 1-2 p.439-454dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04136-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100006200180245016500242300001800407500002000425506007600445520153000521592002802051506003702079650002202116650002102138650001102159650001002170650001202180650001902192650001002211650001202221650001802233650002302251700003202274700001902306700001602325773015102341856007302492852000902565655001202574IND60607695120221207074443.0180731e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060769512DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.91362doi7 aPMC60992572pmcid7 a297811522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Houcke, Jasper1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1098-538X10aQuality perception, purchase intention, and the impact of information on the evaluation of refined Pacific cupped oysters (Crassostrea gigas) by Dutch consumers  ap. 4778-4785.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Oyster refinement using land‐based pond systems is a new activity in the Dutch oyster sector. It increases the oyster's tissue weight and changes its sensorial properties. However, the response of Dutch consumers towards refined oysters is unknown. The research aim was to gain insight into the importance of oyster quality parameters, drivers for oyster consumption, and acceptance of refined oysters by Dutch consumers, taking into account the information given to them about the product and process. RESULTS: Taste, texture, and odor are the most important oyster quality characteristics for Dutch consumers. The outcome of questionnaires showed that willingness to buy and pay is influenced by factors such as the oysters' country of origin, cultivation area, and flavor profile. Refinement did not affect willingness to buy and pay. Furthermore Dutch consumers seem to have a preference for the flavor profile of refined oysters. Consumer evaluation showed that refined Pacific cupped oysters were perceived as sweeter compared with non‐refined oysters. When information on the cultivation process was disclosed, overall appreciation of refined oysters by consumers increased. CONCLUSION: New insights in the importance of oyster quality characteristics for Dutch consumers are generated that can be used in the development of refined Pacific cupped oysters. © 2018 The Authors.

This study investigates the effects of boundary-spanning search on innovation capability. Specifically, it examines the mediating and moderating effects of network ties and absorptive capacity on boundary-spanning search and innovation in Chinese companies. We constructed a theoretical model of an organization&rsquo;s boundary-spanning search and innovation capability and distributed a survey questionnaire to a sample of specific industries with upstream and downstream relations in Sichuan Province in China for their responses. Results from the study reveal that boundary-spanning search has a positive and significant impact on innovation capability as well as a positive moderating effect on absorptive capacity and innovation capability. This paper shows that enterprises need to continuously focus on exploring networking opportunities in direct and indirect ways to get access to effective flow and diffusion of resources, which in turn can enhance innovation capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aindustry 3amarkets 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3atheoretical models 3aChina1 aKun, Zhan1 aBoadu, Francis1 aYu, Liu0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 31, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101139803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010400184300001600288520095200304592002801256650002601284650001501310650001801325650001901343650000901362650001401371650002101385650001401406650001201420650001401432650000901446650001301455650001001468650001601478650003001494650001201524650003001536650002401566650002401590650001001614651001101624651001101635700002101646700001801667700002401685700002001709773011201729856004801841852000901889655001201898IND4473053120221117235641.0121003e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447305312DNAL7 a224345692pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-012-3998-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeillette, Marc10aFunction and limits of biofilters for the removal of methane in exhaust gases from the pig industry  ap. 601-611.  aThe agricultural sector is responsible for an important part of Canadian greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 8 % of the 747 Mt eq. CO2 emitted each year. The pork industry, a key sector of the agrifood industry, has had a rapid growth in Canada since the middle 1980s. For this industry, slurry storage accounts for the major part of methane (CH4) emissions, a GHG 25 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2) on a 100-year time horizon. Intending to reduce these emissions, biofiltration, a process effective to treat CH4 from landfills and coal mines, could be effective to treat CH4 from the pig industry. Biofiltration is a complex process that requires the understanding of the biological process of CH4 oxidation and a control of the engineering parameters (filter bed, temperature, etc.). Some biofiltration studies show that this technology could be used to treat CH4 at a relatively low cost and with a relatively high purification performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aemissions 3agreenhouse gases 3alandfills 3amethane 3aoxidation 3apork 3aslurries 3aswine 3atemperature 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aFiltrationxmethods 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aSwine 3aCanada 0aCanada1 aGirard, Matthieu1 aViens, Pascal1 aBrzezinski, Ryszard1 aHeitz, Michèle0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 May, v. 94, no. 3 p.601-611dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-3998-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245006400171300001600235520168400251592002801935650001901963650001201982650001501994650001402009650002702023650002602050650001902076650001702095650001302112650001802125650001302143650001402156650001802170650001402188650001402202650002102216650001702237650001902254650002502273653003102298653002802329653001402357653002802371653002702399653002102426700002002447700002302467773012002490856008802610852000902698655001202707IND60622928820221117073429.0190131e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062292882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhairul, M.A.14aThe composition, recycling and utilisation of Bayer red mud  ap. 483-498.  aRed mud or bauxite residue is a solid waste generated from the Bayer process. The disposal of red mud leads to a serious environmental threat because of its tiny particle size and high alkaline value. The utilisation and recycling of red mud is currently a crucial issue and needs to be addressed as soon as possible. This study demonstrates the different methods and techniques recently analysed or suggested for the consumption of bulk red mud to maintain a sustainable environment. The potential utilisations of red mud include valuable metal recovery, the preparation of construction materials and as an alternative catalyst for diverse processes, including hydrodechlorination, hydrogenation and hydrocarbon oxidation. In addition, the red mud can also be used to control environmental pollution, such as in wastewater treatment, soil remediation and the puriﬁcation of flue gas. However, the proper utilisation and recycling of red mud has a number of shortcomings: pyro-metallurgical recovery involves high energy costs; large volumes of acid by-product needing to be neutralised after the leaching process; the fine particle size of red mud; and the necessity of pre-treatment in some methods. Although many studies have investigated the potential utilisation of red mud, most of them have concentrated on lab-scale studies. Therefore, a large-scale investigation of the recycling and utilisation of red mud needs to be explored. Moreover, an appropriate cost-benefit analysis of the existing technologies needs to be examined in the future because of the high cost of the transportation of a large amount of red mud from alumina refineries to the point of application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3abauxite 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3aconstruction materials 3acost benefit analysis 3adechlorination 3aenergy costs 3aflue gas 3ahydrogenation 3aleaching 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3apollution 3arecycling 3asoil remediation 3asolid wastes 3atransportation 3awastewater treatment 0aBauxite residue or red mud 0aValuable metal recovery 0aCatalysts 0aEnvironmental pollution 0aConstruction materials 0aSoil remediation1 aZanganeh, Jafar1 aMoghtaderi, Behdad0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Feb., v. 141 p.483-498dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010200161300001800263520115300281592002801434650001601462650002301478650001101501650001701512650001001529650001501539650001101554650002201565650001701587650001101604653001201615653001801627653002501645653002201670653000801692700001601700700001701716700001201733773008201745856008101827852000901908655001201917IND60551561820221121225352.0161019e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.07.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Dan10aTheoretical investigation of the relationship between four-carbon d-sugars and five l-amino acids  ap. 5558-5562.  aThis study constructed the relationship between l-amino acids and four-carbon d-sugar using quantum theory. Theoretically, an l-amino acid could react with the ketone to afford the corresponding Schiff base which may take place an Aldol reaction with a molecule of formaldehyde. An assumption is proposed that the Aldol addition products with (R) or (S) configuration could have different quantity due to the effect from stereogenic center of l-amino acid. By hydrolysis of the Aldol addition, different d- or l-sugar would form. Thus, B3LYP, WP1MPW91 and wB97XD theories were used for the energy difference computations at the 6-311++G(2d,p) level in the gas phase, or in water using PCM and SMD model, respectively. The predicted ee value sequence agrees well to the experimental result in the asymmetric synthesis of 3-carbon sugar using five l-amino acids. Further theoretical study exhibited that 4-carbon D sugar should form if the corresponding l-amino acid is used. The ee values of the 4-carbon sugar are bigger than those of 3-carbon d-sugars catalyzed by the same l-amino acids. This looks like the chiral amplification in the procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3aformaldehyde 3agases 3ahydrolysis 3amodels 3aquantum mechanics 3aschiff bases 3asugars 0ad-Sugar 0al-Amino acids 0aConformational study 0aEnergy difference 0aDFT1 aZhao, Qi-Qi1 aZhu, Hua-Jie1 aLiu, Li0 tTetrahedron.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 72 p.5558-5562dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2016.07.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012200172300001600294520153600310592002801846650002301874650002001897650002301917650002501940650001601965650002301981650001402004650002602018650001902044650002002063650001402083650001402097650002002111653003102131653002502162653002702187653003702214653002902251700003002280700001302310700005902323700005702382700005602439773012002495856008802615852000902703655001202712IND60622928920221117073320.0190131e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062292892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lingyue10aEnvironmental and economic assessment of leachate concentrate treatment technologies using analytic hierarchy process  ap. 474-480.  aRepresenting one of the most challenging operational tasks for landfill management, municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill leachate varies widely in composition and needs to be treated effectively before being discharged into the environment. To maximise resources recycling with the least negative environmental impacts, regulations on both landfill management and leachate discharge are becoming more and more stringent throughout the world. Membrane separation processes, e.g. Nano Filtration (NF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO), are becoming quite popular at most leachate treatment plants (LTPs), given high removal efficiencies, low cost, and easy operation. However, the need for further treatment of the concentrate from NF/RO has been identified as a major drawback for implementation of membrane processes at landfills. This study aims to evaluate current membrane concentrate treatment technologies, which include advanced oxidation and evaporation. An assessment indicator system for leachate concentrate treatment was developed, taking into consideration treatment efficiencies, operational costs, environmental benefits, and process stability. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to the evaluation of leachate concentrate treatment performance. The weight of each index was determined through expert evaluation. Typical treatment technologies were evaluated and ranked based on data collected from full scale treatment plants. These results are helpful in designing cost effective concentrate treatment processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental impact 3aevaporation 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amunicipal solid waste 3ananofiltration 3aoperating costs 3aoxidation 3arecycling 3areverse osmosis 0aAnalytic Hierarchy Process 0aLeachate concentrate 0aTreatment technologies 0aSubmerged combustion evaporation 0aComprehensive evaluation1 aLavagnolo, Maria Cristina1 aBai, Hao1 aPivato, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3380-49991 aRaga, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0157-41051 aYue, Dongbei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5983-11570 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Feb., v. 141 p.474-480dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04208naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245023700185300001800422520234200440592002802782650002002810650000902830650002802839650002202867650001302889650001902902650001202921650002402933650003702957650001202994650001603006650001003022651001103032651002903043653003303072653002203105653003403127700002203161700002203183700002503205700001803230700002403248700001703272700001803289700001703307700002203324700002703346700001703373700001903390773013003409856008203539852000903621655001203630IND60517481020221120113541.0190803e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051748102DNAL7 a256508192pmid7 a10.1017/S136898001400305X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManios, Yannis10aLarge proportions of overweight and obese children, as well as their parents, underestimate children’s weight status across Europe.

Children’s weight and height were objectively measured. Parental anthropometric and sociodemographic data were self-reported. Children and their parents were asked to comment on children’s weight status based on five-point Likert-type scales, ranging from ‘I am much too thin’ to ‘I am much too fat’ (children) and ‘My child’s weight is way too little’ to ‘My child’s weight is way too much’ (parents). These data were combined with children’s actual weight status, in order to assess underestimation of children’s weight status by children themselves and by their parents, respectively. Chi-square tests and multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the aims of the current study. Eight European countries participating in the ENERGY (EuropeaN Energy balance Research to prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth) project. A school-based survey among 6113 children aged 10–12 years and their parents. In the total sample, 42·9 % of overweight/obese children and 27·6 % of parents of overweight/obese children underestimated their and their children’s weight status, respectively. A higher likelihood for this underestimation of weight status by children and their parents was observed in Eastern and Southern compared with Central/Northern countries. Overweight or obese parents (OR=1·81; 95 % CI 1·39, 2·35 and OR=1·78, 95 % CI 1·22, 2·60), parents of boys (OR=1·32; 95 % CI 1·05, 1·67) and children from overweight/obese (OR=1·60; 95 % CI 1·29, 1·98 and OR=1·76; 95 % CI 1·29, 2·41) or unemployed parents (OR=1·53; 95 % CI 1·22, 1·92) were more likely to underestimate children’s weight status. Children of overweight or obese parents, those from Eastern and Southern Europe, boys, younger children and children with unemployed parents were more likely to underestimate their actual weight status. Overweight or obese parents and parents of boys were more likely to underestimate the actual weight status of their children. In obesity prevention such underestimation may be a barrier for behavioural change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3aboys 3achi-square distribution 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aenergy balance 3aparents 3aregression analysis 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asurveys 3aweight gain 3ayouth 3aEurope 3aSouthern European region 0aPerceptions of weight status 0aChildhood obesity 0aWeight status underestimation1 aMoschonis, George1 aKaratzi, Kalliopi1 aAndroutsos, Odysseas1 aChinapaw, Mai1 aMoreno Aznar, Luis,1 aBere, Elling1 aMolnar, Denes1 aJan, Natasha1 aDössegger, Alain1 aDe Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse1 aSingh, Amika1 aBrug, Johannes0 tPublic health nutrition.g2015 Aug., v. 18, no. 12 p.2183-2190dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S136898001400305X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010800163520135600271592002801627650001901655650001601674650001401690650002401704650001501728650001001743650001601753650001901769650002601788650002201814650001001836650002901846653001901875653001001894653002101904653002001925653002101945700001601966700001501982700001701997700002002014700001702034700001202051700001502063773016502078856008402243852000902327655001202336IND60793701320221118233603.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079370132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Nan12aA heat shock protein 70 protects the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) against high-temperature stress  aHeat shock proteins (HSPs) are encoded by Hsp genes and are important in insect tolerance to heat stress. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, is an important agricultural pest. The functions of Hsp genes in the thermal tolerance of M. persicae are unknown. This study identified an Hsp70 gene (MpHsp70a) and analyzed its role in protection against high-temperature stress. MpHsp70a encoded a protein consisting of 659 amino acid residues. The protein had three signature motifs of the HSP70 family and was predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm. The highest expression level of MpHsp70a was in adults, and differences in the mRNA levels between apterous and alate adults were not significant. Exposure to high temperatures (30, 35 and 40 °C) for one hour and treatment with 40 °C for different times (0.5, 1 and 2 h) all resulted in a greatly elevated expression level of MpHsp70a, suggesting that the gene is heat-inducible. The transcriptional level of MpHsp70a was suppressed by injection with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and knockdown of MpHsp70a significantly increased the susceptibility of apterous adults to 40 °C. These results indicate that MpHsp70a is required for tolerance to high-temperature stress in M. persicae. Our findings highlight the molecular mechanism underlying Hsp70-mediated thermal adaptation in M. persicae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyzus persicae 3aamino acids 3acytoplasm 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aentomology 3agenes 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ainsect resistance 3apests 3atranscription (genetics) 0aMyzus persicae 0aHSP70 0aHigh temperature 0aStress response 0aRNA interference1 aTan, Jia-Yu1 aWang, Ying1 aQi, Ming-Hui1 aPeng, Jiang-Nan1 aChen, De-Xin1 aLiu, Su1 aLi, Mao-Ye0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2022 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.101992-dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012400166300001400290520136800304592002801672596005601700650001601756650001901772650001201791650001401803650003101817650001301848650001301861650001701874650001201891650001401903650001701917650004301934650005201977650001402029650001302043650002002056650002202076650001702098700001802115700001802133700001202151700001802163700002002181700001602201700001402217700001402231700005402245773012602299856008202425852000902507655001202516IND60660381520221122235733.0190823e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066038152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-019-04083-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shufeng10aPhysiological, genomic and transcriptomic comparison of two Brassica napus cultivars with contrasting cadmium tolerance  ap. 71-87.  aAIMS: Cadmium (Cd) is the most widespread toxic heavy metal to plant growth. As the second leading oil crop, some genotypes of Brassica napus (B. napus) are potential Cd accumulators. However, the Cd translocation mechanism from root to shoot in B. napus in response to Cd toxicity remains unknown. METHODS: In the present study, a couple of B. napus genotypes with contrasting Cd uptake and root-to-shoot translocation abilities, named P78 (the high Cd accumulator, HC) and P72 (the low Cd accumulator, LC), were chosen from 39 B. napus genotypes with various Cd accumulation features. RESULTS: Physiological comparison of P78 and P72 reveals that P72 is more sensitive to Cd toxicity than P78. With genomic resequencing, transcriptomics and qRT-PCR assay, BnNramp2;1 and BnNramp4;2 were focused with highly upregulation in shoot of P78 under Cd treatment condition. Furthermore, BnNramp2;1 and BnNramp4;2 can successfully complement the function of tonoplast localized Cd transporter YCF1. And when BnNramp2;1 and BnNramp4;2 were transferred in Arabidopsis atnramp mutants, the transgenic plants showed better growth rate than mutants under higher Cd stress conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveals that BnNramp2;1 and BnNramp4;2 were two main Cd transporters associated with enhanced root-to-shoot translocation and accumulation of Cd in shoot of B. napus.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0200903cNational Key R & D Program of China 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica napus 3acadmium 3acultivars 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3agenotype 3aheavy metals 3amutants 3aoil crops 3aplant growth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atonoplast 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics 3atransgenic plants 3atransporters1 aSun, Juanjuan1 aLi, Shengting1 aLu, Kun1 aMeng, Hongjun1 aXiao, Zhongchun1 aZhang, Zhen1 aLi, Jiana1 aLuo, Feng1 aLi, Nannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6592-76220 tPlant and soil.g2019 Aug., v. 441, no. 1-2 p.71-87dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04083-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008000169300001800249500001500267520129800282592002801580650001001608650002601618650000901644650001001653650001501663650001001678650001801688650001101706650001701717650001201734650001401746650001401760650001701774650001501791650002201806650001201828650001701840650002401857650001001881650002501891650001601916650001501932650002701947650000701974653002001981700001702001700001702018700001902035700001902054700001802073700001702091700001402108700001302122773009502135856008502230852000902315655001202324IND60113970120221119235721.0141112e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011397012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2011.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Hongying12aA novel thermoacidophilic family 10 xylanase from Penicillium pinophilum C1  ap. 2341-2346.  a2019-12-04  aA novel endo-β-1,4-xylanase gene (xyn10C1) was cloned from Penicillium pinophilum C1 and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. The 1071-bp full-length gene encodes a 356-residue polypeptide containing the catalytic domain of glycoside hydrolase 10. Deduced XYN10C1 shares highest amino acid sequence identity of 49.3% with a putative xylanase from Glomeella graminicola M1.001. Purified recombinant XYN10C1 showed maximal activity at pH 4.0–5.5 and 75°C, exhibited good adaptability to broad acidic pH and temperature ranges (>69.0% activity at pH 2.5–6.5; and >91.0% activity at 70–80°C and 22.2% even at 90°C), and was highly stable at pH 2.0–7.0 for 1h at 37°C. The specific activity, Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ values for birchwood xylan and soluble wheat arabinoxylan were 100.7 and 137.4U/mg, 4.3 and 6.9mg/ml, and 195.4 and 209.3μmol/min/mg, respectively. The enzyme was strongly resistant to most metal ions and proteases (pepsin and trypsin). Under simulated mashing conditions, addition of XYN10C1 (80U) to the brewery mash (12.5g in 50ml system) significantly increased the filtration rate by 26.7% and reduced the viscosity by 9.8%, respectively. All these favorable enzymatic properties make XYN10C1 attractive for potential applications in the food and animal feed industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3afeeds 3aKomagataella pastoris 3amash 3awheat 3afiltration 3agenes 3afeed industry 3apepsin 3apolypeptides 3atrypsin 3axylanases 3aviscosity 3aactive sites 3ametal ions 3asequence analysis 3amashing 3aarabinoxylan 3agene overexpression 3axylan 3aamino acid sequences 3atemperature 3aglycosides 3aTalaromyces pinophilus 3apH 0aPichia pastoris1 aShi, Pengjun1 aBai, Yingguo1 aHuang, Huoqing1 aYuan, Tiezheng1 aYang, Peilong1 aLuo, Huiying1 aMeng, Kun1 aYao, Bin0 tProcess biochemistry.g2011 Dec., v. 46, no. 12 p.2341-2346dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009800170300001600268500002000284520166600304592002801970650002101998650001502019650001502034650002502049650001402074650001302088650002802101650001402129650001802143650002002161650002502181700001702206700001802223700001402241773011802255852000902373856008902382655001202471IND2090519920221118041202.0210417e199710  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209051992DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00798.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, E.,10aCyclic AMP, a possible regulator of glycolysis in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria  ap. 351-356.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe amounts of cyclic AMP (cAMP), fructose‐2,6‐bisphosphate (F26BP), trehalose and glycogen were determined in cell suspension cultures of the ectomycorrhiza‐forming fungus Amanita muscaria (L. ex Fr.) Hooker. For the assay of cAMF a protocol was developed that enabled the detection of as little as 50 fmol of this secondary messenger by an enzyme‐linked immuno assay (EIA). Values varied from < 1 and up to 5 pmol cAMP mg¹d. wt according to the age of the fungal culture. Typically, a transient increase in cAMP occurred after c. 4 d of culture of the fungus on glucose‐containing medium. This increase (up to 100%) was followed by the start of the logarithmic growth phase, and by a more persistent increase in F26BP. In parallel, glucose in the medium started to decrease, whilst the amounts of fungal carbohydrates, especially the disaccharide trehalose, increased, From these data we assume that a high initial rate of glucose uptake caused an increase in the fungal pools of storage carbohydrates and, via activation of an adenylate cyclase, of cAMP. According to data reported for yeast cells this should enhance the formation of F26BP by phosphorylation of relevant enzymes. In animal and yeast cells an increase in the concentration of F26BP stimulates glycolysis by activation of the ATP‐dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK). A. muscaria also possesses an F26BP activated PFK and, under conditions of symbiosis, host‐derived carbohydrates are supplied mainly in the form of glucose. The implications of these findings to the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism of symbiotic plant root/fungus structures (ectomycorrhiza) are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmanita muscaria 3acyclic AMP 3aglycolysis 3afructose 6-phosphate 3atrehalose 3aglycogen 3acell suspension culture 3abioassays 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3achemical composition1 aWALLENDA, T.1 aSCHAEFFER, C.1 aHAMPP, R.0 tnew phytologist.g1997 Oct., v. 137, no. 2 p.351-356dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00798.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03261naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245015900189300001600348500001500364520100400379592002801383650002201411650002101433650002201454650001201476650001301488650001401501650002801515650002501543650001601568650002301584650001101607650000901618650002101627650002701648650003401675650003201709650002601741650002601767650002001793650002501813650002901838650002901867650003701896650003701933650003701970650002502007650003802032650002802070650003602098650002302134650003302157653001302190653001902203653002502222653001202247653001702259653002202276700002302298700002802321773010602349856008702455852000902542655001202551IND50064884920221117235841.0190409e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006488492DNAL7 a235005892pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHundt, Martin10aAlkaline polyol pulping and enzymatic hydrolysis of softwood: Effect of pulping severity and pulp properties on cellulase activity and overall sugar yield  ap. 307-315.  a2019-12-06  aThe saccharification of softwood using alkaline polyol pulping (AlkaPolP) and enzymatic hydrolysis was investigated. It will be demonstrated that the AlkaPolP process yields high quality pulps which can easily be hydrolyzed by cellulases. Temperature (180–230°C) and duration (15–60min) of the alkaline glycerol pulping, expressed as pulping severity R0, were varied to find optimum reaction conditions. The obtained pulps were characterized regarding their residual lignin content, kappa number and crystallinity index. Thus, the dependencies of the conversion during enzymatic hydrolysis on severity, pulp composition and pulp characteristics could be observed. In further experiments it was investigated how the enzymatic hydrolysis is affected by pulp drying or by a reduction of enzyme loading. Up to 83% of the initial cellulose in wood and almost 97% of the cellulose in pulp were converted into glucose using cellulases from Trichoderma reesei and β-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aalkaline pulping 3acrystal structure 3aglucose 3asoftwood 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3atemperature 3aTrichoderma reesei 3adrying 3apulp 3asaccharification 2aAlkaliesxpharmacology 2aAspergillus nigerxenzymology 2aCarbohydratesxbiosynthesis 2aCellulasexmetabolism 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aCrystallization 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aHydrolysisxdrug effects 2aHydroxidesxpharmacology 2aLigninxisolation & purification 2aPiceaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPinusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPolymersxmetabolism 2aPotassium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aTrichodermaxenzymology 2aWoodxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aXylansxmetabolism 2abeta-Glucosidasexmetabolism 0aGlycerol 0aLignocellulose 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aPulping 0aPretreatment 0aHypocrea jecorina1 aSchnitzlein, Klaus1 aSchnitzlein, Michael G.0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Apr., v. 134 p.307-315dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011500175300001800290520126100308592002801569650001301597650002401610650001101634650001401645650001401659650002001673650001201693650000701705650001701712700002201729700002501751700002401776700002801800773009501828856008501923852000902008655001202017IND60113970220221119234028.0141112e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011397022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2011.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAquino Neto, Sidney14aThe kinetic behavior of dehydrogenase enzymes in solution and immobilized onto nanostructured carbon platforms  ap. 2347-2352.  aThis paper describes the kinetic behavior of alcohol (ADH) and aldehyde (AldDH) dehydrogenases in solution and immobilized onto carbon platform via polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers. All the kinetic constants achieved for soluble ADH and AldDH are in agreement with literature data. The influence of pH and temperature was evaluated. Results showed that physiological conditions and ambient temperature can satisfactorily be applied to systems containing dehydrogenase enzymes, so as to ensure an environment where both ADH and AldDH display good activity. It is noteworthy that the affinity between both ADH and AldDH and their substrates and coenzyme is retained after the immobilization process. Investigation of the influence of the storage time demonstrated that there was no appreciable reduction in enzymatic activity for 50 days. Results showed that the PAMAM dendrimers provide a good environment for immobilization of dehydrogenase enzymes and that the affinity observed between the enzymes and their substrates and coenzymes seems to be retained, despite the considerable loss of enzymatic activity after immobilization. Furthermore, the anchoring methodology employed herein, namely layer-by-layer (LbL), required very low catalyst consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aambient temperature 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acoenzymes 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3apH 3astorage time1 aForti, Juliane C.1 aZucolotto, Valtencir1 aCiancaglini, Pietro1 aDe Andrade, Adalgisa R.0 tProcess biochemistry.g2011 Dec., v. 46, no. 12 p.2347-2352dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009500172300001800267520112800285592002801413650002401441650001301465650001401478650003601492650001201528650001701540650001901557650001501576650001301591700002601604700001901630700002101649700002601670773010501696856008601801852000901887655001201896IND60578095020221122192450.0170811e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057809502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b011412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuriboot, Jakkrit10aPolyethylene as a Cosolvent and Catalyst Support in Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization  ap. 5511-5516.  aPolyethylene oligomers (PEOₗᵢg) can be used as cosolvents and sometimes soluble catalyst supports in ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions. As a catalyst support, this polyolefin serves as an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand for a ROMP catalyst, making it soluble at 70 °C and insoluble at room temperature. As a cosolvent, unfunctionalized PE oligomers facilitate quantitative separation of PEOₗᵢg-bound Ru-catalyst residues from polymer products. In these cases, the insolubility of the unfunctionalized polyethylene (Polywax) and its entrapment of the PEOₗᵢg-supported Ru residue in the product phase at room temperature afford ROMP products with Ru contamination lower than other procedures that use soluble catalysts. These separations require only physical processes to separate the product and catalyst residuesno additional solvents are necessary. Control experiments suggest that most (ca. 90%) of the Ru leaching that is seen results from Ru byproducts formed in the vinyl ether quenching step and not from the polymerization processes involving the PEOₗᵢg-supported Ru complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbenes 3acatalysts 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3aligands 3apolyethylene 3apolymerization 3apolyolefin 3asolvents1 aHobbs, Christopher

However, the ecological risks of using fomesafen in soil remain unknown. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of fomesafen on the microbial community structure of soil using laboratory and field experiments. Under laboratory conditions, the application of fomesafen at concentrations of 3.75 and 37.5mg/kg decreased the basal respiration (RB) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). In contrast, treatment with 375mg/kg of fomesafen resulted in a significant decrease in the RB, MBC, abundance of both Gram+ and Gram– bacteria, and fungal biomass. Analysis of variance showed that the treatment accounted for most of the variance (38.3%) observed in the soil microbial communities. Furthermore, the field experiment showed that long-term fomesafen application in continuously cropped soybean fields affected the soil bacterial community composition by increasing the relative average abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria species and decreasing the abundance of Verrucomicrobia species. In addition, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi species showed a pattern of activation-inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that the application of fomesafen can affect the community structure of soil bacteria in the spring planting soybean region of northern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aChloroflexi 3aProteobacteria 3aVerrucomicrobia 3aanalysis of variance 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3afield experimentation 3afomesafen 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3aplanting 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3asoybeans 3aspring 3avariance 3aChina 0aRB 0aMBC 0aDW 0aqCO2 0aPLFA 0aGram+ 0aGram– 0aOTUs 0aANOVA 0aANOSIM 0aSIMPER 0aPCoA 0aRDA 0aPSA 0aMgSO4 0afomesafen 0asoil microbial activity 0asoil microbial community 0ahigh-throughput sequencing1 aZhang, Ying1 aDu, Peng-Qiang1 aXu, Jun1 aDong, Feng-Shou1 aLiu, Xin-Gang1 aZheng, Yong-Quan0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007600165500001900241520178900260592002802049650001202077650001202089650001802101650001202119650001602131650001202147650003002159650001502189650001302204650002502217650001502242650003002257651001502287651002002302653002502322653001602347653003102363653003102394653001602425773010502441856008502546852000902631655001202640IND60713321220221120090600.0201223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071332122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1061532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Shuai10aBiomass burning spatiotemporal variations over South and Southeast Asia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer active fire and land use products were integrated to extract and classify biomass burning (BB) data for South Asia (SA) and Southeast Asia (SEA). Several trend and geographic distribution analyses were conducted at the grid (0.25° × 0.25°) and regional scales. As the principal local form of BB, crop residue burning (CRB) in SA increased by 844 spots/yr, and the Mann–Kendall (MK) τ reached 0.61. Additionally, the CRB in Punjab-Haryana, a region a well-known for severest CRB, presented a significant declining trend. BB in mainland SEA was much more intense and was dominated by forest and shrubland fires. Forest fires in mainland SEA declined at a rate of −209 spots/yr, and shrubland fire conversely grew at a rate of 803 spots/yr, which was likely related to the dramatic land cover change induced by the local swidden agriculture. Unlike other regions, BB in equatorial SEA primarily occurred in the second half of the year (August to October), and it was extremely vulnerable to El Niño events. When the annual sea surface temperature anomalies within the Niño 3 region improved by 1 °C, the annual BB spots and fire radiative power in equatorial SEA increased by 5.18 × 10⁴ and 2.40 × 10⁶ MW, respectively. Although the interannual variations in equatorial SEA were dramatic, the robust Siegel’s repeated median estimator still revealed that equatorial SEA BB significantly declined by −1825 spots/yr. This regional decline reflects government endeavors to curb indigenous BB. However, regions with enhanced BB still need to draw more attention, and it is imperative for the Indonesian government to take substantial measures to reduce anthropogenic fire sources during El Niño events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3abiomass 3acrop residues 3adecline 3aenvironment 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3aland cover 3aland use 3ashifting cultivation 3ashrublands 3asurface water temperature 3aSouth Asia 3aSouth East Asia 0aCrop residue burning 0aForest fire 0aSiegel’s repeated median 0aStandard deviation ellipse 0aTime series0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Dec., v. 145 p.106153-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1061533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010200168300001800270520128400288592002801572650001301600650002101613650001901634650001301653700001301666773010501679856008601784852000901870655001201879IND60578095220221122192431.0170811e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057809522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b011762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeo, Yew Chin10aImportance of Macromonomer Quality in the Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization of Macromonomers  ap. 5656-5662.  aVarious macromonomers (MMs) were synthesized using controlled radical polymerization (CRP) by either directly growing from a norbornene-functionalized initiator or chain transfer agent (“direct-growth” or DG method) or coupling a norbornenyl group to preformed polymers (“growth-then-coupling” or GC method). The degree of control for the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of these MMs was found to be dependent on which synthetic method was used for the MMs. Narrowly dispersed brush polymers were consistently obtained from the GC-MMs. In contrast, the DG-MMs resulted in brush polymers with a small high-molecular weight (MW) shoulder or broader molecular weight distribution (MWD). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of DG-MMs showed the presence of a small amount of α,ω-dinorbornenyl telechelic species resulting from the biradical combination during polymerization. A control study further revealed that even the presence of 1 mol % α,ω-norbornenyl telechelic polymer in the MM resulted in broadening of MWD. Our surprising findings suggest the importance of MM quality and the absence of dinorbornenyl telechelic polymers in achieving the best control for high-MW brush polymers via efficient ROMP of MMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aXia, Yan0 tMacromolecules.g2015 Aug. 25, v. 48, no. 16 p.5656-5662dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b011763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245009100174520201200265592002802277650003002305650000802335650001802343650001602361650001002377650001702387650001902404650000902423650001702432650001302449650001302462651001002475773012502485856008302610852000902693655001202702IND60742516020221117020241.0210624e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074251602DNAL7 a10.3390/environments80600512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrimblecombe, Peter 10aVisibility Driven Perception and Regulation of Air Pollution in Hong Kong, 1968–2020  aVisibility is a perceptible indicator of air pollution, so it is hardly surprising that it has been used to promote the regulation of air pollutants. In Hong Kong, poor visibility associated with air pollution has been linked with changes in tourist choices and health outcomes. Much research is available to examine the early deterioration of visibility in the city, and especially its relation to particulate sulfate. The period 2004–2012 saw especially poor visibility in Hong Kong and coincided with a time when pollutant levels were high. There is a reasonable correlation (multiple r² = 0.57) between the monthly hours of low visibility (<8 km) and PM₁₀, NO₂, SO₂, and O₃ concentrations from the late 1990s. Visibility can thus be justified as a route to perceiving air pollution. Over the last decade, visibility has improved and average pollutant concentrations have declined in Hong Kong. The changing health risk from individual pollutants parallels their concentration trends: the risk from NO₂ and particulate matter at urban sites has declined, but there have been increases in the health risks from ozone as its concentrations have risen across the region, although this is dominated by concentration increases at more rural sites. Since 2004, the frequency of search terms such as visibility, air pollution, and haze on Google has decreased in line with improved visibility. Despite positive changes to Hong Kong’s air quality, typically, the media representation and public perception see the situation as growing more severe, possibly because attention focuses on the air quality objectives in Hong Kong being less stringent than World Health Organisation guidelines. Policymakers increasingly need to account for the perceptions of stakeholders and acknowledge that these are not necessarily bound to measurements from monitoring networks. Improvements in air quality are hard won, but conveying the nature of such improvements to the public can be an additional struggle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apublic opinion 3arisk 3astakeholders 3asulfates 3atourists 3aChina0 tEnvironments.g2021 June 04, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27132x2076-32987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments80600513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006000170506011700230506007600347520134200423592002801765506003701793650000901830650001301839650001001852650001301862650001001875650001001885650001301895650001201908650001001920650001001930650001901940650001201959650001601971650001401987650001502001650001302016650002102029650001002050651001202060653001802072653002802090653002102118653001102139700002502150700002402175773009602199856008502295852000902380655001202389IND60793701920221207111107.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079370192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.protis.2022.1259112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBobrov, Anatoly10aTestate Amoebae in Historical parks of Potsdam, Germany  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo explore the potential of urban settings as habitats for testate amoebae, five historical parks in Potsdam (Germany) were sampled at different sites. A total of 32 sampling sites was chosen in proximity to deciduous (Acer, Castanea, Fagus, Tilia, Platanus, Quercus) and coniferous (Fraxinus, Picea, Pinus, Tsuga) trees. Meadows and creeks were also sampled. The overall taxonomic record comprises 76 species and sub-species. High species numbers of >20 per sample were found in meadows and below Fagus, Tilia, and Quercus trees. The species richness per park ranges from 33 to 46 taxa. Most species belong to the eurybiontic ecological group, although litter-inhabiting and hygrophilic and hydrophilic species were also present. Common species found in more than 50% of all samples (superdominants) belong to the genera Centropyxis, Cyclopyxis, Euglypha, and Trinema. Interestingly, the rare Frenopyxis stierlitzi which inhabits tree hollows was found as a recently described species in a new genus FrenopyxisBobrov&Mazei2020 in the Babelsberg Park. The studied testate amoebae are characterized by a high degree of morphological and morphometric plasticity. Therefore, the study of testate amoebae in urban settings will reveal new insights into their ecology and enhance the definition of morphometric variability for single species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcer 3aCastanea 3aFagus 3aFraxinus 3aPicea 3aPinus 3aPlatanus 3aQuercus 3aTilia 3aTsuga 3ahydrophilicity 3ameadows 3amorphometry 3anew genus 3aplasticity 3aprotists 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3aGermany 0aSoil protozoa 0amorphometric plasticity 0aurban landscapes 0aEurope1 aWetterich, Sebastian1 aSchirrmeister, Lutz0 tProtist.g2022 Dec., v. 173, no. 6 p.125911-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12496x1434-46107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2022.1259113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245011900176300001400295520097100309592002801280650001201308650002101320650002701341650002501368650001701393650001101410650002001421650001501441651001801456651001201474651001101486651001401497653002101511653001901532653002001551653002701571653001801598653001901616700006401635700002201699700005801721773011801779856008801897852000901985655001201994IND60622929520221117073844.0190131e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062292952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaležentis, Tomas10aProspects of green growth in the electricity sector in Baltic States: Pinch analysis based on ecological footprint  ap. 37-48.  aIn this paper, we model the effects of electricity generation on multiple environmental pressures. Given the environmental considerations, we assume a decrease in the carbon footprint and adjust the energy-mix by increasing the use of renewables. We combined a footprint approach and pinch analysis to devise the optimal energy-mixes and quantify the resulting environmental impacts. The analysis focuses on the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), which not only need to ensure sustainability of their electricity generation but also reduce the use of imported fossil fuels. The results indicate that biomass might be an appealing option for reduction of the carbon footprint in Estonia’s and Latvia’s electricity generation, whereas wind energy might be preferred in Lithuania. However, the analysis of land and water footprints suggests that further considerations are needed to treat biomass as a sustainable means for electricity generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon footprint 3aelectricity generation 3aenvironmental impact 3afossil fuels 3amodels 3awater footprint 3awind power 3aBaltic States 3aEstonia 3aLatvia 3aLithuania 0aCarbon footprint 0aLand footprint 0aWater footprint 0aElectricity generation 0aBaltic States 0aPinch analysis1 aStreimikiene, Dalia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3247-99121 aMelnikienė, Rasa1 aZeng, Shouzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3604-08430 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Mar., v. 142 p.37-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169300001600286520139600302536020901698592002801907596005301935650001301988650000802001650002202009650001302031650004202044650002002086650001002106650002202116650001202138650001802150650001402168650001402182650001202196650005202208653002102260653001202281653002202293653001002315653003302325700002402358700002202382700002302404700001602427700003002443700002002473773012702493856008502620852000902705655001202714IND60624633320221118213200.0181204e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062463332DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2016.12670092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinha, Rebeka10aComparative jejunal expression of MUC 13 in Indian native pigs differentially adhesive to diarrhoeagenic E. coli  ap. 107-111.  aEscherichia coli are important pathogens among bacterial causes of neonatal piglet diarrhoea. Their adhesion to the intestinal epithelial cells is an essential prerequisite for incidence of diarrhoea, which makes certain animal innately resistant and this adhesion pattern is genetically controlled. Among the candidate genes associated with adhesion pattern, MUC13 is the most likely responsible gene examined in diverse outbred swine populations. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the native Indian (desi) pigs in terms of E. coli adhesion pattern (with Indian isolate) and MUC13 expression profile across adhesion phenotypes. Out of 80 pigs screened, 27 were found to be non-adhesive, 46 adhesive and 7 were weakly adhesive. Effect of sex was found to be significant (P<.05) with non-significant age effect. RT-PCR analysis revealed that although, porcine MUC13 mRNA expression was highest in adhesive (2.67±0.69 fold), moderate in weakly adhesive (1.22±0.35 fold) and low levels in non-adhesive (calibrator) phenotypes, differences were statistically non-significant (P<.05).

SWU10  ap. 2255-2262.  aTwo forms of an endo-xylanase were isolated from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces sp. SWU10 that grew on rice straw. The molecular masses of both forms of an enzyme were 31kDa (XynSW2A) and 44kDa (XynSW2B). Analysis of internal amino acid sequences of the proteins by liquid chromatography/ion-trap/time-of flight mass spectrometer (LC/IT/TOF MS) revealed that XynSW2A may be the proteolytic fragment of XynSW2B. Optimal temperature and pH of XynSW2A and XynSW2B were 60°C and 6.0, respectively. Both forms of the enzyme were stable in a wide pH ranges. More than 80% of the initial activities remained at pH 3–9 (XynSW2A) and 2–9 (XynSW2B) after 16h of incubation at 4°C. XynSW2A and XynSW2B were stable up to 80°C and 60°C, respectively. Both forms of the enzyme were strongly inhibited by Hg²⁺ ions. Birch wood xylan, which has no arabinofuranosyl side chains, was the most preferred substrate for both forms. The xynSW2 gene encoding XynSW2B was isolated by in vitro cloning. The coding sequence of xynSW2 gene was 1434bp in length and encode a polypeptide of 477 amino acid residues. Pfam analysis revealed Glyco_hydro_10 and Ricin_β_lectin domains in XynSW2B. The deduced amino acid sequence of XynSW2B exhibited the highest identity with that of a xylanase A of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) belong to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10. Because of their pH and thermal stabilities, XynSW2A and XynSW2B may have potential application in biofuel industry by using rice straw and can be applied in food, textile industries, and waste treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abioenergy industry 3aculture filtrates 3aenzyme stability 3aflight 3agenes 3aglycosides 3aions 3amercury 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3arice straw 3aspectrometers 3atemperature 3atextile industry 3athermal stability 3awaste treatment 3awood 3axylan 3axylanases1 aNishimura, Yūichi,1 aHarada, Naoki1 aSakamoto, Tatsuji1 aSukhumsirichart, Wasana0 tProcess biochemistry.g2011 Dec., v. 46, no. 12 p.2255-2262dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009700166300001600263520140900279592002801688650002101716650002501737650002501762650001801787650002101805650002101826650002401847650001801871650002201889650001201911650002401923650003701947650003001984650002202014650001402036650002402050650001402074653001702088653002302105653002602128653002102154653002602175700001702201700002302218700002002241700002102261773008502282856008402367852000902451655001202460IND60584146920221120202428.0171024e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058414692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2017.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarin, Maia10aCathelicidin modulates synthesis of Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) 4 and 9 in colonic epithelium  ap. 249-258.  aCathelicidin are innate antimicrobial peptides with broad immunomodulatory functions; however, their role in regulating intestinal defenses is not well characterized. This study aimed to investigate the role of cathelicidin modulating expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 4 and 9 in colonic epithelium in response to bacterial patterns. We demonstrated herein that intestinal epithelial cells, when primed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), responded to cathelicidin by increased transcription and protein synthesis of TLR4. This cathelicidin-induced response required the interaction of LPS-TLR4 and activation of MAPK signalling pathways. However, cathelicidin blocked TLR9 responses induced by TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) in these colonic epithelial cells. Modulations of TLRs triggered by cathelicidin in intestinal epithelium occurred mainly in the apical compartment of intestinal cells. Activation of TLR4 by ligands in combination with cathelicidin promoted CXCL8 chemokine secretion and epithelial antimicrobial defenses against Escherichia coli. We concluded that cathelicidin selectively modulated synthesis of TLR4 and 9 in intestinal epithelium, but only when cells were exposed to virulence factors, mostly from apical surfaces. Enhanced TLR4 expression promoted by cathelicidin in intestinal epithelium may be crucial for controlling enteric infectious diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aToll-like receptor 9 3acathelicidins 3aepithelial cells 3aimmunomodulators 3ainfectious diseases 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestinal mucosa 3aligands 3alipopolysaccharides 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3avirulence 0aCathelicidin 0aToll-like receptor 0aIntestinal epithelium 0aEscherichia coli 0aAntimicrobial peptide1 aHolani, Ravi1 aShah, Chaitanya B.1 aOdeón, Anselmo1 aCobo, Eduardo R.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2017 Nov., v. 91 p.249-258dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2017.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245012100181520102900302592002801331650001701359650001701376650001701393650001101410650002301421650000901444650001801453650001501471773012501486856008301611852000901694655001201703IND60742516320221117020030.0210624e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074251632DNAL7 a10.3390/environments80600542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJabłońska-Trypuć, Agata 10aHuman Cell Culture, a Pertinent In Vitro Model to Evaluate the Toxicity of Landfill Leachate/Sewage Sludge. A Review  aBoth landfill leachate and sewage sludge are complex mixtures of many potentially toxic substances in unknown and unpredictable amounts and concentrations. Both types of matrices can pose a risk to human health and the functioning of ecosystems if released into the environment. Therefore, constant monitoring of the toxicity of these mixtures is necessary. However, traditional methods of analysis of sewage sludge/landfill leachate are mainly based on physicochemical studies that do not fully reflect the effects of these mixtures on living organisms. For this purpose, research based on biological models, including mammalian, mainly human, cells is recommended and increasingly implemented. A variety of cytotoxicity tests, based on various metabolic transformations in living cells, are a very useful tool in landfill leachate/sewage sludge toxicology studies. This paper reviews the methods used in the study of the cytotoxicity of environmental matrices and the cell lines used in these studies as biological models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3acytotoxicity 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alandfill leachates 3arisk 3asewage sludge 3atoxicology0 tEnvironments.g2021 June 10, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27132x2076-32987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments80600543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008700171300001600258520121100274536011401485592002801599596005101627650002001678650002201698650001601720650001201736650001801748650001801766650001001784650001101794653001701805653002201822653002101844653001301865653001001878700002401888773012701912856008502039852000902124655001202133IND60624633420221118213212.0181204e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062463342DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2016.12689652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaplan, Selçuk10aComparison of growth curves using non-linear regression function in Japanese quail  ap. 112-117.  aThis study was conducted to determine the goodness of fit of Gompertz, Logistic, Von Bertalanffy, Richards, Levakovich and Janoschek growth models in Japanese quail. Therefore, weekly live-weight data obtained from 372 females and 339 males were fitted. Females’ live weights were found to be higher than that of males, and the first divergence in the growth of female and male birds occurred in 21–28 days, and it survived until the experiment (P < .001). The coefficient of determination (R²), adjusted coefficient of determination (adj. R²), mean square error (MSE), Akaike’s information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were used to determine the best growth model. R² and adjusted R² values of the growth models were similar and close to 1, indicating that all models perform well in describing age-related changes in live weight in quail. Based on the MSE, AIC and BIC values, Richards model was determined to be the best fitting model to the growth data of both sexes. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that Richards function which has a flexible structure in terms of inflection point is the most appropriate growth function for both female and male birds.  aThis study was supported by Namık Kemal University, Scientific Research Project Unit, NKUBAP.00.23.AR.14.06.  aPublisher supplied data  aNKUBAP.00.23.AR.14.06cNamık Kemal University 3aBayesian theory 3aCoturnix japonica 3abody weight 3afemales 3agrowth curves 3agrowth models 3amales 3aquails 0aGrowth curve 0aflexible function 0aprofile analysis 0aRichards 0aquail1 aGürcan, Eser Kemal0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 46, no. 1 p.112-117dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2016.12689653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011700165300001800282520034100300592002800641650001400669650002300683650002300706650000900729650002200738653001600760653001800776653002100794653002600815653002100841653003200862653003200894653003200926653003200958653003200990653003201022653003201054653003201086653003201118653003201150653003201182653003201214653003201246653003201278653003201310653003201342653003201374653003201406653003201438653003201470653003201502700001701534700001701551773008101568856008101649852000901730655001201739IND60551562820221121211756.0161019e20161006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.07.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Young Ju10aSyntheses of 2,2′-bibenzo[7]annulenes by double Au-catalyzed sequential activation of propargylic carboxylates  ap. 6113-6117.  aWe previously reported a novel Au-catalyzed sequential activation of two different propargyl carboxylates to 6-methylene-6H-benzo[7]annulene-5,8-diyl dicarboxylates.

These induce attractant activity and cause arrestment responses and ovipositional stimulation in its egg parasitoid, Trichogramma japonicum Ashmead. Laboratory experiments on short‐range host searching and oviposition were performed to assess the how these crude stem extracts and their fractions influence the biological control efficiency of Trichogramma. The activity of these chemicals as long‐range attractants was confirmed through wind tunnel bioassays. Stem borer‐infested plant extracts had enhanced the parasitization rate of T. japonicum, whereas host eggs treated with the extract from undamaged stems or solvent‐treated control failed to evoke changes in the parasitoid’s behaviour. A preliminary GC‐MASS analysis indicated the presence of several hydrocarbon compounds. The analysis also revealed qualitative and quantitative differences between the chemical profiles of the infested and non‐infested plants. We hypothesized that herbivore‐induced plant chemicals are released through the stem surfaces and attract T. japonicum, even over long distances. These cues elicit parasitoid arrestment on pest‐damaged plants and subsequently lead to the successful parasitization of the stem borer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScirpophaga incertulas 3aTrichogramma 3aattractants 3abioassays 3abiological control 3aboring insects 3aeggs 3ahosts 3ahydrocarbons 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aplant extracts 3arice 3astems 3awind tunnels1 aSandhyarani, K.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2012 Dec., v. 136, no. 10 p.749-760dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2012.01705.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009100173300001600264520173400280592002802014650001202042650001802054650001002072650001602082650002502098650001802123650000902141653001602150653003502166653001802201653001402219653001602233700001802249700002102267700002202288700001802310700002102328700001902349700002202368700002402390700002302414773012102437856009002558852000902648655001202657IND50069342120221122014255.0190403e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006934212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrid, Muren10aDepletion of testis cell populations in pre-pubertal Bos indicus cattle by irradiation  ap. 124-130.  aRecovery of spermatogenesis following a single dose of irradiation was evaluated in pre-pubertal Brahman bulls, after receiving a single dose of 3, 6, 9 or 12Gray (Gy) irradiation. Biopsy samples of testis tissue were collected and processed for immunohistology at various times following irradiation. Spermatogenic recovery was defined by the changes in tubule diameter, and absolute numbers of undifferentiated spermatogonia (PLZF positive cells) and Sertoli cells (GATA-4 positive cells) per tubule cross section. The effect of irradiation on the depletion of testicular cells was dose-dependent. Immunohistological results from both the 9 and 12Gy group showed degeneration of seminiferous tubules, compared with other doses and controls. From 2 weeks after the treatment, irradiation resulted in a significant and dramatic reduction in tubule diameter (up to 40%), number of undifferentiated spermatogonia (up to 90%) and Sertoli cells (up to 70%), which was sustained for up to 16 weeks post-irradiation in 9 and 12Gy groups (P<0.0001). However, a moderate depletion effect was observed in the 6Gy treatment groups, compared with 9 and 12Gy doses. The 6Gy treatment had significant effects on spermatogonia (up to 79% reduction) and Sertoli cell (30% reduction) numbers following irradiation (P<0.0001). In contrast, the 3Gy dose had no significant effect at either 3 or 5 weeks post-irradiation on tubule diameter, spermatogonia or Sertoli cells. In conclusion, the results from the current study suggest that treatment of recipient testes with a single dose of 6Gy irradiation can temporarily deplete spermatogonial cells in pre-pubertal Brahman bulls, whilst minimising the impact on Sertoli cells and tubule morphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrahman 3aSertoli cells 3abulls 3airradiation 3aseminiferous tubules 3aspermatogonia 3azebu 0aIrradiation 0aUndifferentiated spermatogonia 0aSertoli cells 0aDepletion 0aBos indicus1 aDavey, Rhonda1 aStockwell, Sally1 aSchmoelzl, Sabine1 aUphill, Grant1 aPoirier, Valerie1 aHope, Michelle1 aHill, Jonathan R.1 aHolland, Michael K.1 aLehnert, Sigrid A.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2013 Oct., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.124-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013600171520099600307592002801303650001001331650002201341650002201363650001001385650000901395651000901404700002601413700002101439700002201460700001901482700002201501773012501523856008301648852000901731655001201740IND60742516420221117020350.0210624e20210612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074251642DNAL7 a10.3390/environments80600552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavankar, Farzam 10aInfluence of Forest Management and Sylvicultural Treatments on Abundance of Snags and Tree Cavities in Mountain Mixed Beech Forests  aIn this study the influence of forest management on the characteristics of snags and tree cavities in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran was investigated. In particular, the effect of two sylvicultural treatments (shelter wood and single-tree selection) was assessed in comparison to protected stands. The abundance, diameter, height, and degree of decay of snag species, and the characteristics of birds excavated and natural cavities (number and height from the ground level) were measured by systematic plots in each stand. The results showed that the abundance, species diversity, and size of snags in both of the sylvicultural treatments were significantly lower than the protected stands. The number of birds excavated and natural cavities on thicker snags with moderate decay was significantly higher than other decay classes. Abundance, species diversity, size of snags, and number of tree cavities in the single-tree selection stands were significantly higher than sheltered-wood stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aforest management 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3awood 3aIran1 aLatterini, Francesco 1 aNikooy, Mehrdad 1 aVenanzi, Rachele 1 aNaghdi, Ramin 1 aPicchio, Rodolfo 0 tEnvironments.g2021 June 12, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27132x2076-32987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments80600553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013000158300001600288520125900304592002801563650002901591650002101620650001401641650000901655650001601664650002001680650001701700650000901717650002101726650001501747650001801762650002701780650000901807650001401816650001101830650001301841653003301854653003301887653002701920653002101947653001901968653001701987700001802004700001702022700001902039700001902058773012102077856007502198852000902273655001202282IND60527516820221118223826.0160715e20130123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052751682DNAL7 a10.1021/am302534k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jiang-Jen10aEvaluation of the Antibacterial Activity and Biocompatibility for Silver Nanoparticles Immobilized on Nano Silicate Platelets  ap. 433-443.  aSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known for their bactericidal abilities. The antibacterial potency is dependent on the particle size and dispersion status. In this study, we synthesized AgNP/NSP nanohybrids in two different weight ratios (1/99 and 8/92) using the fully exfoliated clay, i.e., nanosilicate platelets (NSP), as a dispersing agent and carrier for AgNPs. Due to the size of NSP, the immobilized AgNPs do not enter cells readily, which may lower the risk associated with the cellular uptake of AgNPs. The biocompatibility, immunological response, and antimicrobial activities of AgNP/NSP hybrids were evaluated. The results revealed that AgNP/NSP hybrids elicited merely mild inflammatory response and retained the outstanding antibacterial activity. The hybrids were further embedded in poly(ether)urethane (PEU) to increase the biocompatibility. At the same silver content (20 ppm), the PEU-AgNP/NSP nanocomposites were nontoxic to mouse skin fibroblasts, while simultaneously exhibiting nearly complete bacterial growth reduction (99.9%). PEU containing the same amount of free AgNPs did not display such an effect. Our results verify the better biosafety of the AgNPs/NSP hybrids and their polymer nanocomposites for further clinical use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiosafety 3aclay 3afibroblasts 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amice 3amicrobial growth 3ananosilver 3aparticle size 3apolymer nanocomposites 3arisk 3asilicates 3asilver 3aurethane 0ananosilicate platelets (NSP) 0asilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) 0aantibacterial activity 0abiocompatibility 0ananocomposites 0apolyurethane1 aLin, Wen-Chun1 aLi, Shing-Da1 aLin, Cheng-Yen1 aHsu, Shan-Hui,0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Jan. 23, v. 5, no. 2 p.433-443dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam302534k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245021900162300001800381520070300399592002801102650002301130650001201153650001301165650002101178700002301199700002301222700001601245700002001261700002101281700002501302700002401327773012901351856007301480852000901553655001201562IND60658134720221118205450.0190816e20071010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065813472DNAL7 a10.1039/b708073e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragonetti, Claudia10aCyclometallated iridium(iii) complexes with substituted 1,10-phenanthrolines: a new class of highly active organometallic second order NLO-phores with excellent transparency with respect to second harmonic emission  ap. 4116-4118.  a[Ir(ppy)₂(5-R-1,10-phen)][PF₆] (ppy = cyclometallated 2-phenylpyridine, phen = phenanthroline, R = H, Me, NMe₂, NO₂) and [Ir(ppy)₂(4-R′,7-R′-1,10-phen)][PF₆] (R′ = Me, Ph) complexes are characterized by one of the highest second order NLO response (measured by the EFISH technique) reported for a metal complex, mainly due (as suggested by a theoretical SOS-TDDFT investigation) to MLCT processes from the ppy–Ir based moiety acting as donor push system to π* orbitals of phen, acting as an acceptor pull system; the good transparency to the second harmonic emission renders these NLO-phores appealing as building blocks for molecular materials with second harmonic generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3airidium 3amoieties 3anitrogen dioxide1 aRighetto, Stefania1 aRoberto, Dominique1 aUgo, Renato1 aValore, Adriana1 aFantacci, Simona1 aSgamellotti, Antonio1 aDe Angelis, Filippo0 tChemical communications.g2007 Oct. 10, , no. 40 p.4116-4118dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b708073e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03858naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012400173300001800297520222800315592002802543650001702571650003202588650001802620650001102638650001402649650002902663650001002692650001302702650001102715650002602726650001902752650002502771650001702796650001302813650001302826650001402839650002102853650001902874650001302893650001902906650001202925653001102937653002102948653001802969653001202987653002602999653003503025700002003060700001803080773009903098856008603197852000903283655001203292IND60534990320221122121721.0190319e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053499032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamanaka, Atsushi10aEvaluation of single-round infectious, chimeric dengue type 1 virus as an antigen for dengue functional antibody assays  ap. 4289-4295.  aDengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are endemic throughout tropical and subtropical countries. Four serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV-1 to DENV-4), each with several genotypes including various subclades, are co-distributed in most endemic areas. Infection–neutralizing and -enhancing antibodies are believed to play protective and pathogenic roles, respectively. Measurement of these functional antibodies against a variety of viral strains is thus important for evaluating coverage and safety of dengue vaccine candidates. Although transportation of live virus materials beyond national borders is increasingly limited, this difficulty may be overcome using biotechnology that enables generation of an antibody-assay antigen equivalent to authentic virus based on viral sequence information. A rapid system to produce flavivirus single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) was recently developed using a Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) subgenomic replicon plasmid. This system allows production of chimeric SRIPs that have surface proteins of other flaviviruses. In the present study, SRIPs of DENV-1 (D1-SRIPs) were evaluated as an antigen for functional antibody assays. Inclusion of the whole mature capsid gene of JEV into the replicon plasmid provided higher D1-SRIP yields than did its exclusion in cases where a DENV-1 surface-protein-expressing plasmid was used for co-transfection of 293T cells with the replicon plasmid. In an assay to measure the balance between neutralizing and enhancing activities, dose (antibody dilution)-dependent activity curves in dengue-immune human sera or mouse monoclonal antibodies obtained using D1-SRIP antigen were equivalent to those obtained using DENV-1 antigen. Similar results were obtained using additional DENV-2 and DENV-3 systems. In a conventional Vero-cell neutralization test, a significant correlation was shown between antibody titers obtained using D1-SRIP and DENV-1 antigens. These results demonstrate the utility of D1-SRIPs as an alternative antigen to authentic DENV-1 in functional antibody assays. SRIP antigens may contribute to dengue vaccine candidate evaluation, understanding of dengue pathogenesis, and development of serodiagnostic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3aJapanese encephalitis virus 3abiotechnology 3acapsid 3achimerism 3adengue hemorrhagic fever 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneutralization 3aneutralization tests 3apathogenesis 3aplasmids 3areplicon 3aserotypes 3asurface proteins 3atransportation 3avaccines 3aviral antigens 3aviruses 0aDengue 0aSerological test 0aViral antigen 0aChimera 0aNeutralizing antibody 0aAntibody-dependent enhancement1 aSuzuki, Ryosuke1 aKonishi, Eiji0 tVaccine.g2014 July 23, v. 32, no. 34 p.4289-4295dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245017300161300002000334520153600354592002801890650002301918650002001941650000901961650001801970650001401988650001502002650001702017650002202034650002802056653002502084653002502109653002402134653002502158653001702183700001402200700001502214700001702229700001702246700001802263700001902281700001802300700002002318700001402338700001802352700001402370773012902384856007802513852000902591655001202600IND60529939920221121032043.0160720e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052993992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b044422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xingye10aTumor-Homing and Penetrating Peptide-Functionalized Photosensitizer-Conjugated PEG-PLA Nanoparticles for Chemo-Photodynamic Combination Therapy of Drug-Resistant Cancer  ap. 17817-17832.  aThe combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy holds great potential in combating drug-resistant cancers. However, the major challenge that lies ahead is how to achieve high coloading capacity for both photosensitizer and chemo-drugs and how to gain efficient delivery of drugs to the drug-resistant tumors. In this study, we prepared a nanovehicle for codelivery of photosensitizer (pyropheophorbide-a, PPa) and chemo-drugs (paclitaxel, PTX) based on the synthesis of PPa-conjugated amphiphilic copolymer PPa-PLA-PEG-PLA-PPa. The obtained nanoparticles (PP NP) exhibited a satisfactory high drug-loading capacity for both drugs. To achieve effective tumor-targeting therapy, the surface of PP NP was decorated with a tumor-homing and penetrating peptide F3. In vitro cellular experiments showed that F3-functionalized PP NP (F3-PP NP) exhibited higher cellular association than PP NP and resulted in the strongest antiproliferation effect. In addition, compared with the unmodified nanoparticles, F3-PP NP exhibited a more preferential enrichment at the tumor site. Pharmacodynamics evaluation in vivo demonstrated that a longer survival time was achieved by the tumor-bearing mice treated with PP NP (+laser) than those treated with chemotherapy only or PDT only. Such antitumor efficacy of combination therapy was further improved following the F3 peptide functionalization. Collectively, these results suggested that targeted combination therapy may pave a promising way for the therapy of drug-resistant tumor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adrug resistance 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3apharmacology 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 0atumor-homing peptide 0amultidrug resistance 0acombination therapy 0aphotodynamic therapy 0ananoparticle1 aJiang, Di1 aKang, Ting1 aYao, Jianhui1 aJing, Yixian1 aJiang, Tianze1 aFeng, Jingxian1 aZhu, Qianqian1 aSong, Qingxiang1 aDong, Nan1 aGao, Xiaoling1 aChen, Jun0 tACS applied materials .g2016 July 20, v. 8, no. 28 p.17817-17832dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b044423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03669naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245014000211300001800351506007600369520168200445592002802127506003702155650002502192650001502217650001402232650002502246650001502271650001002286650000902296650001202305650002702317650002002344650002402364650002902388650002002417650004502437650004802482650001102530650003802541650000902579650000902588650002302597650002002620650004002640650003202680700001902712700001902731700002402750700002002774700001802794700001802812700002402830700002402854773009602878856004802974852000903022655001203031IND50061014020221207065345.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006101402DNAL7 a224224702pmid7 aPMC34457722pmcid7 a10.1007/s11248-012-9605-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFielder, Thomas J.10aComparison of male chimeric mice generated from microinjection of JM8.N4 embryonic stem cells into C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NTac blastocysts  ap. 1149-1158.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo identify ways to improve the efficiency of generating chimeric mice via microinjection of blastocysts with ES cells, we compared production and performance of ES-cell derived chimeric mice using blastocysts from two closely related and commonly used sub-strains of C57BL/6. Chimeras were produced by injection of the same JM8.N4 (C57BL/6NTac) derived ES cell line into blastocysts of mixed sex from either C57BL/6J (B6J) or C57BL/6NTac (B6NTac) mice. Similar efficiency of production and sex-conversion of chimeric animals was observed with each strain of blastocyst. However, B6J chimeric males had fewer developmental abnormalities involving urogenital and reproductive tissues (1/12, 8 %) compared with B6NTac chimeric males (7/9, 78 %). The low sample size did not permit determination of statistical significance for many parameters. However, in each category analyzed the B6J-derived chimeric males performed as well, or better, than their B6NTac counterparts. Twelve of 14 (86 %) B6J male chimeras were fertile compared with 6 of 11 (55 %) B6NTac male chimeras. Ten of 12 (83 %) B6J chimeric males sired more than 1 litter compared with only 3 of 6 (50 %) B6NTac chimeras. B6J male chimeras produced more litters per productive mating (3.42 ± 1.73, n = 12) compared to B6NTac chimeras (2.17 ± 1.33, n = 6). Finally, a greater ratio of germline transmitting chimeric males was obtained using B6J blastocysts (9/14; 64 %) compared with chimeras produced using B6NTac blastocysts (4/11; 36 %). Use of B6J host blastocysts for microinjection of ES cells may offer improvements over blastocysts from B6NTac and possibly other sub-strains of C57BL/6 mice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3ablastocyst 3achimerism 3aembryonic stem cells 3agerm cells 3amales 3amice 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxphysiology 2aCells, Cultured 2aChimeraxphysiology 2aDNAxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEmbryo Transfer 2aEmbryo, Mammalianxcytologyxphysiology. 2aEmbryonic Stem Cellsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aGerm Cellsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMicroinjections 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpermatogenesisxphysiology1 aYi, Charles S.1 aMasumi, Juliet1 aWaymire, Katrina G.1 aChen, Hsiao-Wen1 aWang, Shuling1 aShi, Kai-Xuan1 aWallace, Douglas C.1 aMacGregor, Grant R.0 tTransgenic research.g2012 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1149-1158dSpringer-Verlagx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-012-9605-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245016200153300001600315500001500331520176800346592002802114650001402142650002302156650000902179650001602188650001702204650002102221650001402242650001702256650000902273650001202282650002102294650000902315650001302324650001302337650001302350650001102363650001402374653001702388653002102405653002002426653003802446653002202484700002302506700002102529700002302550700002302573700002202596700002302618700002602641700002002667773012102687856007502808852000902883655001202892IND60527516920170710000000.0160715e20130123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052751692DNAL7 a10.1021/am30254542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiu10aNanoclay Gelation Approach toward Improved Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell Efficiencies: An Investigation of Charge Transport and Shift in the TiO2 Conduction Band  ap. 444-450.  a2019-12-06  aNanoclay minerals play a promising role as additives in the liquid electrolyte to form a gel electrolyte for quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, because of the high chemical stability, unique swelling capability, ion exchange capacity, and rheological properties of nanoclays. Here, we report the improved performance of a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte that is made from a liquid electrolyte and synthetic nitrate-hydrotalcite nanoclay. Charge transport mechanisms in the gel electrolyte and nanoclay interactions with TiO₂/electrolyte interface are discussed in detail. The electrochemical analysis reveals that the charge transport is solely based on physical diffusion at the ratio of [PMII]:[I₂] = 10:1 (where PMII is 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide). The calculated physical diffusion coefficient shows that the diffusion of redox ions is not affected much by the viscosity of nanoclay gel. The addition of nitrate-hydrotalcite clay in the electrolyte has the effect of buffering the protonation process at the TiO₂/electrolyte interface, resulting in an upward shift in the conduction band and a boost in open-circuit voltage (VOC). Higher VOC values with undiminished photocurrent is achieved with nitrate-hydrotalcite nanoclay gel electrolyte for organic as well as for inorganic dye (D35 and N719) systems. The efficiency for hydrotalcite clay gel electrolyte solar cells is increased by 10%, compared to that of the liquid electrolyte. The power conversion efficiency can reach 10.1% under 0.25 sun and 9.6% under full sun. This study demonstrates that nitrate-hydrotalcite nanoclay in the electrolyte not only solidifies the liquid electrolyte to prevent solvent leakage, but also facilitates the improvement in cell efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananoclays 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aions 3adiffusivity 3aion exchange 3atitanium dioxide 3aviscosity 3ahydrotalcite 3aclay 3aiodides 3aelectrochemistry 3agels 3asolvents 3agelation 3aminerals 3aiodine 3aadditives 0aelectrolytes 0aanionic nanoclay 0agel electrolyte 0adye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) 0aquasi-solid state1 aKulkarni, Sneha A.1 aIto, Bruno

The aim of this review was to evaluate and compare efficacy and safety of antifungal agents for the treatment of candidemia. A systematic review with network meta-analysis (NMA), surface under the cumulative ranking analysis (SUCRA) and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses (SMAA) was performed (PROSPERO-CRD42020149264). Searches were conducted in PubMed and Scopus (Nov-2021). Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of oral antifungals (any dose or regimen) on mycological cure, discontinuation rates and adverse events were included. Overall, 13 trials (n=3632) were analysed. There were no significant differences between therapies for the efficacy outcomes; however, caspofungin (50-150 mg), rezafungin (200-400 mg) and micafungin (100-150 mg) had higher rates of clinical and mycological responses (SUCRA overall response >60%) and were considered the most promising therapies. Fluconazole (400 mg) rated worst for overall response (17%). Rezafungin (200-400 mg) and micafungin (100 mg) were associated with lower discontinuation rates (<40%). Conventional amphotericin B (0.6-0.7 mg/kg) was more likely to be discontinued (odds ratio [OR] 0.08; 95% credibility interval [CrI] 0.00-0.95 vs. caspofungin 150 mg) and may impair liver function (87%). Echinocandins are recommended as first-line treatments for invasive candidiasis following a priority order of caspofungin then micafungin. Rezafungin, an echinocandin under development, represents a potential option that should be further investigated. Azoles and liposomal amphotericin B can be used as second-line treatments in cases of fungal resistance or hypersensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphotericin B 3acandidemia 3acandidiasis 3acaspofungin 3afluconazole 3afungi 3ahospitals 3ahypersensitivity 3aliver function 3ameta-analysis 3amicafungin 3amortality 3asystematic review 0aInvasive fungal infection 0aInvasive candidiasis 0aAntifungal agents 0aSystematic review 0aMeta-analysis1 aVilhena, Raquel O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8942-05911 aSantos, Josiane M.M.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0244-50491 aFachi, Mariana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5918-47381 aBöger, Beatriz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0025-23151 aAdam, Livia M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1704-47931 aTonin, Fernanda S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4262-86081 aPontarolo, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7049-43630 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2022 Aug., v. 60, no. 2 p.106614-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2022.1066143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245010500164300001600269500001900285520127200304592002801576650001601604650001701620650001401637650002501651650000901676650001501685650000901700650000701709650002401716650002101740650001101761650001601772650001501788650004001803653002801843653002601871653003701897700001701934700001701951700001301968700001301981700001501994700002102009700001902030700001602049773012202065856008402187852000902271655001202280IND60685025020221118023732.0201025e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068502502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gaost.2020.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xinkai10aEstablishment of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis for soybean protein isolate and its application  ap. 100-109.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo optimize the conditions for the establishment of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) of soybean protein isolate (SPI), we investigated Ampholine mixture, anodic and cathodic electrolytes, loading amount of sample, acrylamide concentration, pH gradient and gel staining method in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to optimize the protein imaging conditions in two-dimensional gel. The results of mixed-level design experiments showed that Ampholine, loading amount and gel staining method had significant effect (P < 0.05) on 2-DE of SPI. The optimal conditions were Ampholine mixture (pH 3–10 + pH 5–7 or pH 4–6 + pH 5–7), loading amount of 2 mg sample and silver staining. Although the acrylamide concentration of the gel, the pH gradient, the anodic and cathodic electrolyte solutions had significant statistical effects on the protein separation degree, the complexity of the protein composition and the visibility of the gel images were more inclined to the 12% gel, the 3–10 pH gradient and the H₃PO₄/NaOH electrolyte. According to the established conditions, the hydrolyzed products of SPI emulsion were determined by 2-DE, and the dynamic changes of protein in the process of enzymatic hydrolysis were described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aelectrolytes 3aemulsions 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agels 3ahydrolysis 3aoils 3apH 3aprotein composition 3aprotein isolates 3asilver 3asoy protein 3atechnology 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0aSoybean protein isolate 0aEnzymatic hydrolysate 0aSoybean protein isolate emulsion1 aCui, Yaoming1 aGuan, Junjun1 aLiu, Xue1 aZhu, Hao1 aJi, Xuyang1 aZheng, Jianzhang1 aCheng, Yunlong1 aFu, Xiaofei0 tGrain & oil science and technology.g2020 Sept., v. 3, no. 3 p.100-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27281x2590-25987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaost.2020.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245012400184300001600308520187000324592002802194650001302222650001602235650002102251650002502272650002102297650001202318650001002330650001602340650001402356650001702370650001502387650001402402650000902416650001302425650001202438650002702450650006302477650001102540650003102551650006002582650000902642650003602651650002102687650000902708650002102717650003502738650002602773700001402799700001502813700002102828700001402849773010002863856004802963852000903011655001203020IND50074482520221119221101.0140404e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007448252DNAL7 a244195122pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-013-1771-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTschernig, T.10aExpression of caveolin-1 and podocalyxin in rat lungs challenged with 2-kDa macrophage-activating lipopeptide and Flt3L  ap. 207-216.  aCaveolin-1 is one of the important regulators of vascular permeability in inflamed lungs. Podocalyxin is a CD34 protein expressed on vascular endothelium and has a role in podocyte development in the kidney. Few data are available on the expression of caveolin-1 and podocalyxin in lungs challenged with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonists such as mycoplasma-derived macrophage activating lipopeptide or with immune modulators such as Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 ligand (Flt3L), which expands dendritic cell populations in the lung. Because of the significance of pathogen-derived molecules that act through TLR2 and of the role of immune modulators in lung physiology, we examine the immunohistochemical expression of caveolin-1 and podocalyxin in lungs from rats challenged with a 2-kDa macrophage-activating lipopeptide (MALP-2) and Flt3L. Normal rat lungs expressed caveolin-1 in alveolar septa, vascular endothelium and airway epithelium, especially along the lateral borders of epithelial cells but not in alveolar macrophages. MALP-2 and Flt3L decreased and increased, respectively, the expression of caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 expression seemed to increase in microvessels in bronchiole-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) in Flt3L-challenged lungs but not in normal or MALP-2-treated lungs. Podocalyxin was absent in the epithelium and alveolar macrophages but was present in the vasculature of control, Flt3L- and MALP-2-treated rats. Compared with control and MALP-2-treated rats, Flt3L-treated lungs showed greater expression of podocalyxin in BALT vasculature and at the interface of monocytes and the endothelium. These immunohistochemical data describing the altered expression of caveolin-1 and podocalyxin in lungs treated with MALP-2 or Flt3L encourage further mechanistic studies on the role of podocalyxin and caveolin-1 in lung inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aendothelium 3aepithelial cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aimmunomodulators 3akidneys 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amonocytes 3apermeability 3aphysiology 3apneumonia 3arats 3atyrosine 2aAnimals 2aCaveolin 1xmetabolism 2aEndothelium, Vascularxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aLipopeptidesxpharmacology 2aLungxblood supplyxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMembrane Proteinsxpharmacology 2aMolecular Weight 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Lew 2aSialoglycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aStaining and Labeling1 aPabst, R.1 aKasper, M.1 aEl-Hadi, Mustafa1 aSingh, B.0 tCell and tissue research.g2014 Apr., v. 356, no. 1 p.207-216dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-013-1771-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245013000212300001800342520184300360592002802203650002502231650001802256650001502274650001302289650001402302650002002316650001102336650002102347650002402368650003002392650000902422650001302431650001602444650001302460653001402473653001202487653001602499653000802515653000802523653000902531653000902540653000802549653001102557653000802568700001802576700002402594700001902618773009902637856008602736852000902822655001202831IND60534990520221122143454.0190319e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053499052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeunou, Pascal F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6038-146110aHeterologous prime-boost immunization with live attenuated B. pertussis BPZE1 followed by acellular pertussis vaccine in mice  ap. 4281-4288.  aPertussis is a severe and life-threatening infectious disease. Two successive generations of vaccines have strongly reduced its incidence over the last 70 years. However, despite excellent global vaccine coverage, it is still not under control and constitutes today the most frequent vaccine-preventable childhood disease. New vaccination approaches are therefore needed. Here, we provide preclinical proof of concept for a heterologous prime-boost strategy, using the live attenuated Bordetella pertussis vaccine candidate BPZE1 to prime infant and neonatal mice intranasally and a currently available acellular pertussis vaccine (aPV) as a booster. Intranasal vaccination with BPZE1 provided strong protection against challenge in neonatal mice, which could be boosted with a single dose of aPV. Furthermore, BPZE1 priming induced a strong Th1/Th17 response, which was maintained after repeated aPV administrations, in contrast to non-primed mice, in which aPV administrations resulted in Th2 skewing. In addition to T cell responses, intranasal administration of BPZE1 to infant or neonatal mice also primed antibody responses to B. pertussis antigens, with a strong preference of the IgG2a over the IgG1 isotypes, which was not seen in non-primed animals. Finally, neonatal BPZE1 priming strongly enhanced aPV-induced protection against B. pertussis challenge. These results lend support for a heterologous prime-boost strategy to control pertussis by using BPZE1 early in life and considering the current aPV administrations as booster vaccinations, thereby bridging the gap from birth to the first aPV immunizations and avoiding aPV-mediated Th2 skewing. A first-in-man clinical trial on BPZE1 has recently been successfully completed, which provides hope that these findings may be translated into human applications in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella pertussis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3achildhood 3aclinical trials 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfectious diseases 3aintranasal administration 3amice 3aneonates 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aPertussis 0aVaccine 0aPrime-boost 0aaPV 0aFHA 0ai.n. 0ai.p. 0aprn 0aPBS/Tw 0aPTX1 aKammoun, Hana1 aDebrie, Anne-Sophie1 aLocht, Camille0 tVaccine.g2014 July 23, v. 32, no. 34 p.4281-4288dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245018500162300001800347520150000365592002801865650001101893650003001904650001901934650003501953650001901988650002002007650001802027650001302045650000702058650002602065650001802091650001102109650001402120650001202134650001702146700002402163700002402187700002102211700002402232773012802256856007402384852000902458655001202467IND60638405620221121065520.0190429e20160623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063840562DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay01460g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhonchai, Apichai10aSimple and rapid screening of the thiocyanate level in saliva for the identification of smokers and non-smokers by capillary electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection  ap. 4983-4990.  aA simple and rapid capillary electrophoresis method with contactless conductivity detection for direct determination of thiocyanate in saliva to differentiate between smokers and non-smokers is proposed. Simple saliva preparation was performed by centrifugation and the dilute and shoot method (1 : 1, v/v) with a running buffer prior to hydrodynamic injection. The running buffer was 20.0 mM His/MES at pH 6.00 containing 0.1 mM CTAB as the electroosmotic flow modifier. Maleate anions were employed as the internal standard for the precision of the response factor of electrophoresis separation which was carried out at −8.0 kV (266 V cm⁻¹) with a total analysis time of 3.5 min per sample. A linear calibration curve for thiocyanate in the concentration range 0.2–4.0 mM was obtained (r² > 0.999). The limit of quantification was 0.12 mM which is sufficient for the quantitative determination of thiocyanate in saliva for the purpose of identification of smokers and non-smokers. Intra-day and inter-day precisions were 0.7–1.7% RSD and 2.4–6.4% RSD, respectively. Accuracy based on the percentage recovery of spiked saliva samples was in the range of 72–141% (n = 18). The measured thiocyanate levels were significantly different to classify non-smokers from smokers; a cut-off value of 1.0 mM is proposed to separate the two groups. This method is convenient and rapid, suitable for screening of a large number of subjects, such as in clinical work or health-care surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acentrifugation 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3aelectroosmosis 3ahealth services 3ahydrodynamics 3amaleates 3apH 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3asaliva 3ascreening 3asurveys 3athiocyanates1 aSrisukpan, Thapanat1 aRiengrojpitak, Suda1 aWilairat, Prapin1 aChantiwas, Rattikan0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 June 23, v. 8, no. 25 p.4983-4990dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay01460g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012600171520198500297592002802282650002702310650003702337650002602374650002602400650002302426650002202449650001302471650001202484650001002496650002302506650001002529650001002539650002602549650001402575650001102589650002002600650001402620650002102634650001402655650002202669650001402691650001802705650002202723650001102745650003002756650001402786650001402800650001302814651001202827700001602839700001802855700002102873700002402894700002502918700002202943773012702965856008503092852000903177655001203186IND60707878720221118035910.0200821e20200723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070787872DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80811042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirsch, Nicola 10aPhenotypic and Genotypic Properties of Vibrio cholerae non-O1, non-O139 Isolates Recovered from Domestic Ducks in Germany  aVibrio cholerae non-O1, non-O139 bacteria are natural inhabitants of aquatic ecosystems and have been sporadically associated with human infections. They mostly lack the two major virulence factors of toxigenic V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 strains, which are the causative agent of cholera. Non-O1, non-O139 strains are found in water bodies, sediments, and in association with other aquatic organisms. Occurrence of these bacteria in fecal specimens of waterfowl were reported, and migratory birds likely contribute to the long-distance transfer of strains. We investigated four V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139 isolates for phenotypic traits and by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The isolates were recovered from organs of domestic ducks with serious disease symptoms. WGS data revealed only a distant genetic relationship between all isolates. The isolates harbored a number of virulence factors found in most V. cholerae strains. Specific virulence factors of non-O1, non-O139 strains, such as the type III secretion system (TTSS) or cholix toxin, were observed. An interesting observation is that all isolates possess multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin toxins (MARTX) closely related to the MARTX of toxigenic El Tor O1 strains. Different primary sequences of the abundant OmpU proteins could indicate a significant role of this virulence factor. Phenotypic characteristics such as hemolysis and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) were studied. Three isolates showed susceptibility to a number of tested antimicrobials, and one strain possessed AMR genes located in an integron. Knowledge of the environmental occurrence of V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139 in Germany is limited. The source of the infection of the ducks is currently unknown. In the context of the ‘One Health’ concept, it is desirable to study the ecology of V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139, as it cannot be excluded that the isolates possess zoonotic potential and could cause infections in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae non-O1 3aVibrio cholerae non-O1, non-O139 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic organisms 3abacteria 3acholera 3aducks 3aetiological agents 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3amigratory birds 3aphenotype 3apoultry diseases 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3asurface water 3atoxigenic strains 3atoxins 3atype III secretion system 3avirulence 3awaterfowl 3azoonoses 3aGermany1 aKappe, Eva 1 aGangl, Armin 1 aSchwartz, Keike 1 aMayer-Scholl, Anne 1 aHammerl, Jens  Andre1 aStrauch, Eckhard 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 July 23, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80811043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245009400189300001500283520116500298592002801463650003601491650001801527650002101545650001101566650001701577650001401594650001501608650001201623650003401635650002401669650001701693650003001710650002101740650001801761650003001779650003001809650001101839650003501850650004701885650004601932650003901978650003602017650004202053700001902095700001702114773009702131856008402228990002302312852000902335655001202344IND60092111420221120120244.0141103e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009211142DNAL7 a223611762pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2012.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Chih-Hsin10aHMGB-1 induces cell motility and α5β1 integrin expression in human chondrosarcoma cells  ap. 98-106.  aChondrosarcoma is a type of highly malignant tumor with a potent capacity to invade locally and cause distant metastasis. High mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB)-1 is a widely studied, ubiquitous nuclear protein that is present in eukaryotic cells, and plays a crucial role in inflammatory response. However, the effects of HMGB-1 on human chondrosarcoma cells are largely unknown. In this study, we found that HMGB-1 increased the migration and the expression of α5β1 integrin in human chondrosarcoma cells. Transfection of cells with receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) receptor siRNA reduced HMGB-1-induced cell migration and integrin expression. Activations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and AP-1 pathways after HMGB-1 treatment were demonstrated, and HMGB-1-induced expression of integrin and migration activity was inhibited by the specific inhibitor and mutant of PI3K, Akt, and AP-1 cascades. Taken together, our results indicated that HMGB-1 enhances the migration of chondrosarcoma cells by increasing α5β1 integrin expression through the RAGE receptor/PI3K/Akt/c-Jun/AP-1 signal transduction pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3acell movement 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aintegrins 3ametastasis 3amutants 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asignal transduction 3atransfection 2aBone Neoplasmsxpathology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Movement 2aChondrosarcomaxpathology 2aHMGB1 Proteinxphysiology 2aHumans 2aIntegrin alpha5beta1xgenetics 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxphysiology 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxphysiology 2aReceptors, Immunologicxphysiology 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aTranscription Factor AP-1xphysiology1 aKeng, Yun-Ting1 aLiu, Ju-Fang0 tCancer letters.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 322, no. 1 p.98-106dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.02.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245016400211500001900375520200400394592002802398650001602426650001602442650001502458650001802473650001502491650002302506650002902529650002102558653002902579653001802608653003402626653002202660653001702682653002202699653001402721653002502735700001802760773011602778856008402894852000902978655001202987IND60732861320221116203712.0210708e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073286132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1068742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDietrich, Ottfried1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4637-978410aField calibrations of a Diviner 2000 capacitive soil water content probe on a shallow groundwater site and the application in a weighable groundwater lysimeter  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe determination of the volumetric soil water content θᵥ by means of capacitive profile probes is often applied to investigate the soil water storage change ΔS that serves as basis for decisions in agricultural water management. The soil properties have a big effect on the accuracy of the θᵥ measurements. The use of only one calibration function, often provided by the manufacturers of the probes, cannot fulfil the requirements of all site conditions. Therefore, many individual calibration functions have in the past been determined for different soils and sensors. A literature review of existing calibration functions of the capacitive profile probe Diviner 2000 shows the broad range of available functions. The review makes it clear that there is a lack of functions for organic soils. These soils are typical soils of wet sites with shallow groundwater tables. The soil moisture is of big importance for many ecological processes of these sites and therefore an exact determination of θᵥ is important. A Diviner 2000 profile probe was calibrated on such a shallow groundwater site in a classic field calibration procedure and the determined functions were applied to the soil profile of a weighable groundwater lysimeter. The soil water storage change ΔS was estimated with the measured θᵥ values and compared with the measured mass change Δm of the lysimeter. The mean error (bias) between ΔS with the field calibration function and Δm was 7.8 kg and the root mean squared error (RMSE) 19.9 kg. An iterative adaptation of the calibration functions to the measured Δm values of the lysimeter reduced the bias to 0.9 kg and the RMSE to 14.0 kg. The investigations illustrate the problems of a classic field calibration under the conditions of a shallow groundwater site with low θᵥ changes in deeper soil horizons and soils with high Cₒᵣg contents as well as the inaccuracy in the determination of ΔS based on θᵥ measurements with capacitive profile probes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3agroundwater 3alysimeters 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3avolumetric water content 3awater management 0aShallow groundwater site 0aOrganic soils 0aVolumetric soil water content 0aCapacitance probe 0aDiviner 2000 0aField calibration 0aLysimeter 0aWater storage change1 aSteidl, Jörg0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 June 30, v. 252 p.106874-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1068743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013700168520171800305592002802023650001502051650001602066650002102082650002602103650001702129650002402146650001502170650002002185650002702205650001802232650002602250650001102276650001302287650002502300650001502325650001802340650001202358650001702370650001502387651001002402700001402412700001402426700002002440700002002460700001602480700001902496700002002515700002002535700001502555773012702570856008502697852000902782655001202791IND60707878820221118035730.0200821e20200805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070787882DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80811932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Sami 10aHow Do Soil Bacterial Diversity and Community Composition Respond under Recommended and Conventional Nitrogen Fertilization Regimes?  aShifts in soil bacterial diversity and community composition are suggested to be induced by elevated input of nitrogen (N) fertilization with implications for soil quality, and consequently production. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of recommended fertilization (RF) and conventional fertilization (CF) on soil chemical properties, crop yield, bacterial diversity, and community composition from two long-term experiments conducted in fluvo-aquic soil and black soil of China. Each site comprised of four treatments, i.e., RF N-, RF N+, CF N-, CF N+. No N fertilization was indicated by N- and N fertilization was indicated by N+. Across both sites, N fertilization significantly increased crop yield compared with no N fertilization and RF successfully enhanced crop yield over CF. Interestingly, the RF maintained bacterial diversity, while CF depressed bacterial diversity in the two soils. Microbial taxa performing important ecological roles such as order Rhodospirillales and Bacillales were significantly enhanced in the RF approach, while Rhizobiales declined under CF. Furthermore, the results of partial least square path modeling revealed that soil available phosphorus (AP) negatively affected bacterial diversity while it positively affected bacterial community structure in fluvo-aquic soils. In contrast, soil pH was positively linked with both bacterial diversity and community structure in black soil. Overall, our study demonstrated that RF is an environmentally friendly approach which not only maintained above ground plant productivity, but also preserved belowground microbial populations and important soil variables regulating bacterial communities varied in different soil types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillales 3aRhizobiales 3aRhodospirillales 3abacterial communities 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3acrop yield 3aedaphic factors 3afertilizer application 3aleast squares 3along term experiments 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3asoil bacteria 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3asoil types 3aChina1 aHe, Ping 1 aAi, Chao 1 aZhao, Shicheng 1 aDing, Wencheng 1 aSong, Dali 1 aZhang, Jiajia 1 aHuang, Shaohui 1 aAbbas, Tanveer 1 aZhou, Wei 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Aug. 05, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80811933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001500185245010500200300001800305506007600323520128400399592002801683506003701711650001101748650001901759650001101778650001301789650001001802650001801812650003101830650001701861653002901878653001701907653002301924653002601947653002701973653002402000700001602024700002402040700002402064700002302088773012302111856008002234852000902314655001202323IND60563576420221207132722.0170301e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056357642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b157282doi7 aPMC53341462pmcid7 a281504892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jinsu10aIncreasing Binding Efficiency via Reporter Shape and Flux in a Viral Nanoparticle Lateral-Flow Assay  ap. 6878-6884.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo identify factors controlling the performance of reporter particles in a sensitive lateral-flow assay (LFA), we investigated the effect of the flux and shape of filamentous bacteriophage (phage) on the performance of phage LFAs. Phage of three different lengths and diameters were modified with biotin and AlexaFluor 555 as binding and read-out elements, respectively. The binding efficiencies of the functionalized phage were tested in a fibrous glass LFA membrane modified with avidin. The total binding rate, quantified using real-time particle counting and particle image velocimetry, decreased monotonically with the average bulk flux of phage through the membrane. At the pore scale, more phage bound in regions with faster local flow, confirming that both average and local flux increased binding. The number of bound phage increased with the aspect ratio of the phage and scaled with the phage surface area, consistent with a binding interaction controlled by the number of recognition elements on the surface. Together, these results indicate that increasing the likelihood that recognition elements on the surface of phage encounter the fibers enhances the assay binding efficiency and suggests one origin for the improved performance of nonspherical phage reporters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aavidin 3abacteriophages 3abiotin 3adiameter 3aglass 3ananoparticles 3aparticle image velocimetry 3asurface area 0apoint-of-care diagnostic 0alateral-flow 0abinding efficiency 0aanisotropic reporters 0ananoparticle transport 0aviral nanoparticles1 aVũ, Bình,1 aKourentzi, Katerina1 aWillson, Richard C.1 aConrad, Jacinta C.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 9, no. 8 p.6878-6884dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b157283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013900164300001800303520130900321592002801630650003101658650002101689650001201710650001101722650002501733650001401758650002301772650002401795650001001819650002101829650002101850650001301871650002201884650000701906650003001913650001601943700002001959700001801979773013801997856008102135852000902216655001202225IND60537177020221119171221.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053717702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-016-1786-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Li-Tao12aA novel amidase from Brevibacterium epidermidis ZJB-07021: gene cloning, refolding and application in butyrylhydroxamic acid synthesis  ap. 1071-1083.  aA novel amidase gene (bami) was cloned from Brevibacterium epidermidis ZJB-07021 by combination of degenerate PCR and high-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (hiTAIL-PCR). The deduced amino acid sequence showed low identity (≤55 %) with other reported amidases. The bami gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the resultant inclusion bodies were refolded and purified to homogeneity with a recovery of 22.6 %. Bami exhibited a broad substrate spectrum towards aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic amides, and showed the highest acyl transfer activity towards butyramide with specific activity of 1331.0 ± 24.0 U mg⁻¹. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that purified Bami exhibited high catalytic efficiency (414.9 mM⁻¹ s⁻¹) for acyl transfer of butyramide, with turnover number (K cₐₜ) of 3569.0 s⁻¹. Key parameters including pH, substrate/co-substrate concentration, reaction temperature and catalyst loading were investigated and the Bami showed maximum acyl transfer activity at 50 °C, pH 7.5. Enzymatic catalysis of 200 mM butyramide with 15 μg mL⁻¹ purified Bami was completed in 15 min with a BHA yield of 88.1 % under optimized conditions. The results demonstrated the great potential of Bami for the production of a variety of hydroxamic acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrevibacterium epidermidis 3aEscherichia coli 3aamidase 3aamides 3aamino acid sequences 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahydroxamic acids 3ainclusion bodies 3akinetics 3amolecular cloning 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atemperature1 aZheng, Ren-Chao1 aZheng, Yu-Guo0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.1071-1083dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-016-1786-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015400168520076200322592002801084650001501112650003101127650001201158650001101170650002001181650002401201653003201225653003201257653002601289653002901315653002601344700002001370700001801390700001301408700002001421700002601441700001401467700001901481773011301500856008601613852000901699655001201708IND60674256420221122060200.0200210e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067425642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1187142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenjie10aDual-objective program and improved artificial bee colony for the optimization of energy-conscious milling parameters subject to multiple constraints  aSelecting a set of reasonable milling parameters of computerized numerical control (CNC) machines is of great importance in decreasing energy consumption and enhancing processing productivity. However, existing works pay little attention to the optimization of energy-conscious milling parameters. This work establishes a dual-objective optimization model for the selection of milling parameters such that power consumption and process time are minimized. With multiple constraints of milling processing conditions, an improved artificial bee colony (ABC) intelligent algorithm is used to handle the proposed dual-objective optimization model. Compared with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), our improved algorithm has good performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy use and consumption 3amilling 3amodels 3aprocessing time 3asystem optimization 0aDual-objective optimization 0aScheduling and optimization 0aMilling process model 0aEnergy consumption model 0aIntelligent algorithm1 aTian, Guangdong1 aChen, Maoning1 aTao, Fei1 aZhang, Chaoyong1 aAI-Ahmari, Abdulraham1 aLi, Zhiwu1 aJiang, Zhigang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 245 p.118714-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1187143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100001800187245011100205506007600316506003100392520068000423592002801103596008301131506003701214650002901251650001801280650001001298650001801308653002401326653001501350653001001365653003101375653002401406653001801430773012001448856008301568852000901651655001201660IND60685025520221207143027.0210812e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068502552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2020.1000312chorus7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2020.1000312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Yangchao10aPerspectives on important considerations in designing nanoparticles for oral delivery applications in food  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aWith rapid technological advancements in nanotechnology, it is important to revisit the knowledge of nanoparticles design and fundamental principles that have played major roles in the development of encapsulation and delivery technologies for food applications.

CK4412  ap. 1189-1193.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTautomycetin (TMC) is a linear polyketide metabolite produced by Streptomyces sp. CK4412 that has been reported to possess multiple biological functions including T cell-specific immunosuppressive and anticancer activities that occur through a mechanism of differential inhibition of protein phosphatases such as PP1, PP2A, and SHP2. We previously reported the characterization of the entire TMC biosynthetic gene cluster constituted by multifunctional type I polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly and suggested that the linear form of TMC could be generated via free acid chain termination by a narrow TMC thioesterase (TE) pocket. The modular nature of the assembly presents a unique opportunity to alter or interchange the native biosynthetic domains to produce targeted variants of TMC. Herein, we report swapping of the TMC TE domain sequence with the exact counterpart of the macrocyclic polyketide pikromycin (PIK) TE. PIK TE-swapped Streptomyces sp. CK4412 mutant produced not only TMC, but also a cyclized form of TMC, implying that the bioengineering based in vivo custom construct can be exploited to produce engineered macrolactones with new structural functionality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptomyces 3aantineoplastic activity 3abioengineering 3aimmunosuppression 3ametabolites 3amultigene family 3amutants 3apolyketide synthases1 aChoi, Si-Sun1 aSherman, David H.1 aKim, Eung-Soo0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.1189-1193dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-016-1790-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04594naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003200135040001800167100002500185245014200210300001100352506007600363520233300439592002802772506003702800650001402837650001302851650001202864650003002876650001302906650002002919650001002939650001502949650001202964650001702976650001202993650001503005650001403020650001403034650000903048650001303057650001203070650001903082650001303101650001203114650004103126650002103167650007903188650001103267650001403278650001203292650001103304650001103315650004603326650003203372650004203404650006303446650003003509650002103539650002103560651001103581651002603592700002203618700002203640773011003662856007903772852000903851655001203860IND50064047020221207121737.0191003e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006404702DNAL7 aPMC35996982pmcid7 a234330782pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-6-392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly-Hope, Louise A10aCan malaria vector control accelerate the interruption of lymphatic filariasis transmission in Africa; capturing a window of opportunity?  ap. 39.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000, and nearly all endemic countries in the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and Asia-Pacific regions have now initiated the WHO recommended mass drug administration (MDA) campaign to interrupt transmission of the parasite. However, nearly 50% of the LF endemic countries in Africa are yet to implement the GPELF MDA strategy, which does not include vector control. Nevertheless, the recent scale up in insecticide treated /long lasting nets (ITNs/LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria control in Africa may significantly impact LF transmission because the parasite is transmitted mainly by Anopheles mosquitoes. This study examined the magnitude, geographical extent and potential impact of vector control in the 17 African countries that are yet to or have only recently started MDA. METHODS: National data on mosquito bed nets, ITNs/LLINs and IRS were obtained from published literature, national reports, surveys and datasets from public sources such as Demographic Health Surveys, Malaria Indicator Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, Malaria Report, Roll Back Malaria and President’s Malaria Initiative websites. The type, number and distribution of interventions were summarised and mapped at sub-national level. and compared with known or potential LF distributions, and those which may be co-endemic with Loa loa and MDA is contraindicated. RESULTS: Analyses found that vector control activities had increased significantly since 2005, with a three-fold increase in ITN ownership and IRS coverage. However, coverage varied dramatically across the 17 countries; some regions reported >70% ITNs ownership and regular IRS activity, while others had no coverage in remote rural populations where the risk of LF was potentially high and co-endemic with high risk L.loa. CONCLUSIONS: Despite many African countries being slow to initiate MDA for LF, the continued commitment and global financial support for NTDs, and the concurrent expansion of vector control activities for malaria, is promising. It is not beyond the capacity of GPELF to reach its target of global LF elimination by 2020, but monitoring and evaluating the impact of these activities over the next decade will be critical to its success.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles 3aInternet 3aLoa loa 3aWorld Health Organization 3abed nets 3adata collection 3adrugs 3afilariasis 3afunding 3ainsecticides 3amalaria 3amonitoring 3aownership 3aparasites 3arisk 3aspraying 3asurveys 3avector control 2aAerosols 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aChild, Preschool 2aElephantiasis, Filarialxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aFemale 2aGeography 2aHousing 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInsect Vectorsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aInsecticide-Treated Bednets 2aInsecticidesxadministration & dosage 2aMalariaxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aMosquito Controlxmethods 2aRural Population 2aUrban Population 3aAfrica 0aAfricaxepidemiology.1 aMolyneux, David H1 aBockarie, Moses J0 tParasites & vectors.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.39-39dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010700158300001600265520063200281592002800913650001100941650001000952650001300962650001700975650001700992653002801009653001601037653004101053653003301094653003501127700001701162700001601179700001501195700002101210700001601231773012101247856007501368852000901443655001201452IND60527517320221123002700.0160715e20130123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052751732DNAL7 a10.1021/am302815y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenchao10aSignificantly Enhanced Energy Output from 3D Ordered Macroporous Structured Fe2O3/Al Nanothermite Film  ap. 239-242.  aA three-dimensionally ordered macroporous Fe₂O₃/Al nanothermite membrane has been prepared with a polystyrene spheres template.

The present study demonstrated that DHMEQ cooperates with Celecoxib (CLX) to decrease NF-κB DNA binding and to inhibit cell growth and proliferation more effectively than treatment with these single agents alone in the hepatoma cell lines HA22T/VGH and Huh-6. ROS production induced by the DHMEQ–CLX combination in turn generated the expression of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and silencing TRB3 mRNA significantly decreased DHMEQ–CLX-induced cell growth inhibition. Moreover, the DHMEQ–CLX combination was associated with induction of PARP cleavage and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and survivin, as well as activated Akt. CD95 and CD95 ligand expression increased synergistically in the combination treatment, which was reversed in the presence of NAC. Knockdown of CD95 mRNA expression significantly decreased DHMEQ–CLX-induced cell growth inhibition in both cell lines. These data suggest that the DHMEQ–CLX combination kills hepatoma cells via ROS production, ER stress response and the activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3astress response 2aAcetylcysteinexpharmacology 2afas Receptorxphysiology. 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBenzamidesxpharmacology 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCyclohexanonesxpharmacology 2aCyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aDrug Synergism 2aEndoplasmic Reticulum Stressxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLiver Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aNF-kappa Bxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPoly(ADP-ribose) Polymerasesxmetabolism 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aPyrazolesxpharmacology 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aRepressor Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aSulfonamidesxpharmacology1 aAzzolina, Antonina1 aUmezawa, Kazuo1 aMontalto, Giuseppe1 aMcCubrey, James A.1 aCervello, Melchiorre0 tCancer letters.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 322, no. 1 p.35-44dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.02.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245009300168300001800261520097900279592002801258650001101286650001401297650002101311650001201332650001501344650001501359650001801374653001201392653001501404653002001419653001001439653001901449653001401468700002901482700001701511700002901528700002001557700002001577700002201597700002401619700002401643773012701667856007301794852000901867655001201876IND60527517520221123002754.0160715e20131023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052751752DNAL7 a10.1021/am401779p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherian, Christie Thomas10aMorphologically Robust NiFe2O4 Nanofibers as High Capacity Li-Ion Battery Anode Material  ap. 9957-9963.  aIn this work, the electrochemical performance of NiFe₂O₄ nanofibers synthesized by an electrospinning approach have been discussed in detail. Lithium storage properties of nanofibers are evaluated and compared with NiFe₂O₄ nanoparticles by galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltammetry studies, both in half-cell configurations. Nanofibers exhibit a higher charge-storage capacity of 1000 mAh g–¹ even after 100 cycles with high Coulmbic efficiency of 100 % between 10 and 100 cycles. Ex situ microscopy studies confirmed that cycled nanofiber electrodes maintained the morphology and remained intact even after 100 charge–discharge cycles. The NiFe₂O₄ nanofiber electrode does not experience any structural stress and eventual pulverisation during lithium cycling and hence provides an efficient electron conducting pathway. The excellent electrochemical performance of NiFe₂O₄ nanofibers is due to the unique porous morphology of continuous nanofibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3amicroscopy 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 0aNiFe2O4 0ananofibers 0aelectrospinning 0aanode 0aLi-ion battery 0aimpedance1 aSundaramurthy, Jayaraman1 aReddy, M.

To investigate this area, we assess osteogenic features in various oral cell types during hMSC coculture, including human alveolar osteoblasts (hOAs), periodontal ligament cells (hPDLs) and gingival fibroblasts (hGFs). Interactive hMSC coculture globally enhanced the transcription of osteogenic genes, in all oral cell types under study, as revealed by qRT-PCR and did not affect oral cell proliferation compared with controls in a transwell coculture system as evaluated by 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine proliferation assay. 3D gel-derived hMSC cocultures exhibited an abundance of bone-related key molecules in oral cells, which followed the ranking hOAs > hGFs > hPDLs. Compared to matched controls, this hierarchy also applied for the presence of higher amounts of extracellular matrix deposits and mineralization nodules in interactive hMSC coculture. Our results show for the first time that in the context of prospective periodontal tissue regeneration strategies, hMSCs influence oral cells by gradually shaping their plasticity, particularly features associated with an osteogenic phenotype. These novel findings contribute another piece to the conceptual hMSC action puzzle and valuably support the notion that hMSCs trigger osteogenesis in the oral cell context.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3acell proliferation 3acoculture 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3ahumans 3aligaments 3amineralization 3aosteoblasts 3aphenotype 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells 3atissue repair 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCalcification, Physiologicxgenetics 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Communicationxgenetics 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCell Proliferation 2aCell Shape 2aCoculture Techniquesxmethods 2aExtracellular Matrix Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHumans 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxcytology. 2aMouthxcytology 2aOsteogenesisxgenetics 2aPeriodontal Ligamentxcytology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aSteinberg, Thorsten1 aVach, Kirstin1 aHellwig, Elmar1 aTomakidi, Pascal0 tCell and tissue research.g2014 Apr., v. 356, no. 1 p.159-170dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-013-1777-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245005100172300001600223520210500239592002802344650001802372650002802390650001202418650002602430650001302456650002002469650001202489650001702501650001702518650000802535650001902543650001202562650001302574650001402587650002002601650001902621650001902640650002202659650002002681650001302701650000902714650001502723650002002738650001702758650001002775700001902785773009502804856008602899852000902985655001202994IND60610962820221121223139.0190712e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061096282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLynch, Gordon S.10aDietary meat and protection against sarcopenia  ap. 180-185.  aSarcopenia describes the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and associated muscle weakness. Sarcopenia is a major global health problem given that the number and proportion of older people in the population is escalating worldwide and represent the fastest growing segment of society. The loss of muscle mass compromises physical capacity, increases susceptibility to falls, and impacts on an individual's functional independence and quality of life. Tackling sarcopenia sensibly and effectively will identify strategies that will enable older adults to age well and age productively. The underlying causes of sarcopenia are complex and multifactorial and will likely require combinatorial therapies to address its symptoms. Nutrition, particularly protein intake, is a more easily modifiable factor, especially when combined with structured (resistance) exercise programs. The relative success of protein feeding strategies for sarcopenia, is limited by a so-called anabolic resistance in older people. Meat contains essential amino acids and nutritive compounds of high quality, and even a moderate intake can increase muscle protein synthesis in older men and women. However, health risks have been identified with the consumption of different meats, with high intake of processed meats increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease and different cancers. Risks for fresh white and red meat are considerably less and modest consumption is encouraged as part of a healthy eating plan for many older adults to ensure adequate protein intake. Other nutritive strategies of relevance for sarcopenia involve fortifying the nutrient value of different meats. Studies on muscle cells and animal models of muscle wasting, have identified the therapeutic potential of the amino acid, glycine, to reduce inflammation, attenuate muscle atrophy, and re-sensitize muscle to anabolic stimuli. Glycine supplementation or feeding animal products with a high glycine content (e.g. gelatin), could represent simple and effective nutritional strategies as part of a suite of therapies to attenuate sarcopenia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acardiovascular diseases 3aelderly 3aessential amino acids 3aexercise 3afeeding methods 3agelatin 3ahealthy diet 3ainflammation 3amen 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3aneoplasms 3anutritive value 3aprocessed meat 3aprotein intake 3aprotein synthesis 3aquality of life 3ared meat 3arisk 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics 3awomen1 aKoopman, René0 tMeat science.g2018 Oct., v. 144 p.180-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012300175300001600298520179300314592002802107650001402135650001602149650001302165650001702178650001702195650001202212650002702224650001102251650001602262650001002278650002302288650001702311650002702328650001902355650001502374650001702389650000902406700002302415700002502438700002402463700001902487700002302506773011602529856005502645852000902700655001202709IND4510586420221121104041.0150730e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451058642DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.01870.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKÃ¶hler, Camilla11aAfolding variant of human Î±âlactalbumin induces mitochondrial permeability transition in isolated mitochondria  ap. 186-191.  aA human milk fraction containing multimeric Î±âlactalbumin (MAL) is able to kill cells via apoptosis. MAL is a protein complex of a folding variant of Î±âlactalbumin and lipids. Previous results have shown that upon treatment of transformed cells, MAL localizes to the mitochondria and cytochromeâc is released into the cytosol. This is followed by activation of the caspase cascade. In this study, we further investigated the involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis induced by the folding variant of Î±âlactalbumin. Addition of MAL to isolated rat liver mitochondria induced a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨m), mitochondrial swelling and the release of cytochromeâc. These changes were Ca2+âdependent and were prevented by cyclosporinâA, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition. MAL also increased the rate of stateâ4 respiration in isolated mitochondria by exerting an uncoupling effect. This effect was due to the presence of fatty acids in theÂ MAL complex because it was abolished completely by BSA. BSA delayed, but failed toÂ prevent, mitochondrial swelling as well as dissipation of ÎÎ¨m, indicating that the fatty acid content of MAL facilitated, rather than caused, these effects. Similar results were obtained with HAMLET (human Î±âlactalbumin made lethal to tumour cells), which is native Î±âlactalbumin converted in vitro to the apoptosisâinducing folding variant of the protein in complex with oleic acid. Our findings demonstrate that a folding variant of Î±âlactalbumin induces mitochondrial permeability transition with subsequent cytochromeâc release, which in transformed cells may lead to activation of the caspase cascade and apoptotic death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abreast milk 3acaspases 3acyclosporine 3acytochrome c 3acytosol 3afatty acid composition 3ahumans 3alactalbumin 3aliver 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasm cells 3aoleic acid 3apermeability 3arats1 aGogvadze, Vladimir1 aHÃ¥kansson, Anders1 aSvanborg, Catharina1 aOrrenius, Sten1 aZhivotovsky, Boris0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 268, no. 1 p.186-191dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.01870.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245012100179300001600300520169900316592002802015650001702043650002902060650001602089650001402105650002302119650004002142650001202182650004702194650002902241650003202270650003702302650001302339650005802352650004502410650009202455650001102547650004302558650005002601650001702651650005502668700001402723700001702737700001502754700002102769700001902790700001902809700001602828773010002844856008102944852000903025655001203034IND50074483220221119221606.0150214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007448322DNAL7 a244424922pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-013-1781-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yan10aEffects of combinations of BMP-2 with FGF-2 and/or VEGF on HUVECs angiogenesis in vitro and CAM angiogenesis in vivo  ap. 109-121.  aAngiogenesis, a complex biologic process, is regulated by a large number of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Whether Bone morphogenetic proteins-2 (BMP-2), the osteoinductive factor, could significantly reinforce the effect of VEGF and FGF-2 on angiogenesis has not been studied in detail. To study the positive effects of multiple growth factors on angiogenesis, HUVECs were treated with BMP-2, VEGF, or FGF-2 singly and in binary and ternary combinations. This study further investigates the optimal timing of the ternary combination of BMP-2, VEGF and FGF-2 for angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane (FGF-2 CAM). Results of single applications of BMP-2, VEGF, or FGF-2 suggested that HUVECs angiogenesis could be promoted in a dose-dependent manner and that the optimal concentration of BMP, VEGF and FGF-2 was 10, 50 and 1 ng/mL, respectively. These results indicated that the angiogenic activity of VEGF and FGF-2 was amplified by combining with BMP-2. The ternary combination of BMP-2, VEGF and FGF-2 exhibited a positive and synergistic effect on HUVECs angiogenesis, with the lower concentrations of each factor (1 ng/mL of BMP-2, 25 ng/mL of VEGF and 0.1 ng/mL of FGF-2) being sufficient to show synergistic promotion. When VEGF and FGF-2 were added in the initial activation stage and BMP-2 was added in the maturation stage, both HUVECs angiogenesis in vitro and CAM angiogenesis in vivo could be enhanced more effectively. These results could provide a basis for the controlled release systems capable of delivering multiple factors sequentially to promote angiogenesis in tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3achorioallantoic membrane 3afibroblasts 3asynergism 3atissue engineering 3avascular endothelial growth factors 2aAnimals 2aBone Morphogenetic Protein 2xpharmacology 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aChickens 2aChorioallantoic Membranexblood supplyxdrug effects. 2aFibroblast Growth Factor 2xpharmacology 2aHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 2xmetabolism 2aNeovascularization, Physiologicxdrug effects 2aTime Factors 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Axpharmacology1 aLeng, Yue1 aYin, Guangfu1 aPu, Ximing1 aHuang, Zhongbing1 aLiao, Xiaoming1 aChen, Xianchun1 aYao, Yadong0 tCell and tissue research.g2014 Apr., v. 356, no. 1 p.109-121dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-013-1781-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245009600206300001800302520159000320592002801910650001101938650001301949650001301962650001601975700002001991700002502011700006602036773011302102856008402215852000902299655001202308IND60607186320221121225005.0180730e20180518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060718632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b005512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Manoj1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6999-676410aLarge PAMAM Dendron Induces Formation of Unusual P4332 Mesophase in Monoolein/Water Systems  ap. 6827-6834.  aCompact macromolecular dendrons have previously been shown to induce the formation of discontinuous inverse micellar assemblies with Fd3m symmetry in monoolein/water systems. Here, we demonstrate that a large PAMAM dendron (G5: fifth generation) induces the formation of a very unusual mesophase with P4₃32 symmetry. This mesophase had previously been observed in monoolein/water systems only on addition of cytochrome c. The P4₃32 mesophase can be considered an intermediate phase between the bicontinuous Ia3d and discontinuous micellar mesophases. We present a detailed investigation of the phase behavior of monoolein/water as a function of G5 concentration and temperature. Addition of 1% G5 in 85/15 monoolein/water system induces a transition from the Lα to Ia3d phase. Further increase in G5 concentration to above 2% induces the formation of the P4₃32 phase. In contrast to this, incorporation of lower generation PAMAM dendrons (G2–G4) in monoolein/water yields a qualitatively different phase diagram with the formation of the reverse micellar Fd3m phase. PAMAM dendrons of all generations, G2–G5, bear terminal amine groups that interact with the monoolein headgroup. The compact molecular architecture of the dendrons and these attractive interactions induce bending of the monoolein bilayer structure. For smaller dendrons, G2–G4, this results in the formation of the Fd3m phase. However, the large size of the G5 dendron precludes this and a rare intermediate phase between the Ia3d and discontinuous micellar phase, and the P4₃32 mesophase forms instead.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3amicelles 3amoieties 3atemperature1 aPatil, Naganath1 aAmbade, Ashootosh V.1 aKumaraswamy, Guruswamy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9442-07750 tLangmuir.g2018 May 18, v. 34, no. 23 p.6827-6834dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b005513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169520121800272592002801490650002401518650002601542650002501568650001301593650001401606650002201620650000901642650001501651650001501666653002401681653002401705653001301729653001501742700002601757700001601783700001901799773010501818856008601923852000902009655001202018IND60779843120221118041713.0220802e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077984312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1067032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Hyeseon10aEvaluation of bacterial community in constructed wetlands treating different sources of wastewater  aBacteria serve as important components of a constructed wetland (CW) system. Various bacterial communities aid in pollutant removal; however, environmental conditions and other external variables can greatly affect their performance and diversity. In this study, four constructed wetlands treating secondary livestock wastewater (LCW), agricultural runoff (ACW1 and ACW2) and urban stormwater (HCW) were investigated to evaluate the relationship between the inflow pollutants and the bacterial community. Based on the findings, the 20 dominant bacterial species in water samples collected from the livestock area (LCW) constituted 98.5% to 99.7% the total bacterial population. In the case of agricultural areas (ACW1 and ACW2), the 20 most abundant bacterial species constituted 99.7% to 99.8% of the total bacterial population. Similarly, the 20 dominant bacterial species found in the soil samples from livestock and agricultural areas made up 97.2% to 98.7% and 99.1% to 99.6% of the total bacterial population, respectively. Generally, the diversity of bacteria in soil was higher compared to water. It is important to establish a target bacterial habitat when creating CW for optimized ecological functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural runoff 3abacterial communities 3aconstructed wetlands 3ahabitats 3alivestock 3apollution control 3asoil 3astormwater 3awastewater 0aBacterial community 0aConstructed wetland 0aBacteria 0aWastewater1 aGeronimo, Franz Kevin1 aJeon, Minsu1 aKim, Lee-Hyung0 tEcological engineering.g2022 Sept., v. 182 p.106703-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1067033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013800173300001800311520117800329592002801507650002101535650002301556650001101579650001701590650001101607650001201618650001801630650002401648650001201672650001301684650001301697650003101710650001301741651001601754700002201770700002501792700001901817700001701836700002801853773009901881856008601980852000902066655001202075IND60534991220221122220607.0190319e20140806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053499122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhelan, Noella W.10aEngaging parents and schools improves uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: Examining the role of the public health nurse  ap. 4665-4671.  aNova Scotia has the highest rate of cervical cancer in Canada, and most of these cases are attributed to the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). In 2007, Gardasil® was approved and implemented in a successful school-based HPV immunization program. Little is known, however, which strategies (if any) used within a school-based program help to improve vaccine uptake.A retrospective, exploratory correlation study was conducted to examine the relationship between school-based strategies and uptake of HPV vaccine. Data was analyzed through Logistic regression, using PASW Statistics 17 (formerly SPSS 17).HPV vaccine initiation was significantly associated with Public Health Nurses providing reminder calls for: consent return (p=0.017) and missed school clinic (p=0.004); HPV education to teachers (p<0.001), and a thank-you note to teachers (p<0.001). Completion of the HPV series was associated with vaccine consents being returned to the students’ teacher (p=0.003), and a Public Health Nurse being assigned to a school (p=0.025).These findings can be used to help guide school-based immunization programs for optimal uptake of the HPV vaccine among the student population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3aeducation programs 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3anurses 3aparents 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aschools 3astudents 3ateachers 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avaccines 3aNova Scotia1 aSteenbeek, Audrey1 aMartin-Misener, Ruth1 aScott, Jeffrey1 aSmith, Bruce1 aD’Angelo-Scott, Holly0 tVaccine.g2014 Aug. 06, v. 32, no. 36 p.4665-4671dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245007800177520103600255592002801291650001201319650001401331650002001345650001101365650001101376650001801387650001701405650001601422650001301438653001701451653001801468653002901486653002801515653003101543653002301574700002101597700002201618700002301640700002301663700002601686773011101712856008501823852000901908655001201917IND60732862120221116203306.0220124e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073286212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapadopoulos, Christos10aW promoted Ni-Al2O3 co-precipitated catalysts for green diesel production  aThe promoting action of W in the Ni-Al₂O₃ co-precipitated catalysts with high nickel loading (31–46 wt% Ni) has been investigated in the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil and waste cooking oil towards green diesel production.

The detailed characterization of the catalysts allowed an insight concerning the tungsten promoting action. It was attributed to the increase in the catalyst specific surface area and metallic nickel surface area, the acidity regulation, the decrease of the amount of catalytically inactive nickel aluminate formed and to the participation of W⁵⁺-oxo species via their defect oxygen sites in the selective deoxygenation network. The optimum reduction – activation temperature was found at 500 °C, where a good compromise between the increase of metallic Ni relative amount, the decrease of the specific surface area and the increase of Ni mean crystal size is achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acatalysts 3acoprecipitation 3anickel 3aoxygen 3asunflower oil 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atungsten 0aGreen diesel 0aSunflower oil 0aNickel-alumina catalysts 0aSelective deoxygenation 0aSecond generation biofuels 0aTungsten promotion1 aKordouli, Eleana1 aSygellou, Labrini1 aBourikas, Kyriakos1 aKordulis, Christos1 aLycourghiotis, Alexis0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 June 15, v. 217 p.106820-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008100172300001800253520135500271592002801626650001501654650001501669650001201684650001301696650001101709650004101720650001201761650002301773650001901796700002001815700005901835773011401894856008402008852000902092655001202101IND60607186420221121233252.0180730e20180417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060718642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b005522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtner, Franziska10aDescription of Adsorption in Liquid Chromatography under Nonideal Conditions  ap. 5655-5671.  aA thermodynamically consistent description of binary adsorption in reversed-phase chromatography is presented, accounting for thermodynamic nonidealities in the liquid and adsorbed phases. The investigated system involves the adsorbent Zorbax 300SB-C18, as well as phenetole and 4-tert-butylphenol as solutes and methanol and water as inert components forming the eluent. The description is based on adsorption isotherms, which are a function of the liquid-phase activities, to account for nonidealities in the liquid phase. Liquid-phase activities are calculated with a UNIQUAC model established in this work, based on experimental phase equilibrium data. The binary interaction in the adsorbed phase is described by the adsorbed solution theory, assuming an ideal (ideal adsorbed solution theory) or real (real adsorbed solution theory) adsorbed phase. Implementation of the established adsorption model in a chromatographic code achieves a quantitative description of experimental elution profiles, with feed compositions exploiting the entire miscible region, and involving a broad range of different eluent compositions (methanol/water). The quantitative agreement of the model and experimental data serves as a confirmation of the underlying physical (thermodynamic) concepts and of their applicability to a broad range of operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aliquids 3amethanol 3amodels 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asolutes 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics1 aRuppli, Chantal1 aMazzotti, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4948-67050 tLangmuir.g2018 Apr. 17, v. 34, no. 19 p.5655-5671dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b005523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002100188245009700209300001200306506007600318520118200394592002801576506003701604650001501641650001901656650001101675650003101686650001101717650002801728650001001756700002001766700002301786700002001809773011701829856008201946852000902028655001202037IND60081865420221207110936.0210908e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008186542DNAL7 aPMC41774272pmcid7 a252418102pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-014-0216-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaudacher, Anne10aValidation of a magnetic resonance imaging guided stereotactic access to the ovine brainstem  ap. 216.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Anatomical differences between humans and domestic mammals preclude the use of reported stereotactic approaches to the brainstem in animals. In animals, brainstem biopsies are required both for histopathological diagnosis of neurological disorders and for research purposes. Sheep are used as a translational model for various types of brain disease and therefore a species-specific approach needs to be developed. The aim of the present study was to establish a minimally invasive, accurate and reproducible stereotactic approach to the brainstem of sheep, using the magnetic resonance imaging guided Brainsightᵀᴹ frameless stereotactic system. RESULTS: A transoccipital transcerebellar approach with an entry point in the occipital bone above the vermis between the transverse sinus and the external occipital protuberance was chosen. This approach provided access to the target site in all heads. The overall mean needle placement error was 1.85 ± 1.22 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The developed transoccipital transcerebellar route is short, provides accurate access to the ovine caudal cranial fossa and is a promising approach to be further assessed in live animals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain stem 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amodels 3anervous system diseases 3asheep1 aOevermann, Anna1 aStoffel, Michael H1 aGorgas, Daniela0 tBMC veterinary research.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.216-216dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0216-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001600191245018000207300001400387520080700401592002801208650002001236650003101256650000901287650001101296650002301307650001601330650002801346650004101374650003801415650004001453650004301493650002101536650001501557650004201572650001101614650009501625650003701720650002401757650004701781650004601828650001801874700001401892700001301906700001401919773009601933856008402029990002302113852000902136655001202145IND60092112220221120095932.0141103e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009211222DNAL7 a223488292pmid7 aPMC33615522pmcid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2012.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Haiquan14aThe anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab sensitizes human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells to radiation in part through inhibiting radiation-induced upregulation of HIF-1α  ap. 78-85.  aIn this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying cetuximab-mediated radiosensitization of HNSCC. Irradiation of HNSCC cells upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) via a mechanism involving de novo synthesis of HIF-1α protein. Radiation-induced upregulation of HIF-1α was completely abolished by concurrent treatment of HNSCC cells with cetuximab. Experimental elevation of constitutively expressed HIF-1α abolished cetuximab-mediated radiosensitization in HNSCC cells, whereas downregulation of HIF-1α by siRNA or a small molecule inhibitor enhanced responses of cetuximab-resistant HNSCC cells to cetuximab plus radiation. Our data suggest that cetuximab sensitizes cancer cells to ionizing radiation in part through inhibition of radiation-induced upregulation of HIF-1α.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahead 3ahumans 3aionizing radiation 3airradiation 3asquamous cell carcinoma 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxpharmacology 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxradiotherapy 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aGenes, ras 2aHead and Neck Neoplasmsxradiotherapy 2aHumans 2aHypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunitxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aRadiation Tolerance 2aRadiation-Sensitizing Agentsxpharmacology 2aErbB Receptorsxantagonists & inhibitors. 2aUp-Regulation1 aLiang, Ke1 aLu, Yang1 aFan, Zhen0 tCancer letters.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 322, no. 1 p.78-85dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168300001800271520129000289592002801579650002301607650001301630650002101643700002201664700002001686700002001706700006401726773011401790856008401904852000901988655001201997IND60607186520221121225015.0180730e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060718652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b005532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBang, Jae Jin10aSpatially Controlled Noncovalent Functionalization of 2D Materials Based on Molecular Architecture  ap. 5454-5463.  aPolymerizable amphiphiles can be assembled into lying-down phases on 2D materials such as graphite and graphene to create chemically orthogonal surface patterns at 5–10 nm scales, locally modulating functionality of the 2D basal plane. Functionalization can be carried out through Langmuir–Schaefer conversion, in which a subset of molecules is transferred out of a standing phase film on water onto the 2D substrate. Here, we leverage differences in molecular structure to spatially control transfer at both nanoscopic and microscopic scales. We compare transfer properties of five different single- and dual-chain amphiphiles, demonstrating that those with strong lateral interactions (e.g., hydrogen-bonding networks) exhibit the lowest transfer efficiencies. Since molecular structures also influence microscopic domain morphologies in Langmuir films, we show that it is possible to transfer such microscale patterns, taking advantage of variations in the local transfer rates based on the structural heterogeneity in Langmuir films. Nanoscale domain morphologies also vary in ways that are consistent with predicted relative transfer and diffusion rates. These results suggest strategies to tailor noncovalent functionalization of 2D substrates through controlled LS transfer.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding1 aPorter, Ashlin G.1 aDavis, Tyson C.1 aHayes, Tyler R.1 aClaridge, Shelley A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8599-05890 tLangmuir.g2018 Apr. 30, v. 34, no. 19 p.5454-5463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b005533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015800164300002000322500001900342520101100361592002801372650001401400650002601414650001501440650001701455650001001472650001501482650001101497650002201508700002201530700001701552700001801569700001901587700001601606773014301622856007401765852000901839655001201848IND60720310820221119221536.0201211e20201207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072031082DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta07716j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Nabeen K.10aCu–Fe–NH₂ based metal–organic framework nanosheets via drop-casting for highly efficient oxygen evolution catalysts durable at ultrahigh currents  ap. 24408-24418.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSynthesizing binder-free metal–organic frameworks (MOF) as thin films on a large scale to serve directly as electrodes for water electrolysis is challenging. Here, we report a simple and readily scalable strategy for fabricating binder-free Cu–Fe–NH₂ based MOF thin film-electrodes directly applicable as a catalyst for water electrolysis. Films composed of thin 2D-nanosheets of the MOF were deposited by dropping ink obtained from solvothermally synthesised bulk MOFs onto nickel foam substrates, or simply immersing the substrates in the ink. The Cu–Fe–NH₂ MOF electrodes demonstrated excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, comparable or superior to recently reported state-of-the-art MOFs. Strikingly, the MOF electrodes exhibited a remarkably low OER overpotential of 330 mV at a high current density of 500 mA cm⁻², and excellent durability with a very minor chronopotentiometric decay loss of 1.26% at the end of a 24 h test at a high bias current of 500 mA cm⁻².  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acoordination polymers 3adurability 3aelectrolysis 3afoams 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxygen production1 aPatil, Supriya A.1 aCho, Sangeun1 aJo, Yongcheol1 aKim, Hyungsang1 aIm, Hyunsik0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Dec. 7, v. 8, no. 46 p.24408-24418dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta07716j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010700158300001900265520110200284592002801386650001101414650001401425650002001439650001201459650003301471650001301504650002101517650003701538653001501575653001601590653002701606653001701633653002401650653002601674700001901700700001601719700001601735700001301751773012801764856007301892852000901965655001201974IND60527518120221117095643.0160715e20131023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052751812DNAL7 a10.1021/am40224942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jun Song10aH2O–EG-Assisted Synthesis of Uniform Urchinlike Rutile TiO2 with Superior Lithium Storage Properties  ap. 9998-10003.  aA facile green method to synthesize uniform nanostructured urchinlike rutile TiO₂ is demonstrated. Titanium trichloride was selected as the TiO₂ precursor, and a mixed solvent containing H₂O and ethylene glycol was used. By using this binary medium, the nucleation and crystal growth of rutile TiO₂ can be regulated, giving rise to very uniform urchinlike structures with tailorable sizes. As confirmed by the SEM and TEM analysis, large particles with dense aggregation of needle-like building blocks or small ones with loosely packed subunits could be obtained at different reaction conditions. The as-prepared samples were applied as the anode material for lithium-ion batteries, and they were shown to have superior properties with a high reversible capacity of 140 mA h g–¹ at a high current rate of 10 C for up to 300 cycles, which is almost unmatched by other rutile TiO₂-based electrodes. A stable capacity of 88 mA h g–¹ can also be delivered at an extremely high rate of 50 C, suggesting the great potential of the as-prepared product for high-rate lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3aethylene glycol 3alithium 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aurchinlike 0arutile TiO2 0ahydrothermal synthesis 0agreen method 0alithium-ion battery 0ahigh-rate performance1 aLiang, Yen Nan1 aLi, Yongmei1 aYan, Qingyu1 aHu, Xiao0 tACS applied materials .g2013 Oct. 23, v. 5, no. 20 p.9998-10003dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am40224943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245012400198500002000322520154200342592002801884650001901912650001801931650000901949650002201958650001901980650002201999700001702021700002002038700002102058700002302079773011602102856007302218852000902291655001202300IND60787924820221117221124.0220811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078792482DNAL7 a10.1002/vetr.1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, David A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7502-229610aOwner reported breathing scores, accelerometry and sleep disturbances in brachycephalic and control dogs: A pilot study  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aObjectives: To compare physical activity and length and quality of sleep between brachycephalic dogs and a control population. Methods: Brachycephalic and control dogs were prospectively enrolled. Length of activity and sleep were determined via accelerometer use. Owners completed a questionnaire regarding typical daily activity, sleep patterns and an ‘owner reported breathing score (ORBS)’. One hour of normal home sleep was recorded for each dog, and a veterinary observer subjectively scored the dogs' sleep quality. Results: Twenty brachycephalic and 15 control dogs were included. There were no differences between age and weight. Owners reported brachycephalic dogs to be less active (p = 0.022) and have higher ORBS (p < 0.001) compared to control dogs. Brachycephalic dogs had increased sleep disturbances compared to control dogs (p = 0.001), and video sleep score was positively correlated with increased sleep disturbances (r² = 0.47, p = 0.007). There were no differences in active and sleep times based on accelerometry between groups. Conclusion: Brachycephalic dogs have more disturbed sleep, which may have negative implications on welfare, but there were no differences in activity or length of sleep between groups. There is evidence that signs suggestive of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) as assessed by ORBS is correlated with poorer sleep quality, indicating that reduced sleep quality is part of BOAS. Owners may underestimate disturbed sleep or may perceive disturbed sleep to be normal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerometers 3aaccelerometry 3adogs 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3asleep deprivation1 aTovey, Emily1 aJeffery, Andrea1 aBlackwell, Emily1 aTivers, Michael S.0 tVeterinary record.g2021 Aug., v. 189, no. 4 p.e135-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vetr.1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002400147245014500171300001600316520105400332592002801386650001201414650001201426650001601438650002101454650001401475650001501489650002501504650002501529650001801554700002301572700002601595700002301621773008001644856008301724852000901807655001201816IND4470745220221121075141.0150812e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447074522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2011.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVesnaver, Elisabeth10aDietary resilience as described by older community-dwelling adults from the NuAge study âIf there is a will âthere is a way!â  ap. 730-738.  aMany older adults experience age-related changes that can have negative consequences for food intake.

It included 30 participants (80% female) aged 73â87years; 10 with decreased diet quality and 20 with steady or increased diet quality; all had faced key barriers to eating well. Semi-structured interviews explored how age-related changes affected participantsâ experiences with eating. Thematic analysis revealed strategies used to overcome eating, shopping, and meal preparation difficulties. Key themes of dietary resilience were: prioritizing eating well, doing whatever it takes to keep eating well, being able to do it yourself, getting help when you need it.

The study was carried out in years 2013 and 2014, where 2013 was an extremely dry year (especially the summer), while 2014 was a “normal” year. Our work showed that in subarctic mature pine forests, soil temperatures were higher, and soil water content was fluctuating more on grazed areas compared to non-grazed areas in both years. On both years, the soil water content on the grazed area was higher in June and the situation changed in the second half of July when the moisture content in the non-grazed area remained higher. There was a negative correlation between soil water content and soil temperature. The soil CO2 effluxes were mostly affected by the year of measurement, time of measurement (different months through growing season), soil temperature and also by the management (grazed or non-grazed) resulting in higher CO2 emissions on the grazed areas. Soil moisture content was not affecting the soil CO2 efflux. The average soil CO2 efflux values were significantly higher in the year 2014 compared to the year 2013 mainly due to differences in soil temperature at the beginning of season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimatic factors 3aconiferous forests 3aforest soils 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowing season 3areindeer 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asummer 3awater content 0aSoil respiration 0aSoil temperature 0aSoil water content 0aClimate change 0aReindeer grazing1 aKöster, Egle1 aKulmala, Liisa1 aBerninger, Frank1 aPumpanen, Jukka0 tCatena.g2017 Feb., v. 149 p.616-622dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012000158300002000278500001900298520109200317592002801409650001301437650001301450650003401463650002101497650001701518650001201535650002201547700001501569700001401584700001301598700001601611700001401627700001801641773014301659856007401802852000901876655001201885IND60720311120221119221743.0201211e20201207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072031112DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta08038a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yongkang10aImplanting an electrolyte additive on a single crystal Ni-rich cathode surface for improved cycleability and safety  ap. 24579-24589.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInterfacial modification is one of the most important technologies to improve the overall electrochemical properties of Ni-rich cathodes. Herein, a novel strategy of in situ planting of an electrolyte film-forming additive on a single crystal NCM811 surface is proposed by consuming the residual lithium to develop a functional Al(Li)BOB nano-layer. Different from traditional physical coating, this approach cleverly consumed the undesirable residual lithium on the NCM811 surface. The in situ grown 30–50 nm Al(Li)BOB layer on the single crystal NCM811 cathode surface contributes to its much enhanced electrochemical performances. At a high operating voltage (charge voltage limit of 4.5 V vs. Li/Li⁺), the capacity retention is greatly increased from 57.0% to 83.5% after 295 cycles. Meanwhile, the incorporation of aluminum is effective in improving the thermal stability of the Ni-rich cathode. The novel interfacial strategy by in situ implanting of an electrolyte additive is of important significance for solving the critical interfacial issue for Ni-rich cathode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3athermal stability1 aXu, Jinmei1 aWang, Wei1 aLong, Fu1 aQu, Qunting1 aWang, Yan1 aZheng, Honghe0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Dec. 7, v. 8, no. 46 p.24579-24589dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta08038a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010300161520161800264592002801882650001901910650001901929650001101948650001401959650003501973650002302008650001302031650002802044651001202072700002202084700001602106773012802122856007402250852000902324655001202333IND60652674620221120161451.0190713e20181031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065267462DNAL7 a10.3390/su101139622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagy, Júlia  A.10aMeasuring Sustainable Development Goals at a Local Level: A Case of a Metropolitan Area in Romania  aMetropolitan areas became the breeding ground for economic, political, and cultural concentration as well as for creativity and innovation. Therefore, sustainability within the urban dimension plays a crucial role in the overall success to attain the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and their targets under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015. Nevertheless, for cities, regions, or countries to monitor and measure their progress, there is a need for harmonized and reliable indicators. Consequently, the current study addresses sustainability on a local level by measuring the extent to which a Romanian metropolitan area achieves the SDGs agreed to in 2015 by the 193-member states of the United Nations. The paper analyses 16 out of the 17 SD (Sustainable Development) goals as the goal titled &ldquo;Life below water&rdquo; was not applicable. Relying on mainly quantitative data, we used the method of normalization and aggregation based on the arithmetic mean, which helped us to calculate the scores attained by each of the component localities of the metropolitan area within the SDGs and their overall SDG index. Next to this, the study combines the quantitative data analysis with a GIS (Geographic Information System) computer mapping technique. The results show that the municipality achieved the best results in the metropolitan area and a vertical development process from west to the east prevails. Measuring progress through a well-defined set of indicators and an optimization technique proved to be crucial in defining attainments&rsquo; levels within the metropolitan area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3abreeding sites 3acities 3acomputers 3ageographic information systems 3ametropolitan areas 3apolitics 3asustainable development 3aRomania1 aBenedek, József,1 aIvan, Kinga0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 31, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101139623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008500171300001600256500001500272520080200287592002801089650001501117650001101132650001001143650003001153650001401183650001101197650001801208650002901226650001401255650001201269651001001281653000901291653002601300653001601326653001901342653001501361653001201376653001701388653001601405653001801421700002601439700002201465773011601487856005101603852000901654655001201663IND50088693320221119202210.0140414e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008869332DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2011.6381642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Manju V.10aAnthropogenic Influences on Wild Nutmeg Fruit Crop in the Western Ghats of India  ap. 563-575.  a2019-12-05  aMyristica dactyloides is characteristic of the mid- and high-elevation evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India. Aril and seeds of the species are valuable nontimber forest products and are harvested extensively. We made visual estimates of fruit crop size in nine populations. We assessed disturbance using five variables: distance from road, method of harvesting fruits, nonforest matrix around the population, seedling regeneration, and protected area status. Unsustainable harvest and proximity to road impacted fruit crop, as did the nonforest matrix (F = 38.17 df = 5,102, p < .001). While high protection and measures against harvesting keep some populations safe, the harvest method plays a crucial role in determining total fruit production and seedling recruitment in the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3afruits 3aseeds 3anontimber forest products 3aseedlings 3anutmeg 3afruit growing 3aanthropogenic activities 3aMyristica 3aforests 3aIndia 0aNTFP 0aMyristica dactyloides 0arecruitment 0aclimax species 0afruit crop 0aharvest 0aregeneration 0adisturbance 0aWestern Ghats1 aCollins, Catherine M.1 aLeather, Simon R.0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 31, no. 6 p.563-575dTaylor & Francis Groupx1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2011.638164  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245010500203300001800308520081100326536050001137592002801637650001501665650002301680650001401703650001301717650001101730650001701741650001301758650001801771653002801789653002501817653001501842653001801857700001501875700001301890773012301903856008202026852000902108655001202117IND60772598120221117030126.0220405e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077259812DNAL7 a10.1177/004051752110505172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Junling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7583-208810aEffect of intra-tow flow on plain woven fabric permeability using virtual fiber-voxel element method  ap. 1135-1146.  aA geometric modeling platform based on the virtual fiber-voxel element is proposed to characterize textile reinforcement in a cost-effective way, which could reflect the systemic local changes of the tow path and tow cross-section. The finite volume method is used to solve the governing equation of the boundary value problem, and the permeability of the fabric is calculated by using the flow field data obtained from the model. The flow field analysis and pressure drop in flow direction of different thickness unit cells suggest that the size of inter-tow channels play a vital role in determining the overall in-plane permeability values. The flow channels of the inter tow in warp direction were found to be greater than in the weft direction, which causes the overall permeability to be anisotropic.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Tianjin (grant number TD13-5043), Shanxi Province Science and Technology Major Project (grant number 20181102022), Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Bureau (Grant Number 18ZXJMTG00190), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 11802204).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acost effectiveness 3aequations 3ageometry 3amodels 3apermeability 3aresearch 3awoven fabrics 0aComputational modelling 0afibrous porous media 0aresin flow 0avirtual fiber1 aXie, Junbo1 aChen, Li0 tTextile research journal.g2022 Apr., v. 92, no. 7-8 p.1135-1146dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/004051752110505173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03836naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100006100187245011200248300001600360506007600376520160100452536018502053592002802238596004902266506003702315650002402352650003502376650000802411650003302419650002702452650002102479650001002500650001902510650002002529650001402549650001902563650002102582650002002603650001402623650001402637650002502651650004302676650001202719650001202731653002802743700006102771700002302832700005602855700001702911700001602928700005902944773014203003856008003145852000903225655001203234IND60662475720221207083932.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066247572DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387198702182doi7 aPMC67271202pmcid7 a314239162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibson, Daniel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0614-829810aDevelopment and use of a triplex real-time PCR assay for detection of three DNA viruses in psittacine birds  ap. 719-725.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAves polyomavirus 1, psittacine beak and feather disease virus, and psittacid herpesvirus 1 are important pathogens of psittacine birds with the potential to cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Using publically available nucleotide sequences, we developed and validated a triplex real-time PCR (rtPCR) assay to rapidly detect these 3 viruses. The assay had high analytical sensitivity, detecting <6 copies of viral DNA per reaction, and 100% analytical specificity, showing no cross-reactivity with 59 other animal pathogens. Archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from psittacine birds diagnosed at postmortem as infected with each of the viruses as well as virus-negative birds were used to validate the utility of the assay. Birds were selected for the positive cohort if they showed histologic evidence of infection (i.e., characteristic inclusion bodies in tissues); birds in the negative cohort had final diagnoses unrelated to the pathogens of interest. The triplex rtPCR assay confirmed 98% of histopathology-positive cases, and also identified subclinical infections that were not observed by histologic examination, including coinfections. Birds that tested positive only by rtPCR had significantly higher cycle threshold values compared to those with histologic evidence of infection. Positive, negative, and overall percentage agreements as well as the kappa statistic between the results of the assay and histopathology were high, demonstrating the usefulness of the assay as a tool to confirm disease diagnoses, and to improve detection of subclinical infections.  aFunding This project was funded by the Ontario Veterinary College Pet Trust program (grant 052654).

However, identifying and providing the forms and types of biodiversity information most needed for research and decision-making is a significant challenge. While research needs and data gaps within particular topics or regions have received substantial attention, other information aspects such as data formats, sources, metadata, and information tools have received little. Focusing on the US southeast, a region of global biodiversity importance, this paper assesses the biodiversity information needs of environmental researchers, managers, and decision makers. Survey results of biodiversity information users’ information needs, information-seeking behaviors and preferred information source attributes support previous conclusions that useful biodiversity information must be easily and quickly accessible, available in forms that allow integration and visualization and appropriately matched to users’ needs. Survey results concerning additional information aspects suggest successful participation in both the creation and provision of biodiversity information include an increased focus on information search and other tools for data management, discovery, and description.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3amanagers 3aresearchers 3asurveys 2aAccess to Information 2aBiodiversity 2aData Collection 2aDatabases as Topic 2aHumans 3aSoutheastern United States 0aSoutheastern United States1 aTenopir, Carol1 aAllard, Suzie1 aFrame, Michael T.0 tEnvironmental management.g2014 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.690-701dSpringer USx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-014-0229-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04098naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245019400213300001600407520195400423592002802377650002602405650001602431650001402447650001802461650001802479650002502497650001702522650003202539650001302571650001502584650002002599650002102619650002302640650002402663650001302687650001302700650002002713650001102733650001902744650001602763650002202779650001402801650002502815650001802840653001402858653001602872653001102888653002002899653002002919653001702939700002002956700002102976700001802997700002503015700002003040700002703060700001803087700002103105700001503126700002003141700002303161773011303184856008203297852000903379655001203388IND60793699020221118113811.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079369902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2022.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Latif, Hany M.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8761-149310aGrowth performance, antioxidant activities, and immunological responses of hapa-reared thinlip mullet (Liza ramada) juveniles fed on diets supplemented with spirulina (Arthrospiraplatensis)  ap. 359-367.  aSpirulina (Arthrospira platensis) (SP) has been utilized for a long time as a valued feed supplement because of its proteinous content and other beneficial phytochemical compounds. Herein, we investigated the influences of SP-supplemented diets on growth, body somatic indices, digestive enzymes, hepatic antioxidant activities, and immunological responses of hapa-reared thinlip mullet (Liza ramada) juveniles. Fish were assigned in six triplicate groups and were fed for consecutive 60 days on the prepared experimental diets containing varying SP levels as 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10.0 g/kg diet and defined as control (CNT or SP0), SP2, SP4, SP6, SP8, and SP10 groups, respectively. The results indicated that dietary SP supplementation linearly and quadratically improved the fish growth performance, and the highest growth indices were found in the SP8 group. However, dietary SP supplementation did not significantly alter feed conversion ratio (FCR), survival rate (%), hepato-somatic index, and viscera-somatic index among all experimental groups. Meanwhile, digestive enzymes (lipase, α-amylase, and proteases) in the mid-intestine were also linearly and quadratically increased in all SP-fed groups, and their uppermost values were noted in the SP8 group. Hepatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and total antioxidant capacity in SP-supplemented groups were significantly elevated than the CNT group. Conversely, hepatic malondialdehyde contents were decreased significantly along with increasing dietary SP-supplementation levels. The immunological parameters such as lysozyme, respiratory burst, and alternative complement activities were significantly elevated in SP-fed groups than in the CNT group. These findings evoked that feeding SP-supplemented diets (especially at 8.0 g/kg diet) significantly promoted the growth, digestive enzymes, hepatic antioxidant status, and immunity of L. ramada juveniles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aLiza ramada 3aSpirulina 3aalpha-amylase 3aanimal growth 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalase 3acomplement 3afeed conversion 3afeed supplements 3agrowth performance 3ahepatosomatic index 3aimmunity 3alysozyme 3amalondialdehyde 3amullet 3aphytochemicals 3aproteinases 3arespiratory burst 3ashellfish 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 0aSpirulina 0aLiza ramada 0aGrowth 0aSomatic indexes 0aInnate immunity 0aAntioxidants1 aSoliman, Ali A.1 aKhaled, Asmaa A.1 aKord, Mohamed1 aAbdel-Tawwab, Mohsen1 aDarwish, Shawky1 aGrana, Youssif Shehata1 aZaki, Mohamed1 aNour, Abd-Elaziz1 aAli, Eglal1 aKhalil, Riad H.1 aKhalil, Hala Saber0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 Nov., v. 130 p.359-367dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245010300179300001800282500002000300520247400320592002802794650001102822650001602833650002202849650002702871650002202898650001202920650002302932650002402955650001202979650002502991650001703016650001403033650002303047651002603070651001803096700002303114700002303137773009803160852000903258856007303267655001203340IND4397323320221120060738.0170626e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439732332DNAL7 a176450172pmid7 a10.1890/06-0742.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornell, Howard V.10aScale‐dependent variation in coral community similarity across sites, islands, and island groups  ap. 1707-1715.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCommunity similarity is the proportion of species richness in a region that is shared on average among communities within that region. The slope of local richness (α diversity) regressed on regional richness (γ diversity) can serve as an index of community similarity across regions with different regional richness. We examined community similarity in corals at three spatial scales (among transects at a site, sites on an island, and islands within an island group) across a 10 000‐km longitudinal diversity gradient in the west‐central Pacific Ocean. When α diversity was regressed on γ diversity, the slopes, and thus community similarity, increased with scale (0.085, 0.261, and 0.407, respectively) because a greater proportion of γ diversity was subsumed within α diversity as scale increased. Using standard randomization methods, we also examined how community similarity differed between observed and randomized assemblages and how this difference was affected by spatial separation of species within habitat types and specialization of species to three habitat types (reef flats, crests, and slopes). If spatial separation within habitat types and/or habitat specialization (i.e., underdispersion) occurs, fewer species are shared among assemblages than the random expectation. When the locations of individual coral colonies were randomized within and among habitat types, community similarity was 46–47% higher than that for observed assemblages at all three scales. We predicted that spatial separation of coral species within habitat types should increase with scale due to dispersal/extinction dynamics in this insular system, but that specialization of species to different habitat types should not change because habitat differences do not change with scale. However, neither habitat specialization nor spatial separation within habitat types differed among scales. At the two larger scales, each accounted for 22–24% of the difference in community similarity between observed and randomized assemblages. At the smallest scale (transect–site), neither spatial separation within habitat types nor habitat specialization had significant effects on community similarity, probably due to the small size of transect samples. The results suggest that coral species can disperse among islands in an island group as easily as they can among sites on an island over time scales that are relevant to their establishment and persistence on reefs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorals 3acoral reefs 3aspatial variation 3ageographical variation 3aspecies diversity 3aislands 3adispersal behavior 3acommunity structure 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoaxphysiology 2aBiodiversity 2aGeography 2aPopulation Density 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aPacific Ocean1 aKarlson, Ronald H.1 aHughes, Terence P.0 tEcology.g2007 July, v. 88, no. 7 p.1707-1715dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-0742.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02874naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245011600205300001600321520146800337592002801805650001101833650001201844650001101856650001601867650001401883650001301897650002301910650001301933650003101946650001801977650001101995650002302006650001102029650002002040650002302060650001102083651001202094700002202106700002002128700001902148700002002167773012602187856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60660379420221122005055.0190823e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066037942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-019-04011-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrauns, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5012-972110aOrganic matter resources fuelling food webs in a human-modified lowland river: importance of habitat and season  ap. 121-131.  aThe role of hydromorphological degradation and temporal variation for food webs in human-modified rivers is still not fully evaluated. We tested the hypothesis that man-made engineering structures alter macroinvertebrate resource use in the Elbe River (Germany) in relation to seasonal variation. Stable isotopes (δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N) and mixing models revealed that dietary contributions of benthic organic matter (BOM) and phytoplankton were driven by engineering structure. Contributions of biofilm were driven by season, while contributions of terrestrial particulate organic matter (t-POM) were driven by both engineering structure and season. Contributions of t-POM were larger than those of phytoplankton in spring and summer, but not in autumn, which adds to the debate about the sources of organic matter fuelling riverine benthic food webs. Resource availability was not systematically related to resource use, indicating that factors other than resource limitation were responsible for the observed results. By demonstrating that human alterations determine consumer resource use independently from resource availability, our study links hydromorphological modifications to fluxes of matter in riverine food webs. Future studies should quantify organic matter fluxes from various autochthonous and allochthonous pathways in human-modified and natural rivers to allow for a robust synthesis of how hydromorphological modifications alter benthic food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3aengineering 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3anitrogen 3aparticulate organic matter 3aphytoplankton 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3asummer 3aGermany1 aBrabender, Marian1 aGehre, Matthias1 aRinke, Karsten1 aWeitere, Markus0 tHydrobiologia.g2019 Sept., v. 841, no. 1 p.121-131dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-04011-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002100148245009200169300001600261520139400277592002801671650002101699650001301720650001201733650002201745650001101767650001301778650000901791651001101800773009901811856008401910852000901994655001202003IND4472863520221120195142.0141111e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447286352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2012.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSocha, Jarosław10aLong-term effect of wetland drainage on the productivity of Scots pine stands in Poland  ap. 172-180.  aThe aim of this study was to estimate the long-term effect of wetland drainage on the productivity of Scots pine stands in Poland. Data were obtained from the forested area of the Niepolomice Forest District, which was drained in 1964–1968. To describe the long-term changes in site productivity, a local site index model was developed. The effect of drainage depended primarily on the age of the stand at the time of drainage. A positive growth response (i.e., an increase in height) was observed in stands that were younger than 45–50years at the time of drainage, with younger stands showing stronger responses. Drainage caused an increase in the site productivity of young stands that can be expressed as a change of 5.4m in site index. For fully stocked stands, the average effect of drainage expressed as the predicted increase in total wood production at age 100years was estimated to be approximately 200m³ha⁻¹ (25%) in those stands planted after drainage. The predicted increase in the total volume of production at total stand age 100years for stands that were 30years old at the time of drainage was estimated to be approximately 125m³ha⁻¹ (15%). For stands that were 40years old at the time of drainage, the predicted increase in volume production was approximately 50m³ha⁻¹ (6%). Stands older than 50years at the time of drainage were assumed to be unaffected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3adrainage 3aforests 3along term effects 3amodels 3awetlands 3awood 3aPoland0 tForest ecology and management.g2012 June 15, v. 274 p.172-180dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245020200161300001600363500001500379520200400394592002802398650001302426650001402439650001302453650001702466650002502483650001202508650001202520650001702532650001402549650001302563650001202576650001402588650001402602650001102616650001502627651001002642653002502652700001802677700001702695700001702712700001802729700001902747700001802766700001702784773010702801856008102908852000902989655001202998IND60121406420221121175355.0150301e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012140642DNAL7 a10.1007/s12040-014-0531-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHAO, NANA10aEvolution process of the Late Silurian–Late Devonian tectonic environment in Qimantagh in the western portion of east Kunlun, China: Evidence from the geochronology and geochemistry of granitoids  ap. 171-196.  a2019-12-04  aThe East Kunlun Orogenic Belt has undergone a composite orogenic process consisting of multiple orogenic cycles and involving many types of magmatic rocks spread over the whole district. However, due to bad natural geographical conditions and complex superimposed orogenic processes, most of the Caledonian orogenic traces were modified by the late tectonic uplift and denudation, so these rocks are poorly studied. Multiperiodic magmatic activity during the Late Silurian (approximately 420 Ma)–Late Devonian (approximately 380 Ma) exists in the Qimantagh area. We obtained 5 zircon U–Pb ages from the Late Silurian–Late Devonian granitoids in the Qimantagh area. Those ages are 420.6 ± 2.6 Ma (Nalingguole biotite monzogranite), 421.2 ± 1.9 Ma (Wulanwuzhuer potassium granite), 403.7 ± 2.9 Ma (Yemaquan granodiorite), 391.3 ± 3.2 Ma (Qunli granite porphyry), and 380.52 ± 0.92 Ma (Kayakedengtage granodiorite). These granitoids belong to the sub-alkaline, high-K calc-alkaline, metaluminous or weakly or strongly peraluminous series. The rocks are right oblique types, having overall relative LREE enrichment and HREE depletion, though rocks from different times may exhibit different degrees of Eu anomalies or overall moderate Eu depletion. The rocks are rich in large ion lithophile elements (LILE), such as Rb, Th, and K, and high field strength elements (HFSE), such as Zr and Hf, and are depleted in Ba, Nb, Ta, Sr, P, Eu, and Ti. The rocks have complex composition sources. The Late Silurian granitoids are mainly crust-derived. Most of the Devonian granitoids are crust-mantle mixed-source and only some parts of them are crust-derived, especially the Middle Devonian granitoids. Those mid-acidic and acidic intrusive rocks are formed in a post-collision tectonic setting, lithosphere delamination may have occurred in the Early Devonian (407 Ma), and the study area subsequently experienced an underplating of the mantle-derived magma at least until the Late Devonian (380 Ma).  aPublisher supplied data 3atantalum 3azirconium 3atitanium 3ageochemistry 3aEarth system science 3abiotite 3agranite 3agranodiorite 3atectonics 3aeuropium 3aniobium 3astrontium 3apotassium 3abarium 3aphosphorus 3aChina 0aearth system science1 aYUAN, WANMING1 aZHANG, AIKUI1 aFENG, YUNLEI1 aCao, Jianhui,1 aCHEN, XIAONING1 aCHENG, XUEQIN1 aMo, Xuanxue,0 tJournal of earth system science.g2015 Feb., v. 124, no. 1 p.171-196dSpringer-Verlagx0253-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-014-0531-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014900169300001600318520100200334592002801336650002101364650002101385650004401406650002601450650001501476650001301491650002901504650002601533650001701559650001901576650001801595650001301613650001701626650001601643650001301659650001301672650001501685653001301700653003601713653003201749653002101781653002701802700002001829700001801849700002101867700001901888700002301907773010801930856008602038852000902124655001202133IND60584144520221120154702.0190318e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058414452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.09.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMania, Szymon10aInvestigation of an elutable N-propylphosphonic acid chitosan derivative composition with a chitosan matrix prepared from carbonic acid solution  ap. 196-206.  aPorous chitosan composites using CO2 dissolution procedure and including water soluble N-propylphosphonic chitosan derivative (p-CHI) were obtained and characterized.

The values of other parameters like swelling degree (30g/g) good antioxidant and antimicrobial properties (almost 100% reduction of S.aureus, E.coli and C. albicans growth) and low in vitro cytotoxicity against fibroblasts were highly advantageous for possible biomedical applications of the composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidants 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonic acid 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3apolymers 3aporosity 3asolubility 0aChitosan 0aPropylphosphonic acid adhydride 0aPhysico-chemical properties 0aBiocompatibility 0aAntioxidant properties1 aTylingo, Robert1 aAugustin, Ewa1 aGucwa, Katarzyna1 aSzwacki, Jakub1 aStaroszczyk, Hanna0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 179 p.196-206dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.09.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245009800198300001800296500002000314520148200334592002801816650002501844650001801869650002101887650002101908650002301929650001301952650002301965650001001988650001401998650002402012650001902036650002302055650001202078650001602090700005702106773015002163856007302313852000902386655001202395IND60607693720221120185727.0180731e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060769372DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.89882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmoah, Robert S1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2168-587310a1‐Methylcyclopropene (1‐MCP) effects on natural disease resistance in stored sweet potato  ap. 4597-4605.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The potential of 1‐methylcyclopropene (1‐MCP) to maintain postharvest storage of sweet potato was studied. In two separate experiments, the orange‐fleshed sweet potato cv. Covington was treated with 1‐MCP (1.0 µL L⁻¹, 24 h) and roots stored at 15 °C. During storage, samples were evaluated for the respiration rate, sprout growth, weight loss, incidence of decay and changes in dry matter. The roots were further assayed for the temporal changes in individual non‐structural carbohydrates and phenolic compounds in the skin and flesh tissues of the proximal (stem end), middle and distal (root end) regions. RESULTS: 1‐MCP treatment reduced root weight loss and decay but respiration rate and non‐structural carbohydrates were not affected. No sprouting was recorded irrespective of the treatment. 1‐MCP transiently suppressed the accumulation of individual phenolic compounds, especially in the middle and distal segments. This accentuated the proximal dominance of phenolic compounds. Isochlorogenic acid A and chlorogenic acid were the dominant phenolics in the skin and flesh tissues, respectively. CONCLUSION: 1‐MCP treatment may have an anti‐decay effect and reduce weight loss. Therefore, storage trials that involve the use of continuous ethylene supplementation to inhibit sprout growth may be combined with 1‐MCP to alleviate ethylene‐induced weight loss and decay in sweet potato. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3acarbohydrates 3acell respiration 3achlorogenic acid 3adisease resistance 3aethylene 3aphenolic compounds 3aroots 3asprouting 3astorage temperature 3asweet potatoes 3atemporal variation 3atissues 3aweight loss1 aTerry, Leon A1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5677-023X0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Sept., v. 98, no. 12 p.4597-4605dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.89883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002400188245011500212300001800327506007600345520173600421592002802157506003702185650001102222650002202233650005302255650001102308650001102319650002002330650001102350650001602361650002402377650001402401650001202415650002402427650002002451650001602471650001002487651001802497653001202515653002302527653001902550653002502569700001802594700002402612700002202636773013002658856008202788852000902870655001202879IND60517479420221207084457.0190803e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051747942DNAL7 aPMC44769442pmcid7 a254098332pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800140025602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangellier, Brent A10aTrends in racial/ethnic disparities in overweight self-perception among US adults, 1988–1994 and 1999–2008  ap. 2115-2125.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWeight self-perceptions, or how a person perceives his/her weight status, may affect weight outcomes. We use nationally representative data from 1988–1994 and 1999–2008 to examine racial/ethnic disparities in weight self-perceptions and understand how disparities have changed over time. Using data from two time periods, 1988–1994 and 1999–2008, we calculated descriptive statistics, multivariate logistic regression models and predicted probabilities to examine trends in weight self-perceptions among Whites, Blacks, US-born Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants to the USA. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988–1994) and continuous NHANES (1999–2008). Adult NHANES participants aged 18 years and older (n 37 050). The likelihood of self-classifying as overweight declined between 1988–1994 and 1999–2008 among all US adults, despite significant increases in mean BMI and overweight prevalence. Trends in weight self-perceptions varied by gender and between racial/ethnic groups. Whites in both time periods were more likely than racial/ethnic minorities to perceive themselves as overweight. After adjustment for other factors, disparities in weight self-perceptions between Whites and Blacks of both genders grew between survey periods (P<0·05), but differences between overweight White women and Mexican immigrants decreased (P<0·05). Weight self-perceptions have changed during the obesity epidemic in the USA, but changes have not been consistent across racial/ethnic groups. Secular declines in the likelihood of self-classifying as overweight, particularly among Blacks, are troubling because weight self-perceptions may affect weight-loss efforts and obesity outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBlacks 3aMexican Americans 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aWhites 3aadults 3abody mass index 3agender 3aimmigration 3aminorities (people) 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3aself-perception 3aweight loss 3awomen 3aUnited States 0aObesity 0aHealth disparities 0aRace/ethnicity 0aPsychosocial factors1 aGlik, Deborah1 aOrtega, Alexander N1 aPrelip, Michael L0 tPublic health nutrition.g2015 Aug., v. 18, no. 12 p.2115-2125dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800140025603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245018600187300001600373500001500389520163800404592002802042650001502070650001902085650002102104650001502125650002102140650001202161650001002173650002202183650002202205650001102227650001602238650001202254650002702266650001202293650003202305650001102337650003902348650005402387650000902441650004902450650002502499650004202524650002202566653001502588700001902603700001602622700001902638700001502657700002202672700001702694773011602711856005502827852000902882655001202891IND4478949220221117235620.0120418e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447894922DNAL7 a219506742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01909.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarques, MG10aEffect of Low Oxygen Tension Atmosphere and Maturation Media Supplementation on Nuclear Maturation, Cortical Granules Migration and Sperm Penetration in Swine In Vitro Fertilization  ap. 491-497.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of low oxygen tension (5% CO2, 5% O2 and 90% N2) on in vitro oocyte maturation using defined media (0.1% polyvinyl alcohol – PVA) or 10% porcine follicular fluid (PFF)‐supplemented media. To achieve this goal, oocytes were evaluated regarding cortical granules (GCs) migration, nuclear maturation and sperm penetration. Oocytes were in vitro matured under different conditions: 5% or 20% O2 atmosphere and 0.1% PVA‐ or 10% PFF‐supplemented media and evaluated at 0 and 44 h of maturation. To evaluate the migration of CGs and nuclear maturation, by confocal microscopy, oocytes were incubated with 100 μg of FITC‐PNA/ml and 10 μg/ml of propidium iodide. To address sperm penetration, after maturation, in vitro fertilization for 6 h and in vitro culture for 18 h, zygotes were incubated with 10 mg/ml Hoechst 33342. Pronuclei and polar bodies were quantified using an epifluorescence microscope. Atmosphere conditions did not affect the CGs migration, but media supplementation did. Oocytes matured in 10% PFF media had a higher percentage of CGs in the oocyte periphery than oocytes matured in PVA‐supplemented media. However, this fact did not have effect on in vitro sperm penetration levels. No effect of atmosphere conditions and media supplementation was observed on the rates of metaphase II oocytes. Therefore, the use of low oxygen tension in association with PVA maturation media does not improve the in vitro maturation system of porcine oocytes, because its use did not improve nuclear maturation, CGs migration and zygotes monospermic rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3ain vitro culture 3apronucleus 3afollicular fluid 3aiodides 3aswine 3acortical granules 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aoxygen 3aspermatozoa 3aoocytes 3ain vitro fertilization 2aAnimals 2aCulture Mediaxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aIn Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniquesxveterinary 2aMale 2aOocytesxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOxygenxpharmacology 2aSperm-Ovum Interactionsxdrug effects 2aSwinexphysiology 0aatmosphere1 ade Barros, FRO1 aGoissis, MD1 aCavalcanti, PV1 aViana, CHC1 aAssumpção, MEOD1 aVisintin, JA0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2012 June, v. 47, no. 3 p.491-497dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01909.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245010200183300001800285520140800303536007801711592002801789596006101817650002901878650002601907650002001933650002701953650001501980650001801995653000802013653000902021653000902030653001302039653002502052653001302077700002202090700002702112700002702139700002702166773014902193856008602342852000902428655001202437IND60662476120221120205111.0210119e20190925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066247612DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2019.16545012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeyed Jalali, Seyed Alireza10aPrediction of Soil Cation Exchange Capacity Using Different Soil Parameters by Intelligent Models  ap. 2123-2139.  aThe traditional methods for the measurement of soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) are time-consuming and laborious. It is also difficult to maintain stability for long-term experiments and projects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an indirect approach such as pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate this property from more easily available soil data. The aim of this study was to compare multiple linear and nonlinear regression, classification and regression trees (C&RT), artificial neural network (ANN) model included multiple layer perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to develop PTFs for predicting soil CEC. Soil samples, 929, were used into two subsets for training and testing of the models. Sensitivity and statistical analyzes were conducted to determine the most and the least influential variables affecting soil CEC. The prediction capability of models was assessed by statistical indicators included the normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R²). Results of the present investigation showed that the k-NN and ANN models had the ability to estimate soil CEC by computing easily measurable variables with a guarantee of authenticity, reliability, and reproducibility. Therefore, the results of this study provide a superior basis for predicting soil CEC and could be applied to other parts of the world with similar challenges.  aThis research was supported by Soil and Water Research Institute of Iran.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018/SWRI/253cSoil and Water Research Institute of Iran 3acation exchange capacity 3along term experiments 3aneural networks 3apedotransfer functions 3aprediction 3asoil sampling 0aANN 0aC&RT 0ak-NN 0amodeling 0amultiple regressions 0asoil CEC1 aNavidi, Mir Naser1 aSeyed Mohammadi, Javad1 aMeymand, Ali Zeinadini1 aMohammad Esmail, Zahra0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2019 Sept. 25, v. 50, no. 17 p.2123-2139dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.16545013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04639naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009400171300001100265520310400276592002803380650002303408650001603431650001903447650001503466650001003481650001603491650001603507650002203523650001803545650001503563650001103578650002703589650002203616650001203638650001303650650001103663650001803674650002803692650001003720651001303730700002403743700002103767700001903788700001803807700001903825700006003844773011303904856008304017852000904100655001204109IND60792877120221118052005.0221003e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079287712DNAL7 a10.1186/s40066-022-00383-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMugabe, Paschal A.10aGoverning COVID-19: analyzing the effects of policy responses on food systems in Tanzania  ap. 47.  aBACKGROUND: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic increased debates on global public health concerns. From early 2020 to 2022, globally, life was upended in the wake of the pandemic. Industries of all kinds were forced to rapidly changed how they work, including agriculture. Particularly for smallholder farmers in developing countries, the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with climate change effects, negatively affected their livelihoods. Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 is unrealistic if immediate efforts are not made to address the existential threats facing smallholder farmers. This study analyzes COVID-19 governance and policy responses, examining its effects on smallholder farmers in the south and east of Tanzania using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. RESULTS: Findings show that mobility restrictions imposed by other countries and fears of the Tanzanian people leading to voluntary isolation resulted in an amended structure of farmers’ markets: Reductions in exports, imports and in the purchasing power of the local people followed. Food security was diminished as food availability on the market level was reduced due to mobility restrictions. The impact of COVID-19 resulted in more than 85% of smallholder farmers experiencing an income reduction, thus also increasing the pre-existing vulnerability of these communities. Findings show that farms producing non-exported crops had less severe income reductions and could cope better. The results indicate that only 20% of smallholder farmers started using digital information technology to gather information since physical movements were restricted. Access to technology remained limited in rural areas. Even during the COVID-19 crises, farmers’ concerns about the vulnerability of their food systems include non-COVID-19 causes, such as climate change. CONCLUSIONS: Although Tanzania did not impose a total lockdown, the country was affected by COVID-19, partly via policies of other countries. Impacts included: (i) a decline in local markets as smallholder farmers had fewer trading partners from neighboring states; (ii) a loss of employment opportunities due to the absence of both local and external trade; (iii) reductions of farm output and income; (iv) a lack of agricultural inputs (fertilizer etc.) that are usually imported; (v) fear to continue farming activities due to news about COVID-19 spreading; and (vi) reduction of work efficiency because of a lack of social gathering due to voluntary isolation. While COVID-19 compelled policymakers to make urgent decisions to ensure stable food supply chains, the fundamental task is to address these immediate disruptions while also investing in the long-term goal of a resilient, sustainable, and productive global food system. This can be achieved by adopting a policy package that includes investments in technological development, access to small long-term loans, and regulatory reforms, with which governments can create conditions supporting productive, sustainable, and resilient food systems that can withstand future shocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aagriculture 3aclimate change 3aemployment 3afarms 3afearfulness 3afertilizers 3afood availability 3afood security 3agovernance 3aincome 3ainformation technology 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3apandemic 3apeople 3apublic health 3asustainable development 3atrade 3aTanzania1 aRenkamp, Theresa M.1 aRybak, Constance1 aMbwana, Hadija1 aGordon, Chris1 aSieber, Stefan1 aLöhr, Katharina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2691-97120 tAgriculture & food security.g2022 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.47-47dBioMed CentralwJournal:2267x2048-70107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40066-022-00383-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011200172520140200284592002801686650001601714650001301730650003201743650002101775650000901796650001601805650001801821650002001839650001201859650002601871650001901897650001701916650001201933650001701945650002301962651001301985700002601998700002202024700001702046700002002063773012402083856008202207852000902289655001202298IND60648620320221122041723.0190701e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064862032DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture90601252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRankoth, Lalith  M.10aCover Crop Influence on Soil Enzymes and Selected Chemical Parameters for a Claypan Corn–Soybean Rotation  aCover crops (CC) improve soil quality, including soil microbial enzymatic activities and soil chemical parameters. Scientific studies conducted in research centers have shown positive effects of CC on soil enzymatic activities; however, studies conducted in farmer fields are lacking in the literature. The objective of this study was to quantify CC effects on soil microbial enzymatic activities (&beta;-glucosidase, &beta;-glucosaminidase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, and dehydrogenase) under a corn (Zea mays L.)&ndash;soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation. The study was conducted in 2016 and 2018 in Chariton County, Missouri, where CC were first established in 2012. All tested soil enzyme levels were significantly different between 2016 and 2018, irrespective of CC and no cover crop (NCC) treatments. In CC treatment, &beta;-glucosaminidase activity was significantly greater at 0&ndash;10 cm depth in 2016 and at 10&ndash;20 and 20&ndash;30 cm in 2018. In contrast, dehydrogenase activity was significantly greater in NCC in 2018. Soil pH and organic matter (OM) content were found to be significantly greater in CC. Overall, CC have mixed effects on soil enzyme activities and positive effects on soil OM compared to NCC. This study highlights the short-term influence of CC and illustrates the high spatial and temporal variability of soil enzymes under farmer-managed fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3abeta-glucosidase 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3aenzyme activity 3afarmers 3afluorescein diacetate 3aorganic matter 3asoil enzymes 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3atemporal variation 3aMissouri1 aUdawatta, Ranjith  P.1 aVeum, Kristen  S.1 aJose, Shibu 1 aAlagele, Salah 0 tAgriculture.g2019 June 15, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture90601253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245010400176300001800280500002000298520213600318592002802454650001002482650001902492650001502511650001802526650002502544650003002569650002202599650002002621650001802641650002202659650007402681650001402755650002302769650002302792650001702815650003202832651001102864651001502875651001102890651001502901651001102916651001102927700002702938773009802965852000903063856007303072655001203145IND4397323720221122043544.0170626e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439732372DNAL7 a176450212pmid7 a10.1890/06-1153.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamis, Karen E.10aTesting the abundant center model using range‐wide demographic surveys of two coastal dune plants  ap. 1747-1758.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIt is widely accepted that species are most abundant at the center of their geographic ranges and become progressively rarer toward range limits. Although the abundant center model (ACM) has rarely been tested with range‐wide surveys, it influences much thinking about the ecology and evolution of species' distributions. We tested ACM predictions using two unrelated but ecologically similar plants, Camissonia cheiranthifolia and Abronia umbellata. We intensively sampled both throughout their one‐dimensional distributions within the Pacific coastal dunes of North America, from northern Baja California, Mexico, to southern Oregon, USA. Data from >1100 herbarium specimens indicated that these limits have been stable for at least the last 100 years. Range‐wide field surveys detected C. cheiranthifolia at 87% of 124 sites and A. umbellata at 54% of 113 sites, but site occupancy did not decline significantly toward range limits for either species. Permutation analysis did not detect a significant fit of geographical variation in local density to the ACM. Mean density did not correlate negatively with mean individual performance (plant size or number of seeds/plant), probably because both species occur at low densities. Although size and seeds per plant varied widely, central populations tended to have the highest values for size only. For C. cheiranthifolia, we observed asymmetry in the pattern of variation between the northern and southern halves of the range consistent with the long‐standing prediction that range limits are imposed by different ecological factors in different parts of the geographical distribution. However, these asymmetries were difficult to interpret and likely reflect evolutionary differentiation as well as plastic responses to ecological variation. Both density and seeds per plant contributed to variation in seed production per unit area. In C. cheiranthifolia only, sites with highest seed production tended to occur at the range center, as predicted by the ACM and assumed by theory proposing that range limits evolve via antagonism between natural selection and gene flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3adunes 3acoastal plains 3aOnagraceae 3aNyctaginaceae 3aspatial distribution 3ageographical distribution 3aspatial variation 3apopulation size 3aplant density 3aseed productivity 2aMagnoliopsidaxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Density 2aReproduction 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 3aOregon 3aCalifornia 3aMexico 0aCalifornia 0aMexico 0aOregon1 aEckert, Christopher G.0 tEcology.g2007 July, v. 88, no. 7 p.1747-1758dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1153.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02119naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010800160520099800268592002801266650001501294650001201309650001301321650001801334650001101352650001301363650001301376650001301389650001801402650001601420650001501436650001601451650001301467650001301480650001201493651001101505773012301516856007301639852000901712655001201721IND60742513820221119030432.0210624e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074251382DNAL7 a10.3390/d130602702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHotos, George N.12aA Preliminary Survey on the Planktonic Biota in a Hypersaline Pond of Messolonghi Saltworks (W. Greece)  aDuring a survey in 2015, an impressive assemblage of organisms was found in a hypersaline pond of the Messolonghi saltworks. The salinity ranged between 50 and 180 ppt, and the organisms that were found fell into the categories of Cyanobacteria (17 species), Chlorophytes (4 species), Diatoms (23 species), Dinoflagellates (1 species), Protozoa (40 species), Rotifers (8 species), Copepods (1 species), Artemia sp., one nematode and Alternaria sp. (Fungi). Fabrea salina was the most prominent protist among all samples and salinities. This ciliate has the potential to be a live food candidate for marine fish larvae. Asteromonas gracilis proved to be a sturdy microalga, performing well in a broad spectrum of culture salinities. Most of the specimens were identified to the genus level only. Based on their morphology, as there are no relevant records in Greece, there is a possibility for some to be either new species or strikingly different strains of certain species recorded elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aArtemia 3aCopepoda 3aCyanobacteria 3aMiozoa 3aNematoda 3aProtozoa 3aRotifera 3ahypersalinity 3amarine fish 3amicroalgae 3anew species 3aplankton 3aprotists 3asurveys 3aGreece0 tDiversity.g2021 June 15, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130602703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009500183300001600278520150500294592002801799650001401827650001001841650001701851650001501868650001201883650001001895650000901905650002201914650005501936650006301991650002702054650001102081650001102092650003002103650000902133650001602142650003002158650002602188650002602214650001202240650002002252650001102272700002102283700002202304700001902326700002302345700002002368700001802388700002402406773008102430856008102511852000902592655001202601IND4451733220221117235702.0141112e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445173322DNAL7 a209348512pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2010.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUchida, Yumiko10aOptimal prediction of the central venous catheter insertion depth on a routine chest x-ray  ap. 557-560.  aOBJECTIVE: Cardiac tamponade is a serious complication of central venous catheter (CVC) insertion. The position of the carina has been shown to be near the pericardial reflection and can easily be identified as a landmark on routine chest x-ray (CXR). The purpose of this study was to show a simple way to predict optimal CVC depth, thereby facilitating safe positioning of the CVC tip. METHODS: Subjects included 119 inpatients undergoing gastroenterologic surgery. Central venous catheterization was performed through the right internal jugular vein or the right subclavian vein. The insertion depth was measured. Postoperatively, the CVC tip position was confirmed by CXR and the distance between the CVC tip and the carina was measured. We compared the “original measurement” up to the carina from the insertion point with the “calculated measurement” derived by adding half the length of the right clavicle and the vertical length between the sternal head of the right clavicle and the carina on the CXR. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the original measurement and the calculated measurement when performed through the internal jugular vein and the subclavian vein. CONCLUSION: The appropriate length of CVC inserted through the right internal jugular vein or right subclavian vein could be estimated by the calculated measurement of adding half the length of the right clavicle and the vertical length between the sternal head of the right clavicle and the carina.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatheters 3achest 3ajugular vein 3aprediction 3asurgery 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCardiac Tamponadexetiologyxprevention & control. 2aCatheterization, Central Venousxadverse effectsxmethods. 2aClaviclexradiography. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aJugular Veinsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPericardiumxradiography. 2aRadiography, Thoracic 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSternum 2aSubclavian Vein 2aX-Rays1 aSakamoto, Masaki1 aTakahashi, Hiroki1 aMatsuo, Yoichi1 aFunahashi, Hitoshi1 aSasano, Hiroshi1 aSobue, Kazuya1 aTakeyama, Hiromitsu0 tNutrition.g2011 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.557-560dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2010.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100002200169245016200191300001600353500002400369520103600393650002101429650001501450650001601465650001001481650001101491650001401502650002901516651001001545700002601555700002601581700002301607700002001630773011401650852000901764856009101773930003301864945002501897946001101922655001201933IND4408994520221122025422.0080815e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440899452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.04.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF6001 aGottardini, Elena10aAmbient levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) may reduce pollen viability in Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) trees -- Correlative evidence from a field study  ap. 299-305.  aIncludes references  aA fully randomized sampling design was adopted to test whether pollen viability of Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) was impacted by NO₂ pollution. Spatial strata (500 * 500 m each) with high (41.9-44.6 μg m⁻³) and low (15.4-21.0 μg m⁻³) NO₂ were selected from a defined population in a small area (236.5 km², <200 m range in elevation) in Northern Italy. Pollen viability was measured by means of the Tetrazolium (TTC) test. Analysis of variance by means of a generalised linear model showed that NO₂ was a significant factor (P =0.0425) affecting pollen viability. Within the treatment, no significant differences were detected among replicates. Within each replicate, sampling unit data were significantly different (P =0.000) and this suggested some improvement in the applied sampling design was needed. Pollen viability was significantly related to pollen germination (P <0.01) and tube length (P <0.01). This suggested a possible impact of NO₂ on the regeneration of Austrian pine in polluted environments. 3anitrogen dioxide 3apollutants 3aPinus nigra 3atrees 3apollen 3aviability 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aItaly1 aCristofori, Antonella1 aCristofolini, Fabiana1 aMaccherini, Simona1 aFerretti, Marco0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 402, no. 2-3 p.299-305dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.04.0483Available from publisher's Web site  a20090827b20091002c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02384naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013600125300001600261520086800277650002201145650001901167650003101186650001701217650001601234650001801250650002301268650002001291650004501311650001301356650002601369650003101395650004701426650004301473653001301516653003401529653003101563700001701594700001901611700001701630700001801647700001601665700001501681700001801696700001701714773006901731852000901800930003301809945001301842946001101855655001201866IND2197514720221122025316.0990312e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219751472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, I.P.10aIntrogression mapping in the grasses.

The BC1 progeny, which predominantly had 14 chromosomes, were analysed using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and genetic markers. GISH revealed that over 74% of the BC1 individuals carried one or more F. pratensis chromosome segments. By comparing the physical size of introgressed F. pratensis chromosome segments with the presence or absence of F. pratensis-specific polymorphisms, it was possible to determine the physical position of genetic markers. The potential of a new type of genetic mapping ('introgression mapping') for the alignment of physical and genetic maps, determining the genetic control of agronomically important characters and the production of novel germplasm for the development of new varieties is discussed. 3aFestuca pratensis 3aLolium perenne 3aintergeneric hybridization 3abackcrossing 3achromosomes 3aintrogression 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agenomics 3agenetic recombination 3anucleic acid hybridization 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 0aanalysis 0agenomic in situ hybridization 0ahomoeologous recombination1 aMorgan, W.G.1 aArmstead, I.P.1 aHarper, J.A.1 aHayward, M.D.1 aBollard, A.1 aNash, J.V.1 aForster, J.W.1 aThomas, H.M.0 tHeredity.g1998 Oct., v. 81, no. pt.4 p.462-467x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01113naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115242011700130245009700247300001600344500004600360520013600406650002600542651001900568700001900587700001400606700001800620700001500638773008500653852000900738939003300747945000800780946001100788655001200799991618218460742620221122004509.0830922e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||slo||7 aPAR830085482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValent, M.10aClinical experience in the treatment of urogenital trichomoniasis with ornidazole manufactured in Czechoslovakia10aKliniche skusenosti s liecbou urogenitalnej trichomoniazy ornidazolom Ceskoslovenskej vyroby  ap. 694-699.  aSummaries in English, Russian, and German  aTrichomonas vaginalis, women with vaginal infections, clinical trials evaluating therapy with ornidazole produced in Czechoslovakia 3aTrichomonas vaginalis 3aCzechoslovakia1 aKlobusicky, M.1 aCatar, G.1 aValentova, M.1 aKusala, S.0 tBratislavske Lekarske Listy.g1982 Dec., v. 78, no. 6 p.694-699x0006-92487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830922c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02016naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013900125300001600264520091800280650001701198650002001215650002301235650002701258650001401285650004701299650004301346653001901389653001601408653002101424653002301445700002101468700001801489773006901507852000901576930003301585945001301618946001101631655001201642IND2199044420221121235308.0990602e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219904442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVirk, P.S.10aMapping AFLP markers associated with subspecific differentiation of Oryza sativa (rice) and an investigation of segregation distortion  ap. 613-620.  aAFLP marker data were generated for a doubled haploid rice mapping population developed from a cross between IR64 (indica) and Azucena (japonica) varieties, as well as for a diverse set of rice germplasm. A total of 151 AFLP markers were incorporated into an existing restriction fragment length polymorphism framework map and compared with a published map. Markers associated with the indica-japonica subspecific differentiation in Asian rice were also mapped and were found to be distributed throughout the genome. Sources of mapping errors were examined and the possibility of such errors being caused by co-migration of bands and segregation distortion was explored. In the case of markers that show distorted segregation, it was concluded that one-third of these may be affected by gametophytic/sterility genes and a futher one-third may arise because of association with the indica-japonica differentiation. 3aOryza sativa 3agenetic markers 3achromosome mapping 3asegregation distortion 3avarieties 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 0aidentification 0asegregation 0aindica varieties 0ajaponica varieties1 aFord-Lloyd, B.V.1 aNewbury, H.J.0 tHeredity.g1998 Dec., v. 81, no. pt.6 p.613-620x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02113naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009100130300001600221500001500237520094600252650002701198650001901225650001001244650000901254650002301263650001001286650001201296650002501308650002401333650002001357650001301377653002101390653002701411653002601438700001701464700001701481700001901498700001501517773006901532852000901601930003301610945001301643946001101656655001201667IND2199044520221121235417.0990602e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219904452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeightley, P.D.10aTest of candidate gene-quantitative trait locus association applied to fatness in mice  ap. 630-637.  a2019-12-05  aWe test for the contribution of five strong candidate genes for obesity to quantitative variation for fatness in mice. The candidate loci are known through their major mutant phenotypes. We propose a randomization test for overall contribution of candidate genes, based on the empirical distribution of LOD scores from a quantitative trait locus (QTL) genome scan. The test is applied to data on body fat content and male gonadal fatpad weight from a QTL genome scan with an F2 population of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred mice. The test is nonsignificant in this experiment for overall body fat content. QTLs detected at an experiment-wide significance level on chromosome 4, 6, 13 and 15 have effects on mean fatness of up to 19% between the homozygotes, but map to locations where there is no strong candidate gene. The test is significant for gonadal fat pad weight in males, and gives weak support for an association with the diabetes gene. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3alinkage groups 3amales 3amice 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3aobesity 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative traits 3agenetic markers 3abody fat 0abody fat content 0agonadal fat pad weight 0aquantitative genetics1 aMorris, K.H.1 aIshikawa, A.1 aFalconer, V.M.1 aOliver, F.0 tHeredity.g1998 Dec., v. 81, no. pt.6 p.630-637x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02916naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007200127300001600199520166900215650001301884650002201897650002701919650000901946650001201955650002001967650001001987650001101997650002702008650001102035650002502046650001202071650001302083650001602096650001602112651001402128653001602142653002302158653002902181653003002210700001702240700001402257700001602271773006902287852000902356930003302365945001302398946001102411655001202422IND2199044620221121235333.0990602e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219904462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunnucks, P.10aEvolution of an ecological trait in parthenogenetic Sitobion aphids  ap. 638-647.  aThe aim of this study was to test whether host plant responses of Sitobion aphids have evolved under parthenogenesis and to examine the relationship between genetic and phenotypical similarity. There are four known chromosomal races of Australian Sitobion miscanthi living on grasses. Three races evolved from a recent common ancestor by mutation and chromosomal rearrangement alone. Australian S. miscanthi reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis, as does the close congeneric S. near fragariae. Mean relative growth rate (MRGR) was investigated in laboratory-raised representative aphid clones of four races of S. miscanthi, and also S. near fragariae (i.e. five aphid 'forms') on three host plants, with 15 replicate aphids per clone. There were significant differences in MRGR; most variance was associated with differences among forms, some among clones within forms and very little with aphids within clones. Developmental time and adult weight both contributed to the differences in MRGR. There was a significant interaction for clone (nested within forms) x host for all three dependent variables. No one clone performed significantly better over all hosts than other clones of its form (clonal MRGRs on the three hosts were negatively correlated). Nearly all clones performed best on barley (which was the only 'familiar' host, in that previous generations had been raised on it), next best on cocksfoot and worst on rye. MRGR was found to be under genetic control. The data show that monophyletic parthenogenetic aphids can rapidly evolve substantial differences in host relations and suggest a possible association of chromosomal rearrangements with MRGR. 3aSitobion 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aloci 3aalleles 3aparthenogenesis 3araces 3aclones 3abiological development 3aweight 3aphenotypic variation 3aPoaceae 3aduration 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3aAustralia 0agrowth rate 0asitobion miscanthi 0asitobion near fragarieae 0amean relative growth rate1 aChisholm, D.1 aTurak, E.1 aHales, D.F.0 tHeredity.g1998 Dec., v. 81, no. pt.6 p.638-647x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03736naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001900198245011900217300001600336520185500352650001902207650001902226650001902245650002402264650002402288650003002312650001602342650004502358650002902403650003402432650002302466650002002489650003902509650004602548650002202594650003602616650003402652651001002686651001502696651001502711651001002726700002102736700002202757700002302779700002602802700002402828773011202852852000902964856006902973930003303042945002503075946001103100990002303111655001203134IND4384956420221121235418.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438495642DNAL7 a164773542pmid7 a10.1007/s10532-005-9023-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

At the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), trichloroethene (TCE) was completely converted to ethene during biostimulation with lactate. At Seal Beach, California, perchloroethene (PCE) was degraded only to cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) during biostimulation but was degraded to ethene after bioaugmentation with a dechlorinating culture containing Dehalococcoides strains. T-RFLP analysis showed that microbial community composition differed significantly between the two sites, but was similar within each site among wells that had low or no electron donor exposure. Analysis of INEEL clone libraries by RFLP with clone sequencing revealed a complex microbial population but did not identify any Dehalococcoides strains. Q-PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Dehalococcoides strains - known for their unique capability to dechlorinate solvents completely to ethene - revealed a significant population at INEEL, but no detectable population at Seal Beach prior to bioaugmentation. Detection of Dehalococcoides by Q-PCR correlated with observed dechlorination activity and ethene production at both sites. Q-PCR showed that Dehalococcoides was present in even the pristine well at INEEL, suggesting that the difference in dechlorination ability at the two sites was due to the initial absence of this genus at Seal Beach. Of the techniques tested, Q-PCR quantification of specific dechlorinating species provided the most effective and direct prediction of community dechlorinating potential. 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3adechlorination 3asoil microorganisms 3amicrobial detection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA primers 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 2aBacteriaxclassification 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCloning, Molecular 2aHazardous Waste 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTetrachloroethylenexmetabolism 2aTrichloroethylenexmetabolism 3aIdaho 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aIdaho1 aChauhan, Sadhana1 aHolmes, Victor F.1 aMacbeth, Tamzen W.1 aSorenson, Kent S.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that higher cadmium exposure is associated with endometriosis among infertile Japanese women in a hospital-based case-control study. We recruited consecutive female patients aged 20-45 years who had complained of infertility and presented to a university hospital in Tokyo. The subjects were interviewed and provided a urine sample prior to a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis between January 2000 and December 2001. The severity of endometriosis was then dichotomized into controls (stage 0 and I) and cases (stage II-IV). We finally measured urinary total cadmium concentration in 54 cases and 74 controls as a biomarker of long-term cumulative exposure. Odds ratios were adjusted for average menstrual cycle length, body-mass index and smoking status using unconditional logistic regression. Results showed no association between endometriosis and urinary cadmium concentration. Medians (interquartile ranges) of urinary cadmium concentration in cases and controls were 0.53 (0.40-0.73) and 0.54 (0.34-0.76) μg/g creatinine, respectively (P for difference=0.88). Adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest tertile of urinary creatinine-adjusted cadmium concentration was 0.86 (0.30 to 2.49, P for trend=0.79). Our results do not support the hypothesis that higher urinary cadmium concentration is associated with the risk of endometriosis. 3acase studies 3acadmium 3afood contamination 3afemales 3ahuman health 3auterus 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aCadmiumxurine 2aCase-Control Studies 2aEndometriosisxchemically inducedxcomplications. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfertility, Femalexcomplications 2aMenstruation 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSmoking 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aIwasaki, Motoki1 aNakajima, Yoshiaki1 aEndō, Yōko.1 aHanaoka, Tomoyuki1 aSasaki, Hiroshi1 aTanaka, Tadao1 aYang, Bin1 aTsugane, Shōichirō.0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 402, no. 2-3 p.171-175dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.05.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090827b20091002c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01754naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001600157245015400173300001400327500002400341520044900365650002400814650001800838650001500856650004300871650002200914650001300936650002000949653001400969700001900983700001701002700001701019700001601036700001801052773009601070852000901166856008801175930003301263945002501296946001101321655001201332IND4408981620221121223427.0080815e20080815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440898162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ4051 aGosetti, F.10aPhotodegradation of E110 and E122 dyes in a commercial aperitif : A high performance liquid chromatography-diode array-tandem mass spectrometry study  ap. 58-63.  aIncludes references  aA commercial aperitif containing E110 and E122 dyes is exposed to photo-irradiation in solar box under conditions chosen to simulate sun light irradiation.

The two decades of research has demonstrated different pharmacological and therapeutic effects of B. vulgaris and its isoquinoline alkaloids (particularly berberine). Studies carried out on the chemical composition of the plant show that the most important constituents of this plant are isoquinoline alkaloids such as berberine, berbamine and palmatine. Berberine represents one of the most studied among the naturally occurring protoberberine alkaloids. In addition to B. vulgaris (barberry), berberine is present in many other plants and is used for the treatment of different diseases. This article reviews the traditional uses and pharmacological effects of total extract and the most active ingredient of B. vulgaris (berberine). 3aBerberis vulgaris 3aactive ingredients 3abark 3aberberine 3aleaves 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3aIran1 aHosseinzadeh, Hossein0 tPhytotherapy research.g2008 Aug., v. 22, no. 8 p.999-1012dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2399 7aarticle02584naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002100176245013500197300001600332500002400348520093700372650000901309650002301318650001901341650001801360650002701378650002001405650004301425650002901468650004101497650002701538650002501565650003101590650002901621650002901650650002401679653002701703700002501730700003101755700002801786773009801814852000901912856008801921930003302009945002502042946001102067655001202078IND4408982420221121194836.0080815e20080822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440898242DNAL7 a186498852pmid7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2041 aBöhm, Christina10aDevelopment of a selective sample clean-up method based on immuno-ultrafiltration for the determination of deoxynivalenol in maize  ap. 111-117.  aIncludes references  aThis paper describes the development of a highly selective analytical method for the determination of deoxynivalenol (DON) in maize. The developed method is based on immuno-ultrafiltration (IUF) and is the first application of IUF as a clean-up strategy in food analysis. Quantification of DON was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. In contrast to immunoaffinity chromatography, in IUF the antibodies are not bound to a solid support material but used in free form, thus making it possible to avoid the critical immobilisation step. Sample clean-up by IUF proved to be as selective as clean-up using commercially available immunoaffinity columns. The limit of detection (S/N=3) of the analytical method was found to be 74ngDON/g maize. Repeated analysis of a certified maize reference material on four different days resulted in a mean recovery of 93% with a standard deviation of 10%. 3acorn 3afood contamination 3adeoxynivalenol 3afood analysis 3aimmunologic techniques 3aultrafiltration 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTrichothecenesxanalysis 2aUltrafiltrationxmethods 2aZea maysxchemistry 0aimmuno-ultrafiltration1 aCichna-Markl, Margit1 aBrenn-Struckhofova, Zdenka1 aRazzazi-Fazeli, Ebrahim0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Aug. 22, v. 1202, no. 2 p.111-117dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.06.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20080825b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle
