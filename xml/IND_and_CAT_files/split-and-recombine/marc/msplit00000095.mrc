In this investigation small amounts of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [Hmim][PF₆] and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Hmim][Tf₂N] (as extractant solvents) were added in a sample solution containing Triton X-114 (as an anti-sticking agent). After centrifuging the cooled solution, analysis was carried out by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Some effective parameters have been optimized. Under the optimum conditions, detection limit of the method was 0.44 ng/mL and the relative standard deviation (RSD) for 100.0 ng/mL cobalt was ±2.3% (n = 7).The calibration curve was linear in the range of 3.0–200.0 ng/mL cobalt and enrichment factor was obtained as 26.5. The applicability of the technique was evaluated by the determination of trace amounts of cobalt in several water samples and synthetic alloys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acobalt 3adetection limit 3aionic liquids 3aions 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3atemperature1 aAmirtaimoury, Najme0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2014 June, v. 69, no. 6 p.503-508dSpringer-Verlagx1061-93487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1061934814060112  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007900168300001600247500002900263520114500292592002801437650002601465650001801491650001601509650001301525650001801538650002001556651001301576653001601589653001601605653001701621653001601638653001701654700002301671773014101694856008401835852000901919655001201928IND60710889320221116170614.0201025e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071088932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jssas.2020.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbro, Asif Ali10aComparative analysis of profitability of major and minor crops in Pakistan  ap. 476-481.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThis article is based on Pakistan's empirical data to analyze the profitability of major and minor crops for 1981–2018. The purpose of the paper was to analyze the pattern of average income per hectare of minor and major crops in Pakistan. The null hypothesis claimed that the average income per hectare of minor crops is equal to or less than the average income per hectare of major crops, in contrast to the alternative hypothesis that the average income per hectare of minor crops is higher than the average income per hectare of major crops. The result obtain on the basis of the analysis was 1.10, i.e. more than one, and came to the conclusion that the average income per hectare of minor crops is higher than the average income per hectare of major crops. The profitability of minor crops also dominated the crop sector. But some fluctuations were observed in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1990, 1992 and from 2004 to 2010, when the profitability of minor crops was lower than that of the major crops. In general, the profitability of small crops demonstrates a steady upward trend since 2011 and contributes to an increase in farmers' income.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural sciences 3adata analysis 3afarm income 3ajournals 3aprofitability 3aspecialty crops 3aPakistan 0aMajor crops 0aMinor crops 0aProductivity 0aSustainable 0aUrbanization1 aAwan, Naveed Wahid0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2020 Oct., v. 19, no. 7 p.476-481dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2020.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245003700196300002000233506007600253520123300329592002801562506003701590650001701627650002801644650001001672650001201682650002601694650001701720650001101737700002101748700002801769700002301797700003101820700002401851700002101875700002401896773013401920856007502054852000902129655001202138IND60538927820221207133322.0160815e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053892782DNAL7 a10.1021/ja40563822doi7 aPMC38742162pmcid7 a239097042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopa, Ionel10aNanomechanics of HaloTag Tethers  ap. 12762-12771.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe active site of the Haloalkane Dehydrogenase (HaloTag) enzyme can be covalently attached to a chloroalkane ligand providing a mechanically strong tether, resistant to large pulling forces. Here we demonstrate the covalent tethering of protein L and I27 polyproteins between an atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever and a glass surface using HaloTag anchoring at one end and thiol chemistry at the other end. Covalent tethering is unambiguously confirmed by the observation of full length polyprotein unfolding, combined with high detachment forces that range up to ∼2000 pN. We use these covalently anchored polyproteins to study the remarkable mechanical properties of HaloTag proteins. We show that the force that triggers unfolding of the HaloTag protein exhibits a 4-fold increase, from 131 to 491 pN, when the direction of the applied force is changed from the C-terminus to the N-terminus. Force-clamp experiments reveal that unfolding of the HaloTag protein is twice as sensitive to pulling force compared to protein L and refolds at a slower rate. We show how these properties allow for the long-term observation of protein folding–unfolding cycles at high forces, without interference from the HaloTag tether.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3aatomic force microscopy 3aglass 3aligands 3amechanical properties 3apolyproteins 3athiols1 aBerkovich, Ronen1 aAlegre-Cebollada, Jorge1 aBadilla, Carmen L.1 aRivas-Pardo, Jaime Andrés1 aTaniguchi, Yukinori1 aKawakami, Masaru1 aFernandez, Julio M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 135, no. 34 p.12762-12771dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja40563823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007500170300001600245520098200261592002801243650001501271650001401286650002701300650001801327650001101345650001001356650000901366653002601375653002701401653002201428653002701450653002701477700001601504773013601520856008501656852000901741655001201750IND60671374420221122032347.0191003e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067137442DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2019.16384502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuhkanen, Eero10aPotential of cross-laminated timber for independent shear wall systems  ap. 355-365.  aThis paper addresses problems related to calculation of the horizontal stiffness of modular multi-story timber frame buildings. The use of cross-laminated timber (CLT) as an independent shear wall system is introduced as a possible solution, meaning that no vertical load is applied to the structure. Its main advantage is to simplify the design process through separation of the vertical and horizontal load, and direct transmission of horizontal loads to the foundations. Two types of shear walls are experimentally investigated and discussed from the perspective of stiffness, design and highly automated manufacturing. The results of CLT hybrid system with steel columns show the utilization of the shear stiffness of CLT up to 27%, and the option of simplified calculations. For a line-connected cantilever shear wall, two analytical models of varying character – force- and displacement-based – are used to validate the test results, with both showing a good overlap.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abuildings 3across laminated timber 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3asteel 3awood 0aModular timber houses 0across-laminated timber 0ashear wall system 0aself-perforating dowel 0aslotted-in steel plate1 aRauk, Lauri0 tWood material science and engineering.g2019 Sept. 3, v. 14, no. 5 p.355-365dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000166x1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2019.16384503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013100174520136400305592002801669650001201697650000901709650001701718650001501735650002601750650002201776650001401798650001201812650001101824650002001835650002201855650001901877650003301896651001001929653003401939653002501973653002301998653002802021653001502049700002202064700001902086700002502105700002102130773011102151856008702262852000902349655001202358IND60686163420221117200358.0200907e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068616342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1039312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContini, Caterina10aDrivers of plant-based convenience foods consumption: Results of a multicomponent extension of the theory of planned behaviour  aCurrent lifestyles always pose increasing time pressure that can result in unhealthy diets. Our study addresses the role that high-quality plant-based convenience foods can play in promoting healthier consumptions. While convenience foods are in fact often associated with poor nutritional values, the spread of healthy convenience foods could respond to the needs of new lifestyles and promote better food choices. The study is based on a multicomponent model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour that has made it possible to verify how control factors such as cooking skills, product availability, budget, time pressure, and interest in healthy eating can affect the consumption of precooked plant-based foods. The results of Structural Equation Models applied to a sample representative of the Italian population (600 individuals) highlight the presence of a consistent group of consumers (almost 70%) that consider plant-based convenience foods as a useful means to improve their diet. For this cluster, the control factors that significantly influence behaviour are market availability, interest in healthy eating, and time pressure. The advancements in knowledge that this research produces are translated into guidelines for producers, retailers, and policy makers that, in synergy, might encourage consumers to replace unhealthy foods with healthy ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooking 3adiet 3afood choices 3aguidelines 3ahealthy eating habits 3aissues and policy 3alifestyle 3amarkets 3amodels 3anutritive value 3aplant-based foods 3aprepared foods 3astructural equation modeling 3aItaly 0aStructural equation modelling 0aHealthy food choices 0aReady-to-eat foods 0aConvenience orientation 0aLifestyles1 aBoncinelli, Fabio1 aMarone, Enrico1 aScozzafava, Gabriele1 aCasini, Leonardo0 tFood quality and preference.g2020 Sept., v. 84 p.103931-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1039313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008000170300001800250500002000268500001900288500000900307520201500316592002802331650001402359650001402373650001302387650002502400650002602425650002002451650001502471650001402486650001902500650001602519650002502535650001402560650001102574650001402585651001202599700002302611700002002634773013502654856008302789852000902872655001202881IND60663535320221120120709.0220803e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066353532DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2018.08.05432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandhu, Hardev S.10aMinimum or No‐Tillage Improves Sugarcane Ratoon Yield on Florida Histosol  ap. 1516-1523.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Tillering was better in conventional than no‐tillage in plant cane but it was opposite in second ratoon. Minimum or no‐tillage produced higher sugarcane ratoon yields than conventional tillage in Florida Histosols. Overall, in a 3‐yr crop cycle, the yields were similar in all three tillage levels. Tillage effect on yield did not vary with the varieties. ABSTRACT: Minimum or no‐tillage reduces soil carbon oxidation in Histosols, however tillage effect on sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) growth and yield are not well understood. To determine the effects of tillage on sugarcane growth and yield, a 3‐yr (plant cane, first ratoon, and second ratoon) field trial was conducted in 2013–2015 with three tillage levels and three varieties (CP 88–1762, CP 89–2143, and CP 00–1101). Tillage levels were conventional tillage, CT (three pre‐planting disc passes and two post‐planting inter‐row cultivations); minimum tillage, MT (two pre‐planting disc passes and one post‐planting inter‐row cultivation); and no‐tillage, NT (no cultivation). Data were collected on Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD), stomatal conductance, tillering, and yield parameters. Our results showed that tillage did not affect SPAD and stomatal conductance. Tillering was better in CT than NT in plant cane but it was opposite in second ratoon. Sugarcane yield (tons of cane per hectare, TCH) and sugar yield (tons of sugar per hectare, TSH) were not significantly different in plant cane, but NT had greater TCH than CT and MT in first ratoon, and both NT and MT had greater TCH and TSH than CT in second ratoon. Tillage effects on yield did not vary with the varieties. Our results showed that NT and MT improved yields in ratoon crops with no significant effect on overall sugarcane yields in a 3‐yr crop cycle in a Florida Histosol. Therefore, tillage may be minimized or eliminated in fallow planting to improve soil sustainability without any sugarcane yield penalty in a Florida Histosol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHistosols 3aSaccharum 3aagronomy 3aconventional tillage 3afield experimentation 3aminimum tillage 3ano-tillage 3aoxidation 3aplant analysis 3asoil carbon 3astomatal conductance 3asugarcane 3asugars 3atillering 3aFlorida1 aSingh, Maninder P.1 aVuyyuru, Murali0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Mar., v. 111, no. 3 p.1516-1523dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.08.05433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011300165520139900278592002801677650001801705650001801723650001301741650001501754650002401769650000901793650001501802650002101817650001401838650002101852651001801873700002201891700002001913773012301933856007302056852000902129655001202138IND60745406020221120141128.0210723e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074540602DNAL7 a10.3390/d130703212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Cynthya E.10aNematodes of Amphibians from the South American Chaco: Distribution, Host Specificity and Ecological Aspects  aThis is the first review of the nematode parasites of amphibians from Dry Chaco (DC) and Humid Chaco (HC) ecoregions of South America, covering aspects related to their systematics, distribution, host range and ecology, including their life cycles. Of approximately 100 species of amphibians that inhabit these ecoregions, the nematode parasites of 32 species are known. The parasite species consisted of 51 taxa: 27 in HC and 18 in DC. The family Cosmocercidae alone included 18 species. Aplectana hylambatis and Cosmocerca podicipinus showed the widest geographical and host distribution. Leptodactylus bufonius and Rhinella major presented a high number of nematode parasites. The species richness of nematodes was related to the host body sizes and to the strategy to obtain prey. The mean species richness was higher in terrestrial amphibians with intermediate characteristics in the generalist–specialist spectrum in terms of diet, and in amphibians with intermediate characteristics between actively foraging and the “sit-and-wait” approach in terms of searching for prey. The patterns of similarity among amphibian species showed groups linking with their habitats. Nematodes usually have direct life cycles with the infectious form entering the host passively or actively. However, many amphibians are also involved in heteroxenous cycles that develop in the aquatic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCosmocercidae 3aLeptodactylus 3aRhinella 3aamphibians 3aaquatic environment 3adiet 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3aparasites 3aspecies richness 3aSouth America1 aHamann, Monika I.1 aDuré, Marta I.0 tDiversity.g2021 July 15, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130703213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013800167300001600305520119400321592002801515650001901543650001201562650001601574650002801590650001701618650002201635650001101657650001101668650001901679650001001698650001801708650001101726650000901737653001901746653002001765653001101785653001601796653002901812700001801841700001801859700002601877700002101903700002601924700003201950773012501982856005102107852000902158655001202167IND50074684920221118005747.0140408e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007468492DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2011.6192252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellami, Rim10aEffects of Nickel Hyperaccumulation on Physiological Characteristics of Alyssum Murale Grown on Metal Contaminated Waste Amended Soil  ap. 609-620.  aA pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of nickel concentration on physiological characteristics of Alyssum murale when grown in a soil mixed with sewage sludge (at the rate of 2.8%). Two types of sludge were used: agricultural sewage sludge (S1) and industrial sewage sludge with an increasing nickel concentration (S2, S3, and S4). Results showed that Ni in shoots was higher than Ni in roots. A. murale is able to concentrate up to 12730 mg/kg Ni in leaves. The highest dry matter yield was observed with plants grown with agricultural sewage sludge. An addition of S2 and S3 increased shoot biomass. However, application of S4 reduced 40% shoot dry weight as compared to the control. Ni treatment did not affect all chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio was stable between Ni treatments. Photosynthesis rate (A) increased with agricultural sewage sludge, but remained stable with variable Ni rates from the industrial sludge. The chlorophyll content increased with S1, S2 and S3 but it remains constant with S4 when compared to the control. Therefore, high nickel concentration did not affect the function of the photosynthetic machine of A. murale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlyssum murale 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adry matter accumulation 3afluorescence 3ahyperaccumulators 3aleaves 3anickel 3aphotosynthesis 3aroots 3asewage sludge 3ashoots 3asoil 0aAlyssum murale 0aphytoextraction 0anickel 0achlorophyll 0achlorophyll fluorescence1 aGharbi, Fatma1 aRejeb, Saloua1 aRejeb, Mohamed Néjib1 aHenchi, Belgacem1 aEchevarria, Guillaume1 aMorel, J.

Eighteen, aged, low-productivity ‘Woodard’ rabbiteye blueberry bushes were pruned at two different heights (ground level and a 50-cm above ground level) after harvest in July 2017, and phosphorous acid was applied as a drench and foliar spray in the first year, but this was discontinued as the applications had no effect on the bushes. For two seasons, fruit yields were collected and weighed, bushes were measured for growth parameters, and canes were weighed. Bushes pruned at the 50-cm above ground level had much higher yields in both 2019 (3.47 vs. 0.63 kg) and 2020 (3.91 vs. 1.23 kg), thus providing a substantial yield benefit. The 50-cm above ground level pruning treatment bushes produced more canes by the end of the study, therefore accounting for more fruiting area, as seen in the harvest index. In short, pruning old, nonproductive bushes at a 50-cm above ground level can provide growers with greater potential for early economic returns than pruning at ground level, for ‘Woodard’ rabbiteye blueberry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium virgatum 3afoliar spraying 3afruits 3aharvest index 3aphosphorous acid 3aMississippi 0agrowth index 0arejuvenation1 aSmith, Barbara J.0 tHortTechnology.g2021 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.188-191dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:2120x1943-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH04782-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014500176500001900321520151100340592002801851650002301879650000801902650001901910650002501929650002301954650001501977650001601992650001402008650001802022650001802040650001802058650001502076650001402091650002302105650002002128650001502148650001102163650001902174650002002193650002802213650001302241653002002254653001102274700002702285700002502312700002302337773010302360856008602463852000902549655001202558IND60690563120221120161255.0200907e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069056312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.1054952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehghanpour, Samineh10aEvaluation of toxic effects of platinum-based antineoplastic drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin) on green alga Chlorella vulgaris  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlatinum-based antineoplastic drugs (PBADs) enter the environment via hospital and municipal wastes as reactive and highly toxic molecules. Chlorella vulgaris is a freshwater microalgae and is used as an excellent aquatic model for toxicity assessment. In the present study, the toxicity of PBADs to C. vulgaris was investigated for better understanding of PBADs environmental toxicity. The algae were cultured in Bold´s Basal Medium (BBM) and exposed to different concentrations of PBADs for 48, 72 and 96 h. Then, cell proliferation, the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments, protein content, malondialdehyde (MDA) release and antioxidant potential were determined. IC₅₀ s of cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin for 96 h of exposure were 106.2, 124.3 and 153.9 mg/L respectively. Cell proliferation, synthesis of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and algal protein content significantly decreased in a time and dose-dependent manner. The release of MDA to culture media significantly increased and antioxidant potential decreased.Cisplatin showed more toxic effects on C. vulgaris compared to carboplatin and oxaliplatin indicating its severe toxicity for marine organisms. PBADs induce their toxic effects in algal cells via the interaction with DNA, production of free radicals (such as reactive oxygen species), lipid peroxidation and cell wall damages. Due to these toxic effects of PBADs for various environmental organisms, there must be severe restriction on their release into the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aDNA 3aalgal proteins 3aantioxidant activity 3acell proliferation 3acell walls 3achlorophyll 3acisplatin 3aculture media 3adose response 3aecotoxicology 3afreshwater 3ahospitals 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein content 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 0aCytotoxic drugs 0aPlatin1 aPourzamani, Hamid Reza1 aAmin, Mohammad Mehdi1 aEbrahimpour, Karim0 tAquatic toxicology.g2020 June, v. 223 p.105495-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.1054953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245009300138300001600231520138000247592002801627650001901655650002601674650001001700650002601710650001801736650001201754650001701766650001701783650001301800650001501813650001701828650001101845651001001856653001101866653001501877653000801892653001701900700001901917773018801936852000902124655001202133IND60764437920221120133143.0220130e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076443792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, V.

Medik.)” was conducted during the rabi season of 2020–21 in the research farm of College of Agriculture, CAU, Imphal, Manipur, to find out the most suitable growth hormone and dose for lentil and economics of the treatments. The experiment was laid out in a RBD consisting of eight treatments replicated thrice. GA₃ (250, 500 ppm), IAA (250, 500 ppm) and IBA (100, 200 and 500 ppm) were used as treatments. The results indicated that priming with different doses of plant growth regulators had significant effect on the growth, yield and economics of the crop. Among the treatments, priming with GA3 @ 500ppm (T3) proved significantly superior to other treatments in terms of plant height, fresh and dry weight of plant, number of root nodules, fresh and dry weight of root nodules, number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, test weight, seed yield, stover yield and harvest index of plant. The treatment T3 was closely followed by T₂ (Primed with GA₃ @ 250ppm). Among IAA treatments, priming with 500 ppm showed best results compared to 250 ppm of IAA. Among IBA treatments, priming with 200 ppm showed best results compared to 100 ppm and 300 ppm of IBA. Where, control recorded the lowest values in all aspects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens culinaris 3aagricultural colleges 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3aharvest index 3alentils 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aresearch 3aseed yield 3asomatotropin 3astover 3aIndia 0aLentil 0aNodulation 0aPGR 0aSeed priming1 aLuikham, Edwin0 tSKUAST journal of research.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 2 p.172-177dSher-E-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir, ShalimarwJournal:21329x2349-297X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016000164300001400324520089100338592002801229650001001257650002001267650002201287650001501309650002801324650001701352650002201369650001401391650001801405650001301423651001501436651001001451653001301461653001301474653000901487653002401496653001401520653001701534700002601551700002401577700002401601773008501625856008101710852000901791655001201800IND60615058620221118223544.0181004s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061505862DNAL7 a10.1163/15685381-000028732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFroufe, Elsa10aNuclear and mitochondrial markers reveal the existence of several geographically concordant lineages within a Sahelian gecko species, Ptyodactylus ragazzii  ap. 85-93.  aThe genetic diversity within Ptyodactylus ragazzii was analysed for the first time across the Western part of its range. We have used two mitochondrial (12s rRNA and 16s rRNA) and one nuclear (Cmos) marker to compare results directly with other related Ptyodactylus species, P. oudrii and P. hasselquistii. Results show high levels of intraspecific variability, with at least three divergent mtDNA lineages that have different haplotypes for Cmos and that are geographically concordant. P. ragazzii from Mauritania is probably a distinct species and possibly other lineages too, such as those from the Aïr Mountains in Niger, although more nuclear markers are needed to confirm this. All analysed Ptyodactylus species appear to be cryptic species complexes containing multiple deeply divergent forms, highlighting the need for a careful reassessment of the taxonomy of the whole genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3acryptic species 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aintraspecific variation 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amountains 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy 3aMauritania 3aNiger 0a12s rRNA 0a16s rRNA 0aCmos 0agenetic variability 0aphylogeny 0aPtyodactylus1 aGonçalves, Duarte V.1 aBrito, José Carlos1 aHarris, David James0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g, v. 34, no. 1 p.85-93dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685381-000028733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011400168520183900282592002802121650002402149650001202173650001102185650001302196650001102209650000902220650001502229650002102244650002302265650002102288650002402309653001702333653002302350653002002373653002602393653002602419653001902445700002902464700001602493773011302509856008602622852000902708655001202717IND60706844020221118233653.0201216e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070684402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWahab, Abdul10aImpact of graphene nanofluid and phase change material on hybrid photovoltaic thermal system: Exergy analysis  aAmbient temperature rise has an inadequate effect on the performance of photovoltaic cells. To reduce PV surface temperature, different methodologies have been suggested. In this study, an effective approach is demonstrated to simultaneously utilize active and passive cooling mediums in one system. This paper revolves around the fabrication, experimentation and exergy analysis of hybrid photovoltaic thermal system using both RT-35HC PCM and graphene nanofluid simultaneously as coolants. Exergy analysis is performed to determine actual energy available which can be utilized for useful purposes. It also interprets the losses and sustainability of the system. Results are compared with PV integrated with PCM module and Conventional PV module. Heat loss in the system is minimized to enhance the stability. Working fluids are distilled water and graphene nanofluid with 0.05%–0.15% volume concentrations. Experiments are also performed at different flow rates ranging from 20 to 40 L per minute in outdoor with clear sky. Highest electrical and thermal exergy efficiencies achieved are 13.02% at 40 L per minute and 1.78% at 20 L per minute with 0.1% volume concentration by hybrid photovoltaic thermal system. Maximum overall exergy efficiency is 14.62% attained by same system at 0.1% volume concentration and 40 L per minute. Overall exergy efficiency displays increasing trends with the rise in flow rates of working fluids. It is depicted that thermal exergy impact on overall exergy efficiency is very low compared to electrical exergy. Maximum sustainability index of 1.17 is shown at optimum conditions. Further, exergy losses, exergy destruction, entropy generation and improvement potential have been discussed with graphs to ameliorate and revamp hybrid photovoltaic thermal system sustainability in future work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acooling 3aexergy 3agraphene 3agraphs 3aheat 3ananofluids 3aphase transition 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asolar collectors 3asurface temperature 0aPhotovoltaic 0aGraphene nanofluid 0aExergy analysis 0aSolar thermal systems 0aPhase change material 0aSustainability1 aKhan, Muhammad Alam Zaib1 aHassan, Ali0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.123370-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245006700160300001600227500002000243520121900263592002801482596003601510596002401546650001601570650002201586650001501608650001001623650001801633650001001651650001201661650001201673650001501685650001501700700002001715700002001735700002401755773012901779856007701908852000901985655001201994IND60594938820221120175509.0220424e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059493882DNAL7 a10.2981/wlb.2003.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyeland, Jens10aField methods to assess pectoral muscle mass in moulting geese  ap. 155-159.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this paper, we report two new simple field methods to assess changes in pectoral muscle mass in live moulting geese. In the first method, transverse chest profiles of Canada geese Branta canadensis and greylag geese Anser anser were recorded using soldering wire. This standard measure of the chest angle showed a highly significant relationship with actual pectoral muscle mass. Chest angle measures showed a highly significant polynomial correlation with an index of moult stage, i.e. length of the ninth primary (p9). This indicated an initial slight decline in pectoral muscle mass as p9 length increased, followed by an increase in muscle mass in preparation for regaining the ability to fly. In the second method, visual pectoral profile scores from 0 (thin pectoral muscles concave) to 3 (convex bulky) recorded at distances using telescope or binoculars also proved to be useful as a field measure of pectoral muscle mass in moulting geese. Hence, the first method provides a non‐consumptive means of predicting pectoral muscle mass in moulting geese without the need to dissect birds, and the second method enables field prediction of muscle mass in moulting geese without resort to capture of birds.  aPublisher supplied data  cGreenland Home‐rule Authority  cDanish Polar Centre 3aAnser anser 3aBranta canadensis 3abinoculars 3achest 3afield methods 3ageese 3amolting 3amuscles 3aprediction 3atelescopes1 aFox, Anthony D.1 aKahlert, Johnny1 aTherkildsen, Ole R.0 tWildlife biology.g2003 June, v. 9, no. 2 p.155-159dNordic Board for Wildlife ResearchwJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2981/wlb.2003.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245013700131300001600268520108800284592002801372650001901400650002501419650001401444650001201458650002501470650002401495650001001519650002601529650001201555650001301567650001301580650001501593651001001608653001501618653003301633653001101666653001701677653001001694700001601704700001601720700001901736700001601755700001901771700001201790773018801802852000901990655001201999IND60764438220221120113018.0220130e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076443822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmir, Mohammad10aEffect of seed enhancement techniques on yield and yield attributes of Lentil (Lens culinaris M.) cultivars under rainfed conditions  ap. 193-197.  aTo evaluate the effect of seed enhancing techniques on seed yield and yield components of lentil (Lens culinaris M), a field experiment was conducted in Split Plot Design with three replications using two lentil cultivars viz., KLB-303 and K-75 placed in the main plot with fourteen different seed priming treatments in the sub-plot during the Rabi season of 2019–20 and 2020–21 at Oil Seed Farm, CSA University, Kanpur. Analysis of variance of pooled data of both the year revealed that Variety K-75 was significantly superior in terms of yield and yield components as compared to variety KLB-303. Among the various seed priming techniques, seed coating (on hydroprimed seed) with BioNPK and drought alleviating bacteria resulted in maximum yield with and yield components as compared to other treatments. Thus, from the experiment it may be concluded that seed coating (on hydroprimed seed) with drought alleviating bacteria + BioNPK can be used for higher seed production of lentil under sub-optimal condition which is simple, economically feasible and environmental friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens culinaris 3aanalysis of variance 3acultivars 3adrought 3aeconomic feasibility 3aexperimental design 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3alentils 3aoilseeds 3aresearch 3aseed yield 3aIndia 0aBiopriming 0aDrought alleviating bacteria 0aLentil 0aSeed coating 0aYield1 aSingh, C.B.1 aJatav, A.L.1 aKumar, Maneesh1 aSingh, D.P.1 aTripathi, D.K.1 aAstha, 0 tSKUAST journal of research.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 2 p.193-197dSher-E-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir, ShalimarwJournal:21329x2349-297X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245011700126300001600243520152100259592002801780650001401808650001601822650002601838650002301864650001601887650001801903650001401921650001401935650001901949650001501968650001001983650001301993650000902006653001302015653002102028653001302049653002302062653001002085700001702095700001302112700001702125700001402142773014102156852000902297655001202306IND60742876020221116214516.0210626s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074287602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, KC10aCrop, water productivity and economics in chickpea as influenced by application of hydrogel and foliar nutrition  ap. 252-256.  aA field experiment was carried out during two consecutive winter seasons of 2018–19 and 2019–20 to enhance crop and water productivity in chickpea RSG 973 through hydrogel and foliar nutrition under deficit soil moisture conditions. Ten treatments combinations consisting of two hydrogel levels (control versus hydrogel at 5 kg/ha applied at last plough or sowing in rows) in main plots and five foliar nutrition levels (water spray i.e., control, urea 2%, thiourea 500 ppm, salicyclic acid 100 ppm and NPK at 0.5% (with complex fertilizer having N: P: K 19: 19: 19 kg/ha) applied at flowering and pod development stages) in sub plots were carried out in trice replicated split plot. Results revealed that application of hydrogel @5 kg/ha significantly increased growth, yield attributes and yield of chickpea during both the year. The mean increases in grain yield and water productivity due to application of hydrogel were 17.54 per cent and 0.24 kg/m³ respectively over control. Similarly, foliar nutrition significantly influence pods/per plant, 100-seed weight, grain, straw, biological yield, harvest index and water productivity during both year of experimentation. Further, foliar application of salicylic acid @ 100 ppm recorded significantly higher pods/plants (63.87, 67.40), 100-seed weight (15.67, 15.85 g), grain yield (15.48, 16.27 qha⁻¹) and water productivity being at par with NPK 19: 19: 19 @0.5 per cent, thiourea @ 500ppm but significantly superior over water spray and urea@ 2 per cent.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickpeas 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3afoliar application 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3ahydrogels 3anutrition 3asalicylic acid 3asoil water 3astraw 3athiourea 3aurea 0aChickpea 0aFoliar Nutrition 0aHydrogel 0aWater productivity 0aYield1 aPraharaj, CS1 aJain, SK1 aKumar, Vipin1 aYadav, MR0 tJournal of food legumes.g2020, v. 33, no. 4 p.252-256dIndian Society of Pulses Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2075x0976-24347nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245017000162300001200332520173600344592002802080650002302108650001102131650001402142650002002156650003102176650001002207650001302217650002402230650001902254650001502273650001402288650001702302650002002319650004302339650001402382650002902396650002602425650002002451700001502471700001802486700001702504700001502521700001602536700001402552700001202566700001802578700001602596773011402612856008102726852000902807655001202816IND60548958520221118050557.0161031e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054895852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-016-2238-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Zhen10aIdentification of candidate thermotolerance genes during early seedling stage in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) revealed by comparative transcriptome analysis  ap. 221.  aHigh-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits cotton growth, metabolism, and yield worldwide. The identification and characterization of thermotolerance is restricted by the plant growth environment and growth stage. In this study, four genotypes of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with known field thermotolerance were evaluated under normal and HTs at the seedlings stage in a growth cabinet with 11 physiological, biochemical, and phenotypic assays. Consistent with previous field observations, the thermotolerance could be identified by genotype differences at the seedling stage under HT in a growth cabinet. Comparative transcriptome analysis was performed on seedlings of two contrasting cotton genotypes after 4 and 8 h of HT exposure. Gene ontology analysis combined with BLAST annotations revealed a large number of HT-induced differentially expressed genes (4,698) that either exhibited higher expression levels in the heat-tolerant genotype (Nan Dan Ba Di Da Hua) compared with the heat-sensitive genotype (Earlistaple 7), or were differentially expressed only in Nan Dan Ba Di Da Hua. These genes encoded mainly protein kinases, transcription factors, and heat-shock proteins, which were considered to play key roles in thermotolerance in upland cotton. Two heat-shock transcription factor genes (homologs of AtHsfA3, AtHsfC1) and AP2/EREBP family genes (homologs of AtERF20, AtERF026, AtERF053, and AtERF113) were identified as possible key regulators of thermotolerance in cotton. Some of the differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Our findings provide candidate genes that could be used to improve thermotolerance in cotton cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3acultivars 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat tolerance 3ametabolism 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3aprotein kinases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseedlings 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics1 aHe, Shoupu1 aGong, Wenfang1 aSun, Junling1 aPan, Zhaoe1 aSun, Gaofei1 aCao, Moju1 aXu, Jie1 aDu, Xiongming1 aLü, Yanli,0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2016 Sept., v. 38, no. 9 p.221-221dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-016-2238-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011400171300001600285520100200301592002801303650000801331650002101339650001901360650000901379650002001388650001801408650002401426650002101450653003301471653002301504653002801527653001701555700002201572700002101594773008901615856008401704852000901788655001201797IND60603601120221116194802.0180716e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060360112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnisimov, Sergey10aNumerical study and optimization of the combined indirect evaporative air cooler for air-conditioning systems  ap. 452-464.  aThis paper investigates a mathematical simulation and optimization of the heat and mass transfer processes in the indirect evaporative air cooler.

Mathematical model was validated against existing experimental data. The results obtained from the simulation reveal the high effectiveness of the presented unit. The exchanger was compared with the conventional regenerative unit. The results of comparison show, that the presented unit is characterized by higher effectiveness. The impact of the selected unitless operating factors on the performance of the investigated heat exchanger was established. The conducted multi-criteria optimization allowed to establish Pareto-optimal operating conditions and preferable climatic zones for the presented heat exchanger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aclimatic zones 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 0aIndirect evaporative cooling 0aMathematical model 0aHeat and mass exchanger 0aOptimization1 aPandelidis, Demis1 aDanielewicz, Jan0 tEnergy.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 80 p.452-464dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011300168520172800281592002802009650001202037650002702049650001702076650001402093650001402107650002702121650002802148650001102176653003202187653004202219653002402261653002302285653002702308700002002335700001702355700001702372700001802389700001302407773011302420856008602533852000902619655001202628IND60706844420221118233744.0220719e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070684442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Zhilong10aStudy on all-components regeneration of ultraviolet aged SBS modified asphalt for high-performance recycling  aThe regeneration and reusing of reclaimed asphalt mixture can promote the recycling of waste building materials and the sustainable development of asphalt pavement. To further improve the properties of rejuvenated SBS modified asphalt, the effects of structural changes of SBS, and the colloidal stability of asphalt on the properties of binder were studied. And based on the results, bio-rejuvenator and active rejuvenator were applied to rejuvenate ultraviolet aged SBS modified asphalt (USMA), the impacts of rejuvenators on the composition, structure, physical and rheological properties of USMA were systematically investigated. The results show the decrease of colloidal index and the damage of SBS structure all have a serious adverse influence on the properties of binder. Bio-rejuvenator can rebalance the colloidal stability of ultraviolet (UV) aged binders, meanwhile active rejuvenator could react with the active terminal groups of broken SBS segments and partially rebuilds its crosslinking structure. And the physical and rheological properties of UV aged asphalt can be all basically restored by adding bio-rejuvenator; however bio-rejuvenator cannot restore the properties of USMA, which can only improve the low-temperature performance of USMA. While the addition of active rejuvenator greatly enhances the high-temperature performance of rejuvenated SBS modified asphalt. Furthermore, the combination of bio-rejuvenator and active rejuvenator can both recover the colloidal structure and damaged SBS structure of USMA, which obviously improves its high- and low-temperature properties overall. This paper would contribute to the realization of high-quality regeneration of reclaimed SBS modified asphalt.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3aconstruction materials 3acrosslinking 3apavements 3arecycling 3arheological properties 3asustainable development 3awastes 0aAll-components regeneration 0aUltraviolet aged SBS modified Asphalt 0aColloidal stability 0aChemical structure 0aRheological properties1 aHuang, Xiaoqiao1 aYu, Jianying1 aHan, Xiaobin1 aWang, Ruiyang1 aLi, Ying0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.123376-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016600167300001800333520136400351536045301715592002802168596002702196596001602223596002702239650000802266650001902274650000902293650001402302650002002316650001602336650001702352650001602369650001902385650001602404651001402420653003702434653002802471653006102499653002202560700001402582700001502596700001802611700001802629773012202647856008602769852000902855655001202864IND60757397520221120111926.0211124e20211003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075739752DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2021.19600752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Juhyun10aPre-trained feature aggregated deep learning-based monitoring of overshooting tops using multi-spectral channels of GeoKompsat-2A advanced meteorological imagery  ap. 1052-1071.  aOvershooting tops (OTs) play a crucial role in carrying tropospheric water vapor to the lower stratosphere. They are closely related to climate change as well as local severe weather conditions, such as lightning, hail, and air turbulence, which implies the importance of their detection and monitoring. While many studies have proposed threshold-based detection models using the spatial characteristics of OTs, they have shown varied performance depending on the seasonality and study areas. In this study, we propose a pre-trained feature-aggregated convolutional neural network approach for OT detection and monitoring. The proposed approach was evaluated using multi-channel data from Geo-Kompsat-2A Advanced Meteorological Imager (GK2A AMI) over East Asia. The fusion of a visible channel and multi-infrared channels enabled the proposed model to consider both physical and spatial characteristics of OTs. Six schemes were evaluated according to two types of data pre-processing methods and three types of deep learning model architectures. The best-performed scheme yielded a probability of detection (POD) of 92.1%, a false alarm ratio (FAR) of 21.5%, and a critical success index (CSI) of 0.7.

The free-standing GPE film containing poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) exhibits the excellent suitability as electrolyte in EDLC due to its high ionic conductivity (∼2 × 10⁻³ S cm⁻¹ at 20 °C), thermal stability (from −30 to 80 °C), electrochemical stability window (∼3.5 V vs. Ag), and excellent mechanical properties. The high rate capability of the EDLC has been observed from the impedance analysis in terms of high knee frequency (∼58 Hz), low response time (∼791 ms) and high pulse power (∼16.4 kW kg⁻¹). The cyclic voltammetric response indicates the capacitive performance up to a substantially high scan rate of 1000 mV s⁻¹, which further confirms the high rate performance of the EDLC. Though the specific energy of the solid-state EDLC is observed to be low (Emax ∼ 8.2 Wh kg⁻¹), its power density is substantially high (Pmax > 4 kW kg⁻¹). After ∼20% decrement in specific capacitance during the initial charge–discharge cycles, the EDLC offers almost stable performance up to ∼3500 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal stability 3aelectrolytes 3aspecific energy 3aelectrodes 3asilver 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3agels 3amechanical properties 3aelectrical equipment 3agraphene 0aSupercapacitor 0aElectric double layer capacitor 0aGraphene nano-platelets 0aSuccinonitrile 0aGel polymer electrolyte 0aimpedance1 aSuleman, Mohd1 aKumar, Yogesh1 aHashmi, S.A.0 tEnergy.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 80 p.465-473dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245016900131300001600300520064000316592002800956650002500984650002401009650001101033650001401044650002401058650001301082650001301095653002901108653001501137653002301152700002001175773018801195852000901383655001201392IND60764438520221120092805.0220130e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076443852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMushtaq, Aoufa10aRegression analysis among morphological characteristics in various tomato germplasm against fruit infestation by Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidotera: Noctuidae)  ap. 208-211.  aStudies were carried out at Experimental Farm, Faculty of Agriculture, Wadura, Sopore, SKUAST-K, during the year, 2016–2017.

There are a number of tools available to assist in the resolution of problem feline behaviour and this article will cover environmental modification and behavioural modification. Problem feline behaviours are not uncommon and the veterinary team often have to rely on their own knowledge to assist clients if a specialist behaviourist is not available. There is a lack of evidence-based information regarding how best to work-up and treat cases of problem feline behaviour in practice; therefore, some recommendations within this article are based on the author’s experience of treating cases in a cat-specific behaviour referral practice over the past 20 years. However, there is evidence available regarding how best to enrich a cat’s environment and how to ensure a cat’s environmental needs are met. Any veterinarians, veterinary nurses or technicians who are involved in the diagnosis or treatment of problem feline behaviour in practice would benefit from understanding the principles of environmental and behavioural modification.  aFunding The author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal technicians 3abehavior problems 3acats 3aearly diagnosis 3afirst aid 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary clinics 0aProblem behaviour 0aenvironmental modification 0abehavioural modification 0alearning0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 20, no. 11 p.1005-1014dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X188067573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03764naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245010500180520236700285592002802652650001202680650002202692650001802714650001602732650002502748650002202773650002502795650001502820650002302835650001302858650001602871650002002887651001102907653002402918653001802942653002002960653002002980653001503000653001303015700002103028700002403049700002903073773009603102856008703198852000903285655001203294IND60683055420221119200610.0200318e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068305542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1071522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Andrade, Marcel Levy10aFood safety culture in food services with different degrees of risk for foodborne diseases in Brazil  aFood safety culture may establish the right environment for adequate food handling and management, reducing violations of food safety regulation, especially those related to foodborne disease outbreaks. This study aimed to evaluate differences among elements of food safety culture in food services at low or high-risk for foodborne diseases. This study was conducted with 63 managers and 333 food handlers from 32 food services located in the metropolitan region of Campinas, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The following elements of food safety culture (considering the technical-managerial and human routes) were evaluated: management systems, style, and process; leadership; organizational commitment; food safety climate (communication; self-commitment; management and coworker support; environment support; risk judgment; normative beliefs and work pressure); and risk perceptions. In the technical-managerial route, restaurants were categorized as low- or high foodborne disease risk restaurants. For the evaluation of food safety management systems, a validated checklist was used. In the human route, food safety climate analysis was performed by evaluating five elements applied exclusively to food handlers. High-risk restaurants presented a higher percentage of violation in most aspects related to food safety regulation and physical structure. Leadership and knowledge of low-risk restaurants' managers presented a higher level when compared to high-risk restaurants’ managers, showing that in the first group managers acted as mediators of safe practices. Food handlers from low-risk restaurants presented higher scores in food safety knowledge, organizational commitment, and food safety climate when compared to food handlers from high-risk restaurants. In restaurants with lower risk for foodborne diseases, the elements of food safety culture were better evaluated, indicating fewer violations of food safety regulation. In these restaurants, a consistent food safety climate was perceived within the technical-managerial route. This result shows that fewer violations of food safety legislation, especially those involving high-risk foodborne disease, were a positive outcome of an improved FS-culture. In this sense, it is possible to improve food safety by applying, evolving and maturing the concepts of FS-culture in restaurants in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adisease outbreaks 3afood handling 3afood safety 3afood service workers 3afoodborne illness 3alaws and regulations 3aleadership 3amanagement systems 3amanagers 3arestaurants 3arisk perception 3aBrazil 0aFood safety climate 0aFood services 0aRisk assessment 0aOptimistic bias 0aRestaurant 0aBehavior1 aStedefeldt, Elke1 aZanin, Lais Mariano1 ada Cunha, Diogo Thimoteo0 tFood control.g2020 June, v. 112 p.107152-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1071523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245013100153300001600284520143000300592002801730650001101758650000901769650002101778650001501799650002401814650002301838650002201861650001101883650001301894650001101907650001101918650002101929651001401950653002001964653001601984653001502000653001702015653001102032700002802043700001802071700002002089700001702109700001702126700001902143773011902162856007202281852000902353655001202362IND60763310820221120171546.0220120s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076331082DNAL7 a10.1071/MF203762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Iain10aHow fish kills affected traditional (Baakandji) and non-traditional communities on the Lower Darling&#x2013;<i>Baaka</i> River  ap. 259-268.  aIn the summer of 2018&#x2013;19 mass fish kills occurred in the Lower Darling (Baaka) River in south-eastern Australia. The fish kills received national and international attention and have been the focus of numerous government agency and independent assessments. Although fish kills have previously been recorded in the Lower Darling region, the size and rapid succession of the 2018&#x2013;19 &#x2018;Menindee' fish kills made them unprecedented in the Murray&#x2013;Darling Basin, placing significant pressure on the native fish community. Although the deaths of millions of fish were documented, the significant negative effect that the fish kills had on local communities, particularly the traditional Baakandji people, was largely ignored. The social and cultural aspects of such events can have major non-economic effects on local communities. In this paper we document heart-felt feelings conveyed by local community members. Their sense of loss, despair and helplessness is compounded by frustration regarding water management and policy decision making in the Murray&#x2013;Darling Basin. However, these tragic events have increased understanding of traditional Baakandji connection to the river and its fish and, together with local recovery efforts, now provide prospects for enhanced community and agency cooperation to improve the health of the lower Darling Baaka River and restore its native fish populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3afish 3afish communities 3afreshwater 3agovernment agencies 3aindigenous species 3aissues and policy 3apeople 3aresearch 3arivers 3asummer 3awater management 3aAustralia 0acultural values 0afish deaths 0aIndigenous 0arecreational 0asocial1 aBates, William (Badger)1 aMartin, Sarah1 aMcCrabb, Graeme1 aKoehn, J.

This lack of knowledge complicates undertaking conservation measures considering Pyxis genetic diversity. Here, we describe six new microsatellites for Pyxis arachnoides from wild specimens and several localities, and the cross amplification of two Astrochelys radiata microsatellites. Of these microsatellites, two are monomorphic among the three distinct subspecies and a closely related species, while the remaining six are polymorphic. Microsatellite data are needed for this species to study the inter- and intra-subspecies genetic diversity, especially for the highly endangered subspecies P. a. brygooi, which currently occurs only in remote localities. The availability of polymorphic microsatellites will allow identifying the population of origin of individuals and will aid in justifying their management as separate evolutionary lineages for conservation purposes. The rationale is to preserve both evolutionary processes and adaptive potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstrochelys radiata 3aPyxis arachnoides 3aPyxis planicauda 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anatural history 3atortoises 0aAstrochelys radiata 0aMadagascar 0amicrosatellites 0aPyxis 0atortoises1 aChiari, Ylenia1 aVieites, David R.1 aPedrono, Miguel1 aLouis Jr., Edward0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g, v. 34, no. 1 p.125-128dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685381-000028663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010300173520152600276592002801802650001201830650001201842650001401854650001301868650001101881650001401892650001001906650001701916650002401933650002501957650001201982650001301994650000902007650001502016650001102031650001302042650000702055650001502062650003302077650000902110650001602119650001102135650001102146650001902157650002002176650002202196650000902218651000902227653003902236653002902275653002402304653003002328700001502358700002102373773011302394856008602507852000902593655001202602IND60706844720221118233708.0201216e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070684472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokarram, Marzieh10aEffects of heavy metal contamination on river water quality due to release of industrial effluents  aThis study seeks to evaluate the quality of Kor River water located in southern Iran, and presents techniques for identifying the main sources of contaminations discharged to the river by neighboring factories.

The Kriging method was also applied to analyze the spatial distribution of contaminants in the vicinity of polluting industries. Results of the Dunnett test indicated that the stations located in the vicinity of an industrial area, including petrochemical, pulp mill, home appliances, meat, sugar, tanning, flour, and licorice extraction factories were among the most polluted stations. Water quality index and heavy metal evaluation index were used to determine the contamination level at each station. Stations with water quality indices of 0.9 ± 5.0 and 87.3 ± 2.0 had the highest and the lowest contamination levels, respectively, corresponding to very poor (undrinkable) and very good water qualities. Stations with poor water qualities were also found to be highly polluted according to the heavy metal evaluation index, showing high concentrations for arsenic and cadmium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achlorides 3achromium 3acopper 3afactories 3aflour 3aheavy metals 3ahousehold equipment 3aindustrial effluents 3akriging 3alicorice 3ameat 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3aprincipal component analysis 3apulp 3ariver water 3arivers 3asugars 3awater hardness 3awater pollution 3awater temperature 3azinc 3aIran 0aHeavy metal evaluation index (HEI) 0aIndustrial contamination 0aRiver water quality 0aWater quality index (WQI)1 aSaber, Ali1 aSheykhi, Vahideh0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.123380-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245006700168300001800235520139900253536011901652592002801771650002201799650000901821650001101830650000901841650001801850650002101868650002501889650001701914650001801931650002301949653002001972653001401992653002802006653001002034653002102044773012702065856008002192852000902272655001202281IND60623773920221121210513.0181127e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062377392DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X188067592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitale, Kristyn R10aTools for managing feline problem behaviors: Pheromone therapy  ap. 1024-1032.  aCats are one of the most common companion animals in the world. However, relatively little scientific research has been conducted on cat behavior. With problem behaviors a leading reason for relinquishment of cats to shelters, or abandonment outdoors, solutions to address feline behavioral problems can have important welfare benefits. Because naturally occurring pheromones produce measurable species-specific responses in cats, the use of synthetic pheromone products consisting of the same compounds may activate a specific behavioral response in the receiving individual, allowing humans to better communicate with cats and manage feline problem behavior. In this article the scientific background for naturally occurring feline pheromones and semiochemicals and their impact on cat behavior is reviewed. This is used as a foundation to explore the three feline synthetic pheromones currently available and the empirical evidence that exists for their effectiveness. From this information, several recommendations for veterinarians and behavior professionals on the application of feline pheromone therapy in the home and veterinary clinic setting are presented. The efficacy of synthetic pheromones as a tool for the management of problem behaviors is a relatively new area of research and only fairly recently has the need to implement more rigorous research methodology been recognized.  aFunding The author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior problems 3acats 3ahumans 3apets 3aprofessionals 3aresearch methods 3asynthetic pheromones 3atherapeutics 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary clinics 0aChemical signal 0apheromone 0aolfactory communication 0ascent 0ahuman–cat bond0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 20, no. 11 p.1024-1032dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X188067593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012200170300001800292520146000310592002801770650001101798650001701809650001301826650003501839650001601874650002501890650001501915650001301930650001901943650001101962650002101973651001001994653002602004653001402030653002402044653001202068653001802080653001502098700002202113773009302135856008402228852000902312655001202321IND60535705520221119232909.0190417s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053570552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqpro.2015.02.1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrabhu, M.

The groundwater storage change from place to place and there isneed to identify recharge zones throughgeospatial technology as an important strategy for water management system.However conventional methods alone it is not an easy task to study the surface parameters of a large area to identify suitable sites for artificial recharge, since many controlling parameters must be independently derived and integrated, which involves additional cost, time and manpower. Modern remote sensing technologies have many advantages over older, conventional methods due to their synoptic coverage, improved spatial resolution, and their capabilities for multi-spectral and multi-temporal analysis. In addition, unlike conventional methods for demarcation of suitable areas for groundwater replenishment are able to take into account the diversity of factors that control groundwater recharge. Based on the GIS overlay analysis the possible combinations for recharge sites based on geology, geomorphology, lineament, lineament density, drainage density, Landuse and Landcover combinations covers an area of 915.052 Sq.kmand are suitable for various artificial recharge structures. The results show that by expanding the artificial recharge system, the recharge volume can be increased even for small flood events.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3adrainage 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3aland cover 3aland use 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3awater management 3aIndia 0aGeospatial Techniques 0aLithology 0aArtificial Recharge 0aGeology 0aGeomorphology 0asubtract ;1 aVenkateswaran, S.0 tAquatic Procedia.g2015, v. 4 p.1265-1274dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23340x2214-241X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqpro.2015.02.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012100173300001600294520102100310592002801331650001501359650001401374650002101388650001701409650001101426650001501437650002701452650002501479650001301504650001901517700002501536773010601561856008101667852000901748655001201757IND60548959220221118050509.0160905e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054895922DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-016-9515-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Adalton M.10aPhosphorus Fertilizer Rate for Fresh Market Potato Cultivars Grown in Tropical Soil with Low Phosphorus Availability  ap. 404-414.  aKnowledge on phosphorus (P) response of main potato cultivars is essential to rational fertilization management and maximize yield, mainly in tropical soils that usually have low P availability. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of P fertilization rates (0, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 kg P₂O₅ ha⁻¹) on leaf nutrient concentrations, tuber yield and size distribution, as well as applied P-use efficiency (APUE) in the potato cultivars Agata and Mondial. The results indicated that it is not necessary to evaluate the P-nutritional status and adjust P recommendations on a cultivar basis because P fertilization resulted in similar increases in the leaf P concentration of both cultivars, and the cultivars responded to the same P rate (500 kg P₂O₅ ha⁻¹). However, Mondial had a higher APUE and was more responsive than Agata to the same P rate. A leaf P concentration of 2.9 g kg⁻¹ was superior to 2.5 g kg⁻¹ as the lower limit of the P sufficiency range for Agata and Mondial.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afertilizer rates 3afresh market 3aleaves 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aphosphorus pentoxide 3apotatoes 3atropical soils1 aSoratto, Rogério P.0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2016 Aug., v. 93, no. 4 p.404-414dSpringer USx1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-016-9515-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014400163300001600307520099300323592002801316650000801344650000801352650001501360650001301375650001501388650002101403650002101424650002901445650002101474650002801495650001201523650001101535650002101546650001401567653003901581653003801620653002101658700001301679700001801692700001601710773010701726856008601833852000901919655001201928IND60617622120221116201645.0210114e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061762212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fen10aElectrogenerated chemiluminescence biosensor for detection of mercury (II) ion via target-triggered manipulation of DNA three-way junctions  ap. 114-118.  aA new electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor is fabricated for the determination of mental ion incorporating DNA three-way junction structure (DNA-TWJ). As a model system, Hg²⁺ was chosen as an analyte. The ECL biosensor was fabricated by covalently coupling Hg²⁺ special DNA-TWJ tagged with ruthenium (II) complex (Ru) (named TW/Ru-J1) to the surface of glassy carbon electrode that had been covalently modified with 4-aminobenzoic acid via electrochemical oxidations. Upon binding of Hg²⁺ to the TW/Ru-J1, the confirmation of TW/Ru-J1 changed and induced Ru away from surface of electrode and thus led to a low ECL signal. The signal linearly decreases with the concentration of Hg²⁺ in the range from 0.1 pM to 10 pM with a detection limit of 0.04 pM This study could be easily extended to various analytical platforms for the detection of many kinds of analytes or their interactions such as DNA/RNA, DNAzyme/target, aptamer/target, and antibody/antigen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiosensors 3achemical bonding 3achemical species 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3amercury 3amodels 3aoligonucleotides 3aruthenium 0aElectrogenerated chemiluminescence 0aBiosensor, DNA three-way junction 0aMercury (II) ion1 aChen, Yu1 aZhu, Yinchang1 aLiu, Jiawei0 tTalanta.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.114-118dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010500169300001600274520115000290592002801440650002901468650001201497650001301509650001101522650001101533650002501544650001701569650000901586650001001595650000901605650001401614650001101628650001901639650001401658650000901672651000901681653002201690653001501712653001301727653001601740700001701756700002101773773011301794856005101907852000901958655001201967IND50074950320221119211850.0140410e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007495032DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2012.6979352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForghani, Giti14aThe Concentration and Partitioning of Heavy Metals in Surface Sediments of the Maharlu Lake, SW Iran  ap. 872-888.  aIn this study, an assessment is made of the environmental impacts of heavy metal concentration and fractionation in bed sediments of the saline Maharlu Lake, SW Iran. Total elemental analysis indicated that sediments were highly enriched in Pb and Cd. Sequential extraction analysis revealed that salt of the lake is probably highly contaminated with Cd, Pb, and Co. Due to the oxidizing conditions of the lake, the organic matter fraction of the elements was not significant. In all sediments, Cd, Pb, Co, Mn, and Zn were strongly associated with exchangeable plus carbonate fractions, with mean percentage of 76.4%, 65.3%, 56%, 40.9%, and 34.3%, respectively. On average, the percentage of Ni associated with the sum of the exchangeable and carbonate fractions was 19.8%. Cr, Fe, and Cu fractionation indicated that these metals are environmentally inert and immobile. Statistical relationships among metal fractions and sediment properties showed that Cd, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co, and Mn were mainly from recent anthropogenic sources, while such sources were less important for Cr, Cu, and Fe. The latter metals represented natural geochemical levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenvironmental impact 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alakes 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3aorganic matter 3asediments 3azinc 3aIran 0aEnrichment factor 0aspeciation 0amobility 0asaline lake1 aMoore, Farid1 aQishlaqi, Afshin0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 21, no. 7 p.872-888dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2012.697935  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245016500178300001600343520095900359592002801318650001301346650001501359650001601374650002101390650001201411650001701423650001201440650002301452650001801475650002101493650003701514650001401551650003201565650001201597650001401609650000701623650001401630650001201644650005801656650001101714650002501725650001201750653003001762653002801792653001801820653001201838700002801850700001801878700002701896773010401923856005102027852000902078655001202087IND50087380720221120105055.0140412e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008738072DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2012.6718562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudhakar, G.

AdL is a pentamer with subunits of 82.4, 62.5, 51, 33, and 27.5 kDa. Hemagglutination profile and cross adsorption tests revealed a strong reactivity with rabbit erythrocytes. The agglutinating activity required Ca²⁺, and was reduced when the lectin was dialyzed against TBS-EDTA. The AdL was stable in a pH range (7.5–8.0) and labile at or above 68°C. Ammonium sulphate and trichloroacetic acid completely precipitated the hemagglutinating activity suggesting it is a protein. Treatment with trypsin, potassium metaperiodate oxidation of hemolymph abolished the agglutinating activity. Hemagglutination inhibition assay performed with different carbohydrates and glycoproteins revealed unique specificity of hemolymph agglutinin for N-acetylneuraminic acid and fetuin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDecapoda 3aadsorption 3aagglutinins 3aammonium sulfate 3acalcium 3aerythrocytes 3afetuins 3agel chromatography 3aglycoproteins 3ahemagglutination 3ahemagglutination inhibition test 3ahemolymph 3aion exchange chromatography 3alectins 3aoxidation 3apH 3apotassium 3arabbits 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3ashrimp 3atrichloroacetic acid 3atrypsin 0aCrustacean alpheid shrimp 0aN-acetylneuraminic acid 0aC-type lectin 0aRP-HPLC1 aSmith, V.

This river is a main recipient of all kinds of pollutants from the Pb−Zn mine “Grot.” Sediments from the Korbevačka River were studied to determine the distribution of the metals along the river, assess the quality of sediment, and find the degree of contamination. The concentration of iron, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenic, chromium, and barium were determined. River sediments were collected and analyzed for heavy metal concentration using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The degree of pollution in the sediments of the Korbevačka River has been evaluated based on Canadian sediment quality guidelines, enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (Igₑₒ) and pollution load index (PLI). Inter-metal associations have been evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficients (r). The results indicated that: (1) sediments have been polluted with Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu and have high anthropogenic influences; (2) the calculation of geo-accumulation index suggests that the Korbevačka River sediments have background concentrations of Fe, Cr, and Ni (Igₑₒ < 1); (3) the co-precipitation (inclusion, occlusion, and adsorption) of heavy metals (except As and Ba) with Mn and Fe geochemical phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abarium 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acorrelation 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3anickel 3apollutants 3apollution load 3arivers 3asediments 3azinc 3aSerbia 0aAssessment 0aheavy metals 0aKorbevačka River 0apollution 0asediment1 aŽivković, Nenad,1 aŽivković, Ljiljana,1 aDjordjević, Amelija0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 21, no. 7 p.889-900dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2012.699110  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245005400200300001800254506007600272520086600348592002801214506003701242650002201279650001401301650001801315650001001333650002601343650001801369650001301387650002001400700002001420700001701440700002201457773014101479856007401620852000901694655001201703IND60671000520221207075745.0191002e20141105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067100052DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb01141d2doi7 aPMC42514982pmcid7 a254851122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckmann, D.

These unique features and low toxicity make the nanogels a favorable option for vascular drug targeting. In this review, we have addressed key chemical and biological aspects of nanogel drug carrier design. In particular, we have highlighted published studies of nanogel design, descriptions of nanogel functional characteristics and their behavior in biological models. These studies form a compendium of information that supports the scientific and clinical rationale for development of this carrier for targeted therapeutic interventions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiological models 3achemistry 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3afunctional properties 3ananoparticles 3atoxicity 3aviscoelasticity1 aComposto, R.

The contribution of phytoplankton in the carbon adsorption and stock during shrimp culture in brackishwater ponds. Biodiversitas 21: 5170-5177. In environmental point of view, it is important to determine the potential of adsorption and stock of blue carbon during shrimp farming in ponds with three cultivation technologies namely: extensive/traditional, semi-intensive, and intensive. The aquatic primary productivity approach is used to measure the potential of carbon adsorption in shrimp ponds, while the carbon conversion of chlorophyll-a content is used to measure its stock. The primary productivity and chlorophyll-a content were measured using three ponds for each cultivation technology every ten days from stocking (DOC 0) until the harvest period. The sampling location is in the BLUPPB shrimp pond area of Karawang, West Java - Indonesia. The study concluded that the adsorption and stock of blue carbon varied during shrimp farming in ponds. The primary productivity and chlorophyll-a content of the three cultivation technologies were the significant difference as the results of ANOVA Single Factor. Carbon adsorption average during extensive/traditional, semi-intensive, and intensive shrimp farming in ponds was 1.912832 g C m-3 day-1, 7.097145 g C m-3 day-1 and 8.250195 g C m-3 day-1, respectively. While, the average carbon stock during shrimp farming in extensive/traditional, semi-intensive, and intensive ponds were 0.64896 g m-3, 14.97473 g m-3, and 25.11102 g m-3, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadsorption 3ablue carbon 3abrackish water 3acarbon sinks 3achlorophyll 3aharvest date 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3aIndonesia 0acarbon chlorophyll-a ratio 0acarbon sink 0aprimary productivity1 aRIFQI, MUHAMMAD 1 aMASHAR, ALI 1 aNAZAR, FITRINA 1 aWARDIATNO, YUSLI 0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Oct., v. 21, no. 11dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2111233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015900168300001800327520171800345536036302063592002802426596001502454650001502469650001502484650001102499650001902510650001902529650002502548651001002573653002302583653003802606653003302644653002702677653002602704700001602730700001702746700001902763700001502782773012202797856008602919852000903005655001203014IND60757398220221120193205.0211124e20211003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075739822DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2021.19732162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, Wenqiang10aIntra-annual land cover mapping and dynamics analysis with dense satellite image time series: a spatiotemporal cube based spatiotemporal contextual method  ap. 1195-1218.  aLand covers provide essential information for understanding and detecting ecosystem, resources, and environmental dynamics. However, they are generally mapped at coarser temporal scales to study the inter-annual changes, while scant attention has been paid to map intra-annual land cover dynamics at finer temporal scales. Moreover, existing studies are still limited in intra-annual land cover mapping with dense satellite image time series (SITS). Accordingly, this study proposed a novel approach to accurately classify dense SITS for mapping intra-annual land cover dynamics. First, dense SITS is segmented at multiple spatiotemporal scales to generate optimal spatiotemporal cubes (ST-cubes), which are chosen as classification units. Second, the ST-cubes based on spectral, textural, spatial, and temporal features are integratively defined and employed in SITS classification. Third, the spatiotemporal context is modeled by a spatiotemporally extended conditional random field model that measures both spatiotemporal features and semantic correlation between geographic objects. Finally, the proposed method is applied to map the intra-annual land cover dynamics. Comparative experiments of SITS classification are carried out between our method and three existing competitors in a suburban area in Beijing, China, with a dense Sentinel-2 SITS. Moreover, based on the classification results, we analyzed the quantitative intra-annual dynamics of land cover. The result shows that our approach achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy over existing methods, indicating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in mapping intra-annual land cover dynamics with dense SITS.  aThis work is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871372] and the Key Laboratory of Surveying and Mapping Science and Geospatial Information Technology of Ministry of Natural Resources [2020-2-1];Key Laboratory of Surveying and Mapping Science and Geospatial Information Technology of Ministry of Natural Resources (cn) [[2020-2-1]];  aPublisher supplied data  a[2020-2-1] 3aecosystems 3aland cover 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asuburban areas 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aLand-cover mapping 0adense satellite image time series 0aST-cube-based image analysis 0aspatiotemporal context 0aintra-annual dynamics1 aDu, Shihong1 aDu, Shouhang1 aZhang, Xiuyuan1 aGu, Haiyan0 tGIScience & remote sensing.g2021 Oct. 03, v. 58, no. 7 p.1195-1218dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19689x1943-72267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2021.19732163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007400139245012200213300001600335500002000351520149900371592002801870596008501898650001701983650001802000650001102018650001602029650002602045650001302071650001402084650001502098650001602113650001702129650002502146650002202171650001202193700002202205700006702227700006502294700005502359700006302414700006102477773012702538856007402665852000902739655001202748IND60763311520221120181954.0220120e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076331152DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.142322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCândido‐Sobrinho, Silvio A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6055-579110aMetabolism‐mediated mechanisms underpin the differential stomatal speediness regulation among ferns and angiosperms  ap. 296-311.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent results suggest that metabolism‐mediated stomatal closure mechanisms are important to regulate differentially the stomatal speediness between ferns and angiosperms. However, evidence directly linking mesophyll metabolism and the slower stomatal conductance (gₛ) in ferns is missing. Here, we investigated the effect of exogenous application of abscisic acid (ABA), sucrose and mannitol on stomatal kinetics and carried out a metabolic fingerprinting analysis of ferns and angiosperms leaves harvested throughout a diel course. Fern stomata did not respond to ABA in the time period analysed. No differences in the relative decrease in gₛ was observed between ferns and the angiosperm following provision of sucrose or mannitol. However, ferns have slower gₛ responses to these compounds than angiosperms. Metabolomics analysis highlights that ferns have a higher accumulation of secondary rather than primary metabolites throughout the diel course, with the opposite being observed in angiosperms. Our results indicate that metabolism‐mediated stomatal closure mechanisms underpin the differential stomatal speediness regulation among ferns and angiosperms, in which the slower stomatal closure in ferns is associated with the lack of ABA‐responsiveness, to a reduced capacity to respond to mesophyll‐derived sucrose and to a higher carbon allocation toward secondary metabolism, which likely modulates both photosynthesis‐gₛ and growth‐stress tolerance trade‐offs.  aPublisher supplied data  a428192/2018‐1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAngiospermae 3aabscisic acid 3acarbon 3aenvironment 3aferns and fern allies 3amannitol 3amesophyll 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3asucrose1 aLima, Valéria F.1 aFreire, Francisco B.

Long-term changes in ETc of kharif maize was computed through CROPWAT 8.0 model and Papadakis method for a period of 1970–2018 for Ludhiana in the central plain and 1984–2018 for ballowal Saunkhari in the sub-mountainous agro-climatic region of Punjab. The maize crop at Ludhiana had average ETc of 532.9 mm and ballowal Saunkhari 489.2 mm by CROPWAT model; whereas it was 519.5 mm at Ludhiana and 535.2 mm at ballowal Saunkhari by Papadakis method during the kharif maize growing period. Long term analysis of variability in maize yield during the period 1970–2018 indicated that it increased @ 63.7 kg/ha/year at Ludhiana and 90.6 kg/ha/year at ballowal Saunkhri. At Ludhiana, ETc of maize decreased @ 1.1 mm/year for CROPWAT model and @ 2.3 mm/year for Papadakis method; whereas water productivity increased @ 0.13 kg/ha/mm/year with CROPWAT model and @ 0.15 kg/ha/mm/year with Papadakis method. At ballowal Saunkhri, the ETc of maize decreased @ 2.5 mm/year by CROPWAT model and increased @ 1.5 mm/year by Papadakis method; whereas water productivity increased over years @ 0.21 kg/ha/mm/year with CROPWAT model and @ 0.16 kg/ha/mm/year with Papadakis method. The increase in water productivity of maize could be attributed mainly to increase in yield over years. Multiple regression models explained 61 to 99 per cent variation in ETc of kharif maize at Ludhiana and 78 to 97 per cent at ballowal Saunkhari due to variable weather conditions at these two sites. These models have the potential to assess the impact of climate change on ETc of kharif maize in these two agroecologies of Punjab.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3aclimate change 3acorn 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aweather 0aActual evapotranspiration 0aClimate variability 0aCROPWAT model 0aKharif maize 0aPapadakis method 0aWater productivity1 aKingra, P K1 aSingh, Som Pal0 tAgricultural research journal.g2021 Apr., v. 58, no. 2 p.207-215dPunjab Agricultural University, LudhianawJournal:27376x2395-146X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2395-146X.2021.00032.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245015200216520124500368592002801613650002301641650001701664650002101681650001101702650001501713650001301728650001801741650001801759650003301777650001601810653001001826653002301836653002701859653002001886700001501906700006501921700002201986773011302008856008602121852000902207655001202216IND60706845520221118233926.0201216e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070684552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdullah, Norulsamani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7099-289910aOptimization of electrocatalyst performance of platinum–ruthenium induced with MXene by response surface methodology for clean energy application  aFuel cell produces clean sources of energy and yielding can be improved using emerging material (MXene) in electrocatalysis performance in a fuel cell system. However, MXene in electrocatalysis area for fuel cell is not discovered yet. Therefore, the aim of this study is to enhance the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) electrocatalyst performance using combination of bimetallic PtRu and MXene. Optimization is carried out using response surface methodology (RSM). Composition of MXene, Nafion content and methanol concentration are used as factors (input) and current density is used as a response (output) for the optimization analysis. A cyclic voltammetry (CV) is used to measure the current density. RSM generates optimum factors with MXene composition 78.90 wt%, Nafion content 19.71 wt% and methanol concentration of 2.82M. The optimum response is predicted to be 186.59mA/mgPₜRᵤ. The validation test is carried out and the result shows that the average current density is 187.05mA/mgPₜRᵤ. PtRu/MXene electrocatalyst produces 2.34 times higher current density compared to PtRu/C commercial electrocatalyst. This indicates that MXene has high potential as a nanocatalyst for cleaner energy production through the fuel cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aclean energy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3amethanol 3ananocatalysts 3ananomaterials 3aresponse surface methodology 3avoltammetry 0aMXene 0aMethanol oxidation 0aAnodic electrocatalyst 0aCurrent density1 aSaidur, R.1 aZainoodin, Azran Mohd1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2605-806X1 aAslfattahi, Navid0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.123395-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010200163300001600265520156500281592002801846650002101874650001201895650002001907650001501927650002401942650002401966650001601990650001902006650001102025653001502036653002202051653001402073653003902087700001402126700001502140700001102155773008902166856008402255852000902339655001202348IND60603602020221116194246.0180716e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060360202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, T.S.10aPerformance of two-stage rotary desiccant cooling system with different regeneration temperatures  ap. 556-566.  aIncreasing attention is being given to energy-saving air conditioning technology in recent years. Using natural refrigerant and driven by low grade thermal energy, rotary desiccant cooling system has become a sound alternative solution to conventional vapor compression system. Although one-stage ventilation rotary desiccant cooling system is still the main stream, TSDC (two-stage rotary desiccant cooling) system recently emerges as the latest development, which can be driven by lower regeneration temperature (50–90 °C) compared with one-stage system. In this paper, performance of TSDC with different regeneration temperatures in two stages is analyzed. First integrated mathematical model of TSDC system is established by combing models of different components. Cooling power and COPth (thermal coefficient of performance) are utilized as performance indicators. Then system performance with respect to different combinations of two regeneration temperatures are simulated and discussed, while optimization investigation is also conducted to obtain maximum COPth with same cooling power. Under the simulation condition, results show that cooling power of the system increases with the increase of regeneration temperatures, however, COPth decreases. Also, when the first stage operates in higher regeneration temperature, TSDC system can obtain better performance reflecting in both cooling power and in COPth. Moreover, with the same cooling power provided, COPth of TSDC system obtains a minimum value when temperatures of the two stages approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3acooling 3acooling systems 3adesiccants 3aenergy conservation 3amathematical models 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3avapors 0aSimulation 0aDesiccant cooling 0aTwo-stage 0aDifferent regeneration temperature1 aDai, Y.J.1 aWang, R.Z.1 aLi, Y.0 tEnergy.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 80 p.556-566dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245017600175300001600351520116100367592002801528650001001556650001801566650002201584650001201606650001801618650001001636650001501646650001201661650001701673650001501690650001301705650001001718650001501728650001401743650001401757650002001771650001501791651001001806653001501816653001701831653001401848653001201862653001301874700001801887700002201905700001801927700001801945700002001963773010401983856005102087852000902138655001202147IND50087381120221120115359.0140412e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008738112DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2012.6851092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-García, C.10aSurvival, home range patterns, probable causes of mortality, and den-site selection of the Iberian hare (Lepus, Leporidae, Mammalia) on arable farmland in north-west Spain  ap. 590-597.  aAlthough the Iberian hare is important to Spanish ecosystems and a valued game species, little is known about the survival and spatial behaviour of the species, which are crucial for correct management decisions. This paper studies the survival, home range, probable causes of mortality and den-site selection for 23 wild Iberian hares Lepus granatensis. We used radio telemetry to monitor hares on arable farmland in north-west Spain where habitat management measures were taken, control of predators was carried out and hunting was not allowed. Survival for the period studied (300 days) was 13% and average home range size (MCP 95%) was 39.6 ha. Probable causes of death included predation by wild canids (52%), disease (13%), roadkills (9%), and unknown (26%) for hares we studied. The red fox Vulpes vulpes was the main predator, whereas no raptor predation was reported. Den-site selection was affected by habitat type and hares showed a high preference for uncultivated land. Home range size tended to decrease when hares selected uncultivated land, grassland and lucerne, which were transition zones between shrubland, forest, and cultivated lands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus 3aVulpes vulpes 3aagricultural land 3aalfalfa 3abirds of prey 3adeath 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agame animals 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahares 3ahome range 3amortality 3apredation 3aradio telemetry 3ashrublands 3aSpain 0aHome range 0aIberian hare 0apredation 0ared fox 0asurvival1 aAlonso, M.

Raman reporter molecule Cy3 labeled E2-aptamer and DNA functionalized gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag CS NPs) offered SERS with high sensitivity and selectivity. Based on the fabricated double strand DNA-immobilized gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs), SERS signal intensity of Raman reporter changed with the number of Cy3-labeled aptamer attached to the core-shell nanoparticles due to the strong binding affinity between the aptamers and E2 with different concentrations. A wide linear range from 1.0 × 10–13 to 1.0 × 10−9 was obtained for the detection of E2, with a low detection limit of 2.75 fM. This proposed method showed highly sensitive and selective for detecting E2, and could be used to determine E2 in actual samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abinding capacity 3aestradiol 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 0aAptamer sensor 0aAu@Ag core-shell nanoparticles 0a17β-estradiol 0aDouble strand DNA1 aXie, Xiaohui1 aSun, Da-Wen1 aWei, Qingyi1 aJiang, Yingfen0 tTalanta.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 195 p.419-425dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014800170300001600318520100700334592002801341650002001369650002101389650001701410650002001427650002301447650001201470650001301482650001501495650001101510650002001521650000901541650002101550650001901571650001201590650001001602650001101612650001101623650001501634653002001649653001201669653002401681653004201705700001901747773012601766856005101892852000901943655001201952IND50074686420221118005647.0140408e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007468642DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2011.6192382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauddh, Kuldeep10aCadmium Tolerance and Its Phytoremediation by Two Oil Yielding Plants Ricinus Communis (L.) and Brassica Juncea (L.)

The plants were exposed to 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mg Cd/Kg soil for up to 60 days. It was found that R. communis produced higher biomass at all the contamination levels than that of B. juncea. Proline and malondialdehyde in the leaves increased with increase in Cd level in both the species, whereas soluble protein decreased. The bioaccumulation of Cd was higher in B. juncea on the basis of the per unit biomass, total metal accumulation per plant was higher in R. communis. The translocation of Cd from roots to shoot was also higher in B. juncea at all Cd concentrations. R. communis appeared more tolerant and capable to clean Cd contaminated soil for longer period in one sowing than B. juncea and the former can grow in wasteland soil also in which later cannot be cultivated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aRicinus communis 3aantioxidants 3abioaccumulation 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3acleaning 3acole crops 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aoils 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3aproline 3aroots 3ashoots 3asowing 3awastelands 0amalondialdehyde 0aproline 0aconcentration index 0atranslocation factor, phytoextraction1 aSingh, Rana P.0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 14, no. 8 p.772-785dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2011.619238  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013200172300001400304520155600318592002801874653001901902653002801921653002301949700002301972700002901995773010402024856008402128852000902212655001202221IND60603435020221119022335.0180716e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060343502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrost, Stephen R.10aEarly Pliocene Cercopithecidae from Woranso-Mille (Central Afar, Ethiopia) and the origins of the Theropithecus oswaldi lineage  ap. 39-53.  aA large series of fossil cercopithecids has been recovered from the hominid-bearing Woranso-Mille site, Afar State, northeastern Ethiopia. Here we report the taxonomy of those specimens from the Am-Ado, Aralee Issie, Korsi Dora, Makah Mera, and Mesgid Dora collection areas, which are all roughly contemporaneous and dated to between 3.6 and 3.8 million years ago. This series includes a minimum of two cercopithecine and three colobine species. Theropithecus oswaldi cf. darti is by far the most common species in the assemblage, making up over 90% of identifiable cercopithecid specimens. There is also at least one other species of papionin, which cannot be currently assigned to a genus. The colobines are here allocated to Cercopithecoides cf. meaveae and two other species, one small and one large, that cannot be currently assigned to genus.The T. oswaldi cf. darti series from Woranso-Mille is both the earliest and largest identified to date. It documents the earliest occurrence of the T. oswaldi lineage and strongly suggests that parallel evolution of molar morphology has occurred within the genus between T. oswaldi and Theropithecus brumpti. Given the dominance of monkeys at Woranso-Mille, and the preponderance of Theropithecus among cercopithecids, T. o. cf. darti is likely to be the most common mammal present at the 3.6–3.8 million-years-old localities of the Woranso-Mille study area.

The respiration rates were measured at 15, 28, and 42 °C by NADH, succinate, and malate oxidation. NADH was shown to act as an efficient substrate regardless of the temperature. The structural organization of functional mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes was studied using blue native PAGE and in-gel activity staining. In both species, almost 90% of the total complex I was assembled into supercomplexes, and P. edulis contained a greater amount of complex-I-comprising supercomplexes than B. oldhamii. Approximately 50% of complex III and 75% of complex V were included in supercomplexes, whereas P. edulis mitochondria possessed a greater amount of complex-V-comprising supercomplexes. The alternative oxidase (AOX), plant mitochondrial uncoupling protein (PUCP), plant mitochondrial potassium channel (PmitoKATP), rotenone-insensitive external/internal NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase [NDH(e/i)], and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities of the energy-dissipating systems were investigated. P. edulis mitochondria had higher levels of the PUCP1 and AOX1 proteins than B. oldhamii mitochondria. The activity of PmitoKATP in P. edulis was higher than that in B. oldhamii. However, P. edulis mitochondria possessed lower NDH(e/i) and SOD activities than B. oldhamii mitochondria. The results suggest that the adaptation of P. edulis to a cooler environment may correlate with its greater abundance of functional mitochondrial supercomplexes and the higher energy-dissipating capacity of its AOX, PUCP and PmitoKATP relative to B. oldhamii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBambusa oldhamii 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3abamboos 3aenergy metabolism 3amalates 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3aplant physiology 3apotassium channels 3asuccinic acid 3asummer 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3awinter1 aWu, Yuan-Chin1 aChen, Hui-Ping0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2011 Apr., v. 49, no. 4 p.449-457dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245006700175300001800242520102700260592002801287650002201315650002401337650001301361650001501374650001401389650001801403650002501421650001101446650001301457653001501470653002801485653002601513700002801539700002001567700002101587700001801608773012601626856008501752852000901837655001201846IND60671371420221122112853.0191003e20191117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067137142DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14705142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Beatriz T.10aMarine natural flavonoids: chemistry and biological activities  ap. 3260-3272.  aAs more than 70% of the world’s surface is covered by oceans, marine organisms offer a rich and unlimited resource of structurally diverse bioactive compounds. These organisms have developed unique properties and bioactive compounds that are, in majority of them, unparalleled by their terrestrial counterparts due to the different surrounding ecological systems. Marine flavonoids have been extensively studied in the last decades due to a growing interest concerning their promising biological/pharmacological activities. The most common classes of marine flavonoids are flavones and flavonols, which are mostly isolated from marine plants. Although most of flavonoids are hydroxylated and methoxylated, some marine flavonoids possess an unusual substitution pattern, not commonly found in terrestrial organisms, namely the presence of sulphate, chlorine, and amino groups. This review presents, for the first time in a systematic way, the structure, natural occurrence, and biological activities of marine flavonoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3abioactive compounds 3achlorine 3aecosystems 3aflavonols 3ahydroxylation 3amedicinal properties 3aoceans 3asulfates 0aFlavonoids 0amarine natural products 0abiological activities1 aCorreia da Silva, Marta1 aPinto, Madalena1 aCidade, Honorina1 aKijjoa, Anake0 tNatural product research.g2019 Nov. 17, v. 33, no. 22 p.3260-3272dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2018.14705143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01253naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245007900180300001400259500001900273500000900292520022800301592002800529650001300557650000900570650001200579650001500591650000900606650000900615700001700624700001900641700001700660773012000677856009700797852000900894655001200903IND60663532520221120080128.0191122e196103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066353252DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1961.00021962005300020002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrunes, D.

Despite broad recognition that cultural eutrophication may exacerbate nearshore bloom events, the association is typically not linear and is often difficult to quantify. Off the Gulf Coast of Florida, Karenia brevis blooms initiate in the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and advection of cells supplies nearshore blooms. However, past work has struggled to describe the relationship between terrestrial nutrient runoff and bloom maintenance near the Gulf Coast. This study applied a novel nonlinear time series (NLTS) analytical framework to investigate whether nearshore bloom dynamics observed near Charlotte Harbor, FL were causally and systematically driven by terrestrially sourced inputs of nitrogen, phosphorus, and freshwater between 2012 and 2018. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) isolated low-dimensional, deterministic signals in K. brevis log₁₀-density dynamics and in the dynamics of nine of 10 candidate drivers. The predominantly seasonal K. brevis signal was strong, explaining 77.6% of the total variance in the observed time series. Causal tests with convergent cross-mapping provided evidence that nitrogen concentrations measured at the discharge point of the Caloosahatchee River systematically influenced K. brevis bloom dynamics. However, further causal testing failed to link these nitrogen dynamics to an upstream basin, possibly due to data limitations. The results support the hypothesis that anthropogenic nitrogen runoff facilitated the growth of K. brevis blooms near Charlotte Harbor and suggest that bloom events would be mitigated by nitrogen source and transport controls within the Caloosahatchee and/or Kissimmee River basins. More broadly, this work demonstrates that management-relevant causal inferences into the drivers of HABs may be drawn from available monitoring records.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKarenia brevis 3aadvection 3aalgal blooms 3abasins 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3apoisonous algae 3apublic health 3arivers 3arunoff 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awatersheds 3aFlorida 3aGulf of Mexico 0aRed tides 0aCultural eutrophication 0aWater quality 0aNonlinear time series analysis 0aCausal networks 0aLake Okeechobee 0aCCM 0aNLTS 0aSSA1 aHuffaker, Ray1 aJawitz, James W.1 aMuñoz Carpena, Rafael,0 tHarmful algae.g2020 Sept., v. 98 p.101900-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2020.1019003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010800170300001600278520121100294592002801505650002201533650001801555650002501573650001701598650001801615650002301633650001901656650002201675650002401697650001701721650002301738653002501761653000701786653000701793653002601800653001901826700001901845700001801864700001901882700002701901773011001928856008502038852000902123655001202132IND60085527320221120141342.0161024e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008552732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2013.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Firas12aA molecular chromatographic approach to study the effects of OH and NO on acetylcholinesterase activity  ap. 136-140.  aAcetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Here, the effects of hydroxyl radical (OH) and nitric oxide (NO) on AChE activity were studied using a biochromatographic process. The enzyme was immobilized on an ethylenediamine (EDA) monolithic convective interaction media (CIM) disk. The AChE enzymatic mechanism was demonstrated from the chromatographic peak shape. A decrease in AChE activity was observed for each concentration of NO, while OH radical formation led to an increase in the rate of enzymatic catalysis. Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk plots were obtained in the presence or absence of the free radicals and their effects on Km and Vmax were evaluated. Our results indicated classical deactivation/activation kinetics without significant influence on the rate of substrate binding. The variation in transition state energies (ΔΔGES) induced by the free radicals indicated that a conformational change was occurring in the active site, while changes in the binding site were negligible. These results clearly demonstrate the direct role of OH and NO on AChE activity and confirm the role they may play in Alzheimer's disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive sites 3abinding sites 3acatalytic activity 3achromatography 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aimmobilized enzymes 3anitric oxide 3aserine proteinases 0aAcetylcholinesterase 0aNO 0aOH 0aLiquid chromatography 0aThermodynamics1 aAndré, Claire1 aAljhni, Rania1 aGharbi, Tijani1 aGuillaume, Yves Claude0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

Olives and brine samples were taken at different fermentation times, and yeast were enumerated by standard plate count and identified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the most frequent, followed by Candida tropicalis, Pichia membranifaciens and Candida boidini, representing together 94.8% of the total isolates. Galactomyces reessii was also identified for the first time in table olives. The highest species diversity was found between 44 and 54 days of fermentation, both in brine and olive pulp. Furthermore, high similarity was observed between brine and olive pulp microbiotas. In conclusion, these results give valuable information to table olive industrials in order to achieve more knowledge on the fermentation process of this important Protected Designation of Origin product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida tropicalis 3aGalactomyces 3aPichia membranifaciens 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afermentation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aolive pulp 3aolives 3aplate count 3apopulation dynamics 3aprotected designation of origin 3aribosomal DNA 3aspecies diversity 3ayeasts 0aYeasts 0aBrine 0aOlive pulp 0aDiversity1 aRamalhosa, Elsa1 aBorges, Ana1 aPereira, José A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2260-06001 aBaptista, Paula0 tFood microbiology.g2015 Apr., v. 46 p.582-586dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009200163300001200255520201600267592002802283650001702311650002302328650002302351650001602374650001902390650001002409650001402419650002002433650001802453650001602471650001702487650001902504650002702523650001102550650001902561650002802580650000902608650002202617700001602639700001602655700001502671700001202686700001502698700001502713773009002728856008102818852000902899655001202908IND60574757620221121153233.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057475762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-017-1918-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, L.

Mining the genes for grain yield under low temperatures and elucidating the genetic mechanism is a key approach to breeding improved-yield crops. In this study, we generated 190 recombinant inbred lines with 155 SSR markers from a cross between Dongnong422 (a low-temperature-sensitive variety) and Kongyu131 (a low-temperature-tolerant variety). These lines were employed for linkage mapping for yield-component traits under low water temperature and control conditions in two consecutive years. As a result, 18 addition QTLs (A-QTLs) were detected using ICIM, other two analytical methods, CIM (22 A-QTLs) and MICM (8 A-QTLs) were used to demonstrate QTLs ICIM has detected, which showed that all three analytical methods gave a consistency in result. Among these QTLs, 17 QTLs (35.4%) were detected simultaneously under both cold-water-irrigated and control conditions, and these QTLs were most influential (adaptive effect) under the cold-water treatment. Five pleiotropic genomic regions controlling yield were mapped on chromosomes 6, 7, 8 and 11. Among these regions, one of the major regions located, the marker interval RM1306–RM70, was repeatedly detected for panicle length, grains per panicle, primary branch number, secondary branch number and grain density under low-water temperature and control conditions based on three analysis models. Multiple-environment joint analysis showed that nine A-QTLs were detected for seven traits. Thirteen pairs of epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) were detected for seven traits, but for yield per plant, only seven pairs had significant environmental specificity. The QTLs detected using three analytical models under different environments showed that it is possible to use molecular breeding for cold tolerance, and the markers linked to the QTLs of stable expression could be applied to rice yield improvement in low temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aanalytical methods 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acold tolerance 3acrops 3aepistasis 3agenetic markers 3agenome mining 3agrain yield 3ainbred lines 3ainflorescences 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3awater temperature1 aZhao, H.

Oxygen-sensing technology, based on the principle of fluorescence quenching to detect oxygen and assess seed quality was used to rapidly evaluate seed quality of two varieties (Shandong Tancheng 202 and Zhejiang Dafoshou) of G. biloba from five mother plants. Fifteen samples of three vigor levels were produced by accelerated aging treatments. This process was applied in duplicate. A portable oxygen-sensing detector was employed to measure oxygen content during seed germination in a closed system at 25 °C each day until day 14. Four oxygen metabolism indices were calculated: oxygen consumption index, oxygen consumption rate, critical oxygen concentration, and theoretical germination time (T GT). Additionally, we tested laboratory germination and field emergence. The results of a one-way analysis of variance and correlation analysis showed that T GT was the candidate index to evaluate seed quality of G. biloba. Therefore, the T GT value was used to validate the reliability of oxygen-sensing evaluation for Zhejiang Dafoshou seeds kept under four storage conditions. The trend in the change in oxygen metabolism agreed completely agreement with that of seed germination under all storage conditions. The oxygen-sensing test reliably and rapidly assessed seed quality of G. biloba. The germination rate of Zhejiang Dafoshou was accurately predicted by T GT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo biloba 3aaccelerated aging 3aanalysis of variance 3acorrelation 3afluorescence 3alabor 3ametabolism 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aseed germination 3aseed quality 3aseeds 3astorage conditions 3avigor 3aChina1 aZhao, Guangwu0 tJournal of forestry research.g2017 July, v. 28, no. 4 p.725-731dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-016-0351-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015300171300001400324520114200338592002801480650002701508650002101535650002101556650001101577650001801588650002301606650002001629650002401649650001701673650002201690653002601712653002401738653001201762653001601774653001501790700002301805700002501828773010801853856008501961852000902046655001202055IND60085527620221120141132.0161024e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008552762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2013.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlftrén, Johan10aIn vivo biotinylation of recombinant beta-glucosidase enables simultaneous purification and immobilization on streptavidin coated magnetic particles  ap. 29-35.  aBeta-glucosidase from Bacillus licheniformis was in vivo biotinylated in Escherichia coli and subsequently immobilized directly from cell lysate on streptavidin coated magnetic particles. In vivo biotinylation was mediated by fusing the Biotin Acceptor Peptide to the C-terminal of beta-glucosidase and co-expressing the BirA biotin ligase. The approach enabled simultaneous purification and immobilization of the enzyme from crude cell lysate on magnetic particles because of the high affinity and strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin. After immobilization of the biotinylated beta-glucosidase the specific activity (using p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside as substrate) was increased 6.5 fold (compared to cell lysate). Immobilization of the enzyme resulted in improved thermal stability compared to free enzyme; after 2h of incubation (at 50°C) the residual enzyme activity of immobilized and free beta-glucosidase was 67 and 13%, respectively. The recyclability of immobilized beta-glucosidase was examined and it was observed that the enzyme could be recycled at least 9 times and retain 89% of its initial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aEscherichia coli 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiotin 3abiotinylation 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme activity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3astreptavidin 3athermal stability 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aBiotin-streptavidin 0aRecycle 0aBiorefinery 0aBioethanol1 aOttow, Kim Ekelund1 aHobley, Timothy John0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

A possibility is to use supplementary cementitious materials and recycled aggregates. Therefore, the objective of this work is to compare the environmental impacts (EI) of concrete mixes, which contain different incorporation ratios of fly ash (FA) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), with and without Superplasticizer (SP). The Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used for environmental assessment, according to ISO 14040 (2006) and EN 15804 (2012). Contrary to most of the previous studies, this one separately obtained the impact for each life cycle stage in detail (e.g. the impact of raw materials production, transportation, and mixing procedure), and explains the reason behind selecting each dataset. Thus, the results of this study can be used for other case studies. The results show that the EI slightly increased when SP was used. Moreover, the incorporation ratio of fine RCA did not change the results for most of the EI categories. Nevertheless, the EI of most of the categories decreased when coarse NA was fully replaced with coarse RCA. Despite the long transportation distance between the coal power plant and the concrete plant considered in the case study, the EI significantly decreased in most categories with increasing amounts of FA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoal 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3adata collection 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afly ash 3alife cycle assessment 3amixing 3apower plants 3araw materials 3atransportation 0aADP 0aAP 0aCDW 0aEI 0aEP 0aEPD 0aFA 0aGWP 0aLCA 0aNA 0aOPC 0aPE-NRe 0aPOCP 0aRCA 0aSCM 0aSP 0aSustainability 0aConcrete 0aRecycled concrete aggregates 0aFly ash 0aLife Cycle Assessment1 aSilvestre, José D.1 aBrito, Jorge de,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6766-27360 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2018 Dec., v. 139 p.407-417dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245013600156300001800292500001100310520177400321592002802095650001502123650002002138650002602158650001402184650001302198650001102211650001802222650001202240650002102252650001502273650005002288650001402338650001702352650002102369700001702390700001402407700001902421773013702440856007202577852000902649655001202658IND60623906920221120025048.0181129e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062390692DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.42532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUtembe, Wells13aAn assessment of applicability of existing approaches to predicting the bioaccumulation of conventional substances in nanomaterials  ap. 2972-2988.  aREVIEW  aThe experimental determination of bioaccumulation is challenging, and a number of approaches have been developed for its prediction. It is important to assess the applicability of these predictive approaches to nanomaterials (NMs), which have been shown to bioaccumulate. The octanol/water partition coefficient (KOW) may not be applicable to some NMs that are not found in either the octanol or water phases but rather are found at the interface. Thus the KOW values obtained for certain NMs are shown not to correlate well with the experimentally determined bioaccumulation. Implementation of quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) for NMs is also challenging because the bioaccumulation of NMs depends on nano‐specific properties such as shape, size, and surface area. Thus there is a need to develop new QSAR models based on these new nanodescriptors; current efforts appear to focus on digital processing of NM images as well as the conversion of surface chemistry parameters into adsorption indices. Water solubility can be used as a screening tool for the exclusion of NMs with short half‐lives. Adaptation of fugacity/aquivalence models, which include physicochemical properties, may give some insights into the bioaccumulation potential of NMs, especially with the addition of a biota component. The use of kinetic models, including physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, appears to be the most suitable approach for predicting bioaccumulation of NMs. Furthermore, because bioaccumulation of NMs depends on a number of biotic and abiotic factors, it is important to take these factors into account when one is modeling bioaccumulation and interpreting bioaccumulation results.

Since then, usnic acid and its sodium salt (sodium usnic acid) have been used in medicine, perfumery, cosmetics, and other industries due to its extensive biological activities. However, its acaricidal activity has not been studied. In this paper, we investigated the acaricidal activity of usnic acid and sodium usnic acid against Psoroptes cuniculi in vitro. After evaluating the acaricidal activity and toxicity of usnic acid and sodium usnic acid in vitro, the results showed that at doses of 250, 125, and 62.5 mg/ml, usnic acid and sodium usnic acid can kill mites with 91.67, 85.00, and 55.00 % and 100, 100, and 60.00 % mortality after treatment 24 h. The LT₅₀ values were 4.208, 8.249, and 16.950 h and 3.712, 7.339, and 15.773 h for usnic acid and sodium usnic acid, respectively. Sodium usnic acid has a higher acaricidal activity than usnic acid, which may be related to the difference in their structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsoroptes cuniculi 3aacaricidal properties 3acosmetics 3aindustry 3alichens 3amedicine 3amites 3amortality 3asodium 3atoxicity 3ausnic acid 2aAcaricidesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBenzofuransxadministration & dosagexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHeterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ringxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPsoroptidaexdrug effects1 aMiao, Xiaolou1 aLv, Huiping1 aWang, Dongsheng1 aZhang, Jiqin1 aHe, Hua1 aYang, Zhiqiang1 aPan, Hu0 tParasitology research.g2014 June, v. 113, no. 6 p.2387-2390dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-3910-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245006800166300001800234520179600252592002802048650001502076650001102091650001302102650001102115650000902126650001102135650002202146650001602168653001602184653001102200653001302211653001502224700002102239773015602260856008002416852000902496655001202505IND60522716020221120153342.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052271602DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1984-11-12162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranck, Fabrice10aFlash Pattern of Oxygen Evolution in Greening Etioplasts of Oat  ap. 1091-1096.  aEtioplasts isolated from oat leaves that have received two 5 min illumination periods, spaced apart by a 90 min dark interval, are able to evolve oxygen. If this oxygen evolution is measured as consequence of short saturating light flashes a pattern is obtained which in agreement with the Kok-Joliot model shows a damped oscillation with a periodicity of four. As usual for most other systems the maximum flash yield is observed under the third flash. In continuous light such slightly greened etioplasts show a small oxygen gush. From our studies it appears that the second 5 min illumination period is obligatory for oxygen evolution. Omission of this period leads to a condition in which under flashes strictly no oxygen is evolved. In continuous light under these conditions no oxygen gush but rather an uptake is observed after onset of illumination. It appears that in greening etioplasts the flash pattern shows some peculiarities when compared to the normal green conditions. Thus, a flash sequence of a greening etioplast always shows a substantial positive amperometric signal under the first flash. The half time of the state which would belong to this signal is 3 to 4 min in a greening etioplast, isolated from leaves that have received 2 h light. In the course of greening this half time decreases continuously and reaches a normal and constant value of approx. 10 s in chloroplasts from green oat or etiochloroplasts that are prepared from leaves that have received 15 h of light. The result is discussed in terms of metastable S₃ which seems to be a property of the developing oxygen evolving system in greening oat leaves. In the greening system as we use it is shown for the first time that the photoenzyme protochlorophyllide chlorophyllide reductase is DCMU sensitive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aetioplasts 3aleaves 3alighting 3amodels 3aoats 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aperiodicity 0aFlash Yield 0aOxygen 0aS-States 0aEtioplasts1 aSchmid, Georg H.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 39, no. 11-12 p.1091-1096dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1984-11-12163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010100167300001800268520185200286592002802138650002702166650002102193650001202214650001802226650001302244650001302257650002302270650001102293650002202304650001602326650001902342650002202361650002102383653001702404653001902421653001802440653002302458700001802481773015602499856008002655852000902735655001202744IND60522716120221120153924.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052271612DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1984-11-12172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPistorius, E. K.10aStudies on the O2 Evolution under Flash Light Illumination in Preparations of Anacystis nidulans  ap. 1097-1103.  aThe O₂ yield under flash light illumination in preparations of Anacystis nidulans was examined in the presence of redox components such as ferricyanide and ferrocyanide. When ferricyanide (1 mᴍ) was added to the lyophilized, lysozyme treated and EDTA washed cells of A. nidulans the familiar Joliot-Kok oscillalion with maximum on the third flash and periodicity of four was observed (in the presence of added CaCl₂ and MnCl₂). However, when the ferricyanide con­centration was increased to about 8 mᴍ , a reduction of the O₂ evolution under flash illumination was observed, and an O₂ uptake could clearly be seen under the first and second flash. This O₂ uptake was inhibited by DCMU and o-phenanthroline, but was not influenced by KCN or salicylhydroxamic acid. As ferrocyanide was progressively added to 1 mᴍ ferricyanide, the oscillations faded out and the steady-state O₂ evolution decreased. Light would progressively increase the O₂ evolution and reduce the damping of the oscillations. Two patterns of O₂ evolution under short saturating light flashes were observed with these Anacystis preparations on first illumination in the presence of cations but in the absence of ferricyanide. One pattern corresponded to the typical pattern which has been repeatedly described in the literature, but the second pattern gave the indication of an initial “over-reduced” state of the photosystem II reaction center. With suitable procedures the two patterns were interchangeable. Moreover, the effect of ʟ-arginine on the flash pattern was examined. The results are discussed in connection with the possible dual function of the previously described flavin protein as an ʟ-amino acid oxidase and as a component of the O₂ evolving reaction center (E. K. Pistorius and H. Voss, Eur. J. Biochemistry 126,203-209 (1982)).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3acalcium chloride 3acations 3afreeze drying 3alighting 3alysozyme 3amanganese chloride 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aperiodicity 3aphotosystem II 3apotassium cyanide 3asuperoxide anion 0aO2 Evolution 0aPhotosystem II 0aCyanobacteria 0aAnacystis nidulans1 aSchmid, G.

Here we seek to understand how abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change can affect plant-herbivore interactions in a model crop species (soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr.) by answering three questions: (1) Do the combined effects of abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change cause synergistic negative effects on plant biomass? (2) Can abiotic stress affect resistance of plants to insect herbivores? (3) Does genetic variation in plant traits modify a plant’s response to stress? We performed three experiments in controlled growth environments using up to 51 soybean genotypes selected to vary in numerous traits associated with drought and resistance against pests (e.g., insect herbivores, nematodes, and pathogenic fungi), and up to 3 generalist-feeding herbivorous noctuid moth species (Helicoverpa zea, Heliothis virescens, and Spodoptera exigua) that commonly feed on soybean in North America. Drought and herbivory had the largest and the most consistent negative effects on plant performance, reducing the above- and below-ground biomass by 10-45 %, whereas increased temperature had little to no effect on plants. Drought also increased susceptibility to generalist noctuid herbivores, but these results varied dramatically in magnitude and direction among plant genotypes. Our experiments show that the effects of abiotic and biotic stress on soybean biomass were largely due to the additive effects of these stresses, and there exists substantial genetic variation in the soybean germplasm pool we studied that could be used as a source of parental stock in breeding new crops that can more effectively tolerate and resist the combined negative effects of insect herbivory and drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aHeliothis virescens 3aNematoda 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aabiotic stress 3abelowground biomass 3abiotic stress 3aclimate change 3adrought 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ainsect pests 3amoths 3aphytomass 3asoybeans 3astress response 3atemperature 3aNorth America1 aCarter, Thomas E., Jr.cJr.1 aJohnson, Marc T.

Cows were equipped with global positioning collars that recorded position, temperature and head movements at 5-min intervals during 6 days in each of four seasons repeated during 2 years. The time animals took to traverse areas of varying diameter revealed patches of 6–9-m diameter in the pastures with low, and 18–21-m diameter in the pastures with high tree canopy cover. In agreement with the current model, crookedness of cow paths had two distinct domains. Within distances of 0–40 m, paths were relatively straight and similar, but from 40 to 200 m, they became increasingly tortuous. Correlation of sequential turning angles identified patches of movement with diameters between 40 and 100 m, which correspond to the ‘patch’ level of grazing within grazing sites. Seasonal changes in meal patterns were consistent with changes in temperature and forage quality and interacted with the distribution of shade. Thus, spatial distribution of grazing and temporal distribution of meals were inextricably linked. Low forage quality and high temperatures in summer resulted in highly concentrated grazing around trees. Conversely, winter and early spring forages of very high quality and low availability motivated more widely distributed grazing, with low proportion of areas being re-grazed. Resting sites acted as beginning and end of grazing bouts. We conclude that shade distribution can modulate meal start and duration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acollars 3acows 3aforage quality 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3ahead 3amodels 3apastures 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3awinter 3aCalifornia 0aanimal movement 0afractals 0alivestock behaviour1 aGeorge, M.

Some of the yeasts are considered harmful as they can damage the quality of the olive oil through the hydrolysis of the triacylglycerols. Present research has demonstrated that the lipolytic activity of some lipase-producer strains belonging to a yeast species called Candida adriatica, Candida diddensiae and Yamadazyma terventina can be modulated by the water and the polyphenol content of olive oil. Laboratory tests highlighted a substantial increase in free fatty acid in the inoculated olive oil characterized by high water content and low polyphenol concentration. The acidity of the olive oil samples containing 0.06% and 0.31% of water increased significantly by 33% in the lipase-producer yeast strains tested during a period of 2 weeks of incubation at 30 °C. All other yeasts showed strong lipolytic activity in the presence of 1.31% of water – the only exception to this was the C. adriatica 1985 strain. The phenolic compounds typical of olive oil represent another important factor able to condition the viability and the lipolytic activity of the lipase-producer yeasts. From the tests performed on the olive oil characterized by an increasing content of total polyphenols equal to 84, 150 and 510 mg per kg of oil, the percentage of the lipase-producer yeasts able to hydrolyse the triacylglycerols was respectively 100%, 67% and 11%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aacidity 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afree fatty acids 3ahydrolysis 3alaboratory experimentation 3alipolysis 3apolyphenols 3atriacylglycerols 3aviability 3awater content 3ayeasts 0aExtra-virgin olive oil 0aOlive oil acidity 0aPolyphenols 0aYeast 0aWater content in olive oil1 aZullo, B.A.0 tFood microbiology.g2015 May, v. 47 p.12-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2014.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245010000212300001400312520161500326592002801941650001901969650001501988650001502003650001102018650002202029650001602051650002102067650001902088650002002107650001502127651001102142653003402153653001902187653001802206653001902224653001302243653001102256700002702267773011802294856008702412852000902499655001202508IND60611189020221116164336.0180830e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061118902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKisakye, Violet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7162-478010aEffects of climate change on water savings and water security from rainwater harvesting systems  ap. 49-63.  aClimate change presents major uncertainties in future safe water access especially in rural communities that are already faced with water insecurity. For Uganda, rainwater harvesting has become a major adaptation strategy to ensure the attainment of safe water access for all. However, climate change effects on rainwater harvesting potential remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper assesses climate change effects on water savings and water security from rainwater harvesting systems for Kabarole district, Uganda. The top performing Global circulation models (GCMs), used in this study included; MIROC5, BCC-CSM-1-M, CNRM-CM5, ACCESS1-0, HADGEM2-ES and HADGEM2-CC using projections for 2025–2055 (2040s) and 2060–2090 (2070s) periods. Seasonal analysis used the 4 seasons for Uganda, namely; the 2 dry seasons of December, January, February (DJF) and June, July, August (JJA) and the 2 rainy seasons of September, October, November (SON) and March, April, May (MAM). Although there are conflicting model predictions, generally, the models agree that water savings and security will reduce in DJF and MAM and increase in JJA and SON seasons. MAM rain season will be most affected with water savings and security projected to reduce by more than 50% in the 2070s period. Therefore, households should harness the increased water savings in JJA and SON to cater for the predicted reduction in water savings in MAM and DJF seasons especially for the 2070s period. A larger tank of 5 m³ along with at least 50 m² roof size combined with a low cost household water treatment is thus recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adry season 3ahouseholds 3amodels 3arural communities 3auncertainty 3awater harvesting 3awater security 3awater treatment 3awet season 3aUganda 0aDomestic rainwater harvesting 0aWater security 0aWater savings 0aClimate change 0aKabarole 0aUganda1 aBruggen, Bart van der,0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2018 Nov., v. 138 p.49-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013000166300001800296500001900314520151800333592002801851650000801879650001501887650002201902650002301924650001901947650001601966650001901982650001202001650001502013650001502028650002302043650001002066650001602076650001702092650001802109650001702127650001102144650001102155650001002166650001302176650001902189650001402208650001302222650001402235650001502249651001202264700001702276700001802293700001902311700001802330700002202348700001902370700002602389700002202415773013502437856004802572852000902620655001202629IND50066244320221122031624.0130507e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006624432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1322-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrifa, Mounira10aHuman cell death in relation to DNA damage after exposure to the untreated and biologically treated pharmaceutical wastewater  ap. 3836-3842.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmong all the pharmaceutical drugs that contaminate the environment, antibiotics occupy an important place due to their high consumption rates in both veterinary and human medicine. The present study examined the ability of Pseudomonas putida to grow on the antibiotic wastewater, currently expanding in Tunisia, containing amoxicillin and cefadroxil. P. putida was very efficient to grow quickly in pharmaceutical wastewater (PW) and in reducing the total dissolved solids to 80.1 %. Cytotoxicity of PW, before and after biodegradation with P. putida mt-2, was evaluated in vitro, using the MTT assay, against four human tumor cell lines such as A549 (lung cell carcinoma), HCT15 (colon cell carcinoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), and U373 (glioma cell carcinoma). The PW reduced all human cell lines viability in a dose-dependent manner. This activity was very remarkable against U373 cell line. For this reason, we have tested the genotoxicity of PW using comet assay for quantification of DNA fragmentation. In fact, PW has statistically significant (p < 0.001) influence on DNA. Indeed, the percentage of genotoxicity was 66.87 and 87.5 %, after 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively. However, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity decreased strongly when tested the PW obtained after incubation with P. putida mt-2. Our results indicate that P. putida is a promising and improved alternative to treating industrial-scale effluent compared to current chemical treatment procedures used by the industrials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA fragmentation 3aPseudomonas putida 3aadenocarcinoma 3aamoxicillin 3abiodegradation 3abreasts 3acefadroxil 3acell death 3achemical treatment 3acolon 3acomet assay 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3agenotoxicity 3aglioma 3ahumans 3alungs 3amedicine 3aneoplasm cells 3apollution 3aresearch 3aviability 3awastewater 3aTunisia1 aDellai, Afef1 aBouhlel, Ines1 aRobert, Jacque1 aCherif, Ameur1 aBarillier, Daniel1 aMosrati, Ridha1 aChekir-Ghedira, Leila1 aBen Mansour, Hedi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 June, v. 20, no. 6 p.3836-3842dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1322-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245009900174300001800273500001900291500000900310520153600319592002801855650002301883650001901906650001301925650002101938650002501959650001601984650001102000650001602011650001502027650001502042650001702057650002102074650001902095650000802114650002302122650001402145650001702159650001702176650001502193650001002208651001202218700002102230700002902251773012502280856008402405852000902489655001202498IND60663533420221121015521.0191226e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066353342DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2000.9251000x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyakatawa, Ermson Z.10aTillage, Cover Cropping, and Poultry Litter Effects on Cotton: II. Growth and Yield Parameters  ap. 1000-1007.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aThe development of conservation tillage systems for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), capable of reducing soil erosion and improving soil quality while increasing yields and profits, remains a challenge in the southeastern USA. Poor emergence and growth, delayed maturity, and reduced yield are some of the problems that have been encountered in the use of conservation tillage on cotton. The objectives of this study was to evaluate the effects of tillage (no-till, mulch-till, conventional till), cropping system [cotton–winter fallow, cotton–winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop] and N source (poultry litter, ammonium nitrate) on growth and yield of cotton from 1996 to 1998 in northern Alabama. In 1997, cotton lint yield under no-till (NT) was 24 and 18% greater than that under conventional till (CT) and mulch-till (MT) systems, respectively. In 1998, cotton lint yield under the NT system was 7% greater than that under CT. Poultry litter (PL) at 100 kg N ha⁻¹ gave similar lint yield to ammonium nitrate (AN), whereas at 200 kg N ha⁻¹, lint yields were significantly greater. No-till, cotton–winter rye cropping, and surface application of 200 kg N ha⁻¹ in form of PL conserved soil moisture in the top 7 cm of the soil. This resulted in early seedling emergence, high seedling vigor, good plant growth, and high lint yield of cotton. These treatments would be appropriate for use in the southeastern USA where soil erosion is a problem and plenty of PL is available each year from the poultry industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aSecale cereale 3aagronomy 3aammonium nitrate 3aconventional tillage 3acover crops 3afallow 3alint cotton 3alint yield 3ano-tillage 3aplant growth 3apoultry industry 3apoultry manure 3arye 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3asoil erosion 3asoil quality 3asoil water 3avigor 3aAlabama1 aReddy, K.Chandra1 aMays, D.

They constitute the first postcrania ever described of Ouranopithecus macedoniensis (Primates, Hominoidea) from the late Miocene locality of Ravin de la Pluie (RPl), Macedonia (Greece). They are isolated specimens, and the only ones known for their genus. The hypotheses that these specimens derive either from the hand or from the foot were tested. Comparisons with living apes of known positional behaviour were made to assess the functional signal in these specimens. The proximal phalanx, either manual or pedal, closely matches the proximal phalanges of terrestrial quadrupedal primates or the bipedal primate Homo. With respect to the intermediate phalanx we show that it closely matches phalanges of quadrupedal terrestrial primates. The terrestriality of Ouranopithecus, here reconstructed from phalangeal remains, is in agreement with our previous results of dental studies (thick check teeth enamel and microwear pattern of incisors and molars), which indicate that it was a hard object feeder living near the ground.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPhalanges 0aHands and feet 0aPositional behaviour 0aBipedalism 0aTerrestrial quadrupedalism 0aHominid origins1 aKoufos, George D.0 tJournal of human evolution.g2014 Sept., v. 74 p.21-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:26743x0047-24847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245007800179300001600257500001900273500000900292520153000301592002801831650001601859650001301875650001701888650002801905650001001933650000901943650001401952650001201966650000901978650001301987650001302000700001802013773012202031856009702153852000902250655001202259IND60663533520221121015229.0191122e198011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066353352DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200060009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, J.

The objective of this study was to determine the nature or mode of inheritance of Mn tolerance in soybeans. Test plants were Forrest (Mn-intolerant, Fe-inefficient), T203 (Mn-tolerant, Fe-inefficient) and their F₂ progeny Forrest ∗ T203 (F∗T) and T203 ∗ Forrest (T∗F); and Bragg (Mn-intolerant, Fe-efficient), Lee (Mn-tolerant, mod. Fe efficient) and their F₂ progeny, Bragg ∗ Lee (B∗L), and Lee ∗ Bragg (L∗B). The plants were grown in Mn-toxic soil and in nutrient solutions containing 0.35 and 0.65 mg Mn/liter. Only T203 did not develop some Mn-toxicity symptoms under conditions of relatively high Mn. The order of symptom severity was Forrest ≥ Bragg > Lee > T203. Manganese toxicity symptoms also varied among the F₂ progeny of reciprocal crosses. The leaves of both parents and progenies contained about 500 mg Mn/g dry matter. Some factor(s) other than Mn concentration in the plants appeared to cause the Mn-toxicity symptoms. The Fe concentration in plant tops was related somewhat to Mn-toxicity symptoms in that the Fe concentrations were usually greater in Mn-intolerant than in Mn-tolerant genotypes. Control of tolerance to excess Mn appeared to be multgenic rather than controlled by a single gene locus. Reciprocal differences in progeny suggested that cytoplasmic inheritance influenced Mn tolerance. Crop failure can be avoided by selecting a Mn-tolerant soybean to be grown in a soil relatively high in available Mn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aagronomy 3acrop failure 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3agenes 3aloci 3amanganese 3aprogeny 3asoil 3asoybeans 3atoxicity1 aDevine, T.

To better understand factors affecting prey distribution in Thailand’s Western Forest Complex (WEFCOM), we conducted sign surveys for gaur (Bos gaurus), banteng (Bos javanicus), and sambar (Rusa unicolor) along 3517 1-km transects and used occupancy models to identify important covariates associated with habitat use by each species. Habitat use by both gaur and sambar was lowest in areas closest to human settlements, although sambar preferred lower slopes near streams whereas gaur preferred steeper slopes at higher elevations. Banteng were found in only one of 17 protected areas (Huai Kha Khaeng [HKK] Wildlife Sanctuary), where they used low elevations and low slopes. We used these modeled relationships to predict occurrence of gaur, sambar, and banteng across each square km of the 19,000 km² WEFCOM landscape, using > 60 % occupancy probability to define suitable habitat use for each species. Based on this criterion, gaur and sambar occupied 28 and 50 % of suitable habitat in WEFCOM, and banteng occupied 57 % of suitable habitat in HKK. We used our models to assess the effectiveness of two hypothetical conservation initiatives. First, we modeled the impact of decreasing human activities around nine villages in the core of WEFCOM, which increased predicted suitable habitat in WEFCOM to 68 and 75 % for guar and sambar. We also modeled the extent of potential banteng habitat that still remains in the other 16 protected areas. This could result in a 4-fold increase in banteng suitable habitat in WEFCOM. This is the first study to use occupancy surveys to determine where large prey species can be restored to support management to increase the distribution of tigers, and potentially fill a half-full tiger landscape.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBos gaurus 3aBos javanicus 3aRusa unicolor 3aconservation areas 3aforests 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amithuns 3aprey species 3aprobability 3aThailand 0aBanteng 0aGaur 0aSambar 0aPanthera tigris 0aDetection probability 0aLandscape survey 0aOccupancy modeling 0aPrey restoration1 aDuangchantrasiri, Somphot1 aJinamoy, Sitthichai1 aPattanavibool, Anak1 aHines, James E.1 aArnold, Todd W.1 aFieberg, John1 aSmith, James L.D.0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2020 Dec., v. 58 p.125896-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2020.1258963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001600285520211300301592002802414650002102442650002902463650001702492650001502509650001202524650002002536650001102556650001502567650002302582650002702605650001702632650001902649650001102668650003502679651001602714651001102730651002502741651001602766651002802782700002802810700002002838700001902858773011402877856008102991852000903072655001203081IND60574896420221121194614.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057489642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-017-0393-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTóth, Endre Gy.10aEvolutionary history and phylogeography of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Europe based on molecular markers  ap. 637-651.  aIn this review we summarized recent historical records and molecular studies on evolutionary history and phylogeography of Scots pine with focus on the European highly fragmented distribution area of the species. Fossilized pollen, plant micro- and macrofossil records provided evidences on the large-scale species’ range shifts and demographic changes during the Quaternary. Populations of Scots pine were documented both in the glacial (incl. full glaciation) and interglacial periods. Recolonization of Europe after the glaciation originated from the (Sub) Mediterranean areas like the Balkan Peninsula but also from around the Eastern Alps and the surroundings of the Danube plain. Fennoscandia and northern European Baltic regions were most probably colonized from two main directions, from Western Europe and from the Russian Plain. Modern history of Scots pine was hardly affected by anthropogenic activities that started to strengthen in the Bronze and Iron Age. Along with the fossil records, molecular genetic tools were used to infer the origin and putative history including migration, differentiation and demography of the species. In this paper we compiled the major publications (30) of molecular genetic studies of the past 20 years derived from distinctly inherited organelle genomes (mitochondrial, chloroplast, nuclear) revealed by different marker systems (mtDNA-cox1, -nad1, -nad3, -nad7, ISSR, cpSSR, nSSR, B-SAP, SNP). It is important to consider that different phylogeographic patterns can be drawn by the analysis of different DNA marker types. Accordingly the use of more than one marker simultaneously outlines the most sophisticated phylogeographical pattern on the genetic lineages and can reveal high differentiation of the European distribution. Combined marker systems and markers derived from coding sequences have also been used to detect species’ phylogeographic patterns, but these were rarely applied to Scots pine. Although new molecular techniques can provide higher resolution data for populations, the reviewed results can shape the direction of further studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aanthropogenic activities 3achloroplasts 3ademography 3afossils 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3aglaciation 3ahistorical records 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3aphylogeography 3apollen 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aAlps region 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region 3aScandinavia 3aWestern European region1 aKöbölkuti, Zoltán A.1 aPedryc, Andrzej1 aHöhn, Mária,0 tJournal of forestry research.g2017 July, v. 28, no. 4 p.637-651dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-017-0393-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006900150245010200219300001400321520107800335592002801413653002201441653001901463653001701482653001601499653002501515653002201540700001801562773010501580856008401685852000901769655001201778IND60603436320221118221602.0180716e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060343632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVon Petzinger, Genevieve,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2442-397512aA place in time: Situating Chauvet within the long chronology of symbolic behavioral development  ap. 37-54.  aSince the discovery of the Grotte Chauvet (Ardèche, France) in the mid-1990s, there has been a debate regarding the accuracy of assigning this site to the Aurignacian period. The main argument stems from a perceived lack of agreement between the radiocarbon age of the imagery (>32,000 years BP [before present]) and its stylistic complexity and technical sophistication, which some believe are more typical of the later Upper Paleolithic. In this paper we first review the evidence for symbolic behavior among modern humans during the Aurignacian in order to explore the question of whether Chauvet's images are anachronistic. Then, using a database of non-figurative signs found in Paleolithic parietal art, we undertake a detailed comparison between Chauvet's corpus of signs and those found in other French Upper Paleolithic caves. While we conclude that there is substantial evidence to support an Aurignacian date for Grotte Chauvet, we also suggest that it may be time to revisit some of the cultural boundaries that are currently in use in Paleolithic archaeology.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUpper Paleolithic 0aWestern Europe 0aParietal art 0aAurignacian 0aNon-figurative signs 0aSymbolic behavior1 aNowell, April0 tJournal of human evolution.g2014 Sept., v. 74 p.37-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:26743x0047-24847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012000157300002000277520168600297592002801983650000802011650001502019650001502034650001402049650003602063650001702099650002102116650001902137650002102156650001902177650001902196650001802215650001602233700002302249700002402272700003002296700002102326700001902347700003402366700002002400700003202420773013402452856007502586852000902661655001202670IND60538926120170628000000.0160815e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053892612DNAL7 a10.1021/ja404422z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumat, Blaise10aDNA Switches on the Two-Photon Efficiency of an Ultrabright Triphenylamine Fluorescent Probe Specific of AT Regions  ap. 12697-12706.  aWe report on the design and synthesis of two-photon fluorescent triphenylamines bearing two or three vinyl branches terminated by a N-methyl benzimidazolium moiety. The new compounds (TP-2Bzim, TP-3Bzim) are light-up fluorescent DNA probes with a long wavelength emission (>580 nm). Compared to their pyridinium models, the TP-Bzim dyes exhibit a remarkable improvement of both their DNA affinity and fluorescence quantum yield, especially for the two-branch derivative (TP-2Bzim: ΦF = 0.54, Kₐ = 10⁷ M–¹), resulting in a large fluorescence emission turn-on ratio of up to 140. Concomitantly, the two-photon absorption cross-section of TP-2Bzim is dramatically enhanced upon DNA binding (δ = 1080 vs 110 GM for the free form). This effect of the DNA matrix on the nonlinear absorption is uncovered for the first time. This is attributed to a tight fit of the molecule inside the minor groove of AT-rich DNA which induces geometrical rearrangements in the dye ground state as supported by circular dichroism and molecular modeling data. Consequently, TP-2bzim displays an exceptional two-photon molecular brightness (δ×ΦF = 583 GM), a value unrivalled for a small biofluorophore. These properties enable to image nuclear DNA in fixed cells at submicromolar concentration ([TP-2Bzim] = 100 nM) and to visualize ultrabright foci of centromeric AT-rich chromatin. Finally TP-2Bzim exhibits a high photostability, is live-cell permeant, and does not require RNase treatment. This outstanding combination of optical and biological properties makes TP-2Bzim a bioprobe surpassing the best DNA stainers and paves the way for studying further nonlinear optical processes in DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA probes 3aabsorption 3achromatin 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3amolecular models 3anuclear genome 3aphotostability 3aribonucleases 3awavelengths1 aBordeau, Guillaume1 aFaurel-Paul, Elodie1 aMahuteau-Betzer, Florence1 aSaettel, Nicolas1 aMetge, Germain1 aFiorini-Debuisschert, Céline1 aCharra, Fabrice1 aTeulade-Fichou, Marie-Paule0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 135, no. 34 p.12697-12706dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja404422z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012600169300001400295520140200309592002801711650002101739650001901760650002901779650002301808650003101831650001601862650002101878650001801899650001101917650001201928650001301940650002201953653002201975653003001997653002602027653002002053653002102073700002502094700002302119700002702142773010802169856008502277852000902362655001202371IND60085528620221120141331.0161024e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008552862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2013.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdu, Emel B.10aEffect of surface electrostatic interactions on the stability and folding of formate dehydrogenase from Candida methylica  ap. 23-28.  aNAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH-EC 1.2.1.2) is an important enzyme to regenerate valuable NADH required by NAD+-dependent oxidoreductases in enzyme catalysis. The limitation in the thermostability of FDH enzyme is a crucial problem for development of biotechnological and industrial processes, despite of its advantages. In this study, to investigate the contribution of surface electrostatic interaction to the thermostability of FDH from Candida methylica (cmFDH) N187E, H13E, Q105R, N300E, N147R N300E/N147R, N187E/Q105R, N187E/N147R,Y160R, Y302R, Y160E and Y302E mutants were designed using a homology model of cmFDH based on Candida boidinii (cb) by considering electrostatic interactions on the protein surface. The effects of site-specific engineering on the stability of this molecule was analyzed according to minimal model of folding and assembly reaction and deduced equilibrium properties of the native system with respect to its thermal and denaturant sensitivities. It was observed that mutations did not change the unfolding pattern of native cmFDH and increased numbers of electrostatic interactions can cause either stabilizing or destabilizing effect on the thermostability of this protein. The thermodynamic and kinetic results suggested that except relatively improved mutants, three out of the nine single mutations increased the melting temperature of cmFDH enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida boidinii 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aaldehyde oxidoreductases 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aengineering 3aenzyme stability 3amelting point 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3athermal stability 0aCandida methylica 0aElectrostatic interaction 0aFormate dehydrogenase 0aProtein folding 0aEnzyme stability1 aSessions, Richard B.1 aClarke, Anthony R.1 aKaragüler, Nevin Gül0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

Irradiation of haemolymph from Manduca sexta and Locusta migratoria in the presence of racemic [10-³H]JH-III results in covalent incorporation of up to 3.2% of the radioactivity into an acetone insoluble protein fraction. Resolution of the proteins by HPLC and by SDS-PAGE confirms the presence of radiolabelled JH-binding proteins. Proteins not involved in JH-binding in insect haemolymph are labelled photochemically with lower yields only. Thus, JH-III is a suitable natural ligand for photoaffinity labelling of high-affinity binding sites. Use of the natural hormone instead of a hormone analog bears the major advantage that the binding with a JH-binding protein will occur at specific sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLocusta migratoria 3aManduca sexta 3aacetone 3abinding sites 3ahemolymph 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainsects 3airradiation 3ajuvenile hormones 3aligands 3aphotoaffinity labeling 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3aradiolabeling 0aInsect Haemolymph 0aHormone Binding Proteins 0aJuvenile Hormone 0aPhotoaffinity Labelling 0aManduca sexta 0aLocusta migratoria1 aPeter, Martin G.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 39, no. 11-12 p.1145-1149dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1984-11-12263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01761naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009400169300001400263520051700277592002800794650001700822650001600839650002500855650002300880650001100903650001300914650001400927650001600941650001100957653002000968653002200988653002201010653002501032653001701057700001101074700001201085700001101097700001701108773010801125856008501233852000901318655001201327IND60085528720221120141206.0161024e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008552872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2013.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Dan-Dan10aBovine serum albumin-catalyzed one-pot synthesis of 2-aminothiophenes via Gewald reaction  ap. 29-35.  aA novel bovine serum albumin (BSA)-catalyzed Gewald reaction in one-pot was developed in this work.

A characteristic JH-III titer curve was established by use of the hormone derivatives. No other juvenile hormone homologs were detected. JH-III shows a broad peak maximum of about 30 pmol/g fresh weight during the last larval instar, whereas only traces of the hormone are detectable at pupariation. Prepupae and pupae exhibit about the same JH-III level. In older pupae and in the pharate adults there was no JH-III detectable but it reappeared soon after emergence. Low values of JH-III are found in young male and female flies. The JH contents rise to distinct peaks in older and reproductive adults, both in male and female animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila hydei 3aadults 3afemales 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainstars 3ajuvenile hormones 3alarvae 3amales 3aprepupae 3apupae 3apupariation 0aJuvenile Hormone 0aDrosophila hydei 0aMetamorphosis 0aReproduction 0aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy1 aEmmerich, H.1 aRembold, H.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 39, no. 11-12 p.1150-1154dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1984-11-12273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008700165300001600252520095800268592002801226650001701254650002401271650001901295650001801314650001701332650001401349650002001363650002001383650001701403650001301420650002301433650001901456650002301475650001101498650003801509650002001547650001501567650001001582650001201592650001601604650001701620650002101637650001601658700002101674773012501695856004801820852000901868655001201877IND50089845120221118151034.0140523e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008984512DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590140300302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkin, A.

The present study employs multi criteria decision making techniques to assess the existing and recommended plant species (trees, shrubs, and hedge plants) in downtown and marginal parks of Rasht City, Iran. Twenty seven indicators were defined in the context of six criteria, namely regional adaptation, urban environment, aesthetics, maintenance, growth characteristics, and specific advantages. Weights were assigned to the criteria using the entropy method. They were subsequently ranked by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS), Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS), and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) techniques. To provide a final ranking of the ornamental species, the results of these four techniques were integrated using average rank, Borda, and Copeland methods. Based on the results, Parrotia persica, Liquidambar styraciflua, Lagerstroemia indica, Pyracantha coccinea, and Ligustrum texanum were ranked highest and Aesculus hippocastanum, Koelreuteria paniculata, Crataegus microphylla, Viburnum opulus, and Berberis gagnepainii were ranked lowest. Based on the detailed results, the assessment of trees, shrubs, and hedge plants can help decision makers and planners of urban green space development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAesculus hippocastanum 3aBerberis 3aCrataegus 3aKoelreuteria paniculata 3aLagerstroemia indica 3aLigustrum 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aParrotia persica 3aPyracantha coccinea 3aViburnum opulus 3aaesthetics 3aclimatic factors 3aentropy 3agreen infrastructure 3alifestyle 3amulti-criteria decision making 3anew species 3aplanning 3apollution 3ashrubs 3asustainable development 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aurban parks 3aIran 0aARAS 0aCODAS 0aEDAS 0aMulti-attribute decision making techniques 0aTOPSIS 0aUrban green space1 aKaviani, Behzad1 aSedaghathoor, Shahram1 aAllahyari, Mohammad Sadegh0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2020 Nov., v. 55 p.126824-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.1268243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245023200166520153400398592002801932650002501960650001501985650000902000650002202009650001802031650001102049650002502060650001702085650003202102650001902134650001702153650001402170650003302184653002002217653001802237653001302255653000902268653002602277700002102303700002202324700001902346773012402365856008302489852000902572655001202581IND60690561620221122051055.0200614e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069056162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarata, Kenji10aIdentification of polymer species in a complex mixture by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry as a basis for environmental microplastic analysis  aPyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Py-GC-APCI-TOFMS) was applied for the reliable identification of polymer species in a complex mixture to establish this system as a platform for environmental microplastic analysis. The method was evaluated on a model sample of mixed microplastics comprised of five major polymers: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), polystyrene (PSt), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The representative ions in the mass spectra of the pyrolyzates were identified by Py-GC-APCI-TOFMS measurements of the individual polymer species. The unique APCI ionization/fragmentation process and the high mass resolution of TOFMS were exploited to confirm the presence of the respective polymer species in the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of the mixed sample for the selected key ions. PE and PP were successfully and uniquely identified in the mixed sample by focusing on specific fragment ions of the pyrolyzates formed during APCI (m/z 114.093 ± 0.020 and m/z 156.139 ± 0.020, respectively). The resultant EICs allowed for the specific analysis of these species, even in the presence of interfering species produced from the other polymers. Similar processes were applied to the detection of PVC, PSt, and PET in the mixed sample. These results demonstrated that Py-GC-APCI-TOFMS is a promising tool to characterize a complex mixture of environmental microplastics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3aionization 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis gas chromatography 0aWater pollution 0aMicroplastics 0aPy-GC-MS 0aAPCI 0aHigh-resolution TOFMS1 aKitagawa, Shinya1 aIiguni, Yoshinori1 aOhtani, Hajime0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2020 June, v. 148 p.104828-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011900170300001600289520170600305592002802011650001802039650001402057650001502071650001702086650001202103650001502115650001602130650001102146650001002157700001802167773009402185856008102279852000902360655001202369IND60548956520221118050513.0160905e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054895652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-016-1374-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu-kaya, Usun10aReduced ant defenses in Macaranga myrmecophytes (Euphorbiaceae) infested with a winged phasmid Orthomeria cuprinus  ap. 665-672.  aMacaranga is a tree genus that includes many species of myrmecophytes, which are plants that harbor ant colonies within hollow structures known as domatia. The symbiotic ants (plant–ants) protect their host plants against herbivores; this defense mechanism is called ‘ant defense’. A Bornean phasmid species Orthomeria cuprinus feeds on two myrmecophytic Macaranga species, Macaranga beccariana and Macaranga hypoleuca, which are obligately associated with Crematogaster ant species. The phasmids elude the ant defense using specialized behavior. However, the mechanisms used by the phasmid to overcome ant defenses have been insufficiently elucidated. We hypothesized that O. cuprinus only feeds on individual plants with weakened ant defenses. To test the hypothesis, we compared the ant defense intensity in phasmid-infested and non-infested M. beccariana trees. The number of plant–ants on the plant surface, the ratio of plant–ant biomass to tree biomass, and the aggressiveness of plant–ants towards experimentally introduced herbivores were significantly lower on the phasmid-infested trees than on the non-infested trees. The phasmid nymphs experimentally introduced into non-infested trees, compared with those experimentally introduced into phasmid-infested trees, were more active on the plant surface, avoiding the plant–ants. These results support the hypothesis and suggest that ant defenses on non-infested trees effectively prevent the phasmids from remaining on the plants. Thus, we suggest that O. cuprinus feeds only on the individual M. beccariana trees having decreased ant defenses, although the factors that reduce the intensity of the ant defenses remain unclear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrematogaster 3aMacaranga 3aaggression 3aant colonies 3abiomass 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3anymphs 3atrees1 aItioka, Takao0 tEcological research.g2016 Sept., v. 31, no. 5 p.665-672dSpringer Japanx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-016-1374-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015700169520153900326592002801865650002401893650002201917650001101939650002301950650000901973650000901982650001301991650002702004650003802031650002902069650001202098650002602110650001202136650001902148650004402167650001802211650001602229650001302245650001402258650003302272650001202305650001702317650002102334653001202355653002902367653002702396653001402423653002502437700001802462700001502480700001402495773011302509856008602622852000902708655001202717IND60706841720221119123615.0220719e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070684172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Weichen10aOhmic heating curing of high content fly ash blended cement-based composites towards sustainable green construction materials used in severe cold region  aFly ash (FA) is a common solid waste in those countries which depend much on coal resources. The recycling of FA as a partial substitute for cement concrete is significant to reduce the pressure of land source and environmental protection. In this work, ohmic heating (OH) curing method was presented to cure FA/cement mortar (FA-CM) samples under severely low temperature. Results showed that the FA-CM samples with 20 wt% FA cured by 2 days OH curing at −20 °C (FA20-OH) possessed comparable mechanical properties compared with the FA-CM sample without FA cured by 3 days room temperature (RT) curing (FA0-RT), indicating the significant role of OH curing in promoting strength growth under severely low temperature. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) characterization revealed that OH curing could refine the pore structure, and FA20-OH samples showed comparable total porosity compared with FA0-RT sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that OH curing could effectively densify the microstructure of FA-CM samples compared with RT curing. Moreover, a higher Ca(OH)₂ content and larger mean chain length were observed in FA20-OH sample from thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) analysis and ²⁹Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to further clarify the positive regulation of OH curing on hydration product and its chemical structure. This study provided insights into the sustainable utilization of FA in construction materials used in severe cold region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acalcium hydroxide 3acement 3achemical structure 3acoal 3acold 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenvironmental protection 3afly ash 3amechanical properties 3amercury 3amicrostructure 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aohmic heating 3aporosimetry 3aporosity 3arecycling 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3asolid wastes 3athermogravimetry 0aFly ash 0aSeverely low temperature 0aConstruction materials 0aRecycling 0aOhmic heating curing1 aWang, Mingzhi1 aLiu, Yushi1 aWang, Wei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 276 p.123300-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011000154300001600264500001100280520113200291592002801423596004401451596004401495596004401539650002101583650001001604650002101614650001301635650001201648650001201660650001401672650001801686650001201704700005801716773011501774856007501889852000901964655001201973IND60763303620221121010203.0220119e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076330362DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.157752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Jian10aTraptamer screening: a new functional genomics approach to study virus entry and other cellular processes  ap. 355-362.  aREVIEW  aHistorically, the genetic analysis of mammalian cells entailed the isolation of randomly arising mutant cell lines with altered properties, followed by laborious genetic mapping experiments to identify the mutant gene responsible for the phenotype. In recent years, somatic cell genetics has been revolutionized by functional genomics screens, in which expression of every protein‐coding gene is systematically perturbed, and the phenotype of the perturbed cells is determined. We outline here a novel functional genomics screening strategy that differs fundamentally from commonly used approaches. In this strategy, we express libraries of artificial transmembrane proteins named traptamers and select rare cells with the desired phenotype because, by chance, a traptamer specifically perturbs the expression or activity of a target protein. Active traptamers are then recovered from the selected cells and can be used as tools to dissect the biological process under study. We also briefly describe how we have used this new strategy to provide insights into the complex process by which human papillomaviruses enter cells.  aPublisher supplied data  aAI102876cNational Institutes of Health  aAI150897cNational Institutes of Health  aCA242462cNational Institutes of Health 3aPapillomaviridae 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3agenomics 3amammals 3amutants 3aphenotype 3asomatic cells 3aviruses1 aDiMaio, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2060-59770 tFEBS journal.g2022 Jan., v. 289, no. 2 p.355-362dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.157753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013100166300001800297500002000315520256500335592002802900650001502928650001102943650002402954650001502978650001502993650002503008650003003033651001103063700001903074700002003093700001803113773010303131856007903234852000903313655001203322IND60583643920221119112526.0171021e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058364392DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.127812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobuchon, Marine10aMulti‐scale drivers of community diversity and composition across tidal heights: an example on temperate seaweed communities  ap. 1791-1805.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite recent advances in understanding community assembly processes, appreciating how these processes vary across multiple spatial scales and environmental gradients remains a crucial issue in ecology. This study aimed to disentangle the drivers of diversity and composition of seaweed communities through a gradient of spatial scales based on a hierarchical sampling design consisting of 19 sites distributed in four sectors along the Brittany coastline. Using randomised community matrices and Moran's eigenvector maps (MEMs), we compared (i) the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes, (ii) the environmental correlates of community composition, and (iii) the scale of variation in community composition for seaweed communities located at two different tidal heights. Processes shaping community patterns are expected to vary along a gradient of tidal heights. Therefore, we specifically examined the following hypotheses: the contribution of deterministic over stochastic processes as well as the relative importance of environmental filtering over biotic interactions should be enhanced for seaweed communities of the infralittoral fringe compared to subtidal ones, whereas dispersal of propagules in the water column should be more restricted resulting in finer scale variation in community composition for seaweed communities of the infralittoral fringe compared to subtidal communities. Seaweed communities were largely shaped by deterministic processes, although the relative importance of deterministic processes was greater for communities of the infralittoral fringe than for subtidal communities. Sea surface temperature and geophysical variables were correlates of community composition at the two tidal heights; additionally, waves and current were correlated with the composition of the communities of the infralittoral fringe while kelp density was correlated with the composition of subtidal communities. Variation in community composition was observed at a finer scale for infralittoral fringe than for subtidal communities. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring seaweed communities varies across tidal heights. Furthermore, the Moran's eigenvector maps framework highlights that the nature of environmental correlates and the spatial scale at which they were good correlates of community composition also vary across tidal heights and may therefore be useful to broaden our understanding of community assembly across vertical gradients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocenosis 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3ageophysics 3amacroalgae 3astochastic processes 3asurface water temperature 3aFrance1 aValero, Myriam1 aThiébaut, Eric1 aLe Gall, Line0 tjournal of ecology.g2017 Nov., v. 105, no. 6 p.1791-1805dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.127813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008700165300001600252500002000268520084200288592002801130596005901158596005901217650001701276650001901293650002001312650001201332650001901344650001601363650001901379650000901398650000901407650001601416650001201432651001001444700005501454773015701509856007901666852000901745655001201754IND60615056720221118223533.0181003e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061505672DNAL7 a10.1111/1467-8489.122672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaoguang10aChina feels the heat: negative impacts of high temperatures on China's rice sector  ap. 576-588.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe analysed a county‐level data set of single‐season rice yield and daily weather outcomes in China to examine the effects of temperature on China's rice sector. We found that rice yield exhibited highly nonlinear responses to temperature changes: rice yield increased with temperature up to 28°C and decreased sharply with higher temperatures. Holding current growing seasons and regions constant, average rice yield in China is projected to decrease by 10–19 per cent by 2050 and 11–33 per cent by 2070 due to future warming under the global climate models HadGEM2‐ES and NorESM1‐M. These results imply that future warming poses a major challenge for Chinese rice farmers and that the effectiveness of adaptations will depend on how well they reduce the negative temperature impacts on rice yield because of very hot days.  aPublisher supplied data  a71673224cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a71703149cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aOryza sativa 3aclimate models 3adata collection 3afarmers 3aglobal warming 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3aheat 3arice 3atemperature 3aweather 3aChina1 aChen, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2310-67430 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2018 Oct., v. 62, no. 4 p.576-588dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55734x1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.122673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245017700165300001600342520136700358592002801725650001201753650001501765650002001780650002301800650001101823650002201834650003001856650003201886650002301918650001501941650001401956650000901970650001601979653003401995653001502029653000902044700001602053700001902069700001902088773011202107856005102219852000902270655001202279IND50074948120221119212002.0140410e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007494812DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2012.6724892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wen12aA Rapid Screening Method for the Determination of Seventy Pesticide Residues in Soil Using Microwave-Assisted Extraction Coupled to Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry  ap. 407-418.  aA rapid screening method using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) in combination with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry for the determination of 70 pesticide residues in soil was established. The pesticides included 27 organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), 29 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), nine pyrethroids, and five carbamates. Parameters that could affect the efficiency of extraction, such as temperature, time, and solvent, were investigated. The condition of the extraction, under which recoveries of all 70 pesticides ranged from 70% to 120%, was optimized with a 1:1 (V/V) mixture of acetone and hexane, a temperature of 100°C, and an extraction time of 10 min. All compounds studied could be recovered in good yields and with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20%. The linearity of the method for all the pesticides was greater than 0.99 over a concentration range of 0.1–5 μg/g. The detection limits varied from 0.5 to 211.25 ng/g. Interday and intraday precision analyses yielded RSDs of 1.2%–11.7% and 3.6%–15.1%, respectively. This method, which was as effective as Soxhlet extraction and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), proved to be accurate and precise. When the proposed method was used to examine environmental samples, the obtained results were in good agreement with those obtained using Soxhlet extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3acarbamates 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3ahexane 3amass spectrometry 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3aorganophosphorus pesticides 3apesticide residues 3apyrethrins 3ascreening 3asoil 3atemperature 0aMicrowave-assisted extraction 0apesticides 0asoil1 aLv, Jungang1 aShi, Rongguang1 aLiao, Chunyang0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2012 May 1, v. 21, no. 4 p.407-418dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2012.672489  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245011600160300001600276500001900292520149500311592002801806650002401834650002101858650002201879650001201901650002201913650002101935650001201956650002001968650001801988650001502006650001002021650001902031650002102050650001402071650002002085650001602105650001102121650000902132653002602141653000802167653002302175653001802198653003502216653003602251700001802287700001702305700001802322700001302340700001702353700001602370700001902386700001702405773012702422856008002549852000902629655001202638IND60733536620221120085113.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073353662DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI15660-202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ran10aEffects of Different Fumigants on the Replanted Soil Environment and Growth of Malus hupehensis Rehd. Seedlings  ap. 491-499.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aApple replant disease (ARD) has been reported in all major fruit-growing regions of the world and is often caused by biotic factors (pathogen fungi) and abiotic factors (phenolic compounds). Soil chemical fumigation can kill soil pathogenic fungi; however, the traditionally used fumigant methyl bromide has been banned because of its ozone-depleting effects. There is thus a need to identify greener fumigant candidates. We characterized the effects of different fumigants on the replanted soil environment and the growth characteristics of Malus hupehensis Rehd. seedlings. All five experimental treatments [treatment 1 (T1), metham-sodium; treatment 2 (T2), dazomet; treatment 3 (T3), calcium cyanamide; treatment 4 (T4), 1,3-dichloropropene; and treatment 5 (T5), methyl bromide] promoted significantly the biomass, root growth, and root respiration rate of M. hupehensis seedlings and the ammonium nitrogen (NH₄⁺-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO₃–-N) contents of replanted soil. Metham sodium (T1) and dazomet (T2) had stronger effects compared with 1,3-dichloropropene (T4) and calcium cyanamide (T3). At 172 days after T1, the height, root length, and root respiration rate of Malus hupehensis Rehd. seedlings, and the NH₄⁺-N and NO₃–-N contents of replanted soil increased by 91.64%, 97.67%, 69.78%, 81.98%, and 27.44%, respectively, compared with the control. Thus, dazomet and metham sodium were determined to be the optimal fumigants for use in practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,3-dichloropropene 3aMalus hupehensis 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiomass 3acalcium cyanamide 3acell respiration 3adazomet 3aedaphic factors 3afruit growing 3afumigation 3ametam 3amethyl bromide 3anitrate nitrogen 3apathogens 3areplant disease 3aroot growth 3asodium 3asoil 0aapple replant disease 0aARD 0aFusarium oxysporum 0ametham sodium 0aplant morphological properties 0asoil physicochemical properties1 aJiang, Weitao1 aWang, Haiyan1 aPan, Fengbing1 aFan, Hai1 aChen, Xuesen1 aShen, Xiang1 aYin, Chengmiao1 aMao, Zhiquan0 tHortScience.g2021 Apr., v. 56, no. 4 p.491-499dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:1941x2327-98347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI15660-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245009000172300001800262520116300280592002801443650002101471650001801492650001901510650001601529650001101545650000901556650001601565650001401581650002201595650001501617650001401632650000901646650001301655650001401668650002201682650001001704650001401714653002001728653001901748653002101767653003101788700001701819700001601836773009301852856008401945852000902029655001202038IND60535703320221119233418.0190417s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053570332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqpro.2015.02.1432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalai, Chitaranjan10aRice Husk and Sugarcane Baggase Based Activated Carbon for Iron and Manganese Removal  ap. 1126-1133.  aIron and manganese are commonly present in groundwater supplies used by many water systems. The presence of iron and manganese in the drinking water is not harmful to human bodies. However, higher concentration causes discoloration, staining, turbidity and bad taste problems. It also form iron oxide or manganese dioxide accumulations in pipes.In the present work, low cost methods have been evolved for the removal of iron and manganese from ground water using Rice Husk based Activated Carbon (RHAC) and Sugarcane Baggase based Activated Carbon (SBAC). Exhaustive experiments have been conducted in the Laboratory on sediment columns with variable depths of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50cm. Four graded types of sediment collected from the banks of Rivers Brahmani, Koel, Sankha and Budhabalanga were studied for proper removal of suspended solids by maintaining sufficient infiltration rates. It has been observed that the infiltration rate is maintained for the soil column of 50cm without having any impact of the suspended solids. The Iron and manganese concentrations are found to be removed 100% after passing through the filter material in both the cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3adiscoloration 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3airon 3airon oxides 3amanganese 3amanganese dioxide 3arice hulls 3asediments 3asoil 3astaining 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3ataste 3aturbidity 0aWater treatment 0aDrinking water 0aActivated Carbon 0airon and manganese removal1 aJha, Ramakar1 aDesai, V.R.0 tAquatic Procedia.g2015, v. 4 p.1126-1133dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23340x2214-241X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqpro.2015.02.1433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245011400200300001600314500002000330520113300350592002801483596004001511650002501551650000801576650002301584650001601607650002001623650001601643650002001659650002101679650002301700650002901723700006201752700006001814700006101874700001701935700005801952700005802010773011502068856007502183852000902258655001202267IND60763303920221121005942.0220119e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076330392DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.161862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaidmann, Sascha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8077-905510aGSK3‐mediated phosphorylation of DEK3 regulates chromatin accessibility and stress tolerance in Arabidopsis  ap. 473-493.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChromatin dynamics enable the precise control of transcriptional programmes. The balance between restricting and opening of regulatory sequences on the DNA needs to be adjusted to prevailing conditions and is fine‐tuned by chromatin remodelling proteins. DEK is an evolutionarily conserved chromatin architectural protein regulating important chromatin‐related processes. However, the molecular link between DEK‐induced chromatin reconfigurations and upstream signalling events remains unknown. Here, we show that ASKβ/AtSK31 is a salt stress‐activated glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) from Arabidopsis thaliana that phosphorylates DEK3. This specific phosphorylation alters nuclear DEK3 protein complex composition and affects nucleosome occupancy and chromatin accessibility that is translated into changes in gene expression, contributing to salt stress tolerance. These findings reveal that DEK3 phosphorylation is critical for chromatin function and cellular stress response and provide a mechanistic example of how GSK3‐based signalling is directly linked to chromatin, facilitating a transcriptional response.  aPublisher supplied data  aP27970‐B25cAustrian Science Fund 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3alinkage (genetics) 3anucleosomes 3aphosphorylation 3asalt stress 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atau-protein kinase 3atranscription (genetics)1 aPetutschnig, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0846-18781 aRozhon, Wilfried1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0659-05931 aMolnár, Gergely,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6205-47231 aPopova, Olga1 aMechtler, Karl1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3392-99461 aJonak, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9605-67510 tFEBS journal.g2022 Jan., v. 289, no. 2 p.473-493dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.161863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245012300182500001900305520166400324592002801988650001702016650001702033650001102050700002502061700002902086773011002115856008702225852000902312655001202321IND60683053520221119200757.0200913e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068305352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1038922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz-Vilches, Naomí C.10aTell me what you imagine and I will tell you what you want: The effects of mental simulation on desire and food choice  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany people struggle with the classical choice of eating a mouth-watering snack versus a healthier product. One of the reasons behind this is that unhealthier products are appealing for their direct gratification; they deliver pleasure. The present research investigates the effect of mental simulation as a relatively new strategy to possibly shift the balance between direct gratification and the consideration of longer-term benefits necessary to make healthier choices. Specifically we distinguish between imagining the consumption process versus the outcome of eating a specific product, hereafter referred to as mental simulations. In two studies, we show that participants under process simulation, i.e., imagining the process of eating, had a higher desire for the imagined product compared to a control condition, but in a choice task between a healthy and an unhealthier product, more people chose the unhealthier product over the healthier one. On the other hand, outcome simulation, i.e., imagining the outcome of eating, also generated a higher desire for the imagined product, but in this case people chose the healthier option. In terms of underlying process, we explored the role of valence of the imagined experience on desire for the imagined product. This is the first study giving insights into the processes that could be behind the impact of mental simulation on desire and food choices.

Seeds harvested at 38 DAF (30 Apr.) with well-developed vegetative organs (embryo and endosperm) in seeds categorized as A and B (seed A and seed B, respectively) based on the X-ray images were considered fully developed, and 80% of seeds were considered mature. However, the germination rates were less than 26% or 28% when full seeds harvested at 43 DAF received no or 14 days of CS treatment, respectively. Our study suggests that the low germination rate of fully developed seeds as judged by X-ray images showing well-developed embryo and endosperm could result from the presence of dormancy that was not broken effectively by 14 days of CS coupled with the loss of viability caused by 8 months of dry storage at 5 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnemone cernua 3aX-radiation 3acold 3adormancy 3aendosperm 3agermination 3aviability 0acold treatment 0aempty seeds 0afull seeds 0amaturity 0aseed viability 0aX-ray scanning1 aWei, Qiuying1 aJourdan, Pablo1 aYoo, Yong Kwon0 tHortScience.g2021 Apr., v. 56, no. 4 p.506-510dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:1941x2327-98347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI15683-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010100163300001600264520146700280592002801747650001601775650001501791650001601806650001301822650001201835650001001847650001601857650001801873650002201891650001001913650004001923650001401963650000901977650001201986650001601998650001302014650002702027650002102054650001902075650001002094700001902104700001702123700001702140700001902157773009102176856008102267852000902348655001202357IND60548957220221118050346.0160905e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054895722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-016-1018-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ji Eun10aPolygonatum stenophyllum improves menopausal obesity via regulation of lipolysis-related enzymes  ap. 789-796.  aMenopausal women are associated with an increase in obesity accompanying changes in the body's condition and composition. Polygonatum stenophyllum (PS) rhizome, which is a traditional herbal remedy, has been used to treat various diseases including obesity. However, the effect of PS on menopausal obesity remains unclear. Female C57BL/6 mice were ovariectomized (OVX) and fed on high fat diet (HFD) to induce menopausal obesity. Aqueous extract of PS of 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg was orally administrated for 6 weeks after 7 weeks of induction. The weights of body, uterine, and ovarian fat were investigated. Histological analysis was performed to monitor the changes of liver and fat. In addition, lipid profiles were measured in serum and the expression of lipolysis-related enzymes was analyzed in uterine tissues. PS significantly decreased the weights of body and ovarian fat and increased the uterine weight compared to control group. Administration of PS significantly decreased the adipocyte diameter and the lipid droplets within the hepatocytes. In addition, PS-treated mice had lower levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol than control mice. The expression of lipolysis-related genes, including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), was increased in PS-treated groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PS might have efficacy on menopausal obesity by activating ATGL and HSL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolygonatum 3aadipocytes 3ablood serum 3adroplets 3afemales 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahigh fat diet 3alipid composition 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amenopause 3amice 3aobesity 3aovariectomy 3arhizomes 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols 3auterine tissue 3awomen1 aKim, Eun-jung,1 aKim, Mi-hye,1 aHong, Jongki1 aYang, Woong Mo0 tNatural medicines.g2016 Oct., v. 70, no. 4 p.789-796dSpringer Japanx1340-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-016-1018-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016800157300001800325520099000343592002801333650002401361650002101385650001901406650001901425650001901444650002101463650001901484650001801503650003101521650001901552650003001571650001401601700001901615700001601634700001801650700002001668700001501688700002101703773014301724856007401867852000901941655001201950IND60670998320221120204612.0191002e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067099832DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb01099j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wen Long10aHydrophilic Cu₂₋ₓSe/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites with tunable plasmonic properties and their applications in cellular dark-field microscopic imaging  ap. 7027-7033.  aA facile aqueous chemical approach is developed for one-pot synthesis of the nanocomposites of heavily doped semiconductor nanoparticles (Cu₂₋ₓSe NPs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) at room temperature, wherein the reduction of GO and the in situ growth of Cu₂₋ₓSe NPs on rGO sheets occur simultaneously. The as-prepared Cu₂₋ₓSe/rGO nanocomposites exhibit a well-defined near-infrared (NIR) localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which arises from free carriers (holes) and could be tuned from 1360 to 1050 nm by varying the reaction time, owing to the increase of the free carrier density in the valence band of Cu₂₋ₓSe NPs. This approach not only offers an efficient strategy to synthesize the self-doped Cu₂₋ₓSe/rGO nanocomposites with strong and tunable NIR absorption, but also develops new light scattering nanoprobes with good biocompatibility as well as unique optical properties for in vitro cellular dark-field microscopic imaging (iDFM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiocompatibility 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3aimage analysis 3alight scattering 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3asemiconductors 3asurface plasmon resonance 3asynthesis1 aLie, Shao Qing1 aDu, Yu Qing1 aWan, Xiao Yan1 aWang, Ting Ting1 aWang, Jian1 aHuang, Cheng Zhi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Sept. 24, v. 2, no. 40 p.7027-7033dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb01099j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009300169300001800262520095400280592002801234650001201262650001001274650001701284650001201301650001801313650002801331650001601359650001401375650001601389700001701405700002401422700002201446773010701468856004801575852000901623655001201632IND50068484620221122052859.0130811e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006848462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-012-0856-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiguori, Loredana10aEffect of Process Parameters on Partial Dealcoholization of Wine by Osmotic Distillation  ap. 2514-2524.  aThe effectiveness of the osmotic distillation process for partial dealcoholization of wine was investigated in this work. The dealcoholization process was performed using a hollow fibre membrane module and process parameters, such as hydrodynamic conditions, number of cycles, temperature and ethanol content of feed solution were investigated. Then the partial dealcoholization of Aglianico red wine was carried out up to 2 %vol and the chemicophysical properties evaluated and compared with the initial wine. No significant differences (p < 0.05) in total volatile acidity, colour, total polyphenols and organic acids content, between Aglianico and dealcoholized wine were found. Empirical correlations available in the literature for calculation of ethanol mass transfer coefficient seems able to describe with reasonable agreement the effect of operating conditions of the dealcoholization process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acolor 3adistillation 3aethanol 3amass transfer 3aorganic acids and salts 3apolyphenols 3ared wines 3atemperature1 aRusso, Paola1 aAlbanese, Donatella1 aDi Matteo, Marisa0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.2514-2524dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-0856-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011500168520228800283592002802571650001102599650002502610650001102635650003002646650001502676650000902691650001502700650001802715650002402733650002602757650002302783650002602806650002602832650002102858650001802879653002402897653001702921653002802938700001302966773011302979856008603092852000903178655001203187IND60706842520221118233608.0201216e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070684252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Qianqian10aModerate separation of household kitchen waste towards global optimization of municipal solid waste management  aThe sorting treatment of food waste is gradually considered as an available strategy to improve the sustainability of municipal solid waste (MSW) management, but the separation of household kitchen waste (HKW), the main component of food waste, is controversial because of its disperse sources and possible social cost. Social life cycle assessment is applied in this study to integrate environmental, economic, and social analyses, including the time investment of households, aiming to assess the influence of HKW separation comprehensively. The results show HKW separation at different separation rates improve the environmental performance of MSW treatment. When HKW separation rate increases by every 20 percentages, the net carbon emission reduces 5–7%, the acidic gas emission reduces by 3.1–3.5%, and the cumulative energy demand decreases by approximately 2.1–2.2%, owing to the higher heat value of incineration feedstock and more yield of energy products. HKW separation increases the energy consumption of waste collection and transportation system, but its contribution to the overall energy consumption is very limited. The whole MSW management system also has better economic performance along with more HKW separation and more energy output. In contrary, a huge amount of time cost of households increases the total social cost of MSW management, making HWK separation not an attractive option. From the point of view of residents, the external cost, including environmental cost and household time cost, should not exceed zero to ensure residents obtain some benefits from HKW separation, implying that HKW separation rate of 20% is acceptable. HKW water content and proportion in MSW are the two sensitive factors influencing the comprehensive performance of MSW management. Source HKW draining to water content 60% and source reduction by 30% can decrease the total social cost by 124–215% and 66–73%, respectively. The two effective measures are easy and convenient for residents to carry out with significant improvement of social sustainability of MSW management. Based on the effects on social cost, the priority of HKW management strategies should be given to source draining and then source reduction, followed by source separation from MSW at 20%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aeconomic performance 3aenergy 3aenvironmental performance 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3ahouseholds 3akitchen waste 3aland transportation 3alife cycle assessment 3amanagement systems 3amunicipal solid waste 3asocial sustainability 3awaste management 3awater content 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aIncineration 0aHousehold kitchen waste1 aLi, Huan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.123330-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1233303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04147naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001100145245011000156300001800266500002000284520248000304592002802784650002502812650003202837650002702869650002402896650001802920650001402938650002302952650003002975650000903005650002203014650001203036650002603048650001303074650001603087650002103103650001503124650002103139650002103160650001103181650001603192650002503208650001403233650001803247650002303265700001503288700001203303700002503315700002003340700001803360773010303378856007903481852000903560655001203569IND60583644420221119112430.0171021e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058364442DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.127782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Na10aManipulating two olfactory cues causes a biological control beetle to shift to non‐target plant species  ap. 1534-1546.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOlfactory cues can determine the host preferences of herbivorous insects, but their role in host shifting is unclear. Host specificity and the potential for host shifts are important criteria for screening and post‐release evaluation of biological control agents for invasive plants. However, the role of olfactory cues in mediating host shifts in biological control agents is not well understood. To investigate the role of olfactory cues in host selection of a reportedly monophagous flea beetle (Agasicles hygrophila), an important biocontrol agent for invasive alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides), we extracted and analysed the volatiles produced by the host‐plant A. philoxeroides and the non‐host plants Alternanthera sessilis, Beta vulgaris and Amaranthus mangostanus. Moreover, we used electrophysiological techniques, behavioural bioassays and field trials to test the antennal responses and behavioural preferences of A. hygrophila to combinations of different plant volatiles and treatments, and pure compounds in different dosages and combinations. We show that A. hygrophila female beetles indeed use olfactory cues to select plants for feeding and oviposition and that the survivorship of larvae on the second preferred non‐host plant A. sessilis, a close relative of the first preferred host plant A. philoxeroides, was over 75% in a field trail. Although female beetles responded to many volatile compounds from host and non‐host plants, (E)‐4,8‐dimethyl‐1,3,7‐nonatriene (DMNT) positively encouraged the beetle's feeding and oviposition preferences, whereas (Z)‐3‐hexenol displayed repellent effect. Remarkably, complementation assays with (Z)‐3‐hexenol on host plant or DMNT on non‐host plants significantly shifted A. hygrophila host preferences to non‐host plants and resulted in oviposition and egg hatching on the non‐host plant A. sessilis in field trials. Synthesis. We demonstrate an olfactory mechanism by which a specialized herbivorous beetle uses the ratio of two common plant volatiles, (E)‐4,8‐dimethyl‐1,3,7‐nonatriene and (Z)‐3‐hexenol, to discriminate between its host and non‐host plants in nature. This study highlights an important mechanism by which olfactory cues could lead to undesired host range expansion in biocontrol agent, thus representing an important warning of the potential for a host shift and development of invasiveness in a common biocontrol agent, the flea beetle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgasicles hygrophila 3aAlternanthera philoxeroides 3aAlternanthera sessilis 3aAmaranthus tricolor 3aBeta vulgaris 3abioassays 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3aelectrophysiology 3afemales 3afield experimentation 3ahatching 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3aoviposition 3aphytophagous insects 3ascreening 3asurvival rate 3avolatile compounds1 aLi, Shuang1 aGe, Jin1 aSchuman, Meredith C.1 aWei, Jia‐Ning1 aMa, Rui‐Yan0 tjournal of ecology.g2017 Nov., v. 105, no. 6 p.1534-1546dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.127783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013400167300001400301520095400315592002801269650002301297650002101320650001901341650002001360650001701380650002101397653002801418653001601446653002201462653002101484653000801505700001201513700001501525700001801540700001701558700001301575773009001588856008601678852000901764655001201773IND60617620420221116201124.0210114e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061762042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.09.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ning12aA mitochondrial targeting two-channel responsive fluorescence probe for imaging the superoxide radical anion in vitro and in vivo  ap. 79-85.  aSuperoxide anion is widely involved in broad cellular functions such as immune response, cell signaling and cell proliferation in regulated concentrations but are implicated in the development of various disease in uncontrolled levels.

This probe demonstrated the following advantages: (1) a low detection limit and wide linear region from nanomolar to micromolar concentrations; (2) two-channel responsiveness; and (3) targeting mitochondria specifically. Moreover, the probe was successfully applied to visualize superoxide anions in vitro and in vivo. These excellent features could enable its sensitive determination for O₂•⁻ in biological systems and promising roles in biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3aimmune response 3amitochondria 3asuperoxide anion 0aMitochondrial targeting 0aRatiometric 0aFluorescent probe 0aSuperoxide anion 0aROS1 aHe, Yun1 aTang, Qing1 aWang, Yanfang1 aZheng, Qiang1 aHu, Ping0 tTalanta.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.79-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.09.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245016500175500001900340520164400359592002802003650001702031650002602048650002302074650001602097653002102113653002702134653001602161653002602177653002702203700002202230773011002252856008702362852000902449655001202458IND60683053920221119200507.0200913e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068305392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1038942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagmann, Désirée10aNutri-Score, multiple traffic light and incomplete nutrition labelling on food packages: Effects on consumers’ accuracy in identifying healthier snack options  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFront-of-package (FOP) nutrition labels are designed to help consumers evaluate the healthiness of foods and to promote healthier food choices. In this study, an online experiment with Swiss consumers (N = 1313) was conducted to compare the effects of different nutrition label formats on consumers’ evaluations of snack food healthiness. Participants were asked to select the healthier option in 105 pairwise comparisons of 15 salty snacks. The participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: the FOP presented with (1) the nutrition facts table, (2) the multiple traffic light (MTL), (3) the Nutri-Score, (4) the Nutri-Score on half of the products, or (5) no nutrition information (control). The consumers’ evaluations of the snacks’ healthiness were fairly accurate, even without being given nutrition information on the packaging. The Nutri-Score led to the greatest accuracy in identifying the healthier of two snacks (when using the British FSA/Ofcom nutrient profiling score to determine product healthiness); however, this had only a minimal effect on the evaluation when only some of the products were labelled. Both FOP labels were superior to the FOP with and without the nutrition facts. This indicates that for maximum effectiveness, the labelling of all available products is needed. The perceived usefulness and public support of mandatory implementation were higher for the MTL than for the Nutri-Score label; however, for the latter, perceived usefulness and public acceptance were higher among the participants who became familiar with the label during the experiment than among those who did not.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood quality 3anutrition information 3anutrition labeling 3asnack foods 0aNutrition labels 0aMultiple traffic light 0aNutri-score 0aNutrition facts table 0aHealthiness evaluation1 aSiegrist, Michael0 tFood quality and preference.g2020 July, v. 83 p.103894-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1038943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011200165300001600277520090500293592002801198650001401226650001101240650001001251650001201261650001001273650001601283650001001299650001101309650001001320651001201330653002601342653001501368653001901383653002101402700001201423773010401435856005101539852000901590655001201599IND50087378520221120031827.0140412e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008737852DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2011.6360742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaltag, E.10aMorphometric pattern of European Reed Warblers (Aves, Sylviidae) during spring migration in eastern Romania  ap. 273-279.  aWe analysed the biometric traits of 245 individuals of adult European Reed Warblers.

Comparing the identification methods which we found in literature, we recommend, for the eastern Romanian Reed Warbler population, three methods: Biometric Index, Notch length/Wing length and Wing length/Bill to skull. Regarding the time of migration, we found significant differences in wing shape, which demonstrates that the birds with longer wings arrive earlier. These birds have longer and pointed wings (3rd primary is longer), bigger notch length, tarsus length and total foot span than those which arrive in late May. Our data suggests also, that there are no significant differences in the arrival time between males and females.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSylviidae 3aadults 3abirds 3afemales 3amales 3amorphometry 3askull 3aspring 3awings 3aRomania 0aEuropean Reed Warbler 0abiometrics 0aEastern Europe 0aspring migration1 aIon, C.0 tItalian journal of zoology.g2012 June 1, v. 79, no. 2 p.273-279dTaylor & Francisx1748-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2011.636074  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012900163520107000292592002801362650001401390650001601404650001901420650001901439650000901458650001601467653002501483653001301508653002001521653002401541653002301565653001901588653002201607653003001629700002601659700001601685700001601701700006101717773011201778856008301890852000901973655001201982IND60690562420221122051153.0200621e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069056242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2020.1159022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Nisar10aDesign, engineering and analytical perspectives of membrane materials with smart surfaces for efficient oil/water separation  aEffective separation of various oil-water emulsions using hydrophobic/oleophilic, hydrophilic/oleophobic or amphiphilic materials has gained high research interests. With the ease in handling operations and environmental friendliness, membrane technology remains the most prevalent technique to address the oil/water emulsion problems to achieve efficient separation. The exploitation of membrane-based materials with super wettability, which encompasses the theme of superhydrophobic, superoleophilic, or a combination of both, has become a more vibrant area. Herein, we reviewed smart surfaces with superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic wettability followed by chemical methods for the separation of oil-water mixtures. Various types of membranes are also presented with suitable examples.

However, consumers are hesitant to adopt EVs as they are scared of the long charging times and being stranded midway through a journey. Addressing this concern is the introduction of Battery swap technology (BST). BST assures an uninterrupted driving range in EVs. In this study, the adoption intention of BST for EVs is explored as BST′ success depends on consumer acceptance to guarantee pro-environmental consumption and pollution reduction. The current study extends the theory of planned behavior (TPB) with perceived benefits and knowledge. 407 responses from China's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region were used in this investigation. Findings revealed that the extended TPB improved the explanatory power from 39.5% to 45.7%. Attitude, perceived behavior control (PBC), subjective norms, knowledge, and perceived benefit directly influenced adoption intention. Subjective norms influenced PBC and attitude. PBC was insignificant in impacting attitude towards BST. Knowledge influenced attitude and perceived benefit. Attitude mediated Subjective norms and knowledge. Policy implications are enumerated to enhance BST acceptance and proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aconsumer acceptance 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3aissues and policy 3apollution 3aChina 0aBattery swap technology 0aAdoption intention 0aTheory of planned behavior 0aElectric vehicles 0aBeijing-Tianjin-Hebei1 aSong, Huaming1 aNketiah, Emmanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9500-09481 aObuobi, Bright1 aAdjei, Mavis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9192-96291 aCudjoe, Dan0 tEnergy.g2022 July 15, v. 251 p.123862-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1238623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009600165300001800261520186200279592002802141650001902169650002702188650001602215650003902231650002002270650002102290650002102311650002402332650002602356650001102382650001802393650002402411650001402435650001602449700001802465700002002483700002002503700002102523700002002544773009902564856007502663852000902738655001202747IND60576799720171218000000.0170806e20130709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057679972DNAL7 a10.1021/la401596s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomingues, Tatiana
M.10aInteraction of the Antimicrobial Peptide Gomesin with Model Membranes: A Calorimetric Study  ap. 8609-8618.  aGomesin is a potent cationic antimicrobial peptide (z = +6) isolated from the Brazilian spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana. The interaction of gomesin with large unilamellar vesicles composed of a 1:1 mixture of zwitterionic (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and anionic (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) phospholipids is studied with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In parallel, light scattering and optical microscopy are used to assess peptide-induced vesicle aggregation. The ability of gomesin to permeabilize the membrane is examined with fluorescence spectroscopy of the leakage of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein (CF). Vesicles coated with 3 mol % 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (PE-PEG) lipids are also investigated to assess the influence of peptide-induced vesicle aggregation in the activity of gomesin. The ITC and light scattering titrations are done in two ways: lipid into peptide and peptide into lipid injections. Although some differences arise between the two setups, the basic interaction of gomesin with anionic vesicles is preserved. A surface partition model combined with the Gouy–Chapman theory is put forward to fit the ITC results. The intrinsic binding constant of gomesin is found to be K ≈ 10³ M–¹. The interaction of gomesin with anionic membranes is highly exothermic and enthalpy-driven. Binding of gomesin is virtually always accompanied by vesicle aggregation and changes in membrane permeability, leading to CF leakage. Addition of PE-PEG to the membrane strongly attenuates vesicle aggregation but does not significantly change the mode of action of gomesin. The results point to a strong interaction of gomesin with the membrane surface, causing membrane rupture without a deep penetration into the bilayer core.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthoscurria 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acalorimetry 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aheat production 3alight microscopy 3alight scattering 3amechanism of action 3amembrane permeability 3amodels 3aphospholipids 3apolyethylene glycol 3atitration 3azwitterions1 aMattei, Bruno1 aSeelig, Joachim1 aPerez, Katia R.1 aMiranda, Antonio1 aRiske, Karin A.0 tLangmuir.g2013 July 09, v. 29, no. 27 p.8609-8618dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla401596s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03945naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002100133040001800154072000900172072000900181100001400190245011500204300001600319500002400335500002400359500001500383520155100398650001301949650001301962650001801975650002001993650003002013650002302043650002502066650001602091650001402107650001802121650001402139650001202153650002002165650001702185650001302202650004402215650001902259650001102278650004502289650004102334650003802375650004102413650004902454650000902503650005102512650007202563650006702635653002502702700001702727700001602744700001102760700001702771700001602788773011802804852000902922856007202931856011203003930003303115945002503148946001303173961001303186655001203199IND4390255620221120183053.0070409e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439025562DNAL7 a145628812pmid7 a10.1637/60732doi7 a10113/345052hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aLee, L.F.10aProtection and Synergism by Recombinant Fowl Pox Vaccines Expressing Multiple Genes from Marek's Disease Virus  ap. 549-558.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aRecombinant fowl poxviruses (rFPVs) were constructed to express genes from serotype 1 Marek's disease virus (MDV) coding for glycoproteins B, E, I, H, and UL32 (gB1, gE, gI, gH, and UL32). An additional rFPV was constructed to contain four MDV genes (gB1, gE, gI, and UL32). These rFPVs were evaluated for their ability to protect maternal antibody-positive chickens against challenge with highly virulent MDV isolates. The protection induced by a single rFPV/gB1 (42%) confirmed our previous finding. The protection induced by rFPV/gI (43%), rFPV/gB1UL32 (46%), rFPV/gB1gEgI (72%), and rFPV/gB1gEgIUL32 (70%) contributed to additional knowledge on MDV genes involved in protective immunity. In contrast, the rFPV containing gE, gH, or UL32 did not induce significant protection compared with turkey herpesvirus (HVT). Levels of protection by rFPV/gB1 and rFPV/gI were comparable with that of HVT. Only gB1 and gI conferred synergism in rFPV containing these two genes. Protection by both rFPV/gB1gEgI (72%) and rFPV/gB1gEgIUL32(70%) against Marek's disease was significantly enhanced compared with a single gB1 or gI gene (40%). This protective synergism between gB1 and gI in rFPVs may be the basis for better protection when bivalent vaccines between serotypes 2 and 3 were used. When rFPV/gB1gIgEUL32 + HVT were used as vaccine against Md5 challenge, the protection was significantly enhanced (94%). This synergism between rFPV/gB1gIgEUL32 and HVT indicates additional genes yet to be discovered in HVT may be responsible for the enhancement. 3aimmunity 3achickens 3aFowlpox virus 3agene expression 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 2 3adisease resistance 3arecombinant vaccines 3avaccination 3asynergism 3aMarek disease 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aChick Embryo 2aChickens 2aDose-Response Relationship, Immunologic 2aDrug Synergism 2aFemale 2aFowlpoxxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aFowlpox virusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aGlycoproteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHerpesvirus 2, Gallidxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMale 2aMarek Diseasexprevention & controlxvirology. 2aVaccines, Syntheticxadministration & dosagexgeneticsximmunology. 2aViral Vaccinesxadministration & dosagexgeneticsximmunology. 0aGallid herpesvirus 21 aWitter, R.L.1 aReddy, S.M.1 aWu, P.1 aYanagida, N.1 aYoshida, S.0 tAvian diseases.g2003 July, v.  47, no.  3 p.549-558dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/60733Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/345053Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110119b20110205c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/06/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02960naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011300151300001800264500002000282520177600302592002802078650002602106650002102132650002402153650001002177650002002187650002002207650001202227650001202239650001302251650001202264650000702276650001502283700001102298700001302309700001202322773013402334856007302468852000902541655001202550IND60587887120221120104636.0180102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058788712DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.132802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, L.12aA phosphoethanolamine transferase specific for the 4′‐phosphate residue of Cronobacter sakazakii lipid A  ap. 1444-1456.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Investigate how Cronobacter sakazakii modify their lipid A structure to avoid recognition by the host immune cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lipid A modification was observed in C. sakazakii BAA894 grown at pH 5·0 but not pH 7·0. Overexpression of C. sakazakii gene ESA_RS09200 in Escherichia coli W3110 caused a phosphoethanolamine (PEA) modification of lipid A; when ESA_RS09200 was deleted in C. sakazakii BAA894, this lipid A modification disappeared. Lipid A modification was observed in BAA894 grown at pH 5·0 when the 1‐ phosphate residue of lipid A was removed, but disappeared when the 4′‐ phosphate residue of lipid A was removed. When ESA_RS16430, the orthologous gene of E. coli pmrA, was deleted in C. sakazakii BAA894, this PEA modification of lipid A was still observed, suggesting that this modification was not regulated by the PmrA‐PmrB system. Compared to the wild‐type BAA894, ESA_RS09200 deletion mutant showed decreased resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP), increased recognition by TLR4/MD2, decreased ability to invade and persist in mammalian cells. CONCLUSIONS: ESA_RS09200 in C. sakazakii BAA894 encodes a PEA transferase that specifically adds a PEA to the 4′‐phosphate residue of lipid A, but not regulated by the PmrA‐PmrB system. PEA modification of lipid A reduces recognition and killing by the host innate immune system. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study showed that modification of the lipid A moiety of C. sakazakii with PEA increased resistance to CAMP and recognition of the immune response although signalling of TLR4/MD2 cascade, suggesting that the organism could not successfully evade the host innate immune system without the transference of PEA to its lipid A moiety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCronobacter sakazakii 3aEscherichia coli 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3alipid A 3amammals 3amoieties 3amutants 3apH 3aphosphates1 aLi, Y.1 aWang, X.1 aGuo, W.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Nov., v. 121, no. 5 p.1444-1456dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.132803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010400208300001400312520148000326592002801806650001101834650001001845650001301855650001401868650000901882650001101891651001101902651002501913653001601938653002201954653001701976653002101993653002202014653002202036653001902058653003202077653002302109700005802132700002402190700002502214700001902239700002902258700006402287700006102351700001902412700003002431700006702461700001902528700002002547773010602567856008502673852000902758655001202767IND60612492620221119061007.0181214e20181230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061249262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2018.04.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7067-818910aInsights into Aurignacian daily life and camp organization: The open-air site of Régismont-le-Haut  ap. 69-98.  aRégismont-le-Haut, an Aurignacian open-air campsite, provides an occasion to investigate aspects of Aurignacian site variability that are rarely broached: (1) the relatively poorly known area connecting the Aquitaine and Mediterranean Basins, and (2) the high-resolution spatial organization of an Early Upper Palaeolithic campsite. While more difficult to integrate directly into chronological models of Aurignacian evolution, mostly derived from stratified rock-shelter and cave sites from the northern Aquitaine Basin, it is argued that studying open-air sites like Régismont-le-Haut can furnish detailed information that rock shelter/cave sites cannot, therefore providing critical building blocks and possible reading keys to help reconstruct prehistoric circulation systems and marry synchronic and diachronic perspectives on variability.A detailed description of the geomorphological and sedimentary context, as well as the differing materials and activities (lithic industry and use-wear, faunal remains, mineral colouring materials, personal ornamentation, limestone blocks, fireplaces) that occur on-site, is provided. A summary of activities occurring in two complementary loci ensues, followed by a preliminary spatial reading of one of the primary domestic units. The contemporaneity of the two loci is then treated, and the article finishes with a discussion regarding how Régismont-le-Haut fits both diachronically and synchronically within the Aurignacian.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3afauna 3aindustry 3alimestone 3aloci 3amodels 3aFrance 3aMediterranean region 0aAurignacian 0aOpen-air campsite 0aPalethnology 0aSpatial analysis 0aLithic technology 0aUse-wear analysis 0aPyrotechnology 0aMineral colouring materials 0aPersonal ornaments1 aLejay, Mathieu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5867-73941 aBrugal, Jean-Philip1 aCostamagno, Sandrine1 aHeckel, Claire1 ade Araujo Igreja, Marina1 aPradeau, Jean-Victor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2754-44061 aSalomon, Hélène1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8389-68551 aSellami, Farid1 aThéry-Parisot, Isabelle,1 aBarshay-Szmidt, Carolyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6781-00701 aMensan, Romain1 aBon, François,0 tQuaternary international.g2018 Dec. 30, v. 498 p.69-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04015naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009500168500001900263520220600282592002802488650001502516650002302531650002002554650002802574650003902602650001802641650002602659650002102685650001502706650001502721650001002736650001602746650001302762650001402775650001902789650001502808650001402823650001402837650000902851650001202860650001702872650002802889650001902917651001502936653004202951653002002993653002303013700002103036700001803057700002003075700002303095700001503118700001603133700001603149700001303165773010503178856008503283852000903368655001203377IND60657074320221118153835.0200405e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065707432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanchart, E.10aNitrogen supply reduces the earthworm-silicon control on rice blast disease in a Ferralsol  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRevealing belowground-aboveground relationships (BAR) is essential to drive ecological processes to address agriculture dysfunctions, especially in the management of aboveground plant diseases. Earthworms are one of the most important soil organisms involved in BAR, and silicon (Si) has been identified as a crucial element regulating aboveground plant health. How earthworm-Si interactions induce BAR in poor- and rich-nutrient soil contexts is still poorly understood, despite a growing interest in agricultural sustainability. We investigated the potential of BAR induced by the earthworm-silicon interaction to control the severity of rice blast disease in a Ferralsol in Madagascar, with or without NPK fertilization. We conducted a greenhouse microcosm experiment in which we manipulated the presence of the endogeic earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus and the fungus Pyricularia oryzae in a Ferralsol supplied or not with Si and fertilized with macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, i.e., NPK). After eight weeks of growth, plant biomass, nutrition and disease severity were measured. Our results validated the hypothesis that a dual treatment of earthworm inoculation and Si fertilization in a nutrient-poor tropical soil confers a higher tolerance of rainfed rice to P. oryzae, in comparison with treatments with only earthworms or Si, providing the optimal agronomic balance between a gain in biomass (and nutrition) and a reduction in disease severity. The supply of macronutrients altered this positive BAR by favouring the phenomenon of N-induced susceptibility. The aboveground plant C:N ratio of 15 is a threshold below which any increase in N per C unit likely enhances blast disease. The role of belowground interactions to counteract agricultural dysfunctions is supported by our study. To accomplish ecological intensification and provision of ecosystem services such as disease regulation, our findings recommend replacing excessive use of macronutrient fertilizer with sustained agricultural practices promoting the development of earthworm populations, such as organic matter inputs, superficial or no tillage, and the use of cover crops or conservation agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFerralsols 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aNPK fertilizers 3aPontoscolex corethrurus 3aagricultural conservation practice 3ablast disease 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adisease severity 3aearthworms 3aecosystems 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3apotassium 3arice 3asilicon 3asoil ecology 3asustainable agriculture 3atropical soils 3aMadagascar 0aBelowground-aboveground relationships 0aPlant nutrition 0aPyricularia oryzae1 aRatsiatosika, O.1 aRaveloson, H.1 aRazafimbelo, T.1 aRazafindrakoto, M.1 aSester, M.1 aBecquer, T.1 aBernard, L.1 aTrap, J.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2020 Jan., v. 145 p.103341-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013000164300001600294520137400310592002801684650001901712650002401731650001001755650001401765700001401779700001301793700001601806700001801822700001501840773012801855856008201983852000902065655001202074IND60764325220221118223005.0220126e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076432522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-021-0869-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Lijun10aNumerical modeling of the dynamic variation in multiphase CH4 during CO2 enhanced gas recovery from depleted shale reservoirs  ap. 790-802.  aRegarding CO₂ enhanced shale gas recovery, this work focuses on changes in the multiphase (free/adsorbed) CH₄ in the process of CO₂ enhanced shale gas recovery, by utilizing a rigorous numerical model with real geological parameters. This work studies nine injection well (IW) and CH₄ production well (PW) combinations of CO₂ to determine the influence of IW and PW locations on the dynamic interaction of multiphase CH₄ during 10000 d of CO₂ injection. The results indicate that the content of both the adsorbed CH₄ and free CH₄ is strongly variable before (and during) the CO₂-CH₄ displacement. In addition, during the simulation process, the proportion of the adsorbed CH₄ among all extracted CH₄ phases dynamically increases first and then tends to stabilize at 70%–80%. Moreover, the IW-PWs combinations significantly affect the outcomes of CO₂ enhanced shale gas recovery — for both the proportion of adsorbed/free CH₄ and the recovery efficiency. A longer IW-PW distance enables more adsorbed CH₄ to be recovered but results in a lower efficiency of shale gas recovery. Basically, a shorter IW-PWs distance helps recover CH₄ via CO₂ injection if the IW targets the bottom layer of the Wufeng-Longmaxi shale formation. This numerical work expands the knowledge of CO₂ enhanced gas recovery from depleted shale reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3amathematical models 3ashale 3ashale gas1 aZhang, Ye1 aLiu, Jun1 aLu, Zhaohui1 aZeng, Chunlin1 aZhao, Peng0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2021 Dec., v. 15, no. 4 p.790-802dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001783x2095-01957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-021-0869-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245015200184300001800336520169100354592002802045650001402073650002102087650002202108650001902130650003902149650001602188650001802204650001702222650001802239650001602257650000902273650001402282650001702296653002102313653001302334653002402347653001602371700002802387773013402415856008702549852000902636655001202645IND60584732020221119220636.0181010e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058473202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.10.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundaramurthy, Anandhakumar10aPolyelectrolyte capsules preloaded with interconnected alginate matrix: An effective capsule system for encapsulation and release of macromolecules  ap. 2251-2261.  aIn recent years, the design of stimuli-responsive hollow polymeric capsules is of tremendous interest for the scientific community because of the broad application of these capsules in the biomedical field. The use of weak polyelectrolytes as layer components for capsule fabrication is especially interesting as it results in hollow capsules that show unique release characteristics under physiological conditions. In this work, a methodology to prepare sub-micron sized alginate doped calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles through controlled precipitation in the presence of alginate is reported. Hollow capsules obtained by Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) are showing an interconnected alginate matrix in the interior of the capsules. Investigations showed that the presence of alginate matrix enhances the encapsulation of cationic molecules (e.g. doxorubicin hydrochloride) manifold by charge controlled attraction mechanism. Capsule permeability investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the transformation from an open state to closed state is accompanied by an intermediate state where capsules are neither open nor closed. Furthermore, time dependent study indicated that the encapsulation process is linear as a function of time. The cell viability experiments demonstrated excellent biocompatibility of hollow capsules with mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Anticancer investigations showed that DOX loaded capsules have significant anti-proliferative characteristics against HeLa cells. Such capsules have high potential for use as drug carrier for cationic drugs in cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiocompatibility 3acalcium carbonate 3acell viability 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adoxorubicin 3adrug carriers 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3afibroblasts 3amice 3aneoplasms 3apermeability 0aPAH/PMA capsules 0aAlginate 0aResponsive capsules 0aDoxorubicin1 aSundramoorthy, Ashok K.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Feb., v. 107 p.2251-2261dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.10.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300001600309520182700325592002802152650001102180650001502191650001702206650000902223650001502232650001302247650000902260650001702269650001302286650001402299650001202313650001102325650002202336651001002358700002702368700001702395700001502412700001302427700001502440700001702455773012802472856008202600852000902682655001202691IND60764325320221118223153.0220126e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076432532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-020-0836-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinkai10aInfluence of sedimentation and diagenesis on reservoir physical properties: a case study of the Funing Formation, Subei Basin, eastern China  ap. 892-908.  aThe sandstone of the third member of the Funing Formation (E₁f₃) in the northern slope zone of the Gaoyou Sag has the typical characteristics of high porosity and ultralow permeability, which makes it difficult for oil to flow. In this study, the lithological characteristics, sedimentary facies, diagenetic characteristics, pore structure, and seepage ability of this sandstone are characterized in detail. Correlation analysis is used to reveal the reason for the sandstone high porosity-low permeability phenomenon in the study area. The results indicate that this phenomenon is controlled mainly by the following three factors: 1) the sedimentary environment is the initial affecting factor, whereby the deposition of a large number of fine-grained materials reduces the primary pores of sandstone. 2) The Funing Formation has undergone strong compaction and cementation, which have led to the removal of most of the primary pores and a reduction in size of the throat channels. 3) Owing to fluid activity during the later stage of diagenesis, sandstone underwent intense dissolution and a large number of particles (feldspar and lithic debris) formed many dissolution pores (accounting for nearly 60% of the total pore space). Among these factors, dissolution has contributed the most to the development of high porosity-low permeability phenomenon. This is mainly attributed to the inhomogeneous dissolution process, whereby the degree of particle dissolution (e.g. feldspar) exceeds that of cementing minerals (clay and carbonate minerals). The secondary dissolution pores have increased the porosity of sandstone in the study area; however, the pore connectivity (permeability) has not been significantly improved, thus resulting in the special high porosity-low permeability characteristics of this sandstone.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarbonates 3acase studies 3aclay 3adiagenesis 3afeldspar 3aoils 3apermeability 3aporosity 3asandstone 3aseepage 3athroat 3atopographic slope 3aChina1 aFu, Bennett Yu-Hsiang,1 aYan, Zhaoxun1 aFu, Jialin1 aXie, Jun1 aLi, Kaikai1 aZhao, Yongfu0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2021 Dec., v. 15, no. 4 p.892-908dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001783x2095-01957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-020-0836-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011900162300001800281520193200299592002802231650002602259650001102285650001402296650002502310650000902335650002402344650001302368650002402381650001602405650001202421650001402433650002002447650002202467650001302489650001802502650001502520700001502535700001402550700001402564700001702578700001702595700001202612700001702624773009802641856008102739852000902820655001202829IND60124352820221118201914.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012435282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4373-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lifu10aExosome-like vesicles derived by Schistosoma japonicum adult worms mediates M1 type immune- activity of macrophage  ap. 1865-1873.  aExosomes are 30–100-nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that are released into the extracellular space upon fusion of the multi-vesicular bodies (MVB) with the plasma membrane, while initial studies described that the role of exosomes was a reticulocyte cargo-disposal mechanism allowing remodeling of the plasma membrane during the maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes. Recent studies indicate that exosomes are secreted by most cells and pathogens and play an important role in intercellular signaling and exert regulatory function by carrying bioactive molecules. As numerous pathogens, adult worm of Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) reside in mesenteric veins of definitive host including man and mammal animals. It was reported that the worms or the eggs also have specialized secretion systems to export effector proteins or other molecules into host target cells. However, the mechanisms involved remained unclear. This study investigated the isolation of the exosome-like vesicles secreted by S. japonicum adult worms and its immune activity on microphage in vitro. In this report, we identified exosome-based secretion as a new mechanism for protein secretion by S. japonicum. Electron microscopy tomography revealed the previously unidentified ultrastructural detail of exosome-like vesicles with high resolution; they were found to be typical spherical shape and to have a diverse population that varies in size of 30–100 nm. Exosome-like vesicles isolated from S. japonicum contained a significantly different protein compared with debris pelleted and the apoptosis body. We also demonstrate that macrophages were preferentially differentiated into the M1 subtype while being treated with S. japonicum exosome-like vesicles. This study reveals there are exosome-like vesicles derived by S. japonicum adult worms, and the exosome-like vesicles can mediate M1-type immune- activity of macrophage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3aeggs 3aelectron microscopy 3aexosomes 3aextracellular space 3amacrophages 3amammals 3apathogens 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein secretion 3aproteins 3areticulocytes 3atomography1 aLi, Zhitao1 aShen, Jia1 aLiu, Zhen1 aLiang, Jinyi1 aWu, Xiaoying1 aSun, Xi1 aWu, Zhongdao0 tParasitology research.g2015 May, v. 114, no. 5 p.1865-1873dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4373-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245009400205300001800299506007600317520117600393592002801569506003701597650001001634650001701644650001701661650001101678650002001689650001201709650002001721650001301741650001201754653002301766653002701789653002001816653003001836653003101866700001801897700001601915700001801931700001901949700002001968700001901988700001902007700002002026700001702046700001902063700001802082700002002100773019102120856007902311852000902390655001202399IND60230491320221207093612.0150614e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023049132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14196831122doi7 aPMC43118632pmcid7 a255646662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Kyungtae10aTissue-based metabolic labeling of polysialic acids in living primary hippocampal neurons  ap.

In this work, we developed a tissue-based strategy for metabolically incorporating an unnatural monosaccharide, peracetylated N -azidoacetyl- d -mannosamine, in the sialic acid biochemical pathway to present N -azidoacetyl sialic acid to PSA-NCAM. Although significant neurotoxicity was observed in the conventional metabolic labeling that used the dissociated neuron cells, neurotoxicity disappeared in this modified strategy, allowing for investigation of the temporal and spatial distributions of PSA in the primary hippocampal neurons. PSA-NCAM was synthesized and recycled continuously during neuronal development, and the two-color labeling showed that newly synthesized PSA-NCAMs were transported and inserted mainly to the growing neurites and not significantly to the cell body. This report suggests a reliable and cytocompatible method for in vitro analysis of glycans complementary to the conventional cell-based metabolic labeling for chemical glycobiology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacids 3acytotoxicity 3adissociation 3alipids 3amonosaccharides 3aneurons 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3atissues 0ametabolic labeling 0abioorthogonal reaction 0apolysialic acid 0a1,3-dipolar cycloaddition 0aprimary hippocampal neuron1 aJoo, Sunghoon1 aChoi, Ji Yu1 aGeum, Sujeong1 aHong, Seok-Pyo1 aLee, Seung-Yeul1 aKim, Yŏng-ho,1 aKim, Seong-Min1 aYoon, Myung-Han1 aNam, Yoonkey1 aLee, Kyung-Bok1 aLee, Hee-Yoon1 aChoi, Insung S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Jan. 20, v. 112, no. 3 p.E241-E248dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14196831123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011600157300001800273520111100291592002801402650001601430650001701446650002501463650001501488650002101503650001501524650001401539650002501553650001101578700001901589700001801608700002001626700002001646773014101666856007401807852000901881655001201890IND60641927320221121221446.0190506e20170214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064192732DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta09779k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJun, Sungwoo12aA pressure-induced bending sensitive capacitor based on an elastomer-free, extremely thin transparent conductor  ap. 3221-3229.  aAn elastomer-free, extremely thin (less than 2 μm), and highly transparent (higher than 95%) pressure–sensitive capacitor is successfully fabricated using a combination of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) and a percolated network of silver nanowires (AgNWs). The strong affinity of PVB to the polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) layer, which capped the AgNWs, stabilizes the sensor mechanically to an extent that it can resist 100 000 cycles of bending under a curvature radius of 200 μm. The strong hydrogen bonding interactions and entanglement of PVB chains make the cross-linked PVB freestanding and very strong, facilitating the reduction of the thickness to less than 2 μm. The capacitance is formed on an AgNW tandem compound electrode pattern by the fringing effect, which increases with an increase in the pressure-induced bending applied to the surface of the sensor. The sensitivity is three times higher than that of an elastomeric pressure sensor with the same sensor design. The use of the AgNW/PVB sensor as a wearable acupressure sensor and a transparent motion detector is successfully demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acrosslinking 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3asilver1 aHan, Chul Jong1 aKim, Youngmin1 aJu, Byeong-Kwon1 aKim, Jong-Woong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Feb. 14, v. 5, no. 7 p.3221-3229dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta09779k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001600273520059300289592002800882650001600910650001300926650001600939650001500955650001400970650001500984650001900999650001001018650001501028650001201043650001601055650001201071651000901083653001701092653001601109653001601125653001601141653000901157700002001166700002001186700001801206773009701224856008101321852000901402655001201411IND60520514320221120121232.0160521e20111008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052051432DNAL7 a10.2478/v10200-011-0034-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhahari, Hassan10aScarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) collected in Iranian rice fields and surrounding grasslands  ap. 465-474.  aScarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) comprise a group of species that are present in almost all agro-ecosystems.

The effect of individual pathogens/toxins on the intestinal epithelium has been well characterized: they disrupt barrier tissue in a variety of ways, such as by targeting tight junction proteins, or other elements of the junctions between adjacent cells. A variety of methods have been used to characterize disruption in barrier tissue, such as immunofluorescence, permeability assays and electrical measurements of epithelia resistance, but these methods remain time consuming, costly and ill-suited to diagnostics or high throughput toxicology.The advent of organic electronics has created a unique opportunity to interface the worlds of electronics and biology, using devices such as the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), whose low cost materials and potential for easy fabrication in high throughput formats represent a novel solution for assessing epithelial tissue integrity.In this study, OECTs were integrated with gastro-intestinal cell monolayers to study the integrity of the gastrointestinal epithelium, providing a very sensitive way to detect minute changes in ion flow across the cell layer due to inherent amplification by the transistor.We validate the OECT against traditional methods by monitoring the effect of toxic compounds on epithelial tissue. We show a systematic characterization of this novel method, alongside existing methods used to assess barrier tissue function.The toxic compounds induce a dramatic disruption of barrier tissue, and the OECT measures this disruption with increased temporal resolution and greater or equal sensitivity when compared with existing methods.

There is an eminent need for better biomarkers that can aid in patient care before the onset of the first cardiovascular event.We used quantitative proteomics to identify proteins with altered concentrations in plasma samples from four groups: 1) Individuals without cardiovascular symptoms and without the presence of coronary calcium, 2) individuals without cardiovascular symptoms, but with high amounts of coronary calcium, 3) individuals operated because of atherosclerotic diseases, and 4) individuals with an acute coronary syndrome. Immunoassays and SRM–MS were used for single patient verification of candidate proteins. Proteins involved in cardiovascular diseases i.e. serum amyloid protein A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] displayed an increased expression profile from groups 1 to 4. The top-most elevated protein, vinculin (Vcl) displayed a similar profile. Immunoassays confirmed the expression profile of apo(a) and CRP. A 5-plex SRM–MS assay for Vcl, SAA, CRP, apo(a) and thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) was developed for multiplex verification in all 120 individual samples. The 5-plex SRM assay confirmed a statistically significant up-regulation of Vcl in the acute coronary syndrome group.The aim of this study was to identify new candidate plasma markers of atherosclerosis manifestations, which may develop into screening-, diagnostic- or monitoring biomarkers for risk stratification of cardiovascular disease (CVD). At present no studies have elucidated the proteomic changes that occur along with several stages and manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. By using 4-plex iTRAQ, we identified and quantified proteins with altered concentrations in pooled plasma samples from 120 individuals from four middle-aged groups. Proteins involved in cardiovascular diseases i.e. serum amyloid protein A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] displayed an increased expression profile along with increased manifestations of CVD. A novel candidate marker was identified as vinculin (Vcl), a multi-protein linker that connects cell–matrix adhesions and cell–cell adhesions to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Immuno- and SRM-assays were used for single patient validation of candidate proteins. While further studies needs to address the role of Vcl in the development of atherosclerosis, the combined data provided in this report offers a catalog of the proteomic changes that occurs in plasma over several stages and manifestations of atherosclerotic disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aamyloid 3aatherosclerosis 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3achronic diseases 3acytoskeleton 3aimmunoassays 3amiddle-aged adults 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apatients 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arisk assessment 0aCT-noCa 0aCT-plusCa 0aSAD 0aACS 0aCVD 0aTEAB 0aHCD 0aSRM 0aAtherosclerosis 0aPlasma biomarker 0aProteomics 0aSelected-reaction-monitoring 0aImmunoassay 0aVinculin1 aLarsen, Martin R.1 aMickley, Hans1 aSaaby, Lotte1 aDiederichsen, Axel C.P.1 aLambrechtsen, Jess1 aRasmussen, Lars M.1 aOvergaard, Martin0 tJournal of proteomics.g2014 Apr. 14, v. 101 p.141-153dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2013.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012800162300001800290520166100308592002801969650003301997650002202030650002102052650003502073650001502108650001302123650001502136650001202151650000902163650000902172650002202181650002502203650000902228650001702237650001802254650001202272651001102284651001302295700001702308700001802325773014502343856008202488852000902570655001202579IND60593566720221120180801.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059356672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-017-9946-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijith, H.10aEstimation of soil loss and identification of erosion risk zones in a forested region in Sarawak, Malaysia, Northern Borneo  ap. 1365-1384.  aSoil loss has been quantified and land area categorized for soil erosion vulnerability in a partially forested subwatershed of the Baram River basin (Sarawak, Malaysia) using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, which considers climatic and terrain variables. The quantification of soil loss was achieved by integrating the parameters related to rainfall (R), soils (K), terrain (LS) and land use practices (C). The resultant maps of soil erosion show soil losses ranging from 0 to 1190 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ with a mean of 28 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ in the 1029 km² Sungai Patah subwatershed study area. The subwatershed was mapped using ArcGIS into five classes of soil erosion risk vulnerability. Among the five classes identified, very high and critically vulnerable zones show linear distribution in some areas which together constitute 13% of the total study area. High and medium erosion vulnerable zones cover 30 and 19%, respectively. Low erosion risk zones cover 36% of the total area. Mean soil loss assessed for each LULC (land use/land cover) class indicates that barren land with high slopes contributes comparatively high rates of soil loss (343 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹). Field surveys in the study region have enabled identification of erosion hot spots, such as logging areas, shifting cultivation areas and road construction, which intensely modify the terrain, and explain the linearity of critical and severe erosion risk features. The output of the present study will help to frame appropriate management strategies to minimize erosion through implementation of alternative methods in logging activities and terrain management programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3acomputer software 3acultivation area 3ageographic information systems 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alogging 3arain 3arisk 3aroad construction 3ashifting cultivation 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asubwatersheds 3asurveys 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia1 aSeling, L.W.1 aDodge-Wan, D.0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2018 June, v. 20, no. 3 p.1365-1384dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-017-9946-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245016800171300001800339520181000357592002802167650001202195650001102207650003502218650001902253650002202272650001302294650001502307650001502322650001702337650002502354650001602379650001902395650001702414651001102431700002302442700002102465773014502486856008202631852000902713655001202722IND60593566820221120180721.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059356682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-017-9923-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Kofahi, SalmanD.10aInvestigating the current status of geospatial data and urban growth indicators in Jordan and Irbid municipality: implications for urban and environmental planning  ap. 1067-1083.  aThe increasing levels of urbanization with intensive use of resources became a common problem across all countries. Jordan is a country with limited resources that require periodic assessment and frequent monitoring. The geospatial data, maps and urban growth indicators are fundamental requirements to monitor and evaluate cities expansion, development and resources use. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the availability and accessibility of geospatial data needed for city’s urban planning research and calculate recent urban growth indicators for Greater Irbid Municipality (GIM). All National governmental institutions were visited and surveyed. Landsat-8 images, geographic information system, classification workflow in ENVI-5 and statistical methods were used to assess selected urban growth indicators for GIM. The results showed that only one-fourth of Jordan national authorities use spatial data for urban planning. Researchers are expected to face complexities in identifying the available national geospatial data, accessing and acquisition of the available data with sufficient accuracy and comprehensiveness. The GIM showed lack of certain geospatial data (land use categories, population and built-up densities). These data were calculated, and results showed that the green, urban, open space densities for the year 2015 were 49, 25 and 26%, respectively. The population and built-up densities relative to the urban area was 7879 capita/km² and 20%, respectively. Therefore, the GIM is a dense city and its land use categories need to be monitored. Funds are needed to develop complete, comprehensive and accurate national geodata infrastructure that are governed with policies and regulations to facilitate researchers’ mission to support sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acities 3ageographic information systems 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amonitoring 3aopen space 3aspatial data 3astatistical analysis 3aurban areas 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aJordan1 aJamhawi, MontherM.1 aHajahjah, ZainA.0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2018 June, v. 20, no. 3 p.1067-1083dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-017-9923-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01384naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245012600156300001800282520021500300592002800515650002400543650002600567650001300593650001400606650001300620650001800633650001500651650001800666650001200684700001900696700001500715700001800730700002100748700001800769773012900787856007300916852000900989655001200998IND60657745120221121201025.0190816e20051116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065774512DNAL7 a10.1039/b511577a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, In-Soo,10aRhodium nanoparticles entrapped in boehmite nanofibers: recyclable catalyst for arene hydrogenation under mild conditions  ap. 5667-5669.  aA new recyclable rhodium catalyst was synthesized by a simple procedure from readily available reagents, which showed high activities in the hydrogenation of various arenes under 1 atm H₂ at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aboehmite 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3arhodium1 aKwon, Min Serk1 aKim, Namdu1 aLee, Jae Sung1 aKang, Kyung Yeon1 aPark, Jaiwook0 tChemical communications.g2005 Nov. 16, , no. 45 p.5667-5669dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b511577a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04999naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245006900161300001100230500000900241520326100250592002803511650002503539650001203564650001003576650001003586650001603596650002403612650001203636650001103648650002103659650000903680650002303689650001103712650002103723650002303744650001403767650001703781650001403798650001403812650001403826650002503840650001703865650000903882650002003891650001403911650001703925650001003942650001803952650001003970650002703980650000904007700001504016700002104031700001704052700001704069700001804086700001804104773012904122856007704251852000904328655001204337IND60677206220221120165501.0191123e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067720622DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2016.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelles, R. M.10aOrganic Trace Mineral Supplementation to Augment Pork Loin Color  ap. 47.  aepub  aObjectivesOver the past several years, pork meat has become lighter and paler in color, decreasing consumer acceptance. Furthermore, the National Pork Board aims to improve the subjective color score of pork meat by 2020. Increased paleness could be due to inadequate iron levels, which could decrease myoglobin synthesis and deposition in skeletal muscle. The objective of this study was to determine if organically complexed trace minerals would promote myoglobin content and increase redness in pork meat. Materials and MethodsAt the start of the finisher period, 24 pigs were randomly allocated to one of two treatments: (1) corn-soy phase diets supplemented with 0.15% inorganic trace mineral premix at standard NRC levels (CON) or (2) corn-soy phase diets supplemented with 0.15% organic trace mineral premix (Bioplex and Sel-Plex; Alltech Inc.) at standard NRC levels (OTM). Premixes provided equal supplementation of trace minerals (3 ppm Cu, 40 ppm Fe, 2 ppm Mn, 50 ppm Zn, 0.15 ppm Se, and 0.14 ppm I) and both diets contained an enzyme complex providing P and Ca uplifts (Allzyme SSF). Pigs were fed respective diets 28 d prior to slaughter. Carcasses were chilled at 4°C for 24 h before both loins (Longissimus lumborum) were removed. Six 2.54 cm boneless loin chops were cut from each loin for duplicate packaging treatment per display day. Two chops were placed without stacking on polystyrene trays and overwrapped with an air-permeable polyvinylchloride film. Samples were placed in a retail display cooler at 2 to 4°C for up to 7 d. Meat quality was evaluated for lipid and protein oxidation, water-holding capacity, color, and shear force on display d 0, 3, and 7. Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the significance of main treatment factors (diet and storage time). Least Significant Differences (LSD) all-pairwise multiple comparisons were performed to separate the means when a treatment effect was found significant (P < 0.05). ResultsOverall, lipid oxidation in the meat increased throughout storage; nonetheless, there was no significant difference between dietary treatments throughout retail display. Protein carbonyl content and purge loss was significantly lower in OTM samples on display d 3 and 7 than in CON. However, there was no difference between treatments after cooking. Shear force was 8% (P = 0.01) lower in OTM samples (27.52 ± 1.82 N) than in CON samples (30.00 ± 2.20 N) on d 7 only. Colorimetric L* (lightness) and b* (yellowness) values did not differ between dietary treatments. Although a* values (redness) were higher (P < 0.05) in OTM samples than in CON on retail storage d 3 and 7, the difference would not correspond to a notable visual effect. In agreement, myoglobin content was 33 and 18% higher in OTM samples than in CON on d 3 and 7, respectively. ConclusionThe results of this study revealed that dietary supplementation with organic trace minerals resulted in similar or improved meat quality attributes versus control samples. Although feeding dietary organic trace minerals during the finisher phase increased a* values and myoglobin content on storage d 3 and 7, the results did not correspond to a visual improvement of pork meat color in boneless loin chops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acalcium 3achops 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aconsumer acceptance 3acooking 3acopper 3afeed supplements 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3aloins (meat cut) 3alongissimus muscle 3amanganese 3ameat quality 3amyoglobin 3aoxidation 3apackaging 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolystyrenes 3apork 3askeletal muscle 3aslaughter 3astorage time 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3atrays 3awater holding capacity 3azinc1 aFrugé, E.1 aLindemann, M.

Quicker and economical ways to build up microfluidic systems will make point of care diagnostics viable. Printing is a low-cost technology that is increasingly used in emerging organic and flexible electronics and biosensors. In this paper, we present printed fluidic systems on flexible substrates made with pressure sensitive adhesive materials.Printable pressure sensitive adhesive materials have been used for making microfluidic systems. Flexible substrates have been used, and two types of adhesive materials, one thermally dried and another UV curable, have been tested. Top sealing layer was laminated directly on top of the printed microfluidic structure. Flow tests were done with deionized water.Flow tests with deionized water show that both adhesive materials are suitable for capillary flow driven fluidic devices. Flow test using water as dielectric material was also done successfully on a printed electrolyte gated organic field effect transistor with an integrated microfluidic system.Due to its ease of process and low cost, printed microfluidic system is believed to find more applications in biosensing devices.

These are compared with maximum dose volumes recommended in good practice guidelines. The volumes administered during safety tests frequently exceeded recommended maximums, giving rise to concerns that these tests may seriously compromise animal welfare. This was particularly the case for live liquid vaccines and for vaccines recommended for intramuscular injection. The volumes used in testing vaccines for avian species exceeded the recommended maximums by the greatest amount. The administration of test doses should be performed in a way that minimises pain and discomfort. The refinement of tests by dividing large dose volumes and delivering them over multiple sites is discussed, but it is recognised that there are technical limitations, which in some cases may cause difficulties with fulfilling the purpose of the tests. Previously, the relevance of batch safety tests has been widely criticised, due to a lack of evidence that they contribute to the safety of veterinary medicines. By showing that the conduct of target animal safety tests can involve injection volumes that compromise the welfare of the animals involved, this analysis highlights the need for a more critical assessment of the necessity and justification for these tests.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3avolume 3aanimal welfare 3alaboratory animals 3asafety testing 3aguidelines 3ainjection 3acase studies 3apharmacokinetics 3aEurope0 tATLA.

Early postmortem loin quality is correlated with aged loin quality. However, it is unclear if those correlations differ between pigs raised for lean growth and pigs raised for quality where compositional and fiber type differences likely exist. The objective was to compare correlations among early postmortem loin quality characteristics and aged loin and chop quality characteristics between pigs sired by boars of either Duroc (D, meat quality) or Pietrain (P, lean growth) ancestry. Materials and MethodsEarly and aged loin quality traits were measured on 80 barrows and 80 gilts, slaughtered over 4 d. Pigs were held in lairage for approximately 16 h and immobilized using head-to-heart electrical stunning. Carcasses were chilled at 4°C for a minimum of 20 h. Early (1 d postmortem) quality measures included ultimate pH, instrumental color (L*, a*, b*), and visual color, marbling, and subjective firmness on the ventral surface of boneless loins. Loins were vacuum-packaged and aged at 4°C for 14 d. Loins were removed from packaging, exposed to oxygen, and reevaluated on the ventral surface for the same loin quality traits (aged quality). Aged loins were sliced into 2.54 cm thick chops, and exposed to oxygen. Quality measurements were measured on the chop-face. Chops were cooked to an internal temperature of 63°C for Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and cook loss. Data were grouped into 2 data sets based on sire line. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated and transformed using Fisher’s r to z transformation in the CORR procedure in SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) to compare correlations between sire lines. Correlations between traits were considered moderately correlated at |r| ≥ 0.36. Correlation comparisons between sire lines were considered different at P ≤ 0.05. ResultsEarly ultimate pH was correlated with aged ventral L*, chop L*, and chop color (D, |r| ≥ 0.43; P, |r| ≥ 0.33). However, correlations did not differ (P ≥ 0.10) between the Duroc and Pietrain sired pigs. Early ventral L* was correlated with aged ventral pH, aged ventral L*, aged ventral color, and chop color (D, |r| ≥ 0.52; P, |r| ≥ 0.28), but not WBSF or cook loss (D, |r| ≤ 0.09; P |r| ≤ 0.06). Early ventral a* was correlated with aged ventral a* and chop a* (D, |r| ≥ 0.33; P, |r| ≥ 0.44), but not with WBSF or cook loss (D, |r| ≤ 0.03; P, |r| ≤ 0.06). None of these correlation comparisons differed (P ≥ 0.06) between the Duroc and Pietrain sired pigs, with the exception of early ventral L*. Early ventral L* was strongly correlated with chop L* in Duroc pigs (|r| = 0.64), but was only weakly correlated in Pietrain pigs (|r| = 0.35, P = 0.02). ConclusionEarly loin pH was correlated with color and water-holding capacity regardless of sire line. Early ventral color measurements were correlated with aged ventral and chop color measurements, but not with tenderness. Early ultimate pH, L*, and a* could be used as indicators of aged color. With the exception of early ventral L*, there were no differences in early and aged postmortem correlations between Duroc and Pietrain sired pigs, indicating that sire line does not need to be accounted for when using early quality traits to predict aged quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aPietrain 3aancestry 3abarrows 3aboars 3achops 3acolor 3adata collection 3aeconomic valuation 3afinishing 3afirmness 3agilts 3ainternal temperature 3alairage 3aloins (meat cut) 3amarbling 3ameat aging 3aoxygen 3apH 3apork 3apork quality 3ashear stress 3asires 3astunning methods 3aswine feeding 3avacuum packaging 3awater holding capacity1 aSchunke, E.

Nevertheless, a small amount of research has been undertaken to investigate the impact of these biocompatible nanoparticles on cell lipid profile. The purpose of the present investigation was to explore changes in lipid components occurring in human carcinoma HeLa cells when exposed to short-term treatments (2 and 4h) with monoolein-based cubosomes stabilized by Pluronic F108 (MO/PF108). A combination of TLC and reversed-phase HPLC with DAD and ELSD detection was performed to analyze cell total fatty acid profile and levels of phospholipids, free cholesterol, triacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters. The treatments with MO/PF108 cubosomes, at non-cytotoxic concentration (83μg/mL of MO), affected HeLa fatty acid profile, and a significant increase in the level of oleic acid 18:1 n-9 was observed in treated cells after lipid component saponification. Nanoparticle uptake modulated HeLa cell lipid composition, inducing a remarkable incorporation of oleic acid in the phospholipid and triacylglycerol fractions, whereas no changes were observed in the cellular levels of free cholesterol and cholesteryl oleate. Moreover, cell-based fluorescent measurements of intracellular membranes and lipid droplet content were assessed on cubosome-treated cells with an alternative technique using Nile red staining. A significant increase in the amount of the intracellular membranes and mostly in the cytoplasmic lipid droplets was detected, confirming that monoolein-based cubosome treatment influences the synthesis of intracellular membranes and accumulation of lipid droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3acholesterol 3acholesteryl esters 3adroplets 3adrugs 3afatty acid composition 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3aphospholipids 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asaponification 3astaining 3atriacylglycerols 0aLipid-based cubosomes 0aLipid composition 0aFatty acid profile 0aNile red 0aImage analysis1 aMurgia, Sergio1 aPutzu, Danilo1 aMeli, Valeria1 aFalchi, Angela Maria0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2015 Oct., v. 191 p.96-105dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002100187245006100208300001600269506007600285520129200361592002801653506003701681650002701718650001401745650004301759650001301802700001801815700001801833700001901851700002401870700002001894700001901914773011201933856008102045852000902126655001202135IND60624992720221207062825.0190701e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062499272DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217093554872doi7 aPMC37582412pmcid7 a201856122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuggiero, Laurie10aSupporting Diabetes Self-Care in Underserved Populations  ap. 127-131.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPurpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an innovative intervention that utilized a certified medical assistant with specific diabetes training to work with a multidisciplinary diabetes care team to help provide basic diabetes education and self-care support in low-income minority populations with type 2 diabetes. Methods Enrolled participants were randomized to either the medical assistant coaching (MAC) group (N = 25) or the treatment as usual (TAU) group (N = 25). Deidentified data was obtained on a matched no contact control (NCC) group (N = 50). Results Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) comparisons revealed no significant differences between the 3 groups on A1C, but a trend was observed. A1Cs decreased across time for the MAC group, while increasing for the TAU and NCC groups. ANCOVA comparisons also indicated that the MAC group experienced significantly greater increases in perceived empowerment and a larger, although non-significant, reduction in perceived diabetes related problems than the TAU group. Conclusions This randomized controlled pilot study suggests that the inclusion of a medical assistant self-care coach as part of the diabetes care team holds promise in improving outcomes and should be further examined in a large-scale study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of covariance 3aeducation 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ateachers1 aMoadsiri, Ada1 aButler, Paula1 aOros, Susan M.1 aBerbaum, Michael L.1 aWhitman, Steven1 aCintron, Daisy0 tDiabetes educator.g2010 Mar., v. 36, no. 1 p.127-131dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217093554873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009300155300001800248520130000266592002801566650001401594650001601608650001101624650002601635650002101661650001501682650001101697650001901708650001101727650002101738650001701759650000901776700001401785700001701799700002001816700001701836700001701853700001501870773014101885856007402026852000902100655001202109IND60641927720221121221522.0190506e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064192772DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta09805c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Yang10aMixed-metallic MOF based electrode materials for high performance hybrid supercapacitors  ap. 1094-1102.  aMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have obtained increasing attention as a kind of novel electrode material for energy storage devices. Yet low capacity in most MOFs largely thwarts their application. In this study, an effective strategy was developed to improve the conductivity of MOFs by partially substituting Ni²⁺ in the Ni-MOF with Co²⁺ or Zn²⁺. The mixed-metal organic frameworks (M-MOFs) showed excellent electrochemical performance, which is attributed not only to the favorable paths for charge transport due to the presence of free pores, but also to the raised electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) at the enlarged specific surface area of the material. Meanwhile, the cycling stability of the assembled hybrid supercapacitors (M-MOFs//CNTs–COOH) is enhanced due to the alleviation of phase transformation during electrochemical cycling tests. More interestingly, the Co/Ni-MOF//CNTs–COOH also exhibited an excellent energy density (49.5 W h kg⁻¹) and power density (1450 W kg⁻¹) simultaneously. These values demonstrated the better performance of all the MOF materials in supercapacitors at present. In addition to broadening the application of MOFs, our study may open a new avenue for bridging the performance gap between batteries and supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acapacitance 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3anickel 3aphase transition 3asurface area 3azinc1 aPei, Jian1 aChen, Dahong1 aYan, Chunshuang1 aHu, Yongyuan1 aZhang, Qiang1 aChen, Gang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 5, no. 3 p.1094-1102dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta09805c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245015500181300001600336520085600352592002801208650001701236650006601253650001801319650002101337650001401358650003901372650001901411650000901430653000901439653001301448653000901461653000701470653000701477653000801484653000701492653000701499653000701506653000701513653000701520653000801527653000901535653000901544653000901553653000801562653000801570653000901578653002701587653002601614653001301640653001301653653001701666700002501683700001901708700002201727773010001749856008701849852000901936655001201945IND60628516120221117222644.0190402e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062851612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhadiri Khozroughi, Amin10aInvestigation of the post mortem zinc protoporphyrin IX fluorescence with respect to its protein-bound and unbound occurrence in aqueous meat extracts  ap. 462-467.  aZinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) is known to accumulate in most meat products during storage. However, the pathway of its formation is not yet completely clarified. To gain more insights into the specificity of ZnPP occurrence, a SEC-HPLC-UV-fluorescence setup was established to screen the proteins in aqueous meat extracts for their ZnPP fluorescence during incubation. In accordance with previous studies it was identified by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS that ZnPP formation takes place in myoglobin. In this study, valuable new insights into the ZnPP forming pathway were gained, as our results indicated that a significant part of ZnPP – after being formed within the protein – is transitioned into free ZnPP during incubation. Additionally, the obtained results implied that ZnPP may also occur in proteins of higher molecular weight (>100 kDa).  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ameat extracts 3amolecular weight 3amyoglobin 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotoporphyrin 3azinc 0aFECH 0aSEC-HPLC 0aZnPP 0aPP 0aLL 0aFRC 0aCA 0atR 0aMb 0aHb 0aRT 0aDMF 0aDMSO 0aFePP 0aHCCA 0aTFA 0aPMF 0aMeat 0aFluorescence screening 0aPost mortem chemistry 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSEC-HPLC 0aMALDI-TOF-MS1 aBraga, Tess Waldbach1 aWagner, Janine1 aRawel, Harshadrai0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 15, v. 283 p.462-467dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04928naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245014100159300001400300500000900314520336800323592002803691650000903719650001803728650001103746650001103757650001403768650001103782650002103793650001303814650002003827650001103847650001603858650002603874650002403900650002303924650001103947650001603958650001703974651001603991651000904007700001704016700001704033700001604050700002004066700001804086700001804104700001704122700002104139773012804160856007704288852000904365655001204374IND60677206520221120165631.0191123e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067720652DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2018.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrey, L.

Each set within a strip loin pair were randomly assigned a degree of doneness (DOD): very-rare (VR; 55°C), rare (RA; 60°C), medium-rare (MR; 63°C), medium (ME; 71°C), well-done (WD; 77°C), or very well-done (VWD; 82°C), so that each carcass had representation for each DOD. Steaks were cooked to their designated DOD on a clamshell grill (Cuisinart Griddler Deluxe, Model GR-150, Stamford, CT) with temperatures monitored using a probe thermometer (Super-Fast Thermopen, ThermoWorks, American Fork, UT). From each DOD group, one steak was used for Slice Shear force (SSF), Warner Braztler shear force (WBSF), pressed juice percentage (PJP), and cooked proximate analysis. The other 2 steaks were assigned to consumer or trained sensory testing. Data were analyzed as a split-plot with the whole plot factor of quality treatment and sub-plot factor of degree of doneness. ResultsThere was an interaction (P < 0.05) between DOD and quality treatment for cooked moisture (CM), cooked fat (CF), and cooked moisture + fat (CMF). Select Enhanced contained the greatest (P < 0.05) CM content, and Prime the least (P < 0.05) across all DOD. Select had similar (P > 0.05) CM to Low Choice at R, M, and VWD. At VR, R, and MR, Prime contained the greatest (P < 0.05) CF content, followed by Top Choice and Low Choice, with Select having similar (P > 0.05) CF content to Select Enhanced. However, when cooked to M and higher, Low Choice, Select, and Select Enhanced had similar (P > 0.05) CF. Prime was similar (P > 0.05) to Select Enhanced for CMF when cooked to R and MR, and similar (P > 0.05) to Top Choice at VR, MR, and M. Top Choice, Low Choice and Select samples had similar (P > 0.05) CMF when cooked to VR, R, and VWD. When evaluating the correlation coefficients, CM was associated (P < 0.01) with consumer juiciness (r = 0.27), tenderness (r = 0.17), flavor liking (r = 0.23), and overall liking (r = 0.19), while CF was associated (P < 0.05) with consumer juiciness (r = 0.12) and tenderness (r = 0.15).The strongest (P < 0.01) correlations for consumer juiciness, tenderness, flavor liking, and overall liking occurred with CMF (r = 0.69, r = 0.56, r = 0.45, and r = 0.49, respectively). A logistic regression was performed to predict the probability of a sample being rated juicy by consumers using CMF, and had an adjusted R² value of 0.47. The model identified CMF percentages of 68.25, 69.85, and 71.20% for a probability of 50, 75, and 90% for a consumer rating a steak juicy. ConclusionCombined, cooked moisture and fats showed the strongest association with consumer sensory scores and could be used to predict whether a strip steak would be rated juicy by a consumer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3adata analysis 3aflavor 3ajuices 3ajuiciness 3alipids 3aloins (meat cut) 3amarbling 3ameat tenderness 3amodels 3aprobability 3aproximate composition 3aregression analysis 3asensory evaluation 3asteaks 3atemperature 3athermometers 3aConnecticut 3aUtah1 aPrill, L.

Crystals with tin-rich copper-poor and with zinc-rich copper-poor stoichiometries were obtained. The crystals were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, photocurrent spectroscopy and electroreflectance spectroscopy using electrolyte contacts as well as by spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL)/decay. Near-resonance Raman spectra indicate that the CZTS crystals adopt the kesterite structure with near-equilibrium residual disorder. The corrected external quantum efficiency of the p-type crystals measured by photocurrent spectroscopy approaches 100% close to the bandgap energy, indicating efficient carrier collection. The bandgap of the CZTS crystals estimated from the external quantum efficiency spectrum measured using an electrolyte contact was found to be 1.64–1.68 eV. An additional sub-bandgap photocurrent response (Urbach tail) was attributed to sub bandgap defect states. The room temperature PL of the crystals was attributed to radiative recombination via tail states, with lifetimes in the nanosecond range. At high excitation intensities, the PL spectrum also showed evidence of direct band to band transitions at ∼1.6 eV with a shorter decay time. Electrolyte electroreflectance spectra and spectra of the third derivative of the optical dielectric constant in the bandgap region were fitted to two optical transitions at 1.71 and 1.81 eV suggesting a larger valence band splitting than predicted theoretically. The high values of the EER broadening parameters (192 meV) indicate residual disorder consistent with the existence of tail states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3acopper zinc tin sulfide 3acrystals 3adielectric properties 3aelectric current 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aiodine 3aphotoluminescence 3aspectral analysis 3avapors1 aWeller, Mark T.1 aKissling, Gabriela P.1 aPeter, Laurence M.1 aDale, Phillip1 aBabbe, Finn1 ade Wild, Jessica1 aWenger, Bernard1 aSnaith, Henry J.1 aLane, David0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 5, no. 3 p.1192-1200dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta09817g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011900161300001600280520156500296592002801861650001101889650001401900650002101914650002201935650002701957650001701984650001602001700002402017700002202041700002202063773010502085856004002190852000902230655001202239IND50073777320221120074941.0140310e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007377732DNAL7 a10.1111/een.120762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚNIEGULA, SZYMON10aPhotoperiod and variation in life history traits in core and peripheral populations in the damselfly Lestes sponsa  ap. 137-148.  aIn order to predict evolutionary responses to environmental changes one needs to identify the evolutionary potential in terms of genetic variation of traits and of the traits' plasticity. We studied genetic variance in life history traits and their reaction norms in response to manipulated photoperiods in central, northern, and northernmost peripheral populations of the damselfly Lestes sponsa (Hansemann). After the central‐marginal hypothesis, it is predicted that central populations will express the highest genetic variance. Northern and northernmost populations showed the highest development and growth rates. All populations expressed shorter development and accelerated growth when raised in a northern compared with a central latitude photoperiod. The slopes of reaction norms differed between regions resulting in a region‐by‐photoperiod interaction. There was genetic variation in development time; however, it did not differ across regions. There was no genetic variation in growth rate or in the plasticity of development time and growth rate to photoperiod. Results did not support the central‐marginal hypothesis. However, evidence was found that the development time has the potential to evolve at similar rates across study regions. In contrast, the growth rate seems to be genetically constrained for further evolution, probably because of a strong past directional selection on this trait. The presence of low genetic variation in the slope of the reaction norms could be a result of stabilising selection imposed by seasonality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLestes 3aevolution 3agenetic variance 3agenetic variation 3agrowth and development 3alife history 3aphotoperiod1 aDROBNIAK, SZYMON M.1 aGOŁĄB, MARIA J.1 aJohansson, Frank,0 tEcological entomology.g2014 Apr., v. 39, no. 2 p.137-148dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12076  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002600183245008400209300001600293506007600309520172300385592002802108506003702136650002602173650001502199650001702214650001002231650002002241650001302261650001202274650001402286650001102300650001402311650001302325650002002338650001602358650001202374700002202386700002502408700002102433700002302454700002302477700002102500700001802521700002002539700002202559700002302581700003002604700002202634700002202656700002502678773009002703856008202793852000902875655001202884IND4487126320221207065349.0120502e20120107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448712632DNAL7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.07202doi7 aPMC32236512pmcid7 a216326262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCadena, Carlos Daniel10aLatitude, elevational climatic zonation and speciation in New World vertebrates  ap. 194-201.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany biodiversity hotspots are located in montane regions, especially in the tropics. A possible explanation for this pattern is that the narrow thermal tolerances of tropical species and greater climatic stratification of tropical mountains create more opportunities for climate-associated parapatric or allopatric speciation in the tropics relative to the temperate zone. However, it is unclear whether a general relationship exists among latitude, climatic zonation and the ecology of speciation. Recent taxon-specific studies obtained different results regarding the role of climate in speciation in tropical versus temperate areas. Here, we quantify overlap in the climatic distributions of 93 pairs of sister species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles restricted to either the New World tropics or to the Northern temperate zone. We show that elevational ranges of tropical- and temperate-zone species do not differ from one another, yet the temperature range experienced by species in the temperate zone is greater than for those in the tropics. Moreover, tropical sister species tend to exhibit greater similarity in their climatic distributions than temperate sister species. This pattern suggests that evolutionary conservatism in the thermal niches of tropical taxa, coupled with the greater thermal zonation of tropical mountains, may result in increased opportunities for allopatric isolation, speciation and the accumulation of species in tropical montane regions. Our study exemplifies the power of combining phylogenetic and spatial datasets of global climatic variation to explore evolutionary (rather than purely ecological) explanations for the high biodiversity of tropical montane regions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aallopatric speciation 3aamphibians 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3adata collection 3alatitude 3amammals 3amountains 3aniches 3aphylogeny 3areptiles 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atropics1 aKozak, Kenneth H.1 aGÃ³mez, Juan Pablo1 aParra, Juan Luis1 aMcCain, Christy M.1 aBowie, Rauri C.

We thus evaluated the sediment filtering capabilities of natural herbaceous buffer strips under tropical highland climatic conditions. Overland flow samples were collected at field edges and at various positions in herbaceous buffers and tested for total suspended sediment, nitrate‐nitrogen and total phosphorus. There was a significant effect (P < 0.05) of distance from field edge on the mean values of nutrients. On average, a 10.0 m herbaceous buffer reduced the total phosphorus by 99%, total suspended sediment by 94% and nitrate‐nitrogen by 85%. Altogether, the results suggest that herbaceous buffer strips are important to include in watershed management in agriculturally dominated tropical highlands in order to control sediment loss, stream siltation and the washout of nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3aclimatic factors 3aconservation buffers 3aedge effects 3ahighlands 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrients 3aoverland flow 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3asediments 3astreams 3asuspended sediment 3awatershed management1 aBahrndorff, Simon1 aAlemayehu, Esayas1 aAmbelu, Argaw0 tWater and environment journal.g2017 Nov., v. 31, no. 4 p.522-527dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.122743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245015600166500001900322520137600341592002801717650001101745650001301756650001501769650001101784650002201795650001101817650001801828650001401846650001101860650002401871650001901895650001501914650001401929650001701943653001301960653002901973653001802002653001902020700001402039700005402053700001602107773010502123856008702228852000902315655001202324IND60729054620221119233253.0210619e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072905462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1263702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, J.H.10aFacile one-step hydrothermal fabrication of Allium giganteum-like superhydrophobic coating on Mg alloy with self-cleaning and anti-corrosion properties  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSuperhydrophobic coating can act as the anti-corrosion layer for Mg alloy due to its water-repellency. The construction of such coating is dominated by the roughness and surface energy, which is expected to achieve in one-step to improve the weak adsorption phenomenon of surface modification during traditional approaches. Therefore, a superhydrophobic coating composed of CeO₂ and cerium stearate (Ce(CH₃(CH₂)₁₆COO)₃) is fabricated via a facile hydrothermal method. The synthesis of Ce(CH₃(CH₂)₁₆COO)₃ passivates the surface of CeO₂ nanosheets, leading to a reduction of surface energy and the formation of an Allium giganteum-like structure which presents a micro-nano hierarchical roughness. This unique structure with high roughness and low surface energy is responsible for the excellent superhydrophobic behavior of coating which has high water contact angle (WCA) of 164° and low rolling angle (RA) of 4.1°. The superhydrophobic coating also displays an outstanding self-cleaning behavior due to its low surface adhesion. The corrosion rate of prepared coating in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of bare Mg alloy. This remarkably enhanced corrosion resistance arises from the decrease in contact area between the corrosion solution and sample due to the water-repellency of coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aalloys 3aaqueous solutions 3acerium 3acontact angle 3acorrosion 3aenergy 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3ananosheets 3aroughness 3astearic acid 0aMg alloy 0aSuperhydrophobic coating 0aSelf-cleaning 0aAnti-corrosion1 aSun, G.X.1 aTong, L.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1252-89911 aJiang, Z.H.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 May 20, v. 617 p.126370-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1263703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01255naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245015200160300001800312520025700330592002800587650001200615650001300627650002300640650001900663650001300682700002600695700002200721773012900743856007200872852000900944655001200953IND60657745920221122235254.0190816e20051129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065774592DNAL7 a10.1039/b511714c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, William J.10aSamarium versus aluminium Lewis acidity in a mixed alkyl carboxylate complex related to alkylaluminium activation in diene polymerization catalysis  ap. 5925-5927.  a[(C₅Me₅)₂Sm(μ-O₂CPh)]₂ reacts with ⁱBu₃Al to form a mixed bridge samarium aluminium complex [(C₅Me₅)₂Sm(μ-O₂CPh)(μ-ⁱBu)Al(ⁱBu)₂], that displays two different carboxylate orientations toward the metals in a single crystal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aaluminum 3acatalytic activity 3apolymerization 3asamarium1 aChampagne, Timothy M.1 aZiller, Joseph W.0 tChemical communications.g2005 Nov. 29, , no. 47 p.5925-5927dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b511714c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009600166300001600262520096400278592002801242650001601270650001901286650001401305650002801319650001901347650000901366650002001375650002101395650001601416650001701432650002301449650001601472653001701488653002801505653001101533653001601544653002201560653002801582653002501610700001301635700001701648773010001665856008701765852000901852655001201861IND60628516620221117222638.0190402e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062851662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lu10aImprovement of nutritional quality of soybean meal by Fe(II)-assisted acetic acid treatment  ap. 475-480.  aWe investigated the effect of Fe(II)-assisted acetic acid treatment on improvement of nutrition quality of soybean meal (SBM) by degrading antinutritional factors (ANFs) and maintaining initial nutrition quality. Fe(II)-assistance reduced trypsin inhibitor (TI) content significantly from 5.20 to 0.86 mg/g, and allergenic proteins were completely degraded at 55 °C, due to changes in the conformation of soybean protein isolate (SPI) that renders proteins more prone to acetic acid-mediated degradation. The red-shift of maximum emission wavelength indicated that Fe(II)-assisted acid induced molecular unfolding of SPI and increased surface hydrophobicity. Investigation of protein secondary structure revealed that Fe(II)-assisted acid treatment decreased the β-sheet structure by 4.65% and increased the α-helical content by 7.37%. This demonstrated that Fe(II) and acetic acid synergistically degrade ANFs by altering protein conformations in SBM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacid treatment 3aallergens 3aantinutritional factors 3ahydrophobicity 3airon 3anutritive value 3aprotein isolates 3asoy protein 3asoybean meal 3atrypsin inhibitors 3awavelengths 0aSoybean meal 0aAntinutritional factors 0aFe(II) 0aAcetic acid 0aNutrition quality 0aSoybean protein isolate 0aProtein conformation1 aXu, Yong1 aZhou, Yanmin0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 15, v. 283 p.475-480dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04460naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003700155245017600192300001400368500001500382520194700397592002802344650004402372650001202416650002202428650001902450650001502469650002302484650001402507650002802521650001102549650003802560650001402598650004402612650001902656650001502675650002602690650001902716650002502735653000802760653000902768653000802777653000802785653001402793653000802807653000802815653000902823653000702832653000902839653000702848653002402855653001002879653001602889653000702905653000902912653000802921653000902929653001702938653000802955653000802963653002302971653000802994700003103002700002903033700003803062700003203100700003303132700002203165700002003187700002503207700003103232700002503263700002803288700002803316700003003344773012103374856009003495852000903585655001203594IND60539210920221120182307.0190214e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053921092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes de Azambuja, Carla Roberta10aPhysico-chemical characterization of asolectin–genistein liposomal system: An approach to analyze its in vitro antioxidant potential and effect in glioma cells viability  ap. 24-35.  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, the interaction between soy isoflavone genistein and asolectin liposomes was investigated by monitoring the effects of isoflavone on lipidic hydration, mobility, location and order. These properties were analyzed by the following techniques: horizontal attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (HATR-FTIR), low-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-field 31P NMR, zeta potential, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The antioxidant and antitumoral activities of the genistein liposomal system were also studied. The genistein saturation concentration in ASO liposomes corresponded to 484μM. HATR–FTIR results indicated that genistein influences the dynamics of the lipidic phosphate, choline, carbonyl and acyl chain methylenes groups. At the lipid polar head, HATR–FTIR and 31P NMR results showed that the isoflavone reduces the hydration degree of the phosphate group, as well as its mobility. Genistein ordered the lipid interfacial carbonyl group, as evidenced by the HATR–FTIR bandwidth analysis. This ordering effect was also observed in the lipidic hydrophobic region, by HATR–FTIR, NMR, DSC and turbidity responses. At the saturation concentration, liposome-loaded genistein inhibits the lipid peroxidation induced by hydroxyl radical in 90.9%. ASO liposome-loaded genistein at 100μM decreased C6 glioma cell viability by 57% after 72h of treatment. Results showed an increase of the genistein in vitro activities after its incorporation in liposomes. The data described in this work will contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between genistein and a natural-source membrane and of its influence on isoflavone biological activities. Furthermore, the antitumoral results showed that genistein-based liposomes, which contain natural-sourced lipids, may be promising as a drug delivery system to be used in the glioma therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3acholine 3ahydroxyl radicals 3acell viability 3amonitoring 3alipid peroxidation 3aturbidity 3aantineoplastic activity 3alipids 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agenistein 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3aphosphates 3adrug delivery systems 3azeta potential 3aantioxidant activity 0aΔH 0aFTIR 0aMTT 0aNMR 0aGenistein 0aFID 0aDLS 0aDMPC 0aτ 0aDMEM 0aOH 0aAsolectin liposomes 0aTBARS 0aHATR–FTIR 0aν 0aDPPC 0aFBS 0aS.D. 0aantioxidants 0aTSP 0aASO 0aSpectroscopy study 0aDSC1 ados Santos, Lurdiane Gomes1 aRodrigues, Marisa Raquel1 aRodrigues, Renan Ferreira Meneses1 ada Silveira, Elita Ferreira1 aAzambuja, Juliana Hofstatter1 aFlores, Alex F.C.1 aHorn, Ana Paula1 aDora, Cristiana Lima1 aMuccillo-Baisch, Ana Luisa1 aBraganhol, Elizandra1 ada Silva Pinto, Luciano1 aParize, Alexandre Luís1 ade Lima, Vânia Rodrigues0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2015 Dec., v. 193 p.24-35dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245017000164300001400334520131400348592002801662650001701690650002501707650001001732650001901742650001401761650001701775650002001792650002201812650002001834650002201854650001101876650001601887650002201903650001001925700002201935700001701957773012601974856004802100852000902148655001202157IND4505689120221121231710.0150617e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450568912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-011-0502-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chu-Chih10aExposure reconstruction using a physiologically based toxicokinetic model with cumulative amount of metabolite in urine: a case study of trichloroethylene inhalation  ap. 21-31.  aThe use of a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model to reconstruct chemical exposure using human biomonitoring data, urinary metabolites in particular, has not been fully explored. In this paper, the trichloroethylene (TCE) exposure dataset by Fisher et al. (Toxicol Appl Pharm 152:339â359, 1998) was reanalyzed to investigate this new approach. By treating exterior chemical exposure as an unknown model parameter, a PBTK model was used to estimate exposure and model parameters by measuring the cumulative amount of trichloroethanol glucuronide (TCOG), a metabolite of TCE, in voided urine and a single blood sample of the study subjects by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. An estimated exterior exposure of 0.532Â mg/l successfully reconstructed the true inhalation concentration of 0.538Â mg/l with a 95% CI (0.441â0.645)Â mg/l. Based on the simulation results, a feasible urine sample collection period would be 12â16Â h after TCE exposure, with blood sampling at the end of the exposure period. Given the known metabolic pathway and exposure duration, the proposed computational procedure provides a simple and reliable method for environmental (occupational) exposure and PBTK model parameter estimation, which is more feasible than repeated blood sampling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3abreathing 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aexposure duration 3aexposure models 3aexposure pathways 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3atrichloroethylene 3aurine1 aShih, Meng-Chiuan1 aWu, Kuen-Yuh0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2012 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.21-31dSpringer-Verlagx1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-011-0502-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007300167300001600240500001500256520069000271592002800961650001500989650001901004650001601023650001001039650001401049650002201063650001701085650001501102650001701117650001501134650002301149651001201172651002501184651001201209653003501221653005901256653002301315653000801338700001901346773009701365856008101462852000901543655001201552IND60520515520221122220802.0160521e20111008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052051552DNAL7 a10.2478/v10200-011-0046-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKettani, Kawtar10aNew data on the Chironomidae (Diptera) of the Rif (Northern Morocco)  ap. 587-599.  a2019-12-06  aNew collections of pupal exuviae of chironomids in various fresh water ecosystems in the Rif in the north of Morocco revealed an interesting inventory.

The results obtained were compared with those obtained through inhibition kinetics and fluorescence quenching. It was found that binding of tannic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and epicatechin with α-amylase is an exothermal process, with the binding constants in the order of tannic acid > chlorogenic acid > caffeic acid > epicatechin. This is consistent with the orders of reciprocal of competitive inhibition constant and fluorescence quenching constant. The binding energy obtained through molecular docking showed the same order, except for epicatechin. These results are consistent with the inhibition of α-amylase being caused by the binding of the polyphenols with the enzyme. In addition, from the fluorescence quenching and DSC data, total polyphenols, tannic acid, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid were found to partially unfold the enzyme structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3aapples 3acaffeic acid 3achlorogenic acid 3acomputer simulation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenergy 3aenzyme inhibition 3aepicatechin 3afluorescence 3apolyphenols 3aswine 3atannins 3atitration 0aYoung apple polyphenols 0aPorcine pancreatic α-amylase 0aBinding interactions 0aInhibition1 aWarren, Frederick J.1 aGidley, Michael J.1 aGuo, Yurong1 aMiao, Ming0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 15, v. 283 p.468-474dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024002200137024001900159040001800178100001800196245007300214300001400287506007600301520159400377592002801971506003701999650002402036650001802060650002302078650001702101650002002118650001202138650002802150650002502178650001502203653001402218653000902232653000802241653000802249653000802257653000802265653000902273653001002282653001702292653001902309653001802328653002802346653002302374653003002397700002002427700002102447773012102468856009002589852000902679655001202688IND60539211020221207121322.0190214e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053921102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.10.0022doi7 aPMC46560622pmcid7 a264629042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThistle, Jake10aHelix 1 tryptophan variants in Galleria mellonella apolipophorin III  ap. 18-23.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aApolipophorin III (apoLp-III) from Galleria mellonella is a critical apolipoprotein aiding in lipid transport and has gained considerable interest for a role in innate immunity. Both functions are likely related and form the rationale to gain a more detailed understanding of the lipid binding properties of this insect apolipoprotein. Tryptophan residues were introduced at positions 16, 20 or 24, all in helix 1 as it may play a critical role in the initial steps of lipid binding. Steady-state fluorescence analysis showed that each tryptophan displayed unique properties, indicating different environments both in lipid-free as in lipid-bound states, and demonstrating potential for use in lipid binding analysis. While α-helical contents of wild-type and the tryptophan variant proteins were similar, W20- and W24-apoLp-III displayed increased protein stability. These variants were significantly slower in their ability to convert phosphatidylcholine vesicles into discoidal lipoproteins, which was employed as a measure for lipid binding. In contrast, W16-apoLp-III displayed decreased protein stability but an order of magnitude higher rate of discoidal lipoprotein formation. This demonstrates an inverse correlation between protein stability and the ability to convert vesicles in discoidal lipoproteins. The most stable W20-apoLp-III variant displayed comprised LDL binding capabilities, indicating a partial loss of function. Thus, there is a delicate balance between helix bundle stability and the ability to bind lipids, and helix 1 may play a critical role in this process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGalleria mellonella 3aapolipophorin 3abinding properties 3afluorescence 3ainnate immunity 3ainsects 3alow density lipoprotein 3aphosphatidylcholines 3atryptophan 0aapoLp-III 0aDMPC 0aLDL 0aLPS 0aLUV 0aSDS 0aPAGE 0aλmax 0a[Gdn-HCl]1/2 0aApolipoprotein 0aApolipophorin 0aTryptophan fluorescence 0aCircular dichroism 0aProtein-lipid interaction1 aMartinon, Daisy1 aWeers, Paul M.M.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2015 Dec., v. 193 p.18-23dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014300168500001900311520165400330592002801984650001602012650003402028650003702062650001502099650002202114650002002136650004902156650002202205650001102227650001702238650001602255650002102271650002802292650001702320650002402337650002402361650001102385650001102396653003502407653003702442653001502479700001602494700001702510700005702527773010502584856008702689852000902776655001202785IND60729055120221119233415.0210619e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072905512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1263752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jingyi10aFabrication and characterization of a novel PMO containing riboflavin-5'-phosphate sodium salt for sensitive detection of pesticide ferbam  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA highly sensitive and low-cost optical nanosensor of organic-inorganic hybrid material for pesticide ferbam detection was prepared by utilizing a novel organic siloxane precursor obtained from riboflavin-5′-phosphate sodium salt (Rf). A panel of characterizations was carried out to understand the structure, morphology and surface chemistry of the Rf periodic mesoporous organosilica (Rf-PMO) spherical nanosensors. For the Rf-PMO materials, the doped silica nanoparticles exhibit strong fluorescence emission at 520 nm, on account that the greater steric hindrances and the more separated state of π-conjugate planer platforms between Rf molecules embedded within the silica framework can both enhance the fluorescence emission and reduce the self-quenching of fluorescence produced by stacking aggregation of Rf. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra prove that the prepared Rf-PMO materials can participate in the redox reaction through electron transfer with the pesticide ferbam. Utilized the reducing reaction mechanism of Rf-PMO, it is applied to detect pesticide ferbam with high sensitivity and selectivity, with the limit of detection (LOD) in aqueous solution as low as 6.97 × 10⁻⁹ M. Moreover, the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of Fe K-edge shows a coordination structure through the interaction between iron ions from ferbam and O and N atoms in Rf-PMO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further reveals the redox mechanism. Therefore, the designed and prepared Rf-PMO is potentially valuable to food safety monitoring involving ferbam as the nanosensor, due to its hypersensitivity and selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3adetection limit 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aferbam 3afluorescence 3afood safety 3ahypersensitivity 3aorganosilicon compounds 3aporous media 3areaction mechanisms 3asensors (equipment) 3asilica 3asodium 0aRiboflavin-5'-phosphate sodium 0aPeriodic mesoporous organosilica 0aNanosensor1 aHan, Shuhua1 aHu, Yongfeng1 aPao, Chih-Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7681-43910 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 May 20, v. 617 p.126375-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1263753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03976naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100008500149245010700234300001600341520224700357592002802604650002102632650002202653650002602675650001402701650001602715650002002731650003102751650003602782650001402818650001502832650000902847650001602856650001802872650002602890650000902916653002302925653002202948653002302970653002002993653001503013700002503028700002003053700001403073700002303087700002203110700002803132700006303160700001603223773009103239856008303330852000903413655001203422IND60554659720221118223042.0161024e20140613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055465972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos-Pinto, José Roberto Aparecido1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3172-009710aStructure and post-translational modifications of the web silk protein spidroin-1 from Nephila spiders  ap. 174-185.  aSpidroin-1 is one of the major ampullate silk proteins produced by spiders for use in the construction of the frame and radii of orb webs, and as a dragline to escape from predators. Only partial sequences of spidroin-1 produced by Nephila clavipes have been reported up to now, and there is no information on post-translational modifications (PTMs). A gel-based mass spectrometry strategy with ETD and CID fragmentation methods were used to sequence and determine the presence/location of any PTMs on the spidroin-1. Sequence coverage of 98.06%, 95.05%, and 98.37% were obtained for N. clavipes, Nephila edulis and for Nephila madagascariensis, respectively. Phosphorylation was the major PTM observed with 8 phosphorylation sites considered reliable on spidroin-1 produced by N. clavipes, 4 in N. madagascariensis and 2 for N. edulis. Dityrosine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (formed by oxidation of the spidroin-1) were observed, although the mechanism by which they are formed (i.e. exposure to UV radiation or to peroxidases in the major ampullate silk gland) is uncertain. Herein we present structural information on the spidroin-1 produced by three different Nephila species; these findings may be valuable for understanding the physicochemical properties of the silk proteins and moreover, future designs of recombinantly produced spider silk proteins.Biotechnological significanceThe present investigation shows for the first time spidroin structure and post-translational modifications observed on the major ampullate silk spidroin-1. The many site specific phosphorylations (localized within the structural motifs) along with the probably photoinduction of hydroxylations may be relevant for scientists in material science, biology, biochemistry and environmental scientists. Up to now all the mechanical properties of the spidroin have been characterized without any consideration about the existence of PTMs in the sequence of spidroins. Thus, these findings for major ampullate silk spidroin-1 from Nephila spiders provide the basis for mechanical–elastic property studies of silk for biotechnological and biomedical potential applications.

Ti-ATMP was characterized by elemental analysis (ICP-AES and C, H, N analysis), spectral analysis (FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA), XRD, SEM, and EDX spectroscopy, including physicochemical and ion-exchange characteristics. The equilibrium exchange of transition-metal ions (viz., Cu²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺ Zn²⁺) and heavy-metal ions (viz., Pb²⁺,Cd²⁺, Hg²⁺) with the H⁺ ions contained in ATMP was studied at constant ionic strength and varying temperatures, and various thermodynamic parameters such as the equilibrium constant (K), standard Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), enthalpy (ΔH°), and entropy (ΔS°) were evaluated. The Nernst–Planck equation was used to study the ion-exchange kinetics, and various kinetic parameters, namely, the self-diffusion coefficient (D₀), energy of activation (Eₐ), and entropy of activation (ΔS*), were evaluated under conditions favoring a particle-diffusion-controlled mechanism. Metal-ion adsorptions with variations in concentration and temperature were studied using the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The distribution coefficient (Kd) and breakthrough capacity (BTC) values for transition- and heavy-metal ions were determined. Based on Kd (mL·g–¹), the selectivity order for metal ions toward Ti-ATMP was found to be Cu²⁺ (19820) > Zn²⁺(3280) > Co²⁺ (2630) > Ni²⁺ (2390) among transition-metal ions and Pb²⁺ (3590) > Cd²⁺ (2340) > Hg²⁺ (610) among the heavy-metal ions. The elution behavior of these metal ions was studied using different acids and electrolytes. A study on regeneration and reuse of the ion exchanger Ti-ATMP shows that it is effective up to five cycles without much decline in performance, which indicates that Ti-ATMP has good potential for use as a cation exchanger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGibbs free energy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacids 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3acations 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aengineering 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3aion exchange 3aionic strength 3alead 3amercury 3ametal ions 3anickel 3aprotons 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3atitanium 3azinc1 aChudasama, Uma0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Nov. 05, v. 53, no. 44 p.17454-17467dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie502673m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245013700172300001600309506002800325520145700353592002801810506003701838650002101875650001501896650001001911650001401921650000901935650000701944650000901951650001401960650001001974653001301984653001701997653002302014653002302037653002002060700001502080700002502095700001902120773012802139856008902267852000902356655001202365IND60739770820221207130635.0180531e198112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073977082DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.1981.15.4.13662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorlat, René10aCaractérisation de quelques composantes du potentiel chlorosant des différents milieux carbonates dans le vignoble du Val de Loire  ap. 229-246.  aResource is Open Access  aDans le vignoble de la Moyenne Vallée de la Loire, une grande partie des sols carbonatés est représentée par deux importants faciès lithologiques crayeux : les craies limono-argileuses à pouvoir chlorosant élevé, et les craies sablo-glauconieuses micacées à faible pouvoir chlorosant.

Here we report chemical and physical characterization of polydopamine films deposited on gold surfaces from stirred basic solutions at times ranging from 2 to 60 min, with a focus on times ≤10 min. Data from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical methods suggest the presence of starting (dopamine) and intermediate (C=N-containing tautomers of quinone and indole) species in the polydopamine films at all deposition times. A uniform overlayer analysis of the XPS data indicates that film thickness increased linearly at short deposition times of ≤10 min. At deposition times ≥10 min, the films appeared largely continuous with surface roughness ≈ ≤ 2 nm, as determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Pinhole-free films, as determined by anionic redox probe measurements, required deposition times of 60 min or greater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3aautoxidation 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3agold 3amelanin 3asurface roughness 3atautomers1 aMorris, Todd A.1 aTarlov, Michael J.0 tLangmuir.g2013 July 09, v. 29, no. 27 p.8619-8628dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla400587j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011700168300001600285520138200301592002801683650002201711650001201733650001601745650001101761650000901772650001801781650002401799650002401823650001601847650001901863653001101882653002001893653002601913653002201939653001801961700002101979700002002000773014102020856008302161852000902244655001202253IND60559941120221116150822.0190415e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055994112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jssas.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaq, Raees ul,10aEffect of microwave treatment on dehydration kinetics and moisture diffusivity of Asiatic Himalayan black carrot  ap. 463-470.  aDrying as preservation technique is an old process involving simultaneous heat and mass transfer resulting in reduction of moisture to lower water activity levels. The removal of unbound moisture by dehydration lowers down the water activity levels. Present study determines the effect of microwaves on dehydration characteristics (operated at 2450MHz) of carrot shreds at different intervals of time (1, 2 and 3 min). The microwave treatment resulted in decrease of overall dehydration time with higher treatment time combination decreasing it more profusely than lower treatment time combination. The decrease in dehydration time after three minutes of microwave treatment followed by drying at 50, 60 and 70°C temperatures was approximately 18, 35 and 48%, respectively with respect to untreated carrots. The experimental data points were fitted to different mathematical models for determining the best fit model for the process. Experimental values were proficiently fitted by page model as evident from its higher R2 and lower RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values. Imparting microwave treatment to shreds provided stimulus for increasing the drying rates. Effective moisture diffusivity was lowest for untreated carrot shreds and highest for 3min treated shreds. Activation energy of drying process by virtue of microwave application decreased from 36.31 to 14.24kJ/mol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acarrots 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3amicrowave treatment 3atemperature 3awater activity 0aCarrot 0aDrying kinetics 0aEffective diffusivity 0aActivation energy 0aDrying curves1 aKumar, Pradyuman1 aPrasad, Kamlesh0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2018 Oct., v. 17, no. 4 p.463-470dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245008600217300001100303520126700314592002801581650001701609650001801626650001101644650001401655650001101669650001301680650001001693650000901703650001601712650001301728650002401741650001101765650001101776650001001787650001101797700002501808700002401833700001801857700001901875700001401894700003101908700001901939700001901958773013101977856008302108852000902191655001202200IND60764321820221118215335.0220209e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076432182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-022-03090-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuska, Habib Syaiful Arif1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0891-501314aThe effect of season of birth on the morphometrics of newborn Belgian Blue calves  ap. 76.  aBreed type and environmental factors such as breeding season may have a significant impact on neonatal morphometrics. We followed a total of 236 elective cesarean sections in Belgian Blue (BB) cows, from which neonatal calves were morphometrically assessed (in cm) within the first 72 h of delivery using a strictly standardized protocol. The effect of the season of birth on each calf measurement was analyzed using mixed linear regression models, including the farm of origin as a random effect. Calves born in spring had a longer diagonal length (69.7 ± 1.24; P = 0.05) than those born in autumn (66.9 ± 1.16). The tibial length of calves born in spring (35.8 ± 0.48) was longer (P < 0.02) than of those born in autumn (33.1 ± 0.57) or summer (34.1 ± 0.49). Calves born in autumn have a shorter head diameter (12.9 ± 0.23; P < 0.02) than those born in summer (12.6 ± 0.29) or winter (13.5 ± 0.22). For all other parameters, no differences were found (P > 0.08). Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the birth season influences the morphometrics of neonatal BB calves, with a tendency for spring to be associated with the largest body size. The latter is important to avoid dystocia when BB cattle are crossed with other breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBelgian Blue 3aanimal health 3aautumn 3abody size 3acalves 3adystocia 3afarms 3ahead 3amorphometry 3aneonates 3aregression analysis 3aspring 3asummer 3atibia 3awinter1 aResidiwati, Gretania1 aVan Eetvelde, Mieke1 aVerdru, Karel1 aMeesters, Maya1 aBoediono,1 aPascottini, Osvaldo Bogado1 aSoom, Ann van,1 aOpsomer, Geert0 tTropical animal health and production.g2022 Feb., v. 54, no. 1 p.76-76dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-022-03090-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245014800216506010400364506007600468520151000544592002802054506003702082650000802119650001302127650001102140650001402151650001502165650001202180650001102192650000902203650002002212650001002232650001802242653002302260653001502283653001302298653002502311700005902336700006402395773010802459856008802567852000902655655001202664IND60772462420221207100333.0220529e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077246242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.1041702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmmi, Siddhartha H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6199-749512aA phase field model for partially saturated geomaterials describing fluid–fluid displacements.

This is based on a phase field approach that interprets the mixture of wetting (liquid water) and non-wetting (air) fluids within the pore space as a single saturating non-uniform pore fluid characterized by a phase field parameter, which is considered to be the saturation degree of the wetting fluid. While the standard retention curve provides for the retention properties of the pore walls, a Cahn–Hilliard like double-well energy is employed to describe the possible co-existence of the immiscible fluid phases. An enhanced description of the macroscopic surface tension between the fluid phases is obtained naturally within the phase field framework due to a regularization that depends on the spatial gradient of the water content. A generalized Darcy’s law is used to describe dissipation due to fluid flow driven by the gradient of a generalized chemical potential. Thus, in the context of soil hydrology this model is interpreted as an extension to the classical Richards equation governing the spatio-temporal evolution of the phase field parameter. Employing a convex–concave flux function it is shown, using one-dimensional analysis, that both imbibition and drainage fronts can be modeled in this phase field framework. The non-monotonicities observed in the resolved solutions are explained using a combination of asymptotic matching techniques and dynamical systems analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3adrainage 3aenergy 3aequations 3aimbibition 3aliquids 3amodels 3asoil 3asurface tension 3awater 3awater content 0aPartial saturation 0aImbibition 0aDrainage 0aPhase field modeling1 aSciarra, Giulio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1116-29801 aKotronis, Panagiotis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8978-12740 tAdvances in water resources.g2022 June, v. 164 p.104170-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.1041703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245010600210300001400316520205300330592002802383650004602411650002002457650001102477650001902488650002202507650001202529650001902541650001102560650002102571650002102592650001402613650001702627650001202644650002302656650000902679651001002688653002002698653002402718653001602742653002102758653001902779653003102798700001902829700002202848700001802870700001302888773012102901856008803022852000903110655001203119IND60605319220221119031505.0201202e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060531922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Kuangji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3909-135510aVertical gradients and seasonal variations in the stem CO2 efflux of Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr  ap. 71-80.  aStem CO₂ efflux (ES) plays an essential role in the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. Therefore, it is necessary to study the vertical and seasonal variations in ES in forests with different ages, especially in response to factors associated with temperature, nutrients and wood structure. In this study, we investigated ES and its association with temperature factors using a carbon flux system (Li-8100A) at monthly intervals during the growing season (May to September) and the non-growing season (October) from 2013 to 2015. In addition, we collected data on nutrients and wood structure in August 2016 from 16- (young), 25- (immature), and 41-year-old (mature) Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr stands in North China. Our analysis showed that the ES values at stem positions near the crown and the root system were generally higher than those in the middle and that the minimum ES values in July occurred at 2.0 m (3.61 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹), 3.0 m (2.42 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹), and 5.0 m (4.03 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) in the young, immature, and mature forests, respectively. Air temperature and wood temperature influenced the vertical variation in ES, as did stem nitrogen concentration and sapwood width. Compared to the method that uses the vertical ES gradient to determine tree-scale CO₂ effluxes for 16-, 25- and 41-year-old L. principis-rupprechtii forests, the method that uses the ES value at the 1.3-m stem position underestimated the CO₂ effluxes by 5%, 6%, and 24%, respectively. The ES and Q₁₀ models for each stem position for the three forest ages in this study can be used to accurately estimate tree-scale CO₂ effluxes. These results not only clarified the relationships between the vertical variation in ES and temperature, nutrient content and wood structure, but also revealed the likely response mechanisms of ES to these factors. Methodologically, incorporating the vertical variation in ES and the associated drivers into conventional models would improve the accuracy of annual ES estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii 3aair temperature 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3agrowing season 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aroot systems 3asapwood 3aseasonal variation 3awood 3aChina 0aStem CO2 efflux 0aVertical variations 0aTemperature 0aNutrient content 0aWood structure 0aLarixprincipis-rupprechtii1 aZheng, Minxian1 aFahey, Timothy J.1 aJia, Zhongkui1 aMa, Lvyi0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 262 p.71-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01709naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008100159300002000240520068100260592002800941650001400969650001400983650002300997650002101020650002101041650001601062650001801078650000901096650001401105650000901119650001101128773013601139856007501275852000901350655001201359IND60538191020221119010855.0160815e20141105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053819102DNAL7 a10.1021/ie502681w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Xuezheng10aNovel Ionic Liquid Supported on a Magnetic Core and Its Catalytic Activities  ap. 17325-17332.  aAn acidic ionic liquid immobilized on a magnetic core has been synthesized through the copolymerization of acidic vinylpyridinium IL with a double-bond-modified magnetic core. The ionic liquid was coated on the magnetic core to form a shell structure that provided easily accessible acidic sites for reactants. The magnetic attraction between the particles enhanced the interactions of the ions on the shell surface, resulting in a high stability. The solid acid exhibited a high activity for biodiesel synthesis from waste oils, with a yield of 99% under mild conditions.

In this work, disc-shaped Bi₂O₂(OH)NO₃/g-C₃N₄ nanosheets (BON-CN) were successfully synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. Among them, 20wt% BON-CN composite demonstrated much better performance for CO₂ photocatalytic reduction, the CO yield on which was about 3.2 and 2 times of the pure CN and BON respectively. This improvement of photocatalytic performance is basically attributed to the formation of tightly bonded structure between the two pure catalysts, which could effectively accelerate the separation of electron-hole pairs and thereby allow more free photocatalytic carriers (e⁻ and h⁺) to participate in the redox reaction process. Meanwhile, the possible mechanism was proposed based on the characterization results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbon nitride 3ahot water treatment 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3anitrates 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aredox reactions 0aBi2O2(OH)NO3/g-C3N4 0aPhotocatalytic 0aElectron-hole pairs 0aRedox1 aGuo, Rui-tang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5646-50991 aQin, Hao1 aWang, Zhong-yi1 aShi, Xu1 aPan, Wei-guo1 aTang, Jun-ying1 aJia, Peng-yao1 aMiao, Yufang,1 aGu, Jing-wen0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Nov. 05, v. 580 p.123782-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008100164300001600245520107400261592002801335650000901363650002401372650001601396650002401412650001201436650001501448650001701463650001701480650001401497650001001511653002101521653001601542653001601558700001301574700001401587700002401601700001801625773012601643856008101769852000901850655001201859IND60655483220221118161132.0190801e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065548322DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585110003652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, S.10aEvaluation of seed quality: from physiology to international standardization  ap.

Quality standards of commercial seed lots are determined by their positions on the seed survival curves and the shape of their germination progress curves. Although comparative descriptions of germination curves can be achieved by the calculation of the mean germination time (MGT; delay to radicle emergence), single early counts of radicle emergence provide a convenient means of predicting MGT and differences between seed lots. Evidence is presented for an ageing and metabolic repair hypothesis as the overall physiological basis to explain the principles behind the standard germination and vigour tests (ageing, electrolyte leakage, cold test, germination rate and seedling size). The work of the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) in developing convenient, inexpensive and internationally repeatable tests is illustrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aelectrolyte leakage 3agermination 3ahorticultural crops 3amarkets 3aprediction 3aseed quality 3aseed testing 3aseedlings 3avigor 0ametabolic repair 0aseed ageing 0avigour test1 aNoli, E.1 aDemir, I.1 aKhajeh-Hosseini, M.1 aWagner, M.-H.0 tSeed science research.g2012 Feb., v. 22, no.

The TCA solubility was then determined over a range of industrially relevant conditions by measuring calcium concentration in solution when at equilibrium with excess solids. It was observed that the solubility increased with increasing sodium carbonate concentration. Slight shifts in the XRD pattern were observed when the solids were exposed to the carbonate-containing liquor. From the analysis of existing thermodynamic data, the dominant equilibrium reaction at the conditions tested was determined to be 3CaO·Al₂O₃·6H₂O + 3CO₃²– + 4H⁺ = 3CaCO₃(aq) + 2Al(OH)₄– + 4H₂O. From the experimental results and activity coefficient estimates, the relationship between the reaction equilibrium constant (K) and temperature (T) in the range of 308–368 K is described by the relation log K = 80.56 – 0.105T.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum oxide 3acalcium 3acalcium hydroxide 3aengineering 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aVaughan, James1 aPeng, Hong0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Nov. 05, v. 53, no. 44 p.17499-17505dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie502693p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03940naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245007300214506010400287506007600391520213600467592002802603506003702631650001102668650001602679650001202695650001602707650002202723650001302745650001202758650001502770650001302785650002402798650001102822650001102833650001402844650001502858650001802873651001102891651001902902651001202921651001002933651001402943651001202957653002002969653002402989653001303013653001103026653000903037653003203046700002003078700001703098700001803115773010803133856008803241852000903329655001203338IND60772462620221207100329.0220529e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077246262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.1041882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCAZCARRO, Ignacio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7517-005310aNations’ water footprints and virtual water trade of wood products  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeveral studies addressed the water footprint (WF) of countries and virtual water (VW) trade in agricultural and industrial products, but freshwater use associated with wood products has received little attention. Yet, international trade in wood products has been growing, and forestry competes with other forest ecosystem services over limited freshwater resources. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to assess nations’ WFs of consumption of wood products, the sustainability of these WFs, and the VW flows associated with international trade in wood products. We account nations’ WFs of and VW trade in wood products with a Multi-regional Input-Output model (MRIO-forest) that tracks wood flows along global supply chains (production, processing, trade, and final uses) for the period 1997-2017 and assess the sustainability of the green and blue WF of wood products in 2017. The WF of wood production increased from 8.37 × 10¹¹ m³/y in 1997 to 9.87 × 10¹¹ m³/y in 2017. About 38% (3.76 × 10¹¹ m³/y) of this WF relates to wood products for export (in 2017), which means that VW trade associated with wood products ranks in between agricultural and industrial products in absolute volumes. About 10% (9.9 × 10¹⁰ m³/y) of the green WF and 11% (3.4 × 10⁹ m³/y) of the blue WF of wood products in 2017 are unsustainable, meaning that they are located in areas where the total green/blue WF exceeds the maximum sustainable green/blue WF. The unsustainable green WF occurs mainly in Germany, Indonesia, the Czech Republic and the UK, and mainly relates to coniferous sawnwood, paper and paperboard other than newsprint, fibreboard and non-coniferous sawnwood. The unsustainable blue WF, which is much smaller, occurs in the USA, Russia. Nigeria, Canada and India, and mainly relates to fuelwood, paper and paperboard other than newsprint, sawnwood and fibreboard. This study increases our understanding of how forest evaporation flows link to the final consumption of wood products and contributes to the wider debate on the allocation of freshwater resources in the global economy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRussia 3aevaporation 3aexports 3afiberboards 3aforest ecosystems 3aforestry 3aforests 3afreshwater 3afuelwood 3ainternational trade 3alumber 3amodels 3anewsprint 3apaperboard 3avirtual water 3aCanada 3aCzech Republic 3aGermany 3aIndia 3aIndonesia 3aNigeria 0aWater footprint 0aVirtual water trade 0aForestry 0aTimber 0aWood 0aMulti-regional input-output1 aSCHYNS, Joep F.1 aARTO, Iñaki1 aSANZ, M.

Surface-expression of the resulting fusion proteins CotY-EGFP, CotZ-EGFP, CotY-β-Gal, and CotZ-β-Gal were then evaluated. Fluorescence intensity analysis of the transformed strains indicated that the CotY-EGFP and CotZ-EGFP fusion proteins were successfully displayed on spores. β-Gal was anchored on the surface of B. subtilis spores, confirmed based on western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Results of a β-Gal assay showed that when fused to CotY and CotZ, the obtained enzyme activities of spore-displayed β-Gals were 0.12 and 0.25 U/mg of spores (dry weight), respectively. CotY and CotZ were, thus, shown to be suitable candidate carriers for display of multimeric enzymes on the spore surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3aWestern blotting 3abeta-galactosidase 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amodels 3aspores1 aYang, Ruijin1 aHua, Xiao1 aZhao, Wei1 aZhang, Wenbin0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.1755-1759dThe Korean Society of Food Science and Technologyx1226-77087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-015-0228-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245016600199500002000365520145100385592002801836596004401864596005901908596009201967650001102059650002202070650003002092650001402122650001702136650001302153650001502166650001702181650001102198650001302209650001902222650001702241650001802258650002902276650001602305700002002321700002002341700002002361700002002381700002002401700001402421700002002435773012702455856007502582852000902657655001202666IND60788276420221122215721.0220812e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078827642DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.142082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Xian‐Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1760-561810aSolid‐state‐cultured mycelium of Antrodia camphorata exerts potential neuroprotective activities against 6‐hydroxydopamine‐induced toxicity in PC12 cells  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAntrodia camphorata (A. camphorata) is an edible fungus containing various bioactive compounds generally used for health benefits. This study aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective activities of solid‐state‐cultured mycelium of A. camphorata (SCMAC) against Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as the underlying mechanism using an in vitro 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐OHDA)‐induced PC12 cell model. The results showed that SCMAC extracts alleviated cell toxicity induced by 6‐OHDA and the loss of dopaminergic neurons, which was confirmed by the increase of cell viabilities, inhibition of cell apoptosis, the upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels and the downregulation of α‐Synuclein level. After purification, 11 compounds were identified by the NMR technique, including a quinone, four phenolic acid derivatives, three ubiquinone derivatives, two alkaloids, and a triterpenoid. The present study suggests that SCMAC could be an attractive candidate for the prevention or treatment of PD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Parkinson's disease seriously affects the lifetime and quality of the elder population for a long history. Long‐term consumption of L‐DOPA will result in side effects, such as developing abnormal involuntary movements called dyskinesia. This study showed that natural SCMAC extracts could be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorder.  aPublisher supplied data  aKYY‐HX‐20200488cEnterprise Project  aJCYJ20170818111103886cShenzhen Basic Research Program  a2018C02003 & 2019C02040cThe Key Research and Development Projects of Zhejiang Province 3aL-dopa 3aParkinson disease 3aTaiwanofungus camphoratus 3aapoptosis 3acytotoxicity 3adopamine 3adyskinesia 3aedible fungi 3amodels 3amycelium 3aphenolic acids 3atherapeutics 3atriterpenoids 3atyrosine 3-monooxygenase 3aubiquinones1 aXu, Meng‐Ting1 aDong, Xiao‐Li1 aYing, You‐Min1 aGuan, Rong‐Fa1 aWu, Wei‐Cheng1 aYang, Kai1 aSun, Pei‐Long0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 46, no. 8 p.e14208-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.142083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015600156300002000312520102800332592002801360650002401388650001601412650001301428650001001441650001901451650001901470650001901489650002101508650001301529650001501542700001901557700002101576700001901597700002001616700002101636773013601657856007501793852000901868655001201877IND60538191220221119010929.0160815e20141105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053819122DNAL7 a10.1021/ie50270882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOng, Wee-Jun10aEnhanced Daylight-Induced Photocatalytic Activity of Solvent Exfoliated Graphene (SEG)/ZnO Hybrid Nanocomposites toward Degradation of Reactive Black 5  ap. 17333-17344.  aA series of SEG/ZnO photocatalysts with different ratios of Zn(NO₃)₂ precursor was synthesized via a facile chemical deposition-calcination approach using solvent exfoliated graphene (SEG) as a precursor of graphene, Zn(NH₃)₄CO₃ as a precursor of ZnO, NaOH as a precipitating agent, and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) as an interface linker. The photocatalytic activity and stability of SEG/ZnO were evaluated by the degradation of Reactive Black 5 (RB5) under visible light. In comparison to pure SEG and ZnO, SEG/ZnO nanocomposites displayed a remarkable RB5 degradation of 97.0% with a rate constant of 0.0199 min–¹ under a low-power 15 W energy-saving light bulb for 3 h. The optimum ZnO content was 69.0 wt %, which demonstrated a 10-fold enhancement after graphene hybridization than that for pure ZnO. This was accredited to effective dye sensitization and suppressed electron–hole recombination via SEG as electron storage. Lastly, a visible-light photocatalytic mechanism for the photoactivity was explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3aengineering 3agraphene 3alamps 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3azinc oxide1 aVoon, Seen-Yee1 aTan, Lling-Lling1 aGoh, Boon Tong1 aYong, Siek-Ting1 aChai, Siang-Piao0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Nov. 05, v. 53, no. 44 p.17333-17344dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie50270883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006600164300001600230500001500246520171600261592002801977650001502005650001802020650000902038650001602047650001502063650001502078650001802093650001402111650001402125650001802139650001202157650001302169650002302182650001902205650001702224650001502241650002102256650001902277653001602296653002702312653001402339653001002353653001402363653001302377700002002390773012602410856008102536852000902617655001202626IND60655483420221118161511.0190801e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065548342DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585110003892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, A.G.10aSeed treatments: phytotoxicity amelioration and tracer uptake  ap. S86-S90.  a2019-12-06  aSeed treatments are used globally on a wide range of field, vegetable and ornamental seeds, for efficient early season control of insects and diseases. However, specific seed-treatment compounds may be phytotoxic and this phytotoxicity is most acute in laboratory germination tests. Several strategies have been developed to alleviate seed-treatment phytotoxicity that include spatial separation of the pesticide from the seed. This can be accomplished by the application of the active compounds at the end of pelleting or by using a two-pellet system, termed ‘smart-pill technology’. Another approach is to detoxify or adsorb the agrochemical in a standard germination test by applying a peat medium over the seeds in a roll towel or blotter test. Many new seed-treatment chemicals have systemic activity, and the efficacy of these systemic seed treatments depends on the ability of these applied chemical compounds to be absorbed, and then transported in the developing plant. The present article describes seed-coat permeability to systemic seed treatments, examined by monitoring the movement of fluorescent tracers into intact seeds during imbibition. Two moderately lipophilic, fluorescent tracers have been used – rhodamine (ionic) and coumarin (non-ionic) – which differ mainly in electrical charge. Seed-coat permeabilities of particular species have been grouped into three categories: (1) permeable to both tracers; (2) selectively permeable to only coumarin; and (3) non-permeable to both tracers. The ability of a particular compound to diffuse through the seed coat is related to the chemical nature of the seed-covering tissues and the physico-chemical properties of the compound applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimbibition 3alipophilicity 3apeat 3agermination 3arhodamines 3amonitoring 3aphytotoxicity 3aseed coat 3apelleting 3aagrochemicals 3atissues 3acoumarin 3aactive ingredients 3aseed treatment 3apermeability 3apesticides 3afluorescent dyes 3ainsect control 0aseed pellet 0aseed-coat permeability 0afilm coat 0aseeds 0arhodamine 0asystemic1 aSalanenka, Y.A.0 tSeed science research.g2012 Feb., v. 22, no.

Abnormal development of the embryo, an important part of the grain, not only affects crop yield but also impacts next-generation survival. Here, we found that maize GSK3-like kinase ZmSK2, a homolog of BIN2 in Arabidopsis, is involved in embryonic development. ZmSK2 overexpression resulted in severe BR defective phenotypes and arrested embryonic development at the transition stage, while the zmsk2 knockout lines showed enlarged embryos. ZmSK2 interacts with Aux/IAA-transcription factor 28 (ZmIAA28), a negative regulator of auxin signaling, and the interaction region is the auxin degron “GWPPV” motif of ZmIAA28 domain II. Coexpression of ZmSK2 with ZmIAA28 increased the accumulation of ZmIAA28 in maize protoplasts, which may have been due to phosphorylation by ZmSK2. In conclusion, this study reveals the function of ZmSK2 in maize embryonic development and proposes that ZmSK2-ZmIAA28 may be another link in the signaling pathway that integrates BR and auxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabnormal development 3aauxins 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aembryogenesis 3aphosphorylation 3aprotoplasts 0aBR-auxin signaling 0aEmbryonic development 0aMaize 0aZmSK2 0aZmIAA281 aXu, Jianghai1 aYu, Jingjuan1 aZhu, Dengyun1 aZhao, Qian0 tPlant science.g2022 May, v. 318 p.111221-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1112213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011800175300001400293506002800307520141700335592002801752506003701780650001601817650002101833650001401854650001801868650001101886650001101897650001901908650001301927650002201940650001401962653001101976653001701987653001602004653002202020653001802042653001302060700002002073700002102093700002302114700002402137700001902161773012602180856008702306852000902393655001202402IND60739771320221207130557.0180530e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073977132DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2015.49.1.932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsproudi, Andriani10aProanthocyanidin composition and evolution during grape ripening as affected by variety: Nebbiolo and Barbera cv.  ap. 59-69.  aResource is Open Access  aAim: Proanthocyanidin (PA) content, composition and evolution during berry development was determined in two cv., Nebbiolo and Barbera, quite different in their polyphenolic profile. Methods and results: PAs were extracted separately from seeds and skins, before véraison until maturity. Intact extracts were fractionated according to PA degree of polymerization. Nebbiolo grapes presented a significantly higher PA content in both seeds and skins. PA depolymerization reactions as well as a weaker decrease in polymeric PAs occurred in Barbera skins. Oligomeric PAs prevailed over polymeric ones in Barbera seeds. At harvest, Nebbiolo skins presented a significantly higher percentage of oligomeric PAs, while monomeric and oligomeric flavanol percentages were significantly higher in Barbera seeds. Conclusion: Barbera and Nebbiolo grapes differ also in their PA total amount and structure. PA content in grape skins and seeds, their distribution in monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric fractions, as well as their decrease rate during fruit ripening are different between the cv. Significance and impact of the study: The fractionation results, obtained for Nebbiolo and Barbera grapes for the first time, highlight how grape variety affects the PA profile. Furthermore, this study is the basis for better understanding the astringency and bitter sensation in Barbera and Nebbiolo grapes and wines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aastringency 3adepolymerization 3aevolution 3afractionation 3afruits 3agrapes 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aproanthocyanidins 3asensation 0agrapes 0aNebbiolo cv. 0aBarbera cv. 0aproanthocyanidins 0afractionation 0aripening1 aPiano, Federico1 aAnselmi, Giacomo1 aDi Stefano, Rocco,1 aBertolone, Eleonora1 aBorsa, Daniela0 tOENO One.g2015 Mar., v. 49, no. 1 p.59-69dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2015.49.1.933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013500164300001800299520152500317592002801842596006301870650001601933650001901949650001101968650001001979650001201989650001002001650002202011650001902033650000902052650001402061650002002075650001802095651001402113651001202127651001302139653002002152653002102172653000902193700002302202700002302225700006002248773013402308856008302442852000902525655001202534IND60764131020221118130640.0220125e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076413102DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-04-21-0130-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoto, Noemi10aGenetic Variability of Palm Lethal Decline Phytoplasmas in the Caribbean Basin and Florida, U.S.A., Based on a Multilocus Analysis  ap. 2203-2212.  aPalm lethal decline phytoplasmas are an important group of plant pathogens that cause death in a variety of palm species throughout the Caribbean basin and the southeastern United States. The 16SrIV-D phytoplasma was introduced to the state of Florida, United States; it has since caused severe economic losses to the green industries of Florida and is threating natural ecosystems because of its ability to infect the native palm Sabal palmetto. In this study, the genetic variability of the 16SrIV-D phytoplasma was assessed over a 10-year period to determine if multiple introductions had occurred or if natural mutations were occurring. Furthermore, the genetic variability of the palm lethal decline phytoplasma group (16SrIV) was assessed with a multiple locus analysis using the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region, and secA and groEL genes. Overall, no variability of the 16SrIV-D phytoplasma was documented in Florida over a 10-year period. The multilocus analysis showed support for three distinct species of the phytoplasma in the Caribbean basin that infect palms and further support that the 16SrIV-C from Tanzania is not closely related. Furthermore, 16SrIV-B and 16SrIV-D were found to be the same phytoplasma based on 100% identity between the two based on intergenic spacer region, secA, and groEL analysis. This study represents the first robust, multilocus analysis of palm-infecting phytoplasmas from the Caribbean and sheds light on the phylogeny and evolution of the group.  aPublisher supplied data  aFLA-FTL-005539cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aPhytoplasma 3aSabal palmetto 3abasins 3adeath 3adecline 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aintergenic DNA 3aloci 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathology 3aribosomal RNA 3aCaribbean 3aFlorida 3aTanzania 0alethal bronzing 0alethal yellowing 0apalm1 aHelmick, Ericka E.1 aHarrison, Nigel A.1 aBahder, Brian W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1118-48320 tPhytopathology.g2021 Dec., v. 111, no. 12 p.2203-2212dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-04-21-0130-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011500167300001800282520108800300592002801388650002301416650001701439650001401456650002401470650001401494650001701508650001901525650003101544650001201575650002701587650001301614650002101627650001501648650001401663773014101677856008101818852000901899655001201908IND60439080820221120025549.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043908082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-015-0245-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Hae-Ryong10aNeuroprotective effect of α-tocopherolhydroquinone against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in N18-RE-105 cells  ap. 1875-1878.  aOxidative stress is the imbalance between the production rate of oxidant and the level of antioxidants, and is associated with neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this study was to better understand the cellular mechanisms of neuronal cell degeneration induced by oxidative stress and the protective roles of bioactive substances. Therefore, we established a screening program to identify therapeutic agents that exhibit a preferential neuroprotective activity in glutamate-treated N18-RE- 105 cells. During the course of our screening program, we isolated an active compound, a-tocopherolhydroquinone (TQH2), from persimmon peel. The protective effect of TQH2 against glutamate-induced oxidative damage in cells was investigated using the MTT and LDH assay. Interestingly, flow cytometric analysis showed that TQH2 pretreatment greatly reduced apoptosis. TQH2 pretreatment was also associated with reduced levels of phosphor-p38, PARP, and cleaved caspase-3. The results of this study suggest that TQH2 is a novel antioxidant with a potential to protect against neuronal diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abioactive compounds 3acaspase-3 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3apersimmons 3ascreening0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.1875-1878dThe Korean Society of Food Science and Technologyx1226-77087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-015-0245-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009800173506011700271506007600388520079500464592002801259506003701287650001601324650001201340650001601352650001401368650001101382650001201393650001501405650001401420653001101434653002101445653001901466653002501485653001401510700001901524700001801543773009701561856008701658852000901745655001201754IND60767813220221207094136.0220402e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076781322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1112232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApriyanto, Ardha12aA review of starch, a unique biopolymer – Structure, metabolism and in planta modifications  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStarch is a complex carbohydrate polymer produced by plants and especially by crops in huge amounts. It consists of amylose and amylopectin, which have α-1,4- and α-1,6-linked glucose units. Despite this simple chemistry, the entire starch metabolism is complex, containing various (iso)enzymes/proteins. However, whose interplay is still not yet fully understood. Starch is essential for humans and animals as a source of nutrition and energy. Nowadays, starch is also commonly used in non-food industrial sectors for a variety of purposes. However, native starches do not always satisfy the needs of a wide range of (industrial) applications. This review summarizes the structural properties of starch, analytical methods for starch characterization, and in planta starch modifications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abiopolymers 3achemistry 3aenergy 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3anutrition 0aStarch 0aStarch structure 0aStarch surface 0aStarch modifications 0aAnalytics1 aCompart, Julia1 aFettke, Joerg0 tPlant science.g2022 May, v. 318 p.111223-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1112233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011800171300001300289520102500302592002801327650001101355650001101366650001601377650001001393700002101403700002201424700002401446773010101470856008401571852000901655655001201664IND60584729520221119203648.0200601e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058472952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2017.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Jonathan10aUncertainty management in stratigraphic well correlation and stratigraphic architectures: A training-based method  ap. 1-17.  aWe discuss the sampling and the volumetric impact of stratigraphic correlation uncertainties in basins and reservoirs. From an input set of wells, we evaluate the probability for two stratigraphic units to be associated using an analog stratigraphic model. In the presence of multiple wells, this method sequentially updates a stratigraphic column defining the stratigraphic layering for each possible set of realizations. The resulting correlations are then used to create stratigraphic grids in three dimensions. We apply this method on a set of synthetic wells sampling a forward stratigraphic model built with Dionisos. To perform cross-validation of the method, we introduce a distance comparing the relative geological time of two models for each geographic position, and we compare the models in terms of volumes. Results show the ability of the method to automatically generate stratigraphic correlation scenarios, and also highlight some challenges when sampling stratigraphic uncertainties from multiple wells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3amodels 3auncertainty 3awells1 aLallier, Florent1 aCaumon, Guillaume1 aCarpentier, Cédric0 tComputers & geosciences.g2018 Feb., v. 111 p.1-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2017.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014200157300001800299520130200317592002801619650001501647650001501662650002301677650002201700650001201722650001101734650001501745650001701760650000901777650001101786650000701797650001101804650002301815650001601838650001901854650000901873700002201882700002001904700002501924700001701949773012901966856007402095852000902169655001202178IND60638413920221120154930.0190429e20160929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063841392DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay01825d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadi, Smaail10aNew hybrid material based on a silica-immobilised conjugated β-ketoenol-bipyridine receptor and its excellent Cu(ii) adsorption capacity  ap. 6923-6931.  aA new hybrid material based adsorbent for the efficient elimination of Cu(ii) was synthesized by the immobilization of a new conjugated β-ketoenol-bipyridine ligand receptor onto a silica matrix. The analysis of its surface chemistry was evaluated using a set of suitable techniques. Adsorption studies highlight its surface properties for the excellent removal of Cu²⁺ (131.82 mg g⁻¹) from aqueous solutions using FAAS. The effect of various parameters, such as pH, initial metal concentration, temperature, competitive extraction, thermodynamics and kinetics, on the adsorption of several heavy metals was investigated via metal extraction from real water samples. The adsorption efficiency increases with an increase in pH and follows pseudo-second-order kinetics. Adsorption is rapid, as evidenced by the achievement of equilibrium within 25 min. Adsorption equilibrium data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity for Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Pb²⁺ was 131.82, 110, 90.75 and 79.71 mg g⁻¹, respectively. The removal of metals onto the new adsorbent is endothermic and spontaneous in nature. The adsorbent presents high selectivity for Cu²⁺, in competitive mode, compared to other metals and recent literature reports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanalytical methods 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3acopper 3aendothermy 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amodels 3apH 3asilica 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3azinc1 aTighadouini, Said1 aBacquet, Maryse1 aDegoutin, Stéphanie1 aGarcia, Yann0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Sept. 29, v. 8, no. 38 p.6923-6931dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay01825d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245004500166300001600211520168400227592002801911650002001939650001501959650001901974650002101993650001502014650001502029650001902044650001602063650001602079650001302095650001702108650001402125650001502139650000902154650001802163650002102181650001402202653001202216653000902228653001902237653001402256653002602270653001402296653001902310653001902329773012602348856008102474852000902555655001202564IND60655483620221118161451.0190801e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065548362DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585110004072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOoi, Mark K.J.10aSeed bank persistence and climate change  ap. S53-S60.  aThe strong mechanistic relationship between climatic factors and seed dormancy and germination suggests that forecast climatic changes will significantly affect seed bank persistence. This review focuses on the potential impact of changing temperature, rainfall and fire regimes on the longevity of long-term persistent seed-banks. Currently, there are few studies investigating the mechanistic responses of demographic processes, such as seed-bank dynamics, to forecast climate change. However, from the work that has been published, several key points have been highlighted. First, increased air temperatures will produce significantly higher soil temperatures in open and sparsely vegetated habitats. Some evidence shows that this could accelerate the decline of seed viability and compromise bet-hedging strategies of species in dryland regions. Second, changes to rainfall season may determine the relative success of recruitment, with lower levels of success producing net losses to seed bank longevity. Finally, higher temperatures are likely to produce increased fire frequency, compromising the persistence of plant populations dependent on long-lived seed banks. Improving our understanding of both the mechanistic response and adaptive capacity of seed banks to climate change will provide a solid basis for improved predictions of future species distributions and risk of extinction, particularly in ecosystems subjected to temporally stochastic disturbances. It is necessary to develop functional groups based on key life-history trait responses to changing environmental conditions, to enable broader-scale predictions of distribution and persistence in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3afire frequency 3afire regime 3agermination 3ahabitats 3alife history 3alongevity 3aprediction 3arain 3aseed dormancy 3asoil temperature 3aviability 0adrought 0afire 0aglobal warming 0aheat wave 0along-term persistence 0asemi-arid 0asoil seed bank 0astorage effect0 tSeed science research.g2012 Feb., v. 22, no.

Enzyme activity peaked, and was significantly (p<0.05) higher after 6 h, compared with controls. With extension of the incubation time, TVA absorption into cells was significantly (p<0.05) higher with significantly (p<0.05) more conversion into cis-9, trans-11 CLA, compared with shorter incubation times. TVA incubated cells exhibited significantly (p<0.05) higher levels of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids than controls.

An evaluation of the first two student cohorts (n=19) revealed a significant production of scholarship, an increase in discipline-specific knowledge, enhanced critical thinking and problem solving skills, a greater understanding and appreciation for Extension, and a desire to pursue related graduate studies.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aagricultural development 3amentoring 3amodels 3aoutreach 3aresource management 3astakeholders 3ayouth development 3aMississippi 0aundergraduate 0aapprenticeship 0amentoring 0aintegrated research 0aextension1 aHardman, Alisha Marie0 tAdvancements in agricultural development.g2020, v. 1, no. 1dAdvancements in Agricultural Development IncwJournal:27922x2690-50787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.37433/aad.v1i1.133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245019100171300001600362520098700378592002801365650002201393650003101415650002001446650001101466650002201477653001001499653001001509653002901519653001901548653002101567653001001588653001001598653001001608700002901618700002501647773009101672856008301763852000901846655001201855IND60584729620221119203703.0171028e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058472962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2017.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatalano, Antoine10aRectification of Image Velocity Results (RIVeR): A simple and user-friendly toolbox for large scale water surface Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV)  ap. 323-330.  aLSPIV (Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry) and LSPTV (Large Scale Particle Tracking Velocimetry) are used as relatively low-cost and non-intrusive techniques for water-surface velocity analysis and flow discharge measurements in rivers or large-scale hydraulic models.

Present study demonstrates the first applications of a novel optimized deep-learning algorithm of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using BAT metaheuristic algorithm (i.e., CNN-BAT). Using the prediction powers of 4 well-known algorithms as benchmarks – multilayer perceptron (MLP-BAT), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS-BAT), support vector regression (SVR-BAT) and random forest (RF-BAT), the CNN-BAT model is tested for daily streamflow (Qₜ) prediction in the Korkorsar catchment in northern Iran. Fifteen years of daily rainfall (Rₜ) and streamflow data from 1997 to 2012 were collected and used for model development and evaluation. The dataset was divided into two groups for building and testing models. The correlation coefficient (r) between rainfall and streamflow with and without antecedent events (i.e., Rₜ₋₁, Rₜ₋₂, etc.) (as the input variables) and Qₜ (as the output variable) served as the basis for constructing different input scenarios. Several quantitative and visually-based evaluation metrics were used to validate and compare the model’s performance. The results indicate that Rₜ was the most effective input variable on Qₜ prediction and the integration of Rₜ, Rₜ₋₁, and Qₜ₋₁ was the optimal input combination. The evaluation metrics show that the CNN-BAT algorithm outperforms the other algorithms. The Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicates that the prediction power of CNN-BAT algorithm is significantly/statistically different from the other developed algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3afuzzy logic 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3arain 3aregression analysis 3astream flow 3awater 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aGolkarian, Ali1 aTiefenbacher, John,0 tWater resources management.g2022 Jan., v. 36, no. 2 p.699-716dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-03051-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245011300204520140600317592002801723650001901751650001701770650001201787650002201799650002801821650001601849650002701865650002201892650002901914653002801943653001501971653003301986653002002019653002002039700005802059700005702117700005302174773009002227856008502317852000902402655001202411IND60772463020221118224342.0220531e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077246302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerc, Luka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4032-472310aEconomic viability of flexibility options for smart energy systems with high penetration of renewable energy  aSince the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement, European Union has made contributions to increase the share of renewable energy in its energy mix and limit global warming to 2 °C. Additionally, the European Union has with the passing of the “European Green Deal”, set a plan to transition to a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 which is planned to be achieved by the implementation of renewable energy generating capacities and parallel implementation of sector coupling, energy balancing, and storage technologies. These technologies are required to avoid the emergence of new problems like curtailment and jeopardization of system stability. The application of these technologies may vary due to their operating characteristics as well as the costs associated with them. The goal of this research is to show the most economically viable dynamics of achieving high penetration of renewable energy in combination with different flexibility options on a case study. Application of flexibility options is considered with the goal of keeping critical excess electricity generation within 5% of total electricity demand. The simulations are performed with the combination of energy planning software EnergyPLAN and an optimization software EPLANopt. Results show that the most effective technologies are the vehicle to grid, smart charge, improvements of energy efficiency, and pumped hydro storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy efficiency 3arenewable energy sources 0aEnergy system modelling 0aEnergyPLAN 0aRenewable energy integration 0aDemand response 0aDecarbonization1 aPfeifer, Antun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4293-69851 aDuić, Neven,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2376-64661 aWang, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7332-97260 tEnergy.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 252 p.123739-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015200161300001600313520168400329592002802013650001702041650002602058650001102084650001602095650002302111650002202134650001302156650003002169650001402199650001102213650001602224651001002240653001602250653001302266653001702279653003002296653002102326653001202347700001302359700001702372700001502389700001702404700001902421700001302440700001502453700001402468700005402482700001702536700001702553700001402570700001402584773012302598856008202721852000902803655001202812IND60612490520221119060922.0180913e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061249052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2017.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xi10aAtmospheric isoprene and monoterpenes in a typical urban area of Beijing: Pollution characterization, chemical reactivity and source identification  ap. 150-167.  aContinuous observation of isoprene, α-pinene and β-pinene was carried out in a typical urban area of Beijing from March 2014 to February 2015, using an AirmoVOC online analyzer. Based on the analysis of the ambient level and variation characteristics of isoprene, α-pinene and β-pinene, the chemical reactivity was studied, and their sources were identified. Results showed that the concentrations of isoprene, α-pinene and β-pinene in the urban area of Beijing were lower than those in richly vegetated areas; the concentrations of isoprene were at a moderate level compared with those of previous studies of Beijing. Concentrations of isoprene, α-pinene and β-pinene showed different seasonal, monthly, daily and diurnal variations, and all of the three species showed higher level at night than those in the daytime as a whole, the variations of isoprene, α-pinene and β-pinene mainly influenced by emission of sources, photochemical reaction, and meteorological parameters. Isoprene was the largest contributor to the total OFP values than α-pinene and β-pinene. α-Pinene was the largest contributor to the total SOAFP values than isoprene and β-pinene in autumn, while isoprene was the largest one in other seasons. Isoprene, α-pinene and β-pinene were derived mainly from biological sources; and α-pinene level were also affected by industrial sources. To reduce the concentrations of isoprene, α-pinene and β-pinene, it is necessary to scientifically select urban green plant species, and more strict control measures should be taken to reduce the emission of α-pinene from industrial sources, such as artificial flavors and resins synthesis processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-pinene 3aartificial flavorings 3aautumn 3abeta-pinene 3achemical reactions 3adiurnal variation 3aisoprene 3ameteorological parameters 3apollution 3aresins 3aurban areas 3aChina 0aAmbient air 0aIsoprene 0aMonoterpenes 0aPollution characteristics 0aEmission sources 0aBeijing1 aLi, Hong1 aZhang, Yujie1 aLi, Yuping1 aZhang, Weiqi1 aWang, Xuezhong1 aBi, Fang1 aZhang, Hao1 aGao, Jian1 aChai, Fahe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8796-232X1 aLun, Xiaoxiu1 aChen, Yizhen1 aGao, Jian1 aLv, Junyi0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2018 Sept., v. 71 p.150-167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2017.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245014300156300001400299500002000313520177900333592002802112596008702140596008702227650001602314650001402330650001902344650001302363650001002376650001502386650000902401650002202410650002802432650001102460650001502471650001302486650001802499650002502517700001702542700005902559773012802618856007202746852000902818655001202827IND60627890320221120160110.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062789032DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.43072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Te‐Yu10aUltrasonication‐assisted spray ionization‐based micro‐reactors for online monitoring of fast chemical reactions by mass spectrometry  ap. 26-34.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicrofluidics can be used to handle relatively small volumes of samples and to conduct reactions in microliter‐sized volumes. Electrospray ionization can couple microfluidics with mass spectrometry (MS) to monitor chemical reactions online. However, fabricating microfluidic chips is time‐consuming. We herein propose the use of a micro‐reactor that is sustained by two capillaries and an ultrasonicator. The inlets of the capillaries were individually immersed to two different sample vials that were subjected to the ultrasonicator. The tapered outlets of the two capillaries were placed cross with an angle of ~60° close to the inlet of the mass spectrometer to fuse the eluents. On the basis of capillary action and ultrasonication, the samples from the two capillaries can be continuously directed to the capillary outlets and fuse simultaneously to generate gas phase ions for MS analysis through ultrasonication‐assisted spray ionization (UASI). Any electric contact applied on the capillaries is not required. Nevertheless, UASI spray derived from the eluents can readily occur in front of the mass spectrometer. That is, a micro‐reactor was created from the fusing of the eluent containing different reactants from these two UASI capillaries, allowing reactions to be conducted in situ. The solvent in the fused droplets was evaporated quickly, and the product ions could be immediately observed by MS because of the extreme rise in the concentration of the reactants. For proof of concept, pyrazole synthesis reaction and cortisone derivatization by Girard T reagent were selected as the model reactions. The results demonstrated the feasibility of using UASI‐based micro‐reactor for online MS analysis to detect reaction intermediates and products.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOST105‐2113‐M‐009‐022‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology of Taiwan  aMOST102‐2113‐M‐009‐019‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology of Taiwan 3acapillarity 3acortisone 3aderivatization 3adroplets 3agases 3aionization 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amicrofluidic technology 3amodels 3amonitoring 3asolvents 3aspectrometers 3aultrasonic treatment1 aWu, Min‐Li1 aChen, Yu‐Chie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2253-40490 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2019 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.26-34dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.43073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001800167245015100185300001600336520159800352592002801950650002601978650001002004650001002014650002702024650001602051650001302067650001202080650004002092650004002132650002202172650008102194650006502275650008702340650003602427650002502463650004602488650002802534700001702562700001702579700001602596700001902612700002802631700002102659700001702680773011202697856008402809852000902893655001202902IND4450077020221123022948.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445007702DNAL7 a211632632pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Subir10aInteraction of apicoplast-encoded elongation factor (EF) EF-Tu with nuclear-encoded EF-Ts mediates translation in the Plasmodiumfalciparum plastid  ap. 417-427.  aProtein translation in the plastid (apicoplast) of Plasmodium spp. is of immense interest as a target for potential anti-malarial drugs. However, the molecular data on apicoplast translation needed for optimisation and development of novel inhibitors is lacking. We report characterisation of two key translation elongation factors in Plasmodium falciparum, apicoplast-encoded elongation factor PfEF-Tu and nuclear-encoded PfEF-Ts. Recombinant PfEF-Tu hydrolysed GTP and interacted with its presumed nuclear-encoded partner PfEF-Ts. The EF-Tu inhibitor kirromycin affected PfEF-Tu activity in vitro, indicating that apicoplast EF-Tu is indeed the target of this drug. The predicted PfEF-Ts leader sequence targeted GFP to the apicoplast, confirming that PfEF-Ts functions in this organelle. Recombinant PfEF-Ts mediated nucleotide exchange on PfEF-Tu and homology modeling of the PfEF-Tu:PfEF-Ts complex revealed PfEF-Ts-induced structural alterations that would expedite GDP release from PfEF-Tu. Our results establish functional interaction between two apicoplast translation factors encoded by genes residing in different cellular compartments and highlight the significance of their sequence/structural differences from bacterial elongation factors in relation to inhibitor activity. These data provide an experimental system to study the effects of novel inhibitors targeting PfEF-Tu and PfEF-Tu.PfEF-Ts interaction. Our finding that apicoplast EF-Tu possesses chaperone-related disulphide reductase activity also provides a rationale for retention of the tufA gene on the plastid genome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3adrugs 3agenes 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aplastid DNA 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Nucleusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aPeptide Elongation Factor Tuxchemistryxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Elongation Factorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlasmodium falciparumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlastidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPyridonesxpharmacology1 aLim, Erin E.1 aGupta, Ankit1 aSaqib, Uzma1 aMir, Snober S.1 aSiddiqi, Mohammad Imran1 aRalph, Stuart A.1 aHabib, Saman0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2011 Mar., v. 41, no. 3-4 p.417-427dElsevier Ltdx0020-75197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245008800160300001400248500002000262520116800282592002801450596005201478650001101530650001301541650001201554650001101566650001201577650002201589650001101611700006301622773012801685856007201813852000901885655001201894IND60627890420221123001631.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062789042DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.43132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParchomyk, Tobias10aSubstitution reactions of gaseous ions in a three‐dimensional quadrupole ion trap  ap. 81-87.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSubstitution reactions between gaseous ions and neutral substrate molecules are of ongoing high interest. To investigate these processes in a qualitative and quantitative manner, we have constructed a device, with which a defined amount of a volatile substrate can be mixed with a defined amount of helium gas and added into a three‐dimensional quadrupole ion trap. From the known inner volume of the device, the known ratio nₛᵤbₛₜᵣₐₜₑ:nHₑ of the mixture, and the determined absolute partial pressure of helium in the ion trap, we can derive the partial pressure of the substrate in the ion trap and, thus, convert the directly observable pseudo–first‐order rate constants of the substitution reactions into absolute bimolecular rate constants. We have tested the device by investigating a series of SN2 reactions of Br⁻ and CF₃CH₂O⁻ anions as well as ligand exchange reactions of ligated Na⁺ cations. As the obtained results suggest, the described device makes it possible to determine the bimolecular rate constants of substitution reactions as well as other ion‐molecule reactions with satisfactory accuracy and reliability.  aPublisher supplied data  aKO 2875/10‐1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aanions 3abromides 3acations 3ahelium 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3asodium1 aKoszinowski, Konrad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7352-57890 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2019 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.81-87dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.43133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100003400156245010900190300001400299506002800313520191100341592002802252506003702280650001702317650001702334650001002351650002502361650001202386650001402398650001302412650001802425650001302443650002102456650001002477650000902487653001902496653001602515653003102531653001202562653002402574653001402598653002402612700003502636773018102671856009102852852000902943655001202952IND60739771820221207130629.0210330e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073977182DNAL7 a10.22363/2312-797X-2021-16-1-77-852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepesko, Vladimir Vasilievich10aLongevity of Ulmus pumila L. in protective afforestation on semi-desert lands of the Astrakhan Zavolzhye  ap. 77-85.  aResource is Open Access  aThe article provides a predictive assessment of longevity of Ulmus pumila L. stands in the Astrakhan Zavolzhye. The effi and expediency of renewable logging for rejuvenation and increasing the longevity of plantings in the semi-desert were confi The classifi of ecotopes of the Astrakhan Zavolzhye on suitability for cultivation of protective and shadow elm plantings on pasture lands was developed and presented. In the Caspian region, Ulmus pumila became widespread in forest reclamation of semi-desert lands in the 1950s. Since then, till the beginning of the 1990s, Bogdinskaya research agroforestry experimental station laid on the sandy massifs about 1 thousand hectares of Ulmus pumila L. plantings, which currently amounts to 1824 %. The long-term practice of using protective shade Ulmus pumila umbrellas has shown their signifi ecological effect on functioning pastures. The aim of the research was to develop an improved technology for creating long-lived protective shade stands of Ulmus pumila on degraded pastures of the Astrakhan Zavolzhye. The research was carried out using generally accepted methods of stand forest taxation by A.P. Anuchin (1961), 1. Bitvinskas (1974) and A.S. Manaenkov (2001). Soil conditions were studied by drilling sounding to 3 m depth. The results of the research revealed that the longevity of wood species in the dry-steppe zone was determined mainly by two factors: productive moisture in the soil and salinity level. The most favorable growing conditions for Ulmus pumila were unsalted (to a depth of at least 3 m) brown sandy soils, sandy loam soils, dark-colored swale soils with periodic redistributed accumulation of moisture. In arid conditions of the Astrakhan Zavolzhye in island plantations (group of trees, umbrellas, 0.51 ha parts of forest area) and optimal growing conditions without logging and reforestation, Ulmus pumila lives up to 6070 years.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUlmus pumila 3aagroforestry 3acolor 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3alongevity 3apastures 3areforestation 3asalinity 3asandy loam soils 3ataxes 3awood 0aulmus pumila l 0asemi-desert 0aprotective shade plantings 0aecotope 0apredictive estimate 0alongevity 0aastrakhan zavolzhye1 aRybashlykova, Ludmila Petrovna0 tVestnik Rossijskogo universiteta družby narodov.g2021 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.77-85dPeoples’ Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University)wJournal:27840x2312-79887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22363/2312-797X-2021-16-1-77-853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245011800154300001200272500002000284520121400304592002801518650001601546650001501562650003101577650001501608650003501623650002101658650003501679650000901714650003001723650001901753650002501772650001501797650000901812650002201821650001301843650001301856650001301869650001301882700002201895700002001917700002101937700002301958700005901981773012602040856007202166852000902238655001202247IND60627890520221120155939.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062789052DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.42902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuko, Daiki10aImaging mass spectrometry of gold nanoparticles in a tissue section as an immunohistochemical staining mass probe  ap. 1-6.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFor analysis of low abundance peptides in a tissue section, immunohistochemical staining through antibody‐antigen interaction is a usual technique. The antibody is conjugated with a probe moiety that aids in highly sensitive detection. Gold nanoparticles, which show excellent chemical stability and variation of surface modifications, are expected to act as a sensitive mass probe to desorb gold ions (Au⁺, Au₂⁺, Au₃⁺) that are distinguishable from fragment ions from organic molecules. Here, green fluorescent proteins (GFP) in a tissue section of a transgenic zebrafish were detected by the gold mass probe conjugated with antibodies. Due to the efficient ionization and desorption of gold ions, imaging mass spectrometry of Au₂⁺ ions indicated the distribution of gold nanoparticles stained in a tissue section, and the mass signal distribution was consistent with the area where the GFP‐expressing cells were distributed. Conventional immunofluorescence techniques showed intense autofluorescence that come from intrinsic fluorophores in the tissue section. In contrast, the gold nanoparticles acted as an immunostaining mass probe that displayed significantly lower background signals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aantibodies 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3adesorption 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afluorescent dyes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agold 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimage analysis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aionization 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amoieties 3ananogold 3apeptides 3astaining1 aIkenaga, Takanori1 aKasai, Masanori1 aRabor, Janice B.1 aNishitani, Atsushi1 aNiidome, Yasuro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1086-80360 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2019 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.1-6dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.42903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245018100159500002000340520235200360592002802712650002402740650002202764650002502786650001802811650001302829650002002842650002502862650001202887650002402899650001302923650002002936650001802956650001002974650002002984650002103004650002203025650001403047700002403061700002403085700006003109773012703169856007503296852000903371655001203380IND60788277020221122215726.0220812e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078827702DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.141642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoussef, Basma10aAntidepressant‐like effects of aqueous extracts of miswak (Salvadora persica) and date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) on depression‐like behaviors using CUMS model in male rats  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant‐like effects of aqueous extracts of miswak (Salvadora persica) and date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and their combination on depression‐like behaviors using a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression and to investigate the underlying possible mechanisms. Results showed that CUMS induced depression‐like behaviors and anxiety in male rats, as determined by behavioral tests (FST, EPM, and OFT). CUMS significantly increased the levels of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), cortisol, and pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α and IL‐6), in addition to enhancing acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) activity while plasma total antioxidant capacity and serotonin level were reduced. In the prefrontal cortex, CUMS decreased the expression of CREB and BDNF mRNA. However, aqueous extracts of miswak and date palm and their combination effectively ameliorated depressive‐like behaviors, body weight loss, and oxidative stress induced by CUMS and restored serotonin and cortisol secretion to normal levels. Furthermore, the studied extracts improved the levels of plasma pro‐inflammatory cytokines and CREB and BDNF mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, aqueous extracts of miswak and date palm have significant antidepressant‐like effects on depression‐like behaviors in CUMS model in rats. Moreover, their combination has higher antidepressant‐like effects than either extract alone, suggesting that it may be an effective treatment for stress‐induced depression‐like behaviors acting through modulating pro‐inflammatory cytokines and CREB/BDNF signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortex. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Chronic stress is a major contributor to the development of depression. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of herbal remedies for the treatment of a variety of diseases, particularly mood disorders. Because of the side effects encountered by antidepressant drugs such as anxiety, sexual dysfunction, loss of appetite, and inadequate response or developing tolerance to these medications, there is a need for more efficient and convenient antidepressant treatments. According to this study, aqueous extracts of miswak and date palm are effective treatments for stress‐induced depression‐like behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aSalvadora persica 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aanimal models 3aanorexia 3aantidepressants 3aantioxidant activity 3aanxiety 3abody weight changes 3acortisol 3agene expression 3ainterleukin-6 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aprefrontal cortex 3aserotonin1 aRamadan, Kholoud S.1 aElShebiney, Shaimaa1 aIbrahim, Ehab A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0520-71690 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 46, no. 8 p.e14164-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.141643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01414naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245004800173506002800221520055000249592002800799506003700827650001200864650001100876650001200887651001500899700002200914773009600936856008301032852000901115655001201124IND60739771920221207130627.0201009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073977192DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202025020092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavlet, Mamadzhanov10aWalnut diversity and breeding in Kyrgyzstan  aResource is Open Access  aThe article provides information about the form diversity and selection of walnuts in the natural walnut forests of Kyrgyzstan.

Complete decomposition of TiO₂ was achieved in a medium of (NH₄)₂SO₄/H₂SO₄. Following a suitable dilution of the digest, Ti was quantitated based on external calibration using the 337.280 nm line and sample introduction with a OneNeb® nebulizer. A detection limit (3 s, n = 10) of 10 μg g⁻¹ and a LOQ (10 s, n = 10) of 50 μg g⁻¹ were realized. Eight samples of TiO₂ pigments and two samples of masterbatch pigment resin were analysed, providing results similar to those obtained by both traditional titrimetric and spectrophotometric methods but with standard deviations between 0.01 and 1%, some two-fold better than that of the traditional methodology. This simple procedure has been adopted by the Institute of Technology of Paraná – TECPAR (Curitiba, Brazil).  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3adetection limit 3apigments 3arapid methods 3astandard deviation 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3aBrazil1 aSantos, M.

Evidence reviewed here indicates that ancestral mechanisms are often duplicated, repurposed, and differentially regulated to support social behavior. Focusing on recent research from nonhuman primates, we describe how the primate brain might implement social functions by coopting and extending preexisting mechanisms that previously supported nonsocial functions. This approach reveals that highly specialized mechanisms have evolved to decipher the immediate social context, and parallel circuits have evolved to translate social perceptual signals and nonsocial perceptual signals into partially integrated social and nonsocial motivational signals, which together inform general-purpose mechanisms that command behavior. Differences in social behavior between species, as well as between individuals within a species, result in part from neuromodulatory regulation of these neural circuits, which itself appears to be under partial genetic control. Ultimately, intraspecific variation in social behavior has differential fitness consequences, providing fundamental building blocks of natural selection. Our review suggests that the neuroethological approach to primate behavior may provide unique insights into human psychopathology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrimates 3abrain 3acognition 3ahumans 3aintraspecific variation 3anatural selection 3asocial behavior 3asocial support 0adecision 0aevolution 0areward 0aserotonin 0aoxytocin1 aBrent, Lauren J.

The classification criteria for plant communities (characteristic combination of species, specific relationships with the physical environment, particular chorological and dynamical features) assign strong indicator value to phytosociological units. Moreover, the modern approach of plant sociology, which spans from individual communities to vegetation series and geosigmeta, offers the opportunity to interact under a landscape ecological perspective. Within this general context, we particularly refer to the field of ecological land classification and present a research project on the ecoregions of Italy, which is based on the National Map of Vegetation Series and on bioclimatic, biogeographical, lithological, and geomorphological data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aecoregions 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental models 3ageomorphology 3aland classification 3alandscapes 3aphytosociology 3aplant communities 3avegetation 3aItaly 0aVegetation series 0aecological land classification 0aItaly1 aFrondoni, R.0 tPlant biosystems.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 145, no. sup1 p.30-37dTaylor & Francisx1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2011.602747  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245013900217520213100356592002802487650001402515650001302529650001502542650001702557650001802574650001502592650001402607650001002621650001102631650001602642650002102658650001402679650001502693653002002708653001802728653002702746653001902773700001602792773010602808856008702914852000903001655001203010IND60657072120221118154227.0200210e20191120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065707212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayat, Ali Esfandyari1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5469-668910aAppraising the impacts of SiO2, ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles on rheological properties and shale inhibition of water-based drilling muds  aIn recent decades, utilizing of water-based muds (WBMs) in drilling oil and gas wells is ever increasing comparing to oil-based muds and synthetic-based muds due to the lower environmental issues. However, the main drawbacks with WBMs are rheological properties inefficiency and shale swelling which have caused attentions turn to improvement of WBMs’ rheological properties. In this study, the effects of various nanoparticles (NPs) namely titanium dioxide (TiO₂), silicon dioxide (SiO₂), and zinc oxide (ZnO) on improving rheological properties and shale recovery rate of a WBM sample at two temperatures (25 and 50 °C) were investigated. The concentrations of NPs in the base mud were set at 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 wt%. The results revealed that by adding NPs, the plastic viscosity (PV) of base mud was noticeably increased at the both temperatures. The optimum concentration of all NPs for increasing PV was found to be 0.01 wt%. Furthermore, by increasing concentration of ZnO and SiO₂ NPs up to 0.5 wt%, the base mud yield point value was considerably risen to around 13.3%, while by increasing concentration of TiO₂ NPs, the mud yield point values were reduced to 23.5 and 20.2 (lb/100 ft²) at 25 and 50 °C, respectively. The optimum ZnO, TiO₂, and SiO₂ NPs concentrations for this purpose were found to be 0.05, 0.01, and 0.1 wt%, respectively. Moreover, ZnO and SiO₂ NPs at concentrations below 0.05 wt% had the best performances for filtration loss control. The related reason is higher stability of these NPs in the aqueous phase and consequently, better mud cake pores filling act by them which caused the mud cakes permeabilities were noticeably reduced. Besides that, SiO₂ NPs caused the highest 10 s and 10 min gel strength values and ZnO and TiO₂ NPs in order had the lowest 10 s and 10 min gel strength values at all applied concentrations and temperatures. Finally, by increasing concentrations of all NPs, shale recovery rates have noticeably risen comparing to the base mud. SiO₂, ZnO and TiO₂ NPs in order were successful additives for shale recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3adrilling 3afiltration 3agel strength 3ananoparticles 3aoil fields 3arecycling 3ashale 3asilica 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3aviscosity 3azinc oxide 0aWater-based mud 0aNanoparticles 0aRheological properties 0aShale recovery1 aShams, Reza0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Nov. 20, v. 581 p.123792-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1237923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009400174300001400268520182600282592002802108650001102136650001702147650000902164650001802173650001702191650001102208650001002219650001002229650001402239650001502253650001602268653002202284653003102306653001302337653001002350653003002360700002502390700002102415700002502436700002002461700002302481700002002504700002602524700002302550700001802573700001902591773012402610856008702734852000902821655001202830IND50066547220221120084603.0190318e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006654722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYajuvendra, Singh10aEffective and accurate discrimination of individual dairy cattle through acoustic sensing  ap. 11-18.  aAcoustic sensing seems to be one of the best methods for monitoring of dairy animals at an organized farm for their better care and management. The main aim of present investigation was to establish the existence of significant differences for various acoustic features of vocal signals uttered from different individuals of a herd of crossbred cows. The mean call duration, mean pitch, 1st formant, periodicity and degree of voice breaks of adult lactating Karan Fries crossbred cattle were observed to be 2.37±0.03s, 191.57±2.40Hz, 790.71±5.54Hz, 97.76% (371.71 periodic pulses out of 380.20 pulses) and 7.64±0.44% respectively. Analysis of bioacoustics features extracted from 300 voice samples of ten adult lactating Karan Fries crossbred cows revealed that differences for amplitudes (minimum, maximum and mean), total energy, mean power, pitch (median, minimum, maximum, range and mean), pitch spreading (84–50, 50–16 and 90–10%), intensities (minimum, maximum and mean (P<0.01)), formants (F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5), bandwidths (B1, B3 and B4), number of pulse, number of period, mean period, unvoiced frames, degree of voice breaks, jitter, shimmer, mean noise to harmonic ratio (%) and mean harmonic to noise ratio (dB) were highly significant (P<0.001). Out of these only few acoustic features viz. Pitch (mean and range), formants (F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5), number of pulse, degree of voice breaks, shimmer and mean noise to harmonic ratio (%) were observed to have significant difference for each and every individual cow, therefore only these features could be suggested as the best suited acoustic features for discrimination of individual dairy cattle from their herd. Acoustic features of voice signals uttered from different cows proved to be a passive indicator in discrimination of individual cow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abioacoustics 3acows 3adairy animals 3adairy cattle 3aenergy 3afarms 3aherds 3alactation 3amonitoring 3aperiodicity 0aAcoustic features 0aKaran Fries crossbred cows 0aFormants 0aPitch 0aIndividual discrimination1 aLathwal, Surender S.1 aRajput, Nitendra1 aRaja, Thiruvothur V.1 aGupta, Ashok K.1 aMohanty, Tushar K.1 aRuhil, Anand P.1 aChakravarty, Atish K.1 aSharma, Prakash C.1 aSharma, Vijay1 aChandra, Gulab0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2013 June, v. 146, no. 1-4 p.11-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2013.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245021900160500002000379520177500399592002802174596003502202650002402237650002502261650001702286650001802303650001602321650001302337650001302350650002402363650001602387650002002403650001402423650001902437650001202456650002302468650002502491700006702516700003002583700002002613773012702633856007502760852000902835655001202844IND60788277220221122215723.0220812e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078827722DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.141912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatifi, Ebrahim10aFerula assa‐foetida oleo gum resin ethanolic extract alleviated the pancreatic changes and antioxidant status in streptozotocin‐induced diabetic rats: A biochemical, histopathological, and ultrastructural study  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe current research examines the effects of administration of 150 and 250 mg/kg body weight/day of ethanolic Ferula assa‐foetida L. oleo gum resin extract (FAE) for 42 days in streptozotocin‐induced diabetes in rats. On day 42, all rats were euthanized; HOMA‐β, HOMA‐IR, and QUICKI levels in pancreas were examined histopathologically and ultrastructurally . Low‐dose FAE (150 mg/kg) treatment resulted in significant improvement in serum glucose, insulin and superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase levels (p < .05). It also improved β‐cell function, restored pancreatic β‐cells, and reduced insulin resistance compared to the diabetic control rats. Necrotic and degenerative alterations in the islets, pyknotic β‐cell nuclei, β‐cell degranulation, reduced islet cellular density, and significant vacuolation were found in the islets of STZ‐diabetic control group ratsby the histomorphological and ultrastructural examination. The pancreatic histomorphology of low dose of FAE‐treated diabetic rats showed remarkable improvements in the islets, such as the β‐cell number and the area of the pancreatic islets. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The experiment revealed that Ferula assa‐foetida L. may exert antihyperglycemic activity in STZ diabetes via β‐cell regeneration and its high antioxidant capacity. This work elucidates the role of Ferula assa‐foetida L. in diabetes management. Ferula assa‐foetida L. gum extract improved the morphological changes of the diabetic pancreas and stimulated the regeneration of the β cells. The findings demonstrated positive results for the long‐term cure of diabetes. Additionally, this study showed the potential of isolating nutraceuticals for the development of medications.  aPublisher supplied data  cFerdowsi University of Mashhad 3aFerula assa-foetida 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acatalase 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3aglutathione 3aglycemic effect 3agum resin 3ahistopathology 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aMohammadpour, Ahmad Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6122-11871 aFathi Hafshejani, Behrooz1 aNourani, Hosein0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 46, no. 8 p.e14191-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.141913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016900164300001400333520121200347592002801559650001601587650000801603650000901611650001701620650002001637650001001657650002201667650001001689650005201699650001201751650001701763653002001780653000901800653004701809653001601856653001101872653001701883700001701900700001901917700001701936700001601953773009301969856005102062852000902113655001202122IND50087765720221118110650.0140412e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008776572DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2010.5050172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuchi, N.10aLaser microdissection on Norway spruce bark tissue: A suitable protocol for subsequent real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis  ap. 92-98.  aThe development of new tools able to select specific plant tissue is crucial for gene expression studies. During the last years, the use of laser microdissection, mainly tested on herbaceous plant tissue, has been found to be a useful technique for these purposes. This method is poorly tested on woody species, and so far no studies of gene expression have been applied on forest trees. For this reason the present work proposes the optimization of a functional protocol using laser microdissection pressure catapulting (LMPC) and real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in bark stem tissue of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Bark tissue fragments were collected from Norway spruce trees and sliced with a cryostat. RNA was extracted from both whole cross-sections and microdissected bark cells. The feasibility of the method was confirmed by the amplification of the α-tubulin, an endogenous gene of P. abies, with efficiency comparable to that obtained from non-microdissected tissue. The proposed protocol, here adapted for bark tissue of woody species, represents a useful tool in a wide range of hosts that, unlike herbaceous plants, have scarcely been considered up to now.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aRNA 3abark 3aforest trees 3agene expression 3agenes 3aherbaceous plants 3ahosts 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atubulin 3awoody plants 0aα-Tubulin gene 0abark 0alaser microdissection pressure catapulting 0aPicea abies 0aRT-PCR 0awoody plants1 aCapretti, P.1 aFossdal, C.

In this regard, considering group heterogeneity, we analyzed the trend of energy productivity changes under Meta frontier Malmquist framework (MMEPI) based on Shephard energy distance function over 2000–2016 year period in SSA. Additionally, external factors of energy productivity changes are explored using Tobit regression model. The results indicate improvement in energy productivity, but the average distribution density shows a backward trend. The growth is principally driven by technological progress, which signals a greater potential in improving technical efficiency changes. Also, there are significant disparities in energy productivity changes across income groups. This suggests that employing Meta frontier technology overcomes the potential of underestimating productivity levels. The regression results depict that energy price, GDP growth, and population density positively support improvement in MMEPI. We support the view that each country should examine its local features, design and implement specific techniques and collectively build a regional sustainable energy development level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aincome 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3arenewable energy sources 3asocioeconomics 3aAfrica 0aSub Saharan Africa 0aMeta frontier Malmquist analysis 0aSustainability 0aEnergy productivity changes 0aTobit regression1 aSai, Rockson1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3603-22100 tEnergy.g2022 July 01, v. 250 p.123833-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1238333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001600274520130400290592002801594650001401622650001901636650001001655650001801665650001601683650001401699650001401713650002401727650001001751650001601761653002101777653001601798653002401814653002101838653000801859653002201867700002701889773012601916856008102042852000902123655001202132IND60655484420221118161007.0190801e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065548442DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585120000862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKettner, Keith10aDose–response of germinating Rudbeckia mollis (Asteraceae) seeds exposed to various thermal scenarios  ap. 191-197.  aTemperature is a key environmental signal regulating germination. A thorough understanding of how seed populations respond to various temperatures can inform end-users regarding effective establishment strategies and forms the basis for questions related to a taxon's thermo-biology. Although abundant information exists regarding germination responses of economically important crops to several temperature scenarios, much less is known concerning the seed biology of wild germplasm. To address this, we examined the germination response of non-dormant Rudbeckia mollis seeds to various doses of constant or simulated seasonal diel temperatures. Germination response was sigmoidal. Seeds of R. mollis were capable of germinating within a few days to high percentages (>95%) at relatively cool constant (15–25°C) or 12-hour alternating (22/11–33/24°C) temperatures, with optimum temperatures for germination occurring at 25°C or 29/19°C. Germination was inhibited as temperatures increased to 30°C or 33/24°C with early and late germinating phenotypes displaying differential responses at these temperatures. No germination occurred at 35°C. Results are discussed in terms of seedling establishment of R. mollis outside its natural range and implications of climate change on germination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRudbeckia 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adose response 3agermination 3agermplasm 3aphenotype 3aplant establishment 3aseeds 3atemperature 0agermination rate 0aheat stress 0aoptimum temperature 0aRudbeckia mollis 0at50 0athermo-inhibition1 aPérez, Hector Eduardo0 tSeed science research.g2012 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.191-197dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl50007x1475-27357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585120000863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03742naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015100156300001600307500002000323520222100343592002802564650001702592650001902609650001802628650002602646650001802672650001602690650000902706650002402715650001502739650001402754650001302768650000902781650003702790650001602827650001402843650003002857650002102887650000902908650001702917650001202934650001702946700001802963700001502981700001402996773013203010856007303142852000903215655001203224IND60587885620221121013554.0180102e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058788562DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.132292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLollai, S.A.10aCharacterization of resistance to tetracyclines and aminoglycosides of sheep mastitis pathogens: study of the effect of gene content on resistance  ap. 941-951.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Mastitis causes economic losses and antimicrobials are frequently used for mastitis treatment. Antimicrobial resistance surveys are still rare in the ovine field and characterization of strains is important in order to acquire information about resistance and for optimization of therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens recovered in milk samples from mastitis‐affected ewes were characterized for resistance to tetracyclines and aminoglycosides, members of which are frequently used antimicrobials in small ruminants. A total of 185 strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci, common mastitis pathogens, were tested for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and for resistance genes by PCR. Effects of different tet genes arrangements on MICs were also investigated. Staphylococci expressed the lowest MIC for tetracycline and tet(K) was the most common gene recovered; tet(M) and tet(O) were also found. Gene content was shown to influence the tetracycline MIC values. Enterococci and streptococci showed higher MICs to tetracyclines and nonsusceptible strains always harboured at least one ribosomal protection gene (MIC above 8 μg ml⁻¹). Streptococci often harboured two or more tet determinants. As regards the resistance to aminoglycosides, staphylococci showed the lowest gentamicin and kanamycin median MIC along with streptomycin high level resistant (HLR) strains (MIC >1024 μg ml⁻¹) all harbouring str gene. The resistance determinant aac(6′)‐Ie‐aph(2″)‐Ia was present in few strains. Streptococci were basically nonsusceptible to aminoglycosides but neither HLR isolates nor resistance genes were detected. Enterococci revealed the highest MICs for gentamicin; two str harbouring isolates were shown to be HLR to streptomycin. CONCLUSION: Evidence was obtained for the circulation of antimicrobial‐resistant strains and genes in sheep dairy farming. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Tetracycline MIC of 64 μg ml⁻¹ and high‐level resistance were detected for streptomycin (MIC >1024 μg ml⁻¹), so that effectiveness of common treatments may be at risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aStaphylococcus 3aStreptococcus 3aantibiotic resistance 3adairy farming 3adoxycycline 3aewes 3afinancial economics 3agentamicin 3akanamycin 3amastitis 3amilk 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aminocycline 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aresistance genes 3arisk 3astreptomycin 3asurveys 3atherapeutics1 aZiccheddu, M.1 aDuprè, I.1 aPiras, D.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 121, no. 4 p.941-951dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.132293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012200164520142000286592002801706650002101734650001101755650002401766650000901790650002401799653002501823653001601848653002301864653002101887653002501908700001901933700001701952700001901969773009001988856008502078852000902163655001202172IND60772463820221118214428.0220628e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077246382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1238342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ke10aAnalysis and evaluation of heat source data of large-scale heating system based on descriptive data mining techniques  aThe on-demand parameters of heat source are the precondition for ensuring the safe, stable and energy-saving operation of heating system. For large-scale heating system, the existing predictive methods are not applicable due to the complexity of modeling, while the design heating load index method has many influencing factors, resulting in a low accuracy of obtaining accurate values. In this paper, firstly, the simplified mathematical model of the heating substation is built, and the calculation methods of under-demand rate (η) and energy-saving rate (ς) are proposed for diagnosis thermal balance and evaluation energy-saving potential. Secondly, the variation relationship among heat source parameters is analyzed and the input parameters of the analysis process are determined, then cluster analysis is adopted to identify the operation strategy, and non-on-demand clusters are eliminated from the perspective of professional knowledge. Thirdly, the data in the remaining clusters are discretized, association analysis is used to obtain the frequent item-sets of each cluster, and on-demand heating parameters of each cluster are obtained. Finally, η and ς are used to evaluate the object heating system. This application reveals that the descriptive data mining techniques combined with professional knowledge can successfully identify the on-demand parameters from the historical data of heat source.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3amathematical models 0aOn-demand parameters 0aHeat source 0aMathematical model 0aCluster analysis 0aAssociation analysis1 aYuan, Jianjuan1 aZhou, Zhihua1 aZheng, Xuejing0 tEnergy.g2022 July 15, v. 251 p.123834-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1238343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002300158245009900181300001600280506002800296520220600324592002802530506003702558650002502595650002102620650002502641650002302666650001002689650001302699650001402712650001602726650001902742650002402761650001502785650001402800650001502814653002202829653002702851653003302878653003102911653003802942773018502980856009303165852000903258655001203267IND60739772520221207102338.0200422e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073977252DNAL7 a10.30766/2072-9081.2020.21.2.124-1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShchekleina, L.

The affection of the sowings (spread of the disease), the development of the disease and the area of the affected crops relative to the number of the examined ones were evaluated. The trend in the development of the diseases was established on the basis of a regression analysis of long-term data of the branch of the FSBI Rosselkhozcentr in Kirov region. The annual (100 %) manifestation of snow mold and ergot has been established. Next according to the frequency of manifestation there are root rots and brown rust – 95 %, powdery mildew – 75 %, sclerotinia – 70 %, Fusarium head blight – 70 %, and stem rust – 50 %. A relatively low frequency of manifestation has been observed with septoriose and rhynchosporium – 35 and 30 %. However, taking into account the development of winter rye diseases which exceed the economic threshold of harmfulness (ETH), the studied pathocomplexes have different levels of danger. Thus, the development of brown rust above ETH was diagnosed 13 times within 19 years. The most severe disease development (20.0-52.0 %) was in 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2010; weak - in 2007 (0.8 %), 2017 (1.4 %), 2015 (2.4 %), and 2011 (5 %). The manifestation of powdery mildew above ETH was observed 6 times within 15 years, disease development was at the level of 13.0-53.0 %. The development of septoriose above ETH was diagnosed 6 times within 7 years with the development of disease from 13.5 to 63.0 %. Development of stem rust above ETH was diagnosed 5 times within 10 years with the status of the sign of 15.0-20.0 %. The cyclicity of spread of the most harmful diseases and trends of their change in agrocenoses of winter rye are shown. Thus, the most epitphytotically dangerous diseases include snow mold, brown rust, stem rust, powdery mildew and septoriose. Constant control is also required in relation to ergot and Fusarium head blight. These diseases should be an object for breeding-and-immunological studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium head blight 3adisease severity 3adisease transmission 3aeconomic threshold 3aergot 3aimmunity 3aleaf rust 3aperiodicity 3apowdery mildew 3aregression analysis 3asnow molds 3astem rust 3awinter rye 0asecale cereale l. 0aphytosanitary analysis 0alevel of disease development 0afrequency of manifestation 0aeconomic threshold of harmfulness0 tAgrarnaâ nauka Evro-Severo-Vostoka.g2020 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.124-132dFederal Agricultural Research Center of the North-East named N.V.

In macaque monkeys, cortical synaptogenesis peaks during early infancy and developmental changes in synapse density and dendritic spines occur synchronously across cortical regions. Thus, relatively prolonged synapse and neuronal maturation in humans might contribute to enhancement of social learning during development and transmission of cultural practices, including language. However, because macaques, which share a last common ancestor with humans ∼25 million years ago, have served as the predominant comparative primate model in neurodevelopmental research, the paucity of data from more closely related great apes leaves unresolved when these evolutionary changes in the timing of cortical development became established in the human lineage. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and Golgi staining to characterize synaptic density and dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory (area 3b), primary motor (area 4), prestriate visual (area 18), and prefrontal (area 10) cortices of developing chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We found that synaptogenesis occurs synchronously across cortical areas, with a peak of synapse density during the juvenile period (3–5 y). Moreover, similar to findings in humans, dendrites of prefrontal pyramidal neurons developed later than sensorimotor areas. These results suggest that evolutionary changes to neocortical development promoting greater neuronal plasticity early in postnatal life preceded the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMacaca 3aPan troglodytes 3aadulthood 3aanimal models 3acortex 3adendrites 3aelectron microscopy 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainfancy 3ajuveniles 3alearning 3amonkeys 3aneocortex 3aneuroplasticity 3apruning 3asynapse 3asynaptogenesis 0aevolution 0aGolgi stain 0abrain 0aontogeny1 aStimpson, Cheryl D.1 aDuka, Tetyana1 aLarsen, Michael D.1 aJanssen, William G.

This work presents a novel method for the detection and quantification of trace drugs and metabolites off of a swipe material using a thermal desorption direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (TD-DART-MS) configuration. A variation on traditional DART, this configuration allows for desorption of the sample into a confined tube, completely independent of the DART source, allowing for more efficient and thermally precise analysis of material present on a swipe. Over thirty trace samples of narcotics, metabolites, and cutting agents deposited onto swipes were rapidly differentiated using this methodology. The non-optimized method led to sensitivities ranging from single nanograms to hundreds of picograms. Direct comparison to traditional DART with a subset of the samples highlighted an improvement in sensitivity by a factor of twenty to thirty and an increase in reproducibility, measuring integrated area of the base peak, sample to sample from approximately 45% RSD to less than 15% RSD. Rapid extraction-less quantification was also possible.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acutting agents 3adesorption 3aforensic sciences 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3anarcotics 3arapid methods 3ascreening1 aForbes, Thomas P.1 aStaymates, Matthew E.1 aGillen, G.q(Greg),0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 8, no. 35 p.6494-6499dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay01851c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012900164300001800293520117400311592002801485596011501513596005901628596006301687596009301750650002501843650002501868650001101893650001901904650002901923650001401952650001701966650002001983650001002003650002002013650002802033650001002061650003302071650001002104653001602114653003302130653004002163700001702203700001502220700001502235700001402250700001702264700001302281700005402294700001602348700001602364700001602380700001902396700001702415700001602432700002002448700001402468700001702482700005602499773013402555856008302689852000902772655001202781IND60764131820221118130517.0220125e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076413182DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-11-20-0506-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Puwen12aA Ricin B-Like Lectin Protein Physically Interacts with TaPFT and Is Involved in Resistance to Fusarium Head Blight in Wheat  ap. 2309-2316.  aFusarium head blight (FHB), mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum, has become one of the most serious diseases that damage wheat. The TaPFT (pore-forming toxin-like) and TaHRC (histidine-rich calcium-binding protein) genes at the quantitative trait locus Fhb1 were identified to confer resistance to FHB in the wheat cultivar Sumai 3. In this study, a wheat ricin B-like lectin gene (designated TaRBL) that interacted with TaPFT was isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen of a wheat cDNA library. A yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation study further verified that TaRBL interacted with TaPFT but not with TaHRC. Gene expression studies showed that upon F. graminearum infection, TaRBL expression was upregulated in resistant cultivars but downregulated in susceptible cultivars. Furthermore, knockdown of TaRBL expression by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing significantly reduced the resistance of wheat to FHB in both the resistant cultivar Sumai 3 and the susceptible cultivar Jimai 22. Thus, we conclude that TaRBL encodes a ricin B-like lectin protein that interacts with TaPFT and is involved in resistance to FHB in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data  a192102110131a192102110030a212102110265cKey Scientific and Technological Research Projects in Henan Province  a31872129cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a212300410143cNatural Science Foundation of Henan Province  aYu degree [2018]cPostgraduate Education Reform and Quality Improvement Project of Henan 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3abarley 3acDNA libraries 3acalcium-binding proteins 3acultivars 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agenes 3aplant pathology 3aquantitative trait loci 3aricin 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3awheat 0ainteraction 0avirus-induced gene silencing 0awheat PFT RBL (ricin B-like lectin)1 aZhang, Lufan1 aWu, Liuliu1 aHu, Haiyan1 aLiu, Qili1 aLi, Dongxiao1 aHu, Ping1 aZhou, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4030-67041 aBu, Ruifang1 aWei, Qichao1 aYu, Yongang1 aGuan, Yuanyuan1 aChen, Eryong1 aSu, Xiaojia1 aHuang, Zhongwen1 aQiao, Mei1 aRu, Zhengang1 aLi, Chengwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3614-22760 tPhytopathology.g2021 Dec., v. 111, no. 12 p.2309-2316dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-11-20-0506-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002100192245009000213300001600303506007600319520193300395592002802328506003702356650001502393650002002408650002002428650001702448650001902465650001802484650002202502650001402524650001102538650000702549650002402556650000902580650002002589650001002609653001802619653003402637653002502671700002402696700002202720700003002742700002502772700002002797700002302817700006102840773011502901856008603016852000903102655001203111IND60605320220221207071645.0201125e20180910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060532022DNAL7 a299905262pmid7 aPMC61418102pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMigdadi, Eman M.10aHydrogel-forming microneedles enhance transdermal delivery of metformin hydrochloride  ap. 142-151.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe investigated, for the first time, the potential for a hydrogel-forming microneedle (MN) patch to deliver the high-dose drug metformin HCl transdermally in a sustained manner. This may minimize some gastrointestinal side effects and small intestine absorption variations associated with oral delivery. Patches (two layers) were assembled from a lyophilised drug reservoir layer, with the MN layer made from aqueous blend of 20% w/w poly (methylvinylether-co-maleic acid) crosslinked by esterification with 7.5% w/w poly (ethylene glycol) 10,000 Da. >90% of metformin was recovered from homogeneous drug reservoirs. Drug reservoir dissolution time in PBS (pH 7.4) was <10 min. MN penetrated a validated skin model Parafilm® M consistently. Permeation of metformin HCl across dermatomed neonatal porcine skin in vitro was enhanced by using MN. The combined MN and metformin HCl reservoir patch (containing 75 mg or 50 mg metformin HCl, respectively) delivered 9.71 ± 2.22 mg and 10.04 ± 1.92 mg at 6 h, respectively, and 28.15 ± 2.37 mg and 23.25 ± 3.58 mg at 24 h, respectively.In comparison, 0.34 ± 0.39 mg and 0.85 ± 0.68 mg was delivered at 6 h, respectively, and 0.39 ± 0.39 mg and 1.01 ± 0.84 mg was delivered at 24 h, respectively, from a control set-up employing only the drug reservoirs. In vivo, metformin HCl was detected in rat plasma at 1 h post MN application at a concentration of 0.62 ± 0.51 μg/mL, increasing to 3.76 ± 2.58 μg/ml at 3 h. A maximal concentration of 3.77 ± 2.09 μg/ml was achieved at 24 h. Cₛₛ was 3.2 μg/mL. Metformin transdermal bioavailability using MNs was estimated as 30%.Hydrogel-forming MN are a promising technology that has demonstrated successful transdermal delivery of metformin HCl. Potential clearly exists for administration of other high-dose drugs using this system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aadverse effects 3abioavailability 3acrosslinking 3aesterification 3afreeze drying 3ahydrochloric acid 3ametformin 3amodels 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3arats 3asmall intestine 3aswine 0aMetformin HCl 0aHydrogel-forming microneedles 0aTransdermal delivery1 aCourtenay, Aaron J.1 aTekko, Ismaiel A.1 aMcCrudden, Maelíosa T.C.1 aKearney, Mary-Carmel1 aMcAlister, Emma1 aMcCarthy, Helen O.1 aDonnelly, Ryan F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0766-41470 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 Sept. 10, v. 285 p.142-151dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007600163300001800239500002000257520161500277592002801892650002101920650001501941650002801956650002501984650002202009650002002031650002302051650001802074650001002092650001802102650001202120650001802132650002002150650001202170650001102182651001102193700002202204700002002226700001702246700002502263700001802288700002802306773013402334856007302468852000902541655001202550IND60587885920221121023902.0180102e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058788592DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.132352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarminati, J. de A.10aMicrobiological contamination in peanut confectionery processing plants  ap. 1071-1078.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: In order to investigate Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, Escherichia coli and Salmonella contamination, a survey was conducted at three peanut confectionery processing companies (A, B and C) in Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of different peanut confectionery products (n = 59), peanut raw material (n = 30), manufacturing environment (n = 116) and workers' hand surfaces (n = 12) were analysed. Salmonella and E. coli were not detected in any final product or raw material analysed. Enterobacteriaceae was isolated from 15% of final products. Coliforms were detected in only one sample. Referring to the raw material, six samples showed contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and three samples by coliforms. For the process environment, 19% and 11% of samples presented Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms. Escherichia coli was detected in 5% of samples, and one of these samples tested positive for Salmonella; this strain was serotyping as S. Heidelberg. All food handlers surveyed in Company C showed Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms on their hands. Escherichia coli was isolated from one food worker's hand. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the manufacturing environment, including food handlers were considered the main sources for possible contamination of peanut confectionery products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This has been the first study to investigate the occurrence of Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae throughout peanut confectionery processing lines. The results might be used to assist risk assessment studies and to establish more effective control measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3abacterial contamination 3abusiness enterprises 3acoliform bacteria 3acontrol methods 3afood contamination 3afood handling 3ahands 3amanufacturing 3apeanuts 3araw materials 3arisk assessment 3asurveys 3asweets 3aBrazil1 aAmorim Neto, D.P.1 aMorishita, K.N.1 aTakano, L.V.1 aOlivier Bernardi, A.1 aCopetti, M.V.1 ado Nascimento, M. da S.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 121, no. 4 p.1071-1078dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.132353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245016700169500002200336520135300358592002801711650001301739650001601752650002101768650001301789650001701802650000901819650001201828650001201840650001301852650002401865650001601889650000701905650001101912650001501923653001601938653003201954653003301986653001902019653002202038653001702060700002802077700002202105700001802127773007702145856008702222852000902309655001202318IND60584730620221119220644.0171028s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058473062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuri, Petra10aInfluence of support materials on continuous hydrogen production in anaerobic packed-bed reactor with immobilized hydrogen producing bacteria at acidic conditions  aPre-press version  aThis study assesses the impact of different support materials (Mutag BioChip™, expanded clay and activated carbon) on microbial hydrogen production in an anaerobic packed-bed reactor (APBR) treating synthetic waste water containing glucose as the main carbon source at low pH value. The APBRs were inoculated with acid pretreated anaerobic sludge and operated at pH value of 4±0.2 and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3h. The maximum hydrogen yield of 1.80mol H2/mol glucose was achieved for the APBR packed with Mutag BioChip™ (R1), followed by expanded clay (R2, 1.74mol H2/mol glucose) and activated carbon (R3, 1.46mol H2/mol glucose). It was observed that the investigated support materials influenced the immobilization of hydrogen producing bacteria and consequently hydrogen production performance as well as composition of soluble metabolites. The main metabolic products were acetic acid and butyric acid accompanied with a smaller content of ethanol. The data indicated that in reactors with higher hydrogen yield (R1 and R2), acetate/butyrate (HAc/HBu) ratios were 1.7 and 1.6, respectively, while in the reactor with the lowest hydrogen yield (R3) the obtained HAc/HBu ratio was 4.8. Finally, stable hydrogen and organic acids production throughout the steady-state operation period at low pH values was achieved in all reactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3aactivated carbon 3abacteria 3abutyric acid 3aclay 3aethanol 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ametabolites 3apH 3asludge 3awastewater 0abiohydrogen 0ahydrogen producing bacteria 0aanaerobic packed-bed reactor 0aimmobilization 0asupport materials 0alow pH value1 aMarinšek-Logar, Romana1 aDjinovića, Petar1 aPintar, Albin0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04013naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245017200218520217600390592002802566650002502594650001402619650001802633650001702651650001202668650000902680650001702689650001602706650003102722650001002753650002302763650001502786650001302801650001802814650001402832650001002846650001002856650002502866650001002891651001102901653001702912653001302929653002602942653003502968653002303003653002303026700003003049700002803079700001803107700002803125700007303153773011403226856008603340852000903426655001203435IND60729051820221119234834.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072905182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1133482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Caroline Sprengel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1798-899410aAnthelmintic effect of Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae) on eggs and larvae of Haemonchus contortus: Analyses of structure-activity relationships based on phenolic compounds  aDue to high prevalence and large pathogenicity, Haemonchus contortus is the main gastrointestinal nematode in tropical and subtropical regions. This species is responsible for severe economic losses to sheep and goat breeders in Brazil. The control of this parasite is currently compromised, mainly, due to anthelmintic resistance. In the search for natural anthelmintic alternatives, Pterogyne nitens, a native Brazilian tree with potential ethnopharmacological activity, has been identified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of ethanolic extracts and phenolic compounds from P. nitens, as well as two commercial flavonoids (chrysin and morin), to derive the chemical structure and anthelmintic activity. The ovicidal and larvicidal activity of ethanolic extracts from leaves (EEL) and fruits (EEFR), as well as natural compounds from P. nitens on H. contortus were evaluated through egg hatch assay (EHA) and larval development assay (LDA). The results showed that all extracts, especially the phenolic compounds were active in the EHA and LDA. The egg hatch inhibitory effects of EEL (EC₅₀ = 316 μg/mL) were more potent than EEFR (EC₅₀ = 512 μg/mL). However, larval development inhibitory effects of EEL (EC₅₀ = 47 μg/mL) and EEFR (EC₅₀ = 35 μg/mL) were similar. Among the compounds, the flavones (sorbifolin, pedalitin, and chrysin) did not have inhibitory effects on egg hatching but presented some activity against larval development of H. contortus. In contrast, the flavonols (quercetin, rutin, and morin) showed high activity in the EHA but were inactive in the LDA. The addition of at hydroxyl group and rutinose group to the flavonoid structure increased the ovicidal and larvicidal activity, respectively. The phenolic acids showed potent anthelmintic activity: caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and gallic acid had the highest anthelmintic effects, presenting EC₅₀ values of 1.48, 0.56, and 4.93 μg/mL in the EHA; and 31, 22, and 33 μg/mL in the LDA, respectively. These results suggest that P. nitens might be a source of effective alternative compounds to control H. contortus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aPterogyne 3aanthelmintics 3acaffeic acid 3achrysin 3aeggs 3aferulic acid 3agallic acid 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3agoats 3alarval development 3alarvicides 3aovicides 3apathogenicity 3aquercetin 3arutin 3asheep 3atraditional medicine 3atrees 3aBrazil 0aAnthelmintic 0aIn vitro 0aEgg hatch assay (EHA) 0aLarval development assay (LDA) 0aEthanolic extracts 0aPhenolic compounds1 aPereira, Matheus Henrique1 aGainza, Yousmel Alemán1 aHoste, Hervé1 aRegasini, Luís Octavio1 aChagas, Ana Carolina de Souza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3939-00880 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 June, v. 164 p.113348-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1133483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01433naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012300160300001800283520034100301592002800642650001700670650001100687650002200698700001900720700001700739700001200756700001800768700001600786700001800802700001200820700001700832700001800849773012100867856007400988852000901062655001201071IND60667052320221121092601.0190919e20141219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066705232DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra12704h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei-Guang10aLaxiflorol A, the first example of 7,8:15,16-di-seco-15-nor-21-homo-ent-kauranoid from Isodon eriocalyx var. laxiflora  ap. 6132-6135.  aLaxiflorol A (1), an unprecedented 7,8:15,16-di-seco-15-nor-21-homo-ent-kauranoid, and its precursor analogue, laxiflorol B (2), were isolated from the leaves of Isodon eriocalyx var. laxiflora.

The algorithms – watershed segmentation, region growing and valley-following – were tested on softwood and hardwood sites using Emerge natural colour vertical aerial imagery with 60 cm ground sampled distance and QuickBird panchromatic imagery with an 11˚ look angle. The evaluation considered both plot-level and individual tree crown detection and delineation results. The study shows that while all three methods reasonably delineate crowns in the softwood stand on the Emerge image, region growing provided the highest accuracies, with producer's and user's accuracy for tree detection reaching 70% and root mean square error for crown diameter estimation of 15%. Crown detection accuracies were lower on the QuickBird image. No algorithm proved accurate for the hardwood stand on either image set (both producer's and user's accuracies < 30%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3ahardwood 3ahardwood forests 3aimage analysis 3apanchromatic imagery 3asoftwood 3atree crown 3atrees 3awatersheds1 aQuackenbush, Lindi J.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2011 July 10, v. 32, no. 13 p.3625-3647dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161003762355  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012800170500001400298520138000312592002801692650001601720650001801736650002501754650002101779650001601800650001201816650003501828650002501863650002801888650002301916650001901939650001401958650001301972650002101985700002402006700002802030700001902058700001902077700002002096773013402116856008302250852000902333655001202342IND60721527620221119112523.0201224e20201126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072152762DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101205842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalska, Iwona 10aEffect of Selenium Form and Salicylic Acid on the Accumulation of Selenium Speciation Forms in Hydroponically Grown Lettuce  aNAL-light  aSelenium (Se) uptake by plants depends on its form and salicylic acid (SA) can increase the efficiency of plant biofortification in Se. This study investigated the effects of selenite (Na₂SeO₃) and selenomethionine (SeMet) applied individually or together with SA on a total content of Se, Se speciation forms, yield and content of sugars and ascorbic acid of lettuce, as well as activity of selenocysteine methyltransferase (smt) and methionine methyltransferase (mmt) genes of the Se metabolic pathway. Lettuce was grown in the nutrient film technique (NFT) system. Se and SA were used at doses of 0.5 and 10.0 mg dm⁻³ of the nutrient solution, respectively. The treatments were: 1. control, 2. Na₂SeO₃, 3. Na₂SeO₃ + SA, 4. SeMet, 5. SeMet + SA, 6. SA. Se was accumulated more in the roots than the leaves. SeMet was more effective in biofortification than Na₂SeO₃. SA enhanced Se uptake, especially organic Se. Plants supplied with SeMet alone or SeMet + SA accumulated in their leaves mainly SeMet and methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys), while those treated with Na₂SeO₃ or Na₂SeO₃ + SA accumulated MeSeCys and selenite (SeO₃⁻²). The roots showed no expression of smt, while the expression of two mmt genes was independent of either Se or SA. The leaves of plants supplied with Na₂SeO₃ demonstrated the strongest expression of mmt and smt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aascorbic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofortification 3ahydroponics 3alettuce 3amethionine S-methyltransferase 3amethylselenocysteine 3anutrient film technique 3anutrient solutions 3asalicylic acid 3aselenites 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine1 aSmoleń, Sylwester 1 aCzernicka, Małgorzata 1 aHalka, Maryia 1 aKęska, Kinga 1 aPitala, Joanna 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Nov. 26, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101205843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001900172245010900191300001600300520126700316592002801583650001801611650002001629650001901649650001401668650001501682650001301697650001801710650001401728650001401742650001501756650002001771650001801791650003801809650001201847650002701859650002601886650004301912650001301955650002201968650001501990650001902005650002102024650005302045700001602098700002202114700001802136700001702154773008302171856008902254852000902343655001202352IND4466562220221120034153.0141110e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446656222DNAL7 a225133372pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirtori, Carla10aPhotolysis of flumequine: Identification of the major phototransformation products and toxicity measures  ap. 627-634.  aDirect photolysis of flumequine (FLU, 20mgL⁻¹) in different types of water (demineralised water (DW) and synthetic seawater (SW)), was conducted in a Suntest CPS+solar simulator to evaluate its persistence and toxicity, and to identify the major phototransformation products (PTPs) generated during photolysis in DW. It was observed that FLU is susceptible to transformation when subjected to direct solar radiation. The composition of the water affects the FLU degradation kinetics, which is slower in SW. Photolytic transformation products generated during direct photolysis were identified by liquid chromatography–time of flight–mass spectrometry (LC–TOF–MS). Fourteen PTPs generated in DW were identified. The transformation of FLU begins with the opening of the heterocyclic ring by oxidation of the double bond. Loss of the fluorine atom and the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring also appear as the majority, especially in the early stages. Comparative acute toxicity evaluation by Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna bioassays was performed for the first and last irradiated solutions in both matrices studied. These bioassays demonstrated that in the SW matrix, the most persistent PTPs are highly toxic to D. magna but less so to V. fischeri.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aVibrio fischeri 3aacute toxicity 3abioassays 3aflumequine 3afluorine 3ahydroxylation 3ainfluenza 3aoxidation 3aphotolysis 3asolar radiation 3awater quality 2aAliivibrio fischerixdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aDaphniaxdrug effects 2aFluoroquinolonesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aKinetics 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPhotolysis 2aToxicity Tests 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxtoxicity.1 aZapata, Ana1 aGernjak, Wolfgang1 aMalato, Sixto1 aAgüera, Ana0 tChemosphere.g2012 July, v. 88, no. 5 p.627-634dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245012100209520176500330592002802095650001402123650001402137650001502151650001902166650001602185650001102201650001902212650003102231650001902262650001102281653001902292653002202311653001502333653001802348653001302366700001802379700001802397700002102415700002102436700001902457700005502476700006402531773009002595856008502685852000902770655001202779IND60756512320221119030540.0220328e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075651232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1226032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAğbulut, Ümit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6635-649410aSynthesis of graphene oxide nanoparticles and the influences of their usage as fuel additives on CI engine behaviors  aThe present paper aims to investigate the synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles, and the comprehensive investigation of their use along with the waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCO) and diesel fuel blend on combustion, injection, performance, and emission characteristics of a diesel engine under varying engine loads from 3 to 12 Nm with the gaps of 3 Nm at a fixed speed of 2400 rpm. The test fuels named B0 (completely neat diesel fuel), B15 (85% diesel and 15% WCO), B15 + 100 ppm GO (B15 and 100 ppm GO), B15 + 500 ppm GO (B15 and 500 ppm GO), B15 + 1000 ppm GO (B15 and 1000 ppm GO). In the results, it is noticed that blending of biodiesel into conventional diesel fuel drops the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 2.67%, CO by 7.5%, HC emissions by 8.53%, and increases the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 5.54%, and NOx emissions by 3.37% compared to those of reference-fuel B0. However, nanoparticle-added test fuels exhibit a respectable enhancement in all performance and emission characteristics. With the addition of GO nanoparticles, BTE increases by 7.90%, and BSFC drops by 9.72% due to the improved energy content of test fuels. On the other hand, NOx is pulled back by 15.17% due to both superior surface to volume area ratio and thermal properties of GO nanoparticles. Moreover, GO nanoparticles act as the oxygen buffer, and catalyst the chemical reactions until the combustion process. Accordingly, GO ensures more complete combustion, and therefore reduces CO emission by 22.5% and HC emission by 30.23%. In the conclusion, the present paper declares that GO nanoparticles can give a satisfying solution to improve the worsened characteristics arising from biodiesel and diesel binary blends in CI engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3aenergy use and consumption 3agraphene oxide 3aoxygen 0aGraphene oxide 0aWaste cooking oil 0aCombustion 0aNanoparticles 0aEmission1 aElibol, Erdem1 aDemirci, Tuna1 aSarıdemir, Suat1 aGürel, Ali Etem1 aRajak, Upendra1 aAfzal, Asif1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2961-61861 aVerma, Tikendra Nath1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1156-04120 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122603-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1226033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166520171000256592002801966650001101994650000802005650001402013650001002027650001502037650002402052650001502076650001402091650001402105650001802119650002402137653001302161653002102174653003602195653000802231653001402239653000802253653000802261653000802269653000802277653000802285653000802293653000802301653000702309653001202316653000802328700001602336700001802352700001702370700001602387700005402403700001702457700001702474700001502491700001502506773009602521856008502617852000902702655001202711IND60782812920221120044620.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078281292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1543232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ziyan10aBrusatol suppresses the growth of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by PI3K/Akt pathway  aIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a malignancy with a hidden onset, high metastasis recurrence rate, and poor prognosis. Research on effective drugs for ICC is important for improving the prognosis of patients in the clinic. Brusatol is a quassinoid extracted from the seeds of Brucea sumatrana and has been shown to have the potential to inhibit tumor metastasis and proliferation. There has been no scientific research on the therapeutic effect of brusatol on ICC. Our study offers a novel strategy for the therapy of ICC. Explore effects of brusatol treatment on ICC and clarify the possible mechanism. Various cell functional experiments and basic experimental techniques were applied to ICC cell lines to explore the influences of brusatol on ICC cells; this conclusion was further verified in animal models. The anti-cancer effects of the drug on the cell, protein, and RNA level were verified by cell functional experiments, WB blotting and transcriptome sequencing experiments, respectively. Finally, the experimental results were verified using subcutaneous tumor experiments in nude mice. The consequences exhibited that the levels of epithelial markers of ICC cells increased after brusatol treatment, and the levels of interstitial indicators decreased, suppressing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Brusatol inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed the migration and invasion abilities of Hucc-T1 and RBE oncocytes via activating PI3K/Akt pathway. It also suppressed the growth of Hucc-T1 xenografts in nude mice. Brusatol inhibits the proliferation and EMT process in ICC oncocytes by the PI3K/Akt pathway and promotes apoptosis in oncocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucea 3aRNA 3aapoptosis 3adrugs 3aepithelium 3aexperimental design 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3aprognosis 3atranscriptome 3axenotransplantation 0aBrusatol 0aPI3K/Akt pathway 0aIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 0aEMT 0aApoptosis 0aICC 0aEMT 0aCCA 0aHCC 0aFBS 0aPBS 0aBSA 0aWB 0aqRT-PCR 0aIHC1 aHe, Bangjie1 aZhao, Jungang1 aLi, Jiacheng1 aZhu, Yifeng1 aLi, Leilei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8161-25591 aBao, Wenming1 aZheng, Jiuyi1 aYu, Haitao1 aChen, Gang0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Sept., v. 104 p.154323-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1543233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100003200190245011000222300001400332506007600346520102400422592002801446506003701474650001501511650001701526650001001543650001101553650001801564650001301582650001201595700002001607700001801627700001901645773011101664856008401775852000901859655001201868IND60630113620221207075930.0190516e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063011362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.02.0012doi7 aPMC65201582pmcid7 a307356632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurguete, Alondra Schweizer14aThe regulation of cell size and branch complexity in the terminal cells of the Drosophila tracheal system  ap. 79-85.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe terminal cells of the larval Drosophila tracheal system extend dozens of branched cellular processes, most of which become hollow intracellular tubes that support gas exchange with internal tissues. Previously, we undertook a forward genetic mosaic screen to uncover the pathways regulating terminal cell size, morphogenesis, and the generation and maintenance of new intracellular tubes. Our initial work identified several mutations affecting terminal cell size and branch number, and suggested that branch complexity and cell size are typically coupled but could be genetically separated. To deepen our understanding of these processes, we have further characterized and determined the molecular identities of mutations in the genes sprout, denuded and asthmatic, that had been implicated in our initial screen. Here we reveal the molecular identity of these genes and describe their function in the context of the TOR and Hippo pathways, which are widely appreciated to be key regulators of cell and organ size.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3agas exchange 3agenes 3alarvae 3amorphogenesis 3amutation 3atissues1 aFrancis, Deanne1 aRosa, Jeffrey1 aGhabrial, Amin0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 July 01, v. 451, no. 1 p.79-85dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04554naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006800153245012000221520212500341592002802466650002102494650001602515650003302531650001502564650001602579650002402595650001702619650002202636650001302658651001102671653000802682653000802690653000802698653000802706653000902714653000902723653000802732653000702740653000702747653000902754653000902763653000902772653000902781653000902790653000902799653001002808653000902818653000902827653001002836653000902846653000902855653000902864653000702873653001002880653001002890653001002900653001002910653000902920653000902929653000902938653001002947653001102957653001002968653001002978653001002988653001002998653000703008653000803015653000703023653002403030653002303054653001703077653003303094653002003127700003603147700003603183700006403219700002403283700003003307700006003337773013403397856008803531852000903619655001203628IND60697776420221122072048.0220719e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069777642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1398952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoura-Bueno, Jean Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7240-372810aWhen does stratification of a subtropical soil spectral library improve predictions of soil organic carbon content?  aMore accurate models for the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) by visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy remains a challenging task, especially when the soil spectral libraries (SSL) is composed of soils with a high pedological variation. One proposition to increase the models accuracy is to reduce the SSL variance, which can be achieved by stratifying the library into sub-libraries. Thus, the main objective of this study was to evaluate whether the stratification of a SSL by environmental, pedological and Vis-NIR spectral criteria results in greater accuracy of spectroscopic models than to general models for prediction of SOC content. The performance of the models was evaluated considering the variance of soil components and sample number. In addition, we tested the effect of two spectral preprocessing techniques and two multivariate calibration methods on spectroscopic modeling. For these purposes, a SSL composed of 2471 samples from Southern Brazil was stratified based on i) physiographic region; ii) land-use/land-cover; iii) soil texture, and iv) spectral class. Two spectral processing techniques: Savitzky-Golay - 1st derivative (SGD) and continuum removed reflectance (CRR) and two multivariate methods (partial least squares regression - PLSR and Cubist) were used to fit the models. The best performances for the global and local models were achieved with the CRR spectral processing associated with the Cubist method. The stratification of the SSL in more homogeneous sample groups by environmental criteria (physiographic regions and land-use/land-cover) improved the accuracy of SOC predictions compared to pedological (soil texture) and Vis-NIR spectral (spectral classes) criteria. The reduction in the number of samples negatively affected the performance of models for sub-libraries with high pedological and spectral variation. Stratification criteria were proposed in a flowchart to assist in decision making in future studies. Our findings suggest the importance of sample balance across environmental, pedological and spectral strata, in order to optimize SOC predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological zones 3aenvironment 3aland use and land cover maps 3aprediction 3areflectance 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil texture 3asubtropical soils 3avariance 3aBrazil 0aSSL 0aSGD 0aCRR 0aRAW 0aPLSR 0aLULC 0aGSL 0aVS 0aSL 0aSLR1 0aSLR2 0aSLR3 0aSLTS 0aSLTM 0aSLTC 0aSLTVC 0aSLFA 0aSLFO 0aSLNPS 0aSLC1 0aSLC2 0aSLC3 0aGM 0aRM-R1 0aRM-R2 0aRM-R3 0aTM-VC 0aTM-C 0aTM-M 0aTM-S 0aLM-FA 0aLM-NPS 0aLM-FO 0aSM-C1 0aSM-C2 0aSM-C3 0aSD 0aVAR 0aCV 0aVis-NIR data mining 0aSpectral variation 0aSOC variance 0aEnvironmental-based learning 0aSpectral models1 aDalmolin, Ricardo Simão Diniz,1 aHorst-Heinen, Taciara Zborowski1 aten Caten, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4680-32741 aVasques, Gustavo M.1 aDotto, André Carnieletto1 aGrunwald, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9023-17200 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 737 p.139895-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1398953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010700165300001800272520174000290592002802030650006702058650001202125650001102137650002102148650002102169651001002190700002002200700002402220700001602244773012102260856004802381852000902429655001202438IND50087939820221117175934.0140412e20110710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008793982DNAL7 a10.1080/014311610037623972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPittiglio, C.12aA common dominant scale emerges from images of diverse satellite platforms using the wavelet transform  ap. 3665-3687.  aIn this article we investigate the scale dependence of spatial heterogeneity in multiresolution and multisensor data using the wavelet transform. The landscape analysed with the wavelets retains the same dominant pattern irrespective of the original pixel size of the image. In agricultural areas, typically characterized by a mosaic of cultivated fields, the wavelet transform quantified consistently a median dominant scale of 512 m in the Orthophoto, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ). The dominant scale represented the dominant field size of cultivated areas. The shape of the average wavelet energy curves was also similar among the images. In semi-natural areas the wavelet transform quantified consistently a median dominant scale of 128 m in the Orthophoto and ASTER. The median dominant scale of ETM + was slightly smaller and located at 64 m. We characterized the spatial heterogeneity of agricultural and semi-natural areas in Andalucía (Spain) using multisensor data not time coincident ranging from 1 m (Orthophoto), to 15 m (ASTER) to 28.5 m (ETM + ). The contrast in vegetation cover was measured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ASTER and ETM + and red band in Orthophoto. We performed a multiresolution analysis using a Haar two-dimension discrete wavelet transform to quantify and compare the intensity (maximum degree of contrast in vegetation cover), the dominant scale (the scale at which the maximum intensity occurs) and the wavelet energy curve (intensity plotted as a function of the scale) of different images at intervals of power of 2 within the scale range from 2 to 4096 m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aLandsat 3aenergy 3aorthophotography 3avegetation cover 3aSpain1 aSkidmore, A.

Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was used for analysis of sources of information while principle component analysis used to delineate the important beneficial factors of mobile app perceived by the farmers. In mobile use pattern, more number of farmers were using and spending time on use of Whats app and Facebook. Television was replaced by the mobile internet as top source of information after adoption of mobile app by the farmers. Economic and social benefits; improving input efficiency and output quality; and increase in social capital were the important dimensions of the benefits perceived by the farmers. Low internet speed and irregular network coverage were the important constraints faced by the farmers while using mobile app. Thus, with the use of ICT, there is change in the pattern of information sources use and information search by the farmers; such process of behavioural change may be considered while introduction of new technology to the farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abehavior change 3ainformation sources 3aprincipal component analysis 3asocial capital 3atelevision 3aIndia 0aInformation Communication Technology 0amobile app 0agrape cultivation 0aperception1 aKumar, Shiv1 aKingsly, IM1 aRoy, Mrinmoy0 pIndian J.

Moore, is the only approved medicine in China for silicosis. However, TET-induced hepatotoxicity has raised safety concerns. The underlying toxic targets and mechanism induced by TET remain unclear; there are no targeted detoxification strategies developed for TET-induced hepatotoxicity. Ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpene with liver protective effects, may have detoxification effects on TET-induced hepatotoxicity. This study aims to explore toxic targets and mechanism of TET and present UA as a potential targeted therapy for alleviating TET-induced hepatotoxicity. A TET-induced liver-injury model was established to evaluate TET toxicity and the potential UA detoxification effect. Alkenyl-modified TET and UA probes were designed to identify potential liver targets. Pharmacological and molecular biology methods were used to explore the underlying toxicity/detoxification mechanism. TET induced liver injury by covalently binding to the substrate-binding pocket (H-site) of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and inhibiting GST activity. The covalent binding led to toxic metabolite accumulation and caused redox imbalance and liver injury. UA protected the liver from TET-induced damage by competitively binding to the GST H-site. The mechanism of TET-induced hepatotoxicity is related to irreversible binding with the GST H-site and GST-activity inhibition. UA, a natural antidote, competed with TET on H-site binding and reversed the redox imbalance. This study revealed the hepatotoxic mechanism of TET and provided a targeted detoxifying agent, UA, to alleviate hepatotoxicity caused by GST inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStephania tetrandra 3aalkaloids 3aantidotes 3achemical bonding 3aglutathione transferase 3ahepatotoxicity 3aliver 3amedicine 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3atherapeutics 3aursolic acid 3aChina 0aTetrandrine 0aHepatotoxicity 0aGlutathione S-transferase 0aUrsolic Acid 0aALB 0aALT 0aAM-TET 0aAM-UA 0aAPAP 0aAST 0aBDP 0aBHMT 0aCHOL 0aDCNB 0aDILI 0aDTT 0aEA 0aGLU 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aGST 0aGSTM1 0aGSTP1 0aGSTP2 0aHDL-C 0aHE staining 0aLDL-C 0aPDIA6 0aROS 0aTBTA 0aTET 0aTG 0aTotal GSH 0aTP 0aUA 0aVc1 aLu, Yujie1 aLiu, Wenjuan1 aMa, Xiaoyao1 aPeng, Jiamin1 aWang, Xiaoying1 aJiang, Min1 aBai, Gang0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Sept., v. 104 p.154325-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1543253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009600165300001800261520111800279592002801397650001201425650001701437650000901454650001401463650001701477650001901494650000901513650001101522650002401533651001801557700001701575700002401592773013901616856004801755852000901803655001201812IND50087940120221117175949.0140412e20110710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008794012DNAL7 a10.1080/014311610037747232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkwen, Roland10aRemote sensing of temperature variations around major power plants as point sources of heat  ap. 3791-3805.  aVariations in land surface temperature (LST) around major point sources of heat were studied using the Tampa Bay region as a case study. LST in the Tampa Bay region, FL, USA, was retrieved from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 6 and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 6 high-gain thermal bands. The TM6 image data were obtained on 29 January (winter season) and 3 April 2007 (spring season). The ETM+6 data were obtained on 11 April 2007 (spring season). Spatial profiles of LST around four major fossil-fuelled power plants (FFPPs) were considered in this study. Temperatures were found to be highest at power plants and to decay to an average background temperature within 1.2–2.0 km from the FFPPs. The average background temperatures obtained in January and April were 17°C and 29°C, respectively. Results indicate that LST in close proximity to the FFPPs could be up to 10°C hotter than the surrounding areas. These findings suggest that FFPPs are significant heat sources and populations living within 1–2 km from an FFPP might be at significantly higher risk of heat-related illnesses and mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acase studies 3aheat 3amortality 3apower plants 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3aspring 3asurface temperature 3aUnited States1 aPu, Ruiliang1 aCunningham, Jeffrey0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2011 July 10, v. 32, no. 13 p.3791-3805dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x0143-11617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161003774723  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012400159300001600283500001900299520069200318592002801010650002101038650002201059650002101081650001501102650001301117650001901130650001301149700001501162700001801177700001601195773013101211856007401342852000901416655001201425IND60723576320221116152745.0210115e20210114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072357632DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc06148d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Guoliang14aThe construction of a single-crystalline SbSI nanorod array–WO₃ heterostructure photoanode for high PEC performance  ap. 335-338.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel kind of highly efficient photoanode was constructed with a SbSI/WO₃ heterostructurefabricated through two hydrothermal reactions followed by an iodination reaction (WO₃ → Sb₂S₃/WO₃ → SbSI/WO₃).

Herein, we develop a general route to prepare optically active particles by using poly/oligosaccharides as both chiral inducers and growth templates. By complexing with Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ ions, OH groups on C2 and C3 in poly/oligosaccharides can transfer the chirality to Cu(II) and retain it in CuO. At the same time, poly/oligosaccharides direct growth of CuO by in situ transformation of Cu(NH₃)₄²⁺ ions. Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and starch (ST) are used as representative polysaccharides, and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as a representative oligosaccharide, thus dandelion, duchesnea, and chrysanthemum-like composite particles with chiroptical activity are obtained. Besides, chiral CuO/poly(oligo)saccharide particles (CSP) demonstrate enantioselective ability by differentiating coordination with tryptophan (Trp) enantiomers and form Cu-Trp metal organic framework architectures with different morphologies. The study provides an easily accessible approach to prepare novel functional materials by poly/oligosaccharide-based chiral induction and hold great promise in chiral applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuchesnea 3aTaraxacum 3acellulose 3acoordination polymers 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3ananocrystals 3aoligosaccharides 3aoptical isomerism 3astarch 3atryptophan 0aCNC 0aST 0aβ-CD 0aTrp 0aMOF 0aTTP 0aPVA 0aCSP 0aChiral induction 0aChiral recognition 0aEnantio-differentiating coordination 0aOptically active particles 0aPoly/oligosaccharides1 aWang, Liangjie1 aLiu, Sheng1 aZhao, Biao1 aXiao, Ke1 aYang, Bo1 aDuan, Huabo1 aZhao, Huazhang1 aDeng, Jianping0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 296 p.119944-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1199443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012600154300001800280520172500298592002802023650002202051650001402073650001302087650001402100650002402114650002002138650001602158650001102174650001202185650002702197650002102224650002402245650003702269650001302306700001502319700001402334700001502348700001702363773012502380856007502505852000902580655001202589IND60778297320221119023301.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829732DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04374a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bin10aChitosan oligosaccharides exert neuroprotective effects via modulating the PI3K/Akt/Bcl-2 pathway in a Parkinsonian model  ap. 5838-5853.  aParkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, is a threat to patients due to the inability to prevent or decelerate disease progression. Currently, most clinical drugs for the treatment of PD are synthetic drugs that always present undesirable adverse or toxic effects. Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is a natural oligosaccharide that has been considered relatively safe and studied in the therapeutic effects on different types of neuronal disorders. In this study, we separated four COS monomers (COSs) including chitobiose (COS2), chitotriose (COS3), chitotetraose (COS4) and chitopentaose (COS5) to explore their structure–activity relationship in PD mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Techniques including TLC, HPLC, MS, and NMR were applied to investigate the purity and structure of the COSs. After the oral administration of COSs, behavior indexes, pathological indexes, cytokines, and expression of proteins in the nigrostriatal pathway of the mice were analyzed. The results showed that the four COSs were fully deacetylated and the purity was >90%. Additionally, the neurobehavioral deficits of the PD mice were improved by treatment with COSs. The results further proved that COSs could protect the TH-labelled dopaminergic neurons via reducing the overexpression of α-synuclein, alleviating neuroinflammation, and activating the PI3K/Akt/Bcl-2 pathway to reduce apoptosis. COS3 exhibited a better effect on protecting dopaminergic neurons; however, COS2 provided a better effect on reducing the overexpression of α-synuclein. To conclude, the neuroprotective activity makes COSs a viable candidate as an ingredient for healthcare products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aapoptosis 3achitosan 3acytokines 3adisease progression 3ahealth services 3aingredients 3amodels 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoligosaccharides 3aoral administration 3astructure-activity relationships 3atoxicity1 aWang, Ling1 aQu, Yufei1 aLu, Jingyu1 aXia, Wenshui0 tFood & function.g2022 May 23, v. 13, no. 10 p.5838-5853dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04374a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008400162300001800246520139500264592002801659650002301687650001701710650002501727650001901752650001401771650001101785650001201796650001501808650001901823650002201842650001701864650002701881650001301908700002001921700002501941773012501966856007502091852000902166655001202175IND60778297420221119023118.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829742DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04429j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosnowska, Dorota10aProanthocyanidins as the main pancreatic lipase inhibitors in chokeberry fruits  ap. 5616-5625.  aPancreatic lipase inhibitors are recognized as important in strategies for the management of overweight and obesity. The phytocompounds in chokeberry fruit show multidirectional pro-health effects, including anti-obesity activity. The aims of this study were to fractionate and identify the phenolic compounds of chokeberry fruit phenolic-rich extract that are active as pancreatic lipase inhibitors. Phenolic compounds were fractionated using Sephadex LH-20 resin, followed by polyphenol profile analysis using chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods, while pancreatic inhibitory activity was determined using 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate and emulsified triolein as enzyme substrates. Among the six fractions isolated from extract, two fractions rich in highly polymerized proanthocyanidins showed the greatest ability to inhibit pancreatic lipase activity. In comparison, fractions containing mainly low-molecular-weight phenolic compounds, such as phenolic acids, flavonols and anthocyanins, were 11–64 times less active. The most active fraction showed a mixed mode of pancreatic lipase inhibition, as determined by Lineweaver–Burk plot analysis, and exhibited a cumulative effect with orlistat. This study shows that black chokeberry polyphenols, particularly highly polymerized procyanidins, can effectively inhibit pancreatic lipase activity determined by in vitro methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAronia melanocarpa 3aanthocyanins 3aanti-obesity effects 3achromatography 3aflavonols 3afruits 3aobesity 3aoleic acid 3apolymerization 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprocyanidins 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriolein1 aPodsędek, Anna1 aKucharska, Alicja Z.0 tFood & function.g2022 May 23, v. 13, no. 10 p.5616-5625dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04429j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011100165300001400276520161500290592002801905650001301933650002501946650002501971650001501996650002902011650001802040650002602058650000902084650001402093650001202107650001402119650001702133650001302150700002102163700002102184773010802205856008102313852000902394655001202403IND60579090920221118043631.0170815e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057909092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-017-3239-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimpens, Juul10aPhylogenetic or environmental control on the elemental and organo-chemical composition of Sphagnum mosses?  ap. 69-85.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plant litter chemistry is a key driver of decomposition in peatlands. This study explored the relative contributions of phylogeny and environment to litter chemistry of peat mosses (Sphagnum), the key peat-forming plants on earth. METHODS: Fifteen Sphagnum species, representing three taxonomic sections ACUTIFOLIA, CUSPIDATA and SPHAGNUM, were sampled across a wide range of hydro-geochemical conditions. For all species we characterised chemical composition within (i) inorganic elements, (ii) carbohydrate polymers (iii) non-carbohydrates. RESULTS: The variation in carbohydrates was mostly explained by taxonomic section, suggesting phylogenetic conservation of carbohydrate composition. ACUTIFOLIA species invested relatively more in pectins, whereas CUSPIDATA and SPHAGNUM species invested more in hemicellulose. The composition of non-carbohydrates was mainly influenced by environment, except for some constituents for which the variation was more correlated to phylogeny. Finally, the variation in inorganic element concentrations mostly reflected hydro-geochemical conditions within and between peatlands. CONCLUSIONS: The separation into an environmentally independent, phylogenetically conserved group of compounds (structural carbohydrates) and an environmentally dependent, variable group of compounds (inorganic elements, non-carbohydrates) has important implications both for understanding patterns in and for upscaling of spatially variable ecosystem processes associated with peat decomposition such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3acarbon sequestration 3achemical composition 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahemicellulose 3amosses and liverworts 3apeat 3apeatlands 3apectins 3aphylogeny 3aplant litter 3apolymers1 aBohlin, Elisabet1 aNilsson, Mats B.0 tPlant and soil.g2017 Aug., v. 417, no. 1-2 p.69-85dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3239-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012100172300001600293520224600309592002802555650001502583650000802598650001202606650001302618650001002631650001502641650002202656650002502678650001702703650002102720650001002741650001602751700002202767700002602789700002002815700002202835773009802857856008502955852000903040655001203049IND60086058820221122065733.0141101e20111024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008605882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohlhause, Susan10aNocturnal hyperthermia induced by social stress in male tree shrews: Relation to low testosterone and effects of age  ap. 786-795.  aStress is known to elevate core body temperature (CBT). We recorded CBT in a diurnal animal, the male tree shrew, during a one-week control period and a one-week period of social stress using a telemetric system. During the stress period, when animals were confronted with a dominant male for about 1h daily, CBT was increased throughout the day. We analyzed CBT during the night when animals were left undisturbed and displayed no locomotor activity. To determine whether nocturnal hyperthermia may be related to stress-induced changes in hormonal status, we measured testosterone, noradrenalin and cortisol in the animals' morning urine. The daily social stress increased the mean nocturnal temperature by 0.37°C. Urinary testosterone was reduced during the stress period, and there was a significant negative correlation between testosterone and the area under the curve (AUC) of the nocturnal CBT. This means that stress-induced hyperthermia was strongest in the animals with the lowest testosterone concentrations. As expected, urinary noradrenalin was elevated during the stress week but a positive correlation with the AUC data was only found for animals younger than 12months. Cortisol was also increased during the stress week but there were no correlations with nocturnal hyperthermia. However, the stress-induced increases in noradrenalin and cortisol correlated with each other. Furthermore, there were no correlations between the stress-induced increase in nocturnal CBT and body weight reduction or locomotor activity during the light phase. Interestingly, the extent of nocturnal hyperthermia depended on the animals' ages: In animals younger than 12months, stress increased the AUC by 48%, in animals aged between 12 and 24months, stress increased the AUC by 36%, and older animals showed only a 7% increase. However, testosterone was not significantly reduced in the older animals. The present data reveal an interrelation between the extent of stress-induced nocturnal hyperthermia, the animals' gonadal hormone status and their ages. The negative correlation between hyperthermia and testosterone indicates that this hormone in particular plays an important role in the regulation of body temperature in male tree shrews.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScandentia 3aage 3aanimals 3acortisol 3afever 3alocomotion 3anight temperature 3apsychosocial factors 3atestosterone 3athermoregulation 3aurine 3aweight loss1 aHoffmann, Kerstin1 aSchlumbohm, Christina1 aFuchs, Eberhard1 aFlügge, Gabriele0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2011 Oct. 24, v. 104, no. 5 p.786-795dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008600172300001600258506002800274520196700302592002802269506003702297650001402334650001602348650001502364650001502379650001302394650002602407650001502433650001802448650002002466650001602486650001802502650001302520650002102533650001902554650001702573653001402590653001402604653000802618653002602626700002302652700002302675700002102698700002302719700001802742700001902760700002102779700002402800700002302824773016002847856008403007852000903091655001203100IND60767596320221207104717.0220121e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076759632DNAL7 a10.20961/stjssa.v18i2.566972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolesnikov, Sergey10aEcotoxicological assessment of Zn, Cu and Ni based NPs contamination in Arenosols  ap. 143-151.  aResource is Open Access  aNanoparticles are increasingly used in many industrial fields because of their special properties. In this context, several questions arise related to possible negative consequences associated with nanoparticle (NPs) entrance into the ecosystem. The adsorption of NPs by soil can adversely influence its biological properties. In the present article, the influence of Cu, Zn, and Ni NPs on the biological characteristics of Arenosol is considered. Research aimed to study the effect of Cu, Zn, Ni NPs on the biological characteristics of sandy loam chernozem. Copper, Zn, and Ni NPs were added to the soil in concentrations of 100, 1,000, and 10,000 mg kg-1. The effect of NPs on the biological properties of Arenosol was evaluated after 10-day incubation. The biological indices of the ecological condition of the soil, including the germination of radish, the length of the roots, the bacteria population, Azotobacter sp. count, the catalase activity, and dehydrogenases were studied. As a result of this study, it was revealed that the degree of indices changes depending on the concentration of Cu, Zn, and Ni NPs in the Arenosols. Microbiological characteristics (bacteria population, and Azotobacter sp. count) and phytotoxic feature (length of roots and radish germination) properties were most sensitive to contamination compared to the enzyme activity of Arenosol. Based on the soil integral index of a biological state, the strongest inhibitory effect on biological parameters of Arenosols relative to the control was exerted by Cu NPs (lower than control by 48-72%), while the greatest stability in Arenosol was found for Ni NPs (lower than control by 30-55%). The studied biological parameters allow characterizing the severity of nanoparticle exposure on Arenosols. Early diagnostics of the severity of soil contamination by NPs can be successfully used to quickly assess their impact on the soil condition and prevent possible adverse consequences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArenosols 3aAzotobacter 3aChernozems 3aadsorption 3acatalase 3adiagnostic techniques 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3aenzyme activity 3agermination 3aphytotoxicity 3aradishes 3asandy loam soils 3asoil pollution 3asoil quality 0apollution 0aarenosols 0anps 0abiological properties1 aTimoshenko, Аlena1 aMinnikova, Tatiana1 aMinkina, Tatiana1 aRajput, Vishnu D.,1 aKazeev, Kamil1 aFeizi, Morteza1 aFedorenko, Elena1 aMandzhieva, Saglara1 aSushkova, Svetlana0 tSains Tanah: Jurnal Penelitian Ilmu Tanah dan Agroklimatologi.g2021 Dec., v. 18, no. 2 p.143-151dSebelas Maret UniversitywJournal:27757x2356-14247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20961/stjssa.v18i2.566973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010200172300001600274520143500290592002801725650004401753650002201797650001601819650001301835650001701848650001001865650001701875650002101892650001201913650002301925650001501948650002101963650004401984650000702028650001302035650003302048650001202081650002102093650001402114653002802128653002002156653004502176653001902221653001202240653002502252700002002277700002202297700002002319773010802339856008602447852000902533655001202542IND60540889220221122054708.0190318e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054088922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.02.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunthip, Jatupol10aCationic β-cyclodextrin polymer applied to a dual cyclodextrin polyelectrolyte multilayer system  ap. 156-167.  aA polyelectrolyte multilayer film (PEM) based on cationic and anionic β-cyclodextrin polyelectrolytes was coated onto a textile substrate for future drug delivery purposes. We firstly synthesized a novel cationic β-cyclodextrin polymer (polyEPG-CD) by crosslinking β-cyclodextrin (βCD) with epichlorohydrin (EP) under basic conditions, in the presence of glycidyltrimetrylammonium chloride (GTMAC) as cationizing group. The influence of preparation conditions has been investigated in order to preferably obtain a water soluble fraction whose charge density and molecular weights were optimal for the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition process. The different cationic cyclodextrin polymers obtained were characterized by FTIR, NMR, colloidal titration, conductimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and size exclusion chromatography. Besides, the counterpart polyelectrolyte was a β-cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked with citric acid, polyCTR-CD, whose synthesis and characterization have been previously reported. Finally we realized the Layer by Layer (LbL) build-up of the PEM coating onto the textile support, using the dip coating method, by alternatively soaking it in cationic polyEPG-CD and anionic polyCTR-CD solutions. This multilayer self-assembly was monitored by SEM, gravimetry and OWLS in function of both polyelectrolytes concentrations and ratios. Solutions parameters such as pH, ionic strenght were also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acitric acid 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aepichlorohydrins 3afabrics 3agel chromatography 3agravimetry 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoaking 3athermogravimetry 3atitration 0aβ-Cyclodextrin-polymer 0aEpichlorohydrin 0aPolyelectrolytes multilayer system (PEM) 0aLayer-by-layer 0aTextile 0aDrug delivery system1 aTabary, Nicolas1 aLeclercq, Laurent1 aMartel, Bernard0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 126 p.156-167dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.02.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245010900186300001800295500001500313520107600328592002801404650001801432650001201450650002701462650002601489650002301515650002301538650003601561650003301597650001801630650005001648650004201698650002801740650002001768650001601788650003501804650002101839650001801860650001501878653003401893700002401927700002001951700001801971700003201989773008802021856008402109852000902193655001202202IND60088194320221117042022.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008819432DNAL7 a211932142pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRas, Monique10aExtracellular polymeric substances diversity of biofilms grown under contrasted environmental conditions  ap. 1529-1538.  a2019-12-06  aExtracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) analysis was undertaken on three biofilms grown under different feeding conditions and offering diverging microbial activities and structural characteristics. EPS were extracted by a multi-method protocol including sonication, Tween and EDTA treatments and were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Tween and sonication extracts presented higher EPS size diversity compared to EDTA extracts. EPS size diversity also increased with microbial functions within the biofilms and a specific 25–50 kDa cluster was identified only in extracts from biofilms presenting autotrophic activity. Another specific size cluster (180 kDa) occurred in Tween extracts provided from the mechanically stable biofilms. Such specific EPS appear as potential indicators for describing microbial and structural properties of biofilms. This study brings new elements for designing EPS fractionation and shows that size distribution analysis is an interesting tool to relate EPS diversity with macro-scale characteristics of biofilms.  aPublisher supplied data 3afractionation 3abiofilm 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aenvironmental factors 3agel chromatography 3amicrobial activity 2aBacteriaxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysis 2aBacteriolysis 2aBiofilmsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aBiopolymersxisolation & purification 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aDenitrification 2aEnvironment 2aExtracellular Spacexchemistry 2aMolecular Weight 2aNitrification 2aSolubility 0asize exclusion chromatography1 aLefebvre, Dominique1 aDerlon, Nicolas1 aPaul, Etienne1 aGirbal-Neuhauser, Elisabeth0 tWater research.g2011 Feb., v. 45, no. 4 p.1529-1538dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005400152245014900206520154200355592002801897650003001925650001101955650001901966650000901985650002201994650002002016650001802036650001102054650002402065653001802089653002502107653002102132653000902153653001602162653002902178700001702207700001902224700002002243700001502263700002502278773011702303856008702420852000902507655001202516IND60783762020221120031939.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078376202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1160362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yongyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4103-548310aDesign and optimization of a solid oxide fuel cell-inverted gas turbine integrated system with zero carbon emission for distributed cogeneration  aSolid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine (SOFC-GT) hybrid system is an efficient and potential method for distributed energy supply. The system layout, component operating parameters, system-level heat integration, component selection and design, etc., determine the system performance. To further improve the performance and achieve zero CO₂ emissions, a ambient-pressure solid oxide fuel cell-inverted gas turbine (SOFC-IGT) hybrid system with CO₂ capture using oxy-fuel combustor was proposed. With the aid of partial-load component model and a multi-objective optimization method established, the heat exchanger network and heat exchanger physical structure were designed and optimized. The results show that, pursuing a higher gross electrical efficiency leads to a decline in heat output. The electrical efficiency can be improved by increasing the external reforming ratio while ensuring self-sufficiency in heat. The heat integration is critical to enhance system performance, and optimizing heat exchanger network can make full use of the heat of stack exhaust and reduce the demand for external cold utility. The heat exchanger structural design has a trade-off between the total heat-transfer coefficient and the pressure drop. The net electrical efficiency of the three special solutions can reach 53.9 %, 65.7 %, and 65.8 %, respectively. The design of the maximum heat point (MHP) scheme can be considered when pursuing lower cost, and the design of the maximum power point (MPP) scheme can be employed for higher performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acold 3aenergy conversion 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3asystem optimization 0aHybrid system 0aInverted gas turbine 0aHeat integration 0aSOFC 0aCO2 capture 0aDistributed cogeneration1 aWang, Ligang1 aSharma, Shivom1 aZhang, Guoqiang1 aZhang, Lei1 aMaréchal, François0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 268 p.116036-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1160363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008600163500001400249520141000263592002801673650001801701650002101719650002401740650000901764650002001773650001001793650001501803650002101818650002601839650002301865700002701888700003001915700002001945700002301965773012301988856008102111852000902192655001202201IND60724554220221120152819.0210122e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072455422DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100100022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeff, Erik 10aDrug Resistance in Filarial Parasites Does Not Affect Mosquito Vectorial Capacity  aNAL-light  aParasite drug resistance presents a major obstacle to controlling and eliminating vector-borne diseases affecting humans and animals. While vector-borne disease dynamics are affected by factors related to parasite, vertebrate host and vector, research on drug resistance in filarial parasites has primarily focused on the parasite and vertebrate host, rather than the mosquito. However, we expect that the physiological costs associated with drug resistance would reduce the fitness of drug-resistant vs. drug-susceptible parasites in the mosquito wherein parasites are not exposed to drugs. Here we test this hypothesis using four isolates of the dog heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis)—two drug susceptible and two drug resistant—and two vectors—the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and the Asian tiger mosquito (Ae. albopictus)—as our model system. Our data indicated that while vector species had a significant effect on vectorial capacity, there was no significant difference in the vectorial capacity of mosquitoes infected with drug-resistant vs. drug-susceptible parasites. Consequently, contrary to expectations, our data indicate that drug resistance in D. immitis does not appear to reduce the transmission efficiency of these parasites, and thus the spread of drug-resistant parasites in the vertebrate population is unlikely to be mitigated by reduced fitness in the mosquito vector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes albopictus 3aDirofilaria immitis 3adogs 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3aheartworms 3amosquito vectors 3avector-borne diseases 3avectorial capacity1 aEvans, Christopher C.,1 aJimenez Castro, Pablo  D.1 aKaplan, Ray  M.1 aDharmarajan, Guha 0 tPathogens.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100100023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245009400159300001400253506002800267520059300295592002800888506003700916650002300953650001700976650001200993650002701005650002901032650002101061650001101082650001801093650001801111650001101129650002001140650002701160650001301187650002301200650001701223650002101240653002301261653001501284653001701299700003401316700002601350773018301376856008001559852000901639655001201648IND60767596720221207104715.0200526e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076759672DNAL7 a10.14710/jksa.6.2.19-212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmiyarto10aIdentifikasi Asam Lemak Penyusun Minyak Biji Karet (Hevea Brasiliensis) Menggunakan GC-MS  ap. 19-21.  aResource is Open Access  aIsolation of rubber seed (Hevea brasiliensis) oil have carried out by using soxhlet extraction with n-hexane as solvent.

Their quality and existence depends on the flooding regime of the river. In the Bzura River valley (Vistula tributary, Poland) these forests have been subject to human impact by deforestation and melioration. Since 1823, the Bzura River bed has been deepened and straightened, and approximately over 250km of small drainage ditches have been dug in the river valley. Consequentially, the river water level has significantly decreased. The aim of the study was to identify patterns in the response of vegetation to the overall pressure of climate change and anthropogenic modifications of the river valley. A total of 50 samples of riparian forest vegetation from the 1960s and 2011 were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Indicator plant species for the TWINSPAN groups were identified with an indicator value (IndVal) index. Changes were found to have occurred in the vegetation of the alder carr forest Ribeso nigri-Alnetum. An increase in therophyte coverage and the appearance of invasive species (Bidens frondosa, Conyza canadensis, Echinocystis lobata and Oxalis fontana) were recorded. In addition, a substitute community of alder with clear traces of desiccation (Poo trivialis-Alnetum) has been reinforced. Of the ecological indicators (Ellenberg’s values) for light, nitrogen and moisture requirements, the last significantly decreased between 1960s and 2011. The progressive drying of the Ribeso nigri-Alnetum community is expected to facilitate further changes in the riparian forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBidens 3aConyza canadensis 3aOxalis 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3adeforestation 3adrainage channels 3adrying 3afloodplains 3aforest ecosystems 3aindicator species 3ainvasive species 3anitrogen 3ariparian forests 3ariver water 3arivers 3astream channels 3avalleys 3aPoland 0aVegetation changes 0aAlder carr 0aClimate change 0aInvasive species 0aIndVal index1 aRatajczyk, Natalia1 aWolańska-Kamińska, Agnieszka1 aWalisch, Marek1 aKruk, Andrzej1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1452-79060 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 314 p.120-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013100209300001800340520053900358592002800897650002300925650002300948650001000971650004400981650002201025650001301047653002901060653003601089653002901125653001501154700001901169700002301188773008901211856008401300852000901384655001201393IND60529282320221119050625.0161019e20160316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052928232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Joana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9996-146310aSynthesis and structural characterization by LC–MS and NMR of a new semi-natural blue amino-based pyranoanthocyanin compound  ap. 1277-1281.  aThe synthesis and structural characterization by LC–MS and NMR of a new blue amino-based pyranoanthocyanin-derived pigment is presented from the reaction of A-type vitisin and 4-(dimethylamino)-cinnamic acid.

The global trend in industrialization of agriculture bears in itself a set of risks. One of them is a reduction of a national genetic resource or gene pools of animals. Today, new methods of auxiliary reproductive technology permit using them for preserving not only the reproductive potential of the person, but also the biodiversity of wild and endangered species of farm animals. The art of cryobiology involves the addition of one or more cryoprotectants and change of time and temperature of exposition with tissue, and cooling speed. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to identify an optimum method of cryopreserving ovarian tissue of sheep using various cryoprotectants. Ovarian tissue from 8 indigenous Chuyi breed was transported to the laboratory at 36°C, divided into smaller pieces (5×3×1.0mm) in the holding medium (Dulbecco’s PBS + 10% FCS), and randomly distributed into 8 groups. The pieces were equilibrated sequentially in freezing medium containing 0.25, 0.75 (5 min each), and 0.5M sucrose with 1.5M cryoprotectants (10min) and placed in a cryo straw. The ovarian tissue was frozen in vapors of liquid nitrogen at a distance of 4 or 6cm from the surface within 20min with use of various cryoprotectants: 1.5M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1.5M propylene glycol (PROH), 1.5M ethylene glycol (EG), and 1.5M glycerol (GL). After that, straws were plunged in liquid nitrogen. For thawing, straws were warmed in air at room temperature for 30s and then immersed in a water bath at 37°C for 40s. Then, ovarian pieces were transferred into the solution 0.75M sucrose + 10% FCS + Dulbecco’s PBS (10min, 37°C), then 0.3M sucrose + Dulbecco’s PBS + 10% FCS (15min, twice), and the holding medium (15min). After thawing, the effects of cooling methods with different cryoprotectants on ovarian tissue morphology were evaluated by light microscopy after hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue sections. The number of viable and damaged preantral follicles was counted. Data obtained in the experiments were analysed using Student’s t-test. Data are given as mean values±standard errors. The level of significance was set at P<0.05. In groups that were frozen at 6cm using 1.5M DMSO, 54.6±4.8% of follicles were morphologically normal. In groups that were frozen at 4cm using 1.5M GL and 1.5M DMSO, 69±3.0% and 58.4±3.7% of follicles, respectively, were morphologically normal. Using 1.5M PROH and 1.5M EG did not yield good results. Differences were statistically significant compared with fresh control (99±2.4%). The analysis of comparative histology showed that use of 1.5M DMSO for freezing at distance of 6cm or 1.5M GL at 4cm were more effective in terms of viability of ovarian follicles compared with other cryoprotectants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3abiodiversity 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aendangered species 3aethylene glycol 3afreezing 3agene pool 3agenetic resources 3aglycerol 3ahistology 3alight microscopy 3aliquids 3anitrogen 3aovarian follicles 3apropylene glycol 3arisk 3asheep 3astaining 3asucrose 3athawing 3avapors 3aviability1 aYerzhan, T.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2018, v. 30, no. 1 p.165-166dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RDv30n1Ab523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03756naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100005700180245019800237300001600435500002000451506007600471520196800547592002802515506003702543650002702580650002002607650001102627650001602638650001202654650001902666650001602685650001802701650001802719650001702737650001702754650001002771650001602781700001902797700001702816700001702833700002302850700002402873700002002897700001702917700001502934700005202949773013103001856007303132852000903205655001203214IND60602916120221207124235.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291612DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.130172doi7 aPMC71659652pmcid7 a298899812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlázquez, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8115-322510aCombined effects of spray‐drying conditions and postdrying storage time and temperature on Salmonella choleraesuis and Salmonella typhimurium survival when inoculated in liquid porcine plasma  ap. 205-211.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the spray‐drying process on the inactivation of Salmonella choleraesuis and Salmonella typhimurium spiked in liquid porcine plasma and to test the additive effect of immediate postdrying storage. Commercial spray‐dried porcine plasma was sterilized by irradiation and then reconstituted (1:9) with sterile water. Aliquots of reconstituted plasma were inoculated with either S. choleraesuis or S. typhimurium, subjected to spray‐drying at an inlet temperature of 200°C and an outlet temperature of either 71 or 80°C, and each spray‐drying temperature combinations were subjected to either 0, 30 or 60 s of residence time (RT) as a simulation of residence time typical of commercial dryers. Spray‐dried samples were stored at either 4·0 ± 3·0°C or 23·0 ± 0·3°C for 15 days. Bacterial counts of each Salmonella spp., were completed for all samples. For both Salmonella spp., spray‐drying at both outlet temperatures reduced bacterial counts about 3 logs at RT 0 s, while there was about a 5·5 log reduction at RT 60 s. Storage of all dried samples at either 4·0 ± 3·0°C or 23·0 ± 0·3°C for 15 days eliminate all detectable bacterial counts of both Salmonella spp. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Safety of raw materials from animal origin like spray‐dried porcine plasma (SDPP) may be a concern for the swine industry. Spray‐drying process and postdrying storage are good inactivation steps to reduce the bacterial load of Salmonella choleraesuis and Salmonella typhimurium. For both Salmonella spp., spray‐drying at 71°C or 80°C outlet temperatures reduced bacterial counts about 3 log at residence time (RT) 0 s, while there was about a 5.5 log reduction at RT 60 s. Storage of all dried samples at either 4.0 ± 3.0°C or 23.0 ± 0.3°C for 15 days was effective for eliminating detectable bacterial counts of both Salmonella spp.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aadditive effect 3adryers 3airradiation 3aliquids 3amicrobial load 3aplate count 3apork industry 3araw materials 3aspray drying 3astorage time 3aswine 3atemperature1 aRodríguez, C.1 aRódenas, J.1 aSaborido, N.1 aSolà‐Ginés, M.1 aPérez de Rozas, A.1 aCampbell, J.

Although the protein content is high, the cake contains phorbol esters and antinutritional factors such as phytates, trypsin inhibitors, lectins and tannins. Therefore, it cannot be directly used in food or feed. In this study, the toxic compounds and antinutrients present in J. curcas seed cake were detoxified by fermentation with Enterobacter Z11, a soil‐borne isolate. Solid‐state fermentation was undertaken under optimized conditions: deoiled cake, 5·0 g; initial moisture content, 50%; temperature, 30°C; and inoculum, 2 × 10⁶ cells per gram of cake. Postfermentation, bacterial growth, pH and the amount of antinutrients were studied. Fermentation reduced the content of phorbol esters, phytates, lectins, tannins and trypsin inhibitors by 51·6, 82·6, 88·9, 37·8 and 90·5%, respectively. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The strain of Enterobacter cloacae Z11 was originally isolated from the soil. To the best of our knowledge, E. cloacae has never been used to remove toxins and antinutritional factors in Jatropha curcas seed cake (JSC). Under the optimized condition, fermentation with the Enterobacter strain decreased the phorbol esters content in JSC by 51·6%, and phytates, tannins, lectins and trypsin inhibitors contents by 83, 38, 89 and 90%, respectively. This study provided a new method with potential to render the seed cake suitable for use in feed. Further study is needed to focus on remaining toxicity and nutritional value post‐treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aJatropha curcas 3aantinutritional factors 3abyproducts 3aesters 3ainoculum 3alectins 3amethodology 3amicrobial growth 3anutritive value 3aoils 3aoilseed cakes 3apH 3aprotein content 3aseeds 3asoil 3asolid state fermentation 3atannins 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3atrypsin inhibitors 3awater content1 aWang, H.F.1 aLiu, J.X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5812-51860 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 Aug., v. 67, no. 2 p.197-204dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.130123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013600209300001800345520063100363592002800994650001101022650002301033650002301056650001501079650001501094653001401109653001801123653001901141653002101160653002201181700001701203700002301220700002301243773008901266856008401355852000901439655001201448IND60529282620221119050731.0161019e20160323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052928262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAswad, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7420-240110aEvaluation of dipole moment and electrophilicity on the nature of click-type coupling reaction between thioamide and sulfonyl azide  ap. 1313-1316.  aA cooperated experimental and computational investigation on sulfonyl amidine formation from thioamides and sulfonyl azides is described.

J.10a59 Selected Reaction Monitoring-Based Absolute Quantification of Developmentally Relevant Proteins in Early Bovine Embryos Reveals Differences Between In Vitro and In Vivo Embryo Culture and Between Different Maternal Metabolic Stages  ap. 168-169.  aEarly embryogenesis is a highly complex developmental process, accompanied by a plethora of changes at the morphological and molecular level. Particularly at the level of proteins, these changes are still poorly characterised and understood. During the first cleavages, the embryo depends mainly on maternal transcripts and proteins that were accumulated and stored during oogenesis until embryonic genome activation (EGA) occurs. In the bovine system, the major EGA takes place at the 8- to 16-cell stage. However, we recently demonstrated by liquid chormatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based holistic proteome approaches that despite transcriptional and translational silencing, the proteome of the early embryo is highly dynamic (Deutsch et al. 2014; Demant et al. 2015). Based on these findings, we established a targeted LC-MS/MS approach based on multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (mSRM), which facilitates an absolute quantification of 27 proteins relevant in early embryogenesis. Each protein is targeted by 2 independent peptides to facilitate highly reliable quantifications. Nine characteristic developmental stages from germinal vesicle oocyte to hatched blastocyst were analysed (n=6 per stage), and absolute protein contents are reported as femtomole per embryo, with limits of quantification (LOQ) down to 100 attomoles per embryo. Based on their abundance profiles during maturation, zygote formation, and embryonic development, the 27 proteins could be grouped into 6 SOTA clusters. By principal component analysis (PCA), absolute SRM quantifications of only 9 selected proteins were shown to discriminate between all 9 developmental stages analysed, thus providing molecular fingerprints significant for each developmental stage. We used the 27-plex SRM assay as a powerful readout tool and demonstrated substantial quantitative differences between embryos derived from a well-established in vitro culture system and embryos transferred into the oviduct of living animals for 2 days (in vivo culture). Furthermore, in vivo development of embryos in animals differing in their metabolic stress levels led to significant alterations in the 27-plex SRM profiles.

Nevertheless, the industrial production of isomaltulose from sucrose is currently expensive, thus limiting its application. Molasses is an industrial by-product of sugar refining and contains abundant sucrose, which suggests it could be a cost-effective feedstock for manufacturing isomaltulose. Although isomaltulose can be obtained successfully from molasses, the yield and purity reported in previous studies are insufficient for industrial-scale application. To overcome previous disadvantages, a new strategy was devised in this study considering the molasses composition features, where the sucrose component is used for isomaltulose biosynthesis, while the monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) are used as the energy source for strain growth. Further elements of this strategy involved a series of metabolic engineering steps to construct a recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum strain IS7 with redirected metabolic flux and fine-tuned sucrose isomerase (SIase) activity. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum production of isomaltulose using the engineered strain IS7 was 170.1 g L⁻¹ with a yield of 0.97 g/g with cane molasses as substrate, and 167.0 g L⁻¹ with a yield of 0.97 g/g with beet molasses as substrate, after 72 h fermentation. Moreover, isomaltulose purity was 98% using either cane or beet molasses as substrate. Therefore, this study may provide a robust foundation for efficient industrial-scale bioproduction of high-purity isomaltulose from low-cost cane and beet molasses using the recombinant strain IS7. Moreover, it validates the concept of the sustainable conversion of agricultural residues by biosynthesis to high-value-added products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3abeets 3abiosynthesis 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3afructose 3aglucose 3agreen chemistry 3aindustrial byproducts 3aindustrial wastes 3aisomaltulose 3aisomerases 3amolasses 3asucrose1 aYang, Zhan-Dong1 aHuang, Jun-Sheng1 aGao, Jun-Yong1 aChen, Xiu-Ping1 aCheng, Hao1 aZhang, Ping-Jun1 aSu, Hui-Hui0 tGreen chemistry.g2022 May 23, v. 24, no. 10 p.4050-4060dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc04790f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245014300165520125700308592002801565650003001593650001901623650002201642650000901664650002001673650001801693650001701711650001901728650001601747653004901763653002201812653001801834653002301852653004601875653002401921700001301945700001701958773011701975856008702092852000902179655001202188IND60783762620221120233047.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078376262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1160432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Bo10aDesign and performance evaluation of an energy storage system using CO2-based binary mixtures for thermal power plant under dry conditions  aSuper-critical compressed CO₂ energy storage system (S-CCES) is a prospective approach to alleviate the imbalance between supply and demand on the grid, however, it is less attractive for application under dry conditions due to cooling problems. In this paper, a S-CCES for thermal power plants is proposed, and its inefficiency and uneconomical effects under dry conditions are overcome by CO₂-based binary mixtures. Firstly, five CO₂-based mixtures are selected; then, parametric analysis is performed to compare and evaluate pure CO₂ and CO₂-based binary mixture systems; finally, detailed thermodynamic and exergoeconomic data are presented. The results indicate that the round-trip efficiency decreases by 7.85% and the unit electrical cost increases by 7.85 $/GJ when the cycle minimum temperature increases from 305.13 K to 323.15 K for the pure CO₂ system. An appropriate molar fraction of added gas can reduce the sensitivity of CO₂-based binary mixture systems regarding cooling temperature, and the CO₂-Propane system achieves about 10% improvement in round-trip efficiency. The high-temperature heat storage heat exchanger should be considered foremost to further improve the economy and efficiency of the proposed system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3amole fraction 3apower plants 3asupply balance 3atemperature 0aSuper-critical compressed CO2 energy storage 0aCO2-based mixture 0aDry condition 0aFlexible operation 0aThermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses 0aParametric analysis1 aSun, Lei1 aXie, Yonghui0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 268 p.116043-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1160433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011500172300001400287520174000301592002802041650004402069650003702113650002402150650001102174650001602185650001402201650002502215650002102240650001302261650001002274650002002284650001202304650002102316650001702337650001702354650001802371650001102389650001102400650001302411650002102424650001902445653002702464653001302491653001602504653003002520653003002550653002302580653002702603700002702630700002202657773010602679856008602785852000902871655001202880IND60540889920221122054528.0190318e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054088992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZoppe, Justin O.10aManipulation of cellulose nanocrystal surface sulfate groups toward biomimetic nanostructures in aqueous media  ap. 23-31.  aWe report a facile aqueous procedure to create multivalent displays of sulfonated ligands on CNCs for future applications as viral inhibitors. CNCs were decorated with model compounds containing sulfonate groups via reactions of epoxides and isothiocyanates with amines under alkaline conditions. At first, surface sulfate groups of CNCs were hydrolytically cleaved by alkaline hydrolysis to increase the number of available surface hydroxyls. Success of desulfation was confirmed via dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). CNC surface hydroxyl groups were then activated with epichlorohydrin before subsequent reactions. As proof of concept toward aqueous pathways for functionalizing nanoparticles with sulfonated ligands, 3-chloro-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt hydrate (CPSA) and 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate sodium salt monohydrate (4-SPITC) were chosen as model compounds to react with homobifunctional 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) (EBEA) molecular spacer. The approaches presented are not only applicable to polysaccharide nanocrystals, but also other classes of polymeric and inorganic substrates presenting surface hydroxyl groups, as in the case of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), silica or glass. CNCs carrying sulfonated ligands were characterized by ATR-FTIR and UV–vis spectroscopy. Surface chemical compositions of desired elements were determined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We anticipate that with these facile aqueous procedures as the proof of concept, a diverse library of target-specific functionalities can be conjugated to CNCs for applications in nanomedicine, especially related to viral inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3aamines 3abiomimetics 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3aepichlorohydrins 3aepoxides 3aglass 3aisothiocyanates 3aligands 3alight scattering 3ananocrystals 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3asilica 3asodium 3asulfates 3athermogravimetry 3azeta potential 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aWhiskers 0aDesulfation 0aTyrosine sulfate mimetics 0aMultivalent nanoparticles 0aSulfonated ligands 0aPolyanionic inhibitors1 aJohansson, Leena-Sisko1 aSeppälä, Jukka,0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 126 p.23-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015300167300001400320520138900334592002801723650002001751650002001771650002701791650001501818650001701833650001701850650002401867650001201891650001601903650001101919650001101930650001601941650002701957650001601984653000802000653001102008653000802019653000902027653001202036653000802048653001002056653001102066653000802077653000802085653001102093653000702104653000802111653000802119653001102127653001702138653003002155653001602185700001702201700001502218700002002233700002202253700002302275700005702298773011902355856008502474852000902559655001202568IND60525180320221117064619.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052518032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2016.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jonggun10a4,4′-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and 4,4′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) promote adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell culture  ap. 40-45.  a4,4′-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide, was extensively used in the 1940s and 1950s. DDT is mainly metabolically converted into 4,4′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). Even though most countries banned DDT in the 1970s, due to the highly lipophilic nature and very stable characteristics, DDT and its metabolites are present ubiquitously in the environment, including food. Recently, there are publications on relationships between exposure to insecticides, including DDT and DDE, and weight gain and altered glucose homeostasis. However, there are limited reports regarding DDT or DDE and adipogenesis, thus we investigated effects of DDT and DDE on adipogenesis using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment of DDT or DDE resulted in increased lipid accumulation accompanied by increased expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipose triglyceride lipase, and leptin. Moreover, treatment of DDT or DDE increased protein levels of C/EBPα, PPARγ, AMP-activated protein kinase-α (AMPKα), and ACC, while significant decrease of phosphorylated forms of AMPKα and ACC were observed. These finding suggest that increased lipid accumulation caused by DDT and DDE may mediate AMPKα pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3acell culture 3afatty-acid synthase 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3aleptin 3alipids 3ametabolites 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aweight gain 0aAKT 0aAMPKα 0aACC 0aATGL 0aC/EBPα 0aFAS 0aGAPDH 0aGLUT 4 0aHSL 0aLPL 0aPPARγ 0aTG 0aDDT 0aDDE 0a3T3-L1 0aAdipogenesis 0aAdipocyte differentiation 0aLipogenesis1 aSun, Quancai1 aYue, Yiren1 aYoon, Kyong Sup1 aWhang, Kwang-Youn1 aMarshall Clark, J.1 aPark, Yeonhwa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9727-08990 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2016 July, v. 131 p.40-45dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2016.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008000167300001400247520104100261592002801302650001801330650000901348650001501357650001801372650001401390650001301404650002001417650001201437650001201449650000901461651001701470653002501487653002301512653002701535653001701562653002401579653002401603653004201627653002001669653003101689653002401720653003701744653001901781700001901800700001901819700001901838700001901857700001801876700001801894773011601912856008202028852000902110655001202119IND60516008220221120175418.0190805e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051600822DNAL7 a10.1017/S20786336150002472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Atiyat, R.M.10aCurrent situation and diversity of indigenous cattle breeds of Saudi Arabia  ap. 39-49.  aThis study aims to evaluate the current situation and diversity of indigenous cattle breeds in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). A survey was executed in five regions of the KSA. We recorded population sizes, phenotypes and rearing conditions. Taurine Bos taurus and zebu Bos indicus populations were found. The zebu cattle include two breeds; the Hassawi and the Janobi. The Hassawi breed was found in the eastern region and it is in decreasing number. It may become extinct soon in the absence of conservation plan. Janobi remains common with thousand animals in the south-western part of the country. Only one indigenous taurine cow, showing no phenotypic evidence of zebu introgression, was found in the Central region of KSA (Najd Plateau). This cow might be the last pure indigenous Saudi Arabia taurine animal and therefore, the breed is now close to extinction. We advocate the urgency to design conservation plan for the indigenous livestock of the KSA and to complement these with phenotypic as well as genotypic information.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle breeds 3acows 3aextinction 3aintrogression 3aphenotype 3aplateaus 3apopulation size 3arearing 3asurveys 3azebu 3aSaudi Arabia 0aTaurine (Bos taurus) 0aZebu (Bos indicus) 0alivestock conservation 0aSaudi Arabia 0abovins (Bos taurus) 0azébu (Bos indicus) 0aconservation des animaux d’élevage 0aArabie Saoudite 0aganado vacuno (Bos taurus) 0acebú (Bos indicus) 0aconservación de razas ganaderas 0aArabia Saudita1 aAljumaah, R.S.1 aAbudabos, A.M.1 aAlghamdi, A.A.1 aAlharthi, A.S.1 aAlJooan, H.S.1 aAlotybi, M.N.0 tAnimal genetic resources.g2015 Dec., v. 57 p.39-49dCambridge University PresswJournal:23118x2078-63447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S20786336150002473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245012500168300001400293520069500307592002801002650001801030650001401048650001201062650001201074650001201086650001001098651001101108653002401119653001801143653002401161773012001185856007701305852000901382655001201391IND60594398420221118012350.0180625s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059439842DNAL7 a10.2982/028.106.02012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStruhsaker, Thomas T.10aTwo Red-Capped Robin-Chats Cossypha Natalensis Imitate Antiphonal Duet of Black-Faced Rufous Warblers Bathmocercus rufus  ap. 53-56.  aDuring my studies of primate behavioral ecology in the Kibale Forest, Uganda, I documented the first cases of red-capped robin-chats Cossypha natalensis imitating an antiphonal duet.

In a second case one robin chat gave the male components and another gave that of the female warbler. The lack of temporal separation between the male and female components of the warbler's antiphonal duet indicates an unusually high level of auditory perception and response time and cognitive ability on the part of redcapped robin-chats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3acognition 3aecology 3afemales 3aforests 3amales 3aUganda 0aauditory perception 0aresponse time 0acognitive abilities0 tJournal of East African natural history.g2017, v. 106, no. 2 p.53-56dNature KenyawJournal:19739x1026-16137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2982/028.106.02013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011900167506002800286520135200314592002801666506003701694650001301731650002201744650001501766650001701781650001601798650001501814651001201829651001201841653001301853653003601866653002501902653002101927653002301948653003601971700002302007700002302030773011002053856008202163852000902245655001202254IND60767598920221207140726.0220120e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076759892DNAL7 a10.15393/j4.art.2021.78252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElena, Rubtsova10aFirst Post-war Years of L.

Botanical Secrets of Mezhigorie near Kiev  aResource is Open Access  aThe beginning of a new stage in the life and work of the outstanding landscape architect, Doctor of Biological Sciences, Professor Leonid Ivanovich Rubtsov is analyzed. An experienced landscape architect L. I. Rubtsov was invited from Leningrad to Kiev to participate in the construction of an academic botanical garden (now the N. N. Grishko National Botanical Garden of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine) in 1946. He began his work in Kiev as the head of the department of floriculture and greenhouse crops, and also studied the Trostyanets arboretum in the Chernihiv region. In 1946 L. I. Rubtsov took part in an expedition to Germany to acquire plants for the construction of a botanical garden. In 1946-1947 L. I. Rubtsov also performed a responsible task -&nbsp; landscaping the dacha of N. S. Khrushchev in Mezhigorie near Kiev. A modern study of the territory of the former government dachas of Mezhigorie made it possible to assume that a certain number of plants brought to the botanical garden in 1946 from Germany were planted as well at the dacha of N. S. Khrushchev under the project and guidance of Leonid Ivanovich Rubtsov. The plantations preserved on the site of the former government dachas have a significant scientific value as a dendrological collection and as an example of the landscape composition of the late 1940s.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarboreta 3abotanical gardens 3adendrology 3afloriculture 3agreenhouses 3alandscapes 3aGermany 3aUkraine 0aкиев 0aботанический сад 0aл. и. рубцов 0aгермания 0aмежигорье 0aдача н. с. хрущева1 aNatalia, Chuvikina1 aSvetlana, Klimenko0 tHortus botanicus.g2021 Dec., v. 16, no. 1dPetrozavodsk State UniversitywJournal:27791x1994-38497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15393/j4.art.2021.78253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014000172300001400312520098300326592002801309650001301337650002401350650002201374650001301396650001501409650002201424650001201446650002101458653004101479653000901520653002401529653001701553653002601570700001901596700002201615700002001637700002201657773010601679856008601785852000901871655001201880IND60540890020221123004931.0190318e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054089002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakalahti, Minna10aEffect of interfibrillar PVA bridging on water stability and mechanical properties of TEMPO/NaClO2 oxidized cellulosic nanofibril films  ap. 78-82.  aTEMPO/NaClO2 oxidized cellulosic nanofibrils (TCNF) were covalently bonded with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to render water stable films. Pure TCNF films and TCNF–PVA films in dry state showed similar humidity dependent behavior in the elastic region. However, in wet films PVA had a significant effect on stability and mechanical characteristics of the films. When soaked in water, pure TCNF films exhibited strong swelling behavior and poor wet strength, whereas covalently bridged TCNF–PVA composite films remained intact and could easily be handled even after 24h of soaking. Wet tensile strength of the films was considerably enhanced with only 10wt% PVA addition. At 25% PVA concentration wet tensile strengths were decreased and films were more yielding. This behavior is attributed to the ability of PVA to reinforce and plasticize TCNF-based films. The developed approach is a simple and straightforward method to produce TCNF films that are stable in wet conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acomposite materials 3afilms (materials) 3ahumidity 3ananofibers 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asoaking 3atensile strength 0aTEMPO oxidized cellulose nanofibrils 0aFilm 0aPoly(vinyl alcohol) 0aWater stable 0aMechanical properties1 aSalminen, Arto1 aSeppälä, Jukka,1 aTammelin, Tekla1 aHänninen, Tuomas0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 126 p.78-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017500156300001600331500002000347520176800367592002802135650002502163650003002188650002502218650002202243650001402265650001302279650001802292650001002310650002202320650001002342650001202352650001702364650001402381650001302395650002202408650001302430650001502443650001902458650001402477650001202491700005602503700001402559773013102573856007302704852000902777655001202786IND60602916720221120135923.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291672DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.130042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, X.‐Y.10aiTRAQ‐based quantitative proteomic analysis of differentially expressed proteins in Litopenaeus vannamei in response to infection with WSSV strains varying in virulence  ap. 113-122.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) were applied to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in Litopenaeus vannamei in response to different virulence white spot syndrome virus infection. A total of 2780 unique peptides corresponding to 754 proteins were identified. The number of significant differentially expressed proteins was 161, including 38 up‐regulated ones and 123 down‐regulated ones in low‐virulence infection library compared with normal‐virulence infection library. Gene Ontology function annotation indicated that the differentially expressed proteins mainly participated in the biological process. Subcellular location classification showed that the largest distribution of differentially expressed proteins was found in the cytoplasm in both down‐regulated and up‐regulated proteins. Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbon metabolism. Moreover, three metabolic pathways, including carbon metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and fructose and mannose metabolism, were significantly affected. Our findings offered a better understanding of the host response to different virulence white spot syndrome virus infection. Significance and Impact of the Study: White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the most harmful pathogens in shrimp farming. Previous studies have shown that genetic variations of white spot syndrome virus cause the strains of different virulence. The hosts also show different self‐regulation when infected by different viruses. A better understanding of host response to white spot syndrome virus will help elucidate the virulence and pathogenesis of this unique pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon metabolism 3acytoplasm 3afructose 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3amannose 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apeptides 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3ashrimp culture 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aLiu, Q.‐H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0032-52381 aHuang, J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 Aug., v. 67, no. 2 p.113-122dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.130043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245008700160506002800247520104600275592002801321506003701349650003501386650001601421650002101437650000901458650001901467650002401486650001301510651001401523700002401537700001701561700001801578700002501596700001701621700002401638700002001662700001801682773010501700856007701805852000901882655001201891IND60767599020221207140725.0220125s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076759902DNAL7 a10.18343/jipi.27.1.182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdila, Almi10aPopulasi Mikroorganisme Tanah pada Lahan Jagung setelah Aplikasi Pupuk Poliakrilat  aResource is Open Access  aThe number and type of microorganisms in the soil indicate soil fertility. The use of fertilizers can affect the growth of microorganisms in the soil. Quantitative tests are conducted to evaluate how fertilizers affect the presence of bacteria, fungi, and algae. The number of bacteria and fungi is calculated using the standard plate count method, while the number of algae is calculated using the most probable number method. The highest number of bacteria found in urea-phosphate-potassium (UPK) applications of zeolite polymers is 50%, which is 3.4 × 106 CFU/mL; the most fungi are found in 25% of applications, which is 2.5 × 104 CFU/mL. In contrast, the highest algae population was in control soils, 2.7 × 104 CFU/mL. However, for treatment, an enormous amount is found in the administration of 50% zeolite polymer UPK as much as 1.4 × 103 CFU/mL, so it can be concluded that the administration of UPK zeolite polymer affects the number of microorganisms on the cornfield.

In this study, a multi-indicator method was developed to assess the risk status of livestock populations. Six indicators were used: (i) the current number of breeding females; (ii) the change in the number of breeding females over the last 5 years or generations (depending on the species); (iii) percentage of cross-breeding; (iv) effective population size; (v) breeders organization and technical support; and (vi) socio-economic context. To make these indicators comparable, observed values were converted into scores on a six-point scale (from 0 = no threat to 5 = maximum threat); a specific conversion method was used for each indicator. For each breed, the different scores were analysed graphically and an overall score was calculated by averaging the six separate indicator scores. This approach was applied to 178 French local breeds, belonging to ten different species: horse, donkey, goat, pig, chicken, turkey, goose and Pekin duck. A large percentage of local breeds were found to be at risk to be lost for farming, although the results were species dependent. All local equine and pig breeds, as well as almost all local poultry breeds appeared to be endangered. About 80 percent of local goat and cattle breeds, and half local sheep breeds were also found to be at risk. The usefulness of this method with regards to conservation strategies and public policy is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPekin 3aasses 3acattle breeds 3achickens 3acrossing 3aducks 3aeffective population size 3afemales 3ageese 3agoats 3ahorses 3apublic policy 3arisk 3asheep breeds 3asocioeconomics 3aswine 3aswine breeds 0abreeds 0aendangerment 0aindicators 0araces 0arisque de disparition 0aindicateurs 0arazas 0apuesta en peligro 0aindicadores1 aAudiot, A.1 aBertrand, C.1 aChapuis, H.1 aCharvolin, E.1 aDanchin-Burge, C.1 aDanvy, S.1 aGourdine, J.L.1 aGaultier, P.1 aGuémené, D.1 aLaloë, D.1 aLenoir, H.1 aLeroy, G.1 aNaves, M.1 aPatin, S.1 aSabbagh, M.0 tAnimal genetic resources.g2015 Dec., v. 57 p.105-118dCambridge University PresswJournal:23118x2078-63447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S20786336150002603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010200162300001800264500001900282520128300301592002801584650001701612650001401629650002301643650001301666650001201679650001401691700002601705773013401731856007401865852000901939655001201948IND60730999620221121220542.0210315e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073099962DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cs01339k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrouvé, Jonathan10aBeyond hydrogen bonding: recent trends of outer sphere interactions in transition metal catalysis  ap. 3565-3584.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHomogeneous catalytic reactions are typically controlled by the stereoelectronic nature of the ligand(s) that bind to the metal(s). The advantages of the so-called first coordination sphere effects have been used for the efficient synthesis of fine chemicals relevant for industrial and academic laboratories since more than half a century. Such level of catalyst control has significantly upgraded in the last few decades by mastering additional interactions beyond the first coordination sphere. These so-called second coordination sphere effects are mainly inspired by the action mode of nature's catalysts, enzymes, and, in general, rely on subtle hydrogen bonding for the exquisite control of activity and selectivity. In order to span the scope of this powerful strategy to challenges that cannot be solved purely by hydrogen bonding, a variety of less common interactions have been successfully introduced in the last few years for a fine chemical synthesis. This review covers the latest and most exciting developments of this newly flourishing area with a particular focus on highlighting how these types of interactions can be rationally implemented to control the reactivity in a remote fashion, which is far away from the active site similar to what enzymes also do.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen 3aligands 3asynthesis1 aGramage-Doria, Rafael0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 50, no. 5 p.3565-3584dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs01339k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008300168300001600251520115900267592002801426650001501454650001701469650001101486650001201497650002901509650001001538650001501548650001101563650001301574650002601587650002201613650002201635650001701657650001201674650001701686650001001703651001001713651002501723651001101748653001701759653001701776653002301793653003301816653001901849700001801868700001501886700001901901700001501920773009501935856008402030852000902114655001202123IND60123108320221120094829.0150428e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012310832DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2013.8253442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristaudo, A.10aSpecies–area relationships and minimum area in citrus grove weed communities  ap. 337-345.  aField surveys were carried out in the Catania plain (eastern Sicily, Italy) on winter–spring weed communities in citrus groves, an economical and traditional crop of the Mediterranean area. The aim of this study was to define species–area relationships and to derive information on the minimum sampling area in citrus groves, taking into consideration the ecological, botanical and agronomical implications. Weed flora was composed of 63 taxa belonging to 25 botanical families (42% of taxa included in the families Poaceae , Asteraceae and Brassicaceae). The dominance of therophytes and species with a wide distribution was related to the high degree of artificiality induced by human pressure. The species richness per survey was rather low, ranging from 8 to 22 species, in a surface area of 256 m ². Species–area analyses showed that the minimum sampling area that fully expressed the specific characteristics of plant communities in these citrus groves ranged from 33 to 56 m ². As a result, this methodology can be an appropriate decision support system for sustainable weed management strategies, with a more rational use of herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aBrassicaceae 3aCitrus 3aPoaceae 3adecision support systems 3aflora 3aherbicides 3ahumans 3aorchards 3aplant characteristics 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3asurface area 3asurveys 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 3aSicily 0aCitrus grove 0aminimum area 0anested-plot design 0aspecies–area relationships 0aweed community1 aRestuccia, A.1 aOnofri, A.1 aLo Giudice, V.1 aGresta, F.0 tPlant biosystems.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 149, no. 2 p.337-345dTaylor & Francisx1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2013.8253443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010900171300001600280520160300296592002801899650002201927650002201949650001401971650001401985650001201999650001802011650001402029650001102043650001702054650001402071650003602085651001702121651001302138653000802151653000802159653000602167653000802173653000902181653000602190653002202196653001902218653002602237653002202263653002102285653002002306700002402326773011602350856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60542522020221120124025.0190403e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054252202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuarín, Juan R.10aModeling the stipe growth of the Oenocarpus bataua palm in the Central Cordillera of the Andes, Colombia  ap. 141-149.  aOver 9.4years in the premontane natural forest of Colombia, we measured the annual rates of growth in length (RGL) of the stipes, the stipe length (l) and the annual rates of leaf scars (RLS) in 109 palms of Oenocarpus bataua. We counted leaf scars on the stipes and the leaves of the crown of each palm (SPL) and determined the position of the scar from the first inflorescence on 79 stipes. The RLS are not correlated with the RGL, are not constant and show negative allometry with l. We correct the RLS of each palm with the mean value of a function to obtain the mean rates of leaf scars (MRLS). We estimate the age (t) for each l, dividing SPL by MRLS for each l. We model l as a function of t in years using von Bertalanffýs growth model (l=f(t)) and the relative growth in length, RGL ((1/l)dl/dt=f(t)), which we integrate to obtain a new expression of von Bertalanffýs growth model. For the same ages, both growth equations estimate very similar values of l that are not significantly different from the values of l for 27 palms whose ages were determined using 14C bomb dating. By averaging the values of the two growth equations, we obtained the following results regarding the life history of O. bataua: (i) the life span once the elongation of l begins is 169years, (ii) the half-life is 35years, (iii) the mean residence time is 33.3years, (iv) the maximum RGL(dl/dt) is 0.37myear−1 and occurs at 17.3years, (v) and the maximum l/t, is 0.31myear−1 and occurs at age 31.

There are currently at least 29 serotypes of bluetongue virus (BTV) in the world. Noteworthily, the pathogenesis among BTV serotypes is different, even in the same animal species. In this study, BTV2/KM/2003 and BTV12/PT/2003 were used to investigate the differential immunological effects on bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The BTV viral load and the expression of cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) in PBMCs were measured by fluorescence-based real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was applied to detect BTV signals in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The SWISS-MODEL and IL-4pred prediction tools were used to predict the interleukin 4 (IL-4)-inducing peptides in BTV-coat protein VP2. Synthetic peptides of VP2 were used to stimulate PBMCs for IL-4-inducing capability. This study demonstrated that the cytokine profiles of BTV-induced PBMCs were significantly different between BTV2/KM/2003 and BTV12/PT/2003. BTV2 preferentially activated the T helper 2 (Th2) pathway, represented by the early induction of IL-4, and likely fed back to inhibit the innate immunity. In contrast, BTV12 preferentially activated the innate immunity, represented by the induction of tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 (IL-1), with only minimal subsequent IL-4. The BTV nonstructural protein 3 antibody (anti-BTV-NS3) fluorescent signals demonstrated that monocytes in PBMCs and MDMs were the preferred targets of BTV replication. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the capability to induce IL-4 was attributed to the tip region of the VP2 protein, wherein a higher number of predicted peptide segments on BTVs were positively correlated with the allergic reaction reported in cattle. Synthetic peptides of BTV2-VP2 induced significant IL-4 within 12–24 h post-infection (hpi) in PBMCs, whereas those of BTV12 did not, consistent with the bioinformatics prediction. Bovine PBMCs and synthetic peptides together seem to serve as a good model for pursuing the BTV-induced IL-4 activity that precedes the development of an allergic reaction, although further optimization of the protocol is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBluetongue virus 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3abioinformatics 3abluetongue 3acattle 3aeconomic impact 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahypersensitivity 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-4 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3amonocytes 3apathogenesis 3aprediction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3asynthetic peptides 3aviral load 3aviral nonstructural proteins1 aChang, Chia-Yi 1 aSheng, Chih-Shuan 1 aWang, Chia-Chi 1 aWang, Fun-In 0 tPathogens.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100100033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007300167300001500240506002800255520097300283592002801256506003701284650000901321650001501330650001601345650001901361653001901380653001301399653002101412653002801433700001801461773016501479856008201644852000901726655001201735IND60767600420221207083741.0220116e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076760042DNAL7 a10.29048/makufebed.8817562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKANBER, Rumeysa10aSuggestions for Landscape Design of Kütahya Yoncalı Thermal Region  ap. 92-103.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of this study is to develop suggestions for improving the landscape of Kütahya Yoncalı Thermal Region. First of all, the existing condition of the region was examined; face-to-face questionnaire were conducted with incoming visitors and business owners. Questionnaire consisted of 13 questions for visitors and 11 questions for business owners. As a result of the questionnaire; it has been determined that 12.7% of the visitors think that the walking paths do not allow easy movement in the area, 26.7% of the visitors do not find the area reliable enough for children, and 30% of them think that the need for parking is not met at a sufficient level. According to the results, it has been understood that visitors coming to thermal facilities pay attention to landscaping in their selection of facilities, and that the facilities with landscaping are more preferred. Suggestions for the solution of the problems identified in the study have been developed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afens 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3aquestionnaires 0athermal spring 0akütahya 0alandscape design 0ayoncalı thermal region1 aTOPAY, Mehmet0 tMehmet Akif Ersoy üniversitesi fen bilimleri enstitüsü.g2021 May, v. 12, no. 1 p.92-103dBurdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy UniversitywJournal:27927x1309-22437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.29048/makufebed.8817563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04170naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010600176500001900282520247300301592002802774650001602802650003402818650001102852650001502863650001102878650001402889650002402903650002202927650001102949650001602960650001702976650001302993650001103006650000903017650001403026650001703040650001603057650001303073650001303086653001403099653002003113653003803133653002603171653002203197700002403219700002003243700002203263700002403285700002603309700002203335700002003357773010703377856008703484852000903571655001203580IND60715058120221120132401.0210305e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071505812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPattammattel, Ajith10aIron speciation in particulate matter (PM2.5) from urban Los Angeles using spectro-microscopy methods  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe speciation, oxidation states, and relative abundance of iron (Fe) phases in PM₂.₅ samples from two locations in urban Los Angeles were investigated using a combination of bulk and spatially resolved, element-specific spectroscopy and microscopy methods. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of bulk samples in situ (i.e., without extraction or digestion) was used to quantify the relative fractions of major Fe phases, which were corroborated by spatially resolved spectro-microscopy measurements. Ferrihydrite (amorphous Fe(III)-hydroxide) comprised the largest Fe fraction (34–52%), with hematite (α-Fe₂O₃; 13–23%) and magnetite (Fe₃O₄; 10–24%) identified as major crystalline oxide components. An Fe-bearing phyllosilicate fraction (16–23%) was fit best with a reference spectrum of a natural illite/smectite mineral, and metallic Fe(0) was a relatively small (2–6%) but easily identified component. Sizes, morphologies, oxidation state, and trace element compositions of Fe-bearing PM from electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) revealed variable and heterogeneous mixtures of Fe species and phases, often associated with carbonaceous material with evidence of surface oxidation. Ferrihydrite (or related Fe(III) hydroxide phases) was ubiquitous in PM samples. It forms as an oxidation or surface alteration product of crystalline Fe phases, and also occurs as coatings or nanoparticles dispersed with other phases as a result of environmental dissolution and re-precipitation reactions. The prevalence of ferrihydrite (and adsorbed Fe(III)) has likely been underestimated in studies of ambient PM because it is non-crystalline, non-magnetic, more soluble than crystalline phases, and found in complex mixtures. Review of potential sources of different particle types suggests that the majority of Fe-bearing PM from these urban sites originates from anthropogenic activities, primarily abrasion products from vehicle braking systems and engine emissions from combustion and/or wear. These variable mixtures have a high probability for electron transfer reactions between Fe, redox-active metals such as copper, and reactive carbon species such as quinones. Our findings suggest the need to assess biological responses of specific Fe-bearing phases both individually and in combination to unravel mechanisms of adverse health effects of particulate Fe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acombustion 3acopper 3adigestion 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aferrihydrite 3ahematite 3aillite 3airon 3amagnetite 3aparticulates 3aprobability 3aquinones 3asmectite 0a6): PM2.5 0aIron speciation 0aElectron energy loss spectroscopy 0aNon-exhaust emissions 0aExhaust emissions1 aLeppert, Valerie J.1 aAronstein, Paul1 aRobinson, Matthew1 aMousavi, Amirhosein1 aSioutas, Constantinos1 aForman, Henry Jay1 aO'Day, Peggy A.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 245 p.117988-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245008700199300001800286500001900304500002000323520135200343592002801695596005901723650001701782650001901799650001701818650001401835650001901849650001401868650002501882700005701907773011801964856007302082852000902155655001202164IND60718285320221120070203.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071828532DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.168012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Dongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6332-262710aFrom one side to two sides: the effects of stomatal distribution on photosynthesis  ap. 1754-1766.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe functions of stomata have been studied for a long time; however, a clear understanding of the influences of stomatal distribution on photosynthesis, especially the CO₂ diffusion, is still unclear. Here, we investigated the stomatal morphology, distribution on leaf surfaces, vein traits and gas exchange parameters of 61 species, of which 29 were amphistomatous, spanning 32 families. Photosynthesis (A) was tightly coupled with operational stomatal conductance (gₛ) and mesophyll conductance (gₘ) regardless of whether phylogenetic relationships were accounted for. Although the enhancement of gₛ from ferns and gymnosperms to angiosperms could largely be explained by the increase in leaf vein density (VLA) and stomatal density (SD), the gₛ was decoupled from VLA and SD across angiosperm species. Instead, A in angiosperms was further influenced by the allocation of stomatal pores on leaf surfaces, which dramatically increased gₛ and gₘ. Moreover, the ratio of gₛ to anatomically based maximum gₛ was, on average, 0.12 across species. Our results show that the shift of stomatal pores from one leaf side to both sides played an important role in regulating CO₂ diffusion via both stomata and mesophyll tissues. Modifications of stomata distribution have potential as a functional trait for photosynthesis improvement.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801290cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAngiospermae 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3amesophyll 3aphotosynthesis 3aphylogeny 3astomatal conductance1 aFlexas, Jaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3069-175X0 tnew phytologist.g2020 Dec., v. 228, no. 6 p.1754-1766dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.168013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014100158300001600299520128800315592002801603650002701631650001801658650001701676650001501693650001901708650001901727650001301746650001301759650001701772650001301789650001301802650002501815650001501840650003701855700001801892700001401910700001501924700001201939700001801951700001401969773011901983856007402102852000902176655001202185IND60667049520221121120658.0190919e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066704952DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra12651c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Baolong10aFully aromatic naphthalene-based sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone)s with flexible sulfoalkyl groups as polymer electrolyte membranes  ap. 536-544.  aA series of sulfonated naphthalene-based poly (arylene ether ketone)s (SNPAEK-xx) with pendant sulfoalkyl groups were prepared by polycondensation of 1,5-bis(4-fluorobenzoyl)-2,6-dimethoxynaphthalene and o-methylhydroquinone, followed by a demethylation and sulfobutylation reaction. The sulfonate degree of SNPAEK-xx could be controlled easily by adjusting the ratio of 1,4-butane sultone to the hydroxyl content in the demethylated polymers. Flexible and tough membranes with reasonably high mechanical strength were prepared. SNPAEK-xx membranes showed a high ionic exchange capacity (IEC) in the range of 1.13 to 2.27 mequiv. g⁻¹, and the highest proton conductivity of 0.191 S cm⁻¹ at 80 °C. They exhibited low methanol permeability in the range of 1.25–10.22 × 10⁻⁷ cm² s⁻¹, which was much lower than that of Nafion 117. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of SNPAEK-xx revealed that they had a more obvious phase separated structure between the hydrophilic side chain and hydrophobic fully aromatic domains at a higher IEC. Combining their high thermal and mechanical stability, high selectivity, lower water swelling ratio, SNPAEK-xx membranes could be promising materials as alternative to Nafion membranes for direct methanol fuel cell applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensation reactions 3ademethylation 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amethanol 3amoieties 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aquinones 3astrength (mechanics) 3asulfonates 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aCai, Zhenzhen1 aZhang, Na1 aZhang, Bin1 aQi, Duo1 aZhao, Chengji1 aNa, Hŭi,0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 5, no. 1 p.536-544dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra12651c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013000169520141900299592002801718650002201746650001501768650001501783650003101798650001901829650001701848650001601865650003701881650001501918653001501933653002101948653001601969653001901985653002302004700002002027700001702047700001602064700001402080700001602094700001802110700002002128700001802148700001902166773010602185856008702291852000902378655001202387IND60782810220221122132259.0220824e20221020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078281022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1296942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liyun10aCore-shell sp3@sp2 nanocarbon for adsorption of anionic and cationic organic dyes: Effect of the graphitization of nanocarbon  aDeveloping suitable and efficient adsorbents to remove organic dyes from wastewater become a hot topic. Herein, core-shell sp³@sp² nanocarbons (ND-700, ND-900, ND-1100 and ND-1300), consisting of diamond core and graphitic shell with variable sp²/sp³-carbon ratio, were prepared by annealing nanodiamonds (NDs) at various temperatures (700–1300 °C). The increased graphitization degree of the nanocarbons with the increase of annealing temperature was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM). Sequentially, these nanocarbons were utilized as solid adsorbents to remove anionic methylene orange (MO) and cationic methylene blue (MB). Results show that although all of the nanocarbons are positively charged, the nanocarbons with higher graphitization (ND-1100, ND-1300) exhibit higher adsorption performance for both MB and MO. This can be attributed to the forming of π-π interaction between the graphitic surface and aromatic rings within the dye molecules. The ND-700 exhibits little adsorption for cationic MB for its low graphitization as well as electrostatic repulsion. The adsorption of MO and MB on ND-700 and ND-1300 in the binary MO/MB system was also investigated, respectively. Results show that the ND-1300 could adsorb MO and MB efficiently and simultaneously, and ND-700 exhibits selective adsorption for MO from the binary system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amethylene blue 3ananodiamonds 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater 0aAdsorption 0aMethylene orange 0aMethyl blue 0aGraphitization 0aSp3@sp2 nanocarbon1 aFeng, Guangjing1 aZhou, Weihai1 aZhang, Ying1 aWang, Lei1 aWang, Lihua1 aLiu, Zhongqiu1 aZhao, Tiansheng1 aZhu, Wancheng1 aZhang, Bingsen0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 651 p.129694-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1296943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245009500126300001600221520122700237592002801464650001701492650000901509650001201518650002901530650001201559650001101571651001001582651001001592651001601602653001101618653002901629653001401658700002401672700001801696773012501714852000901839655001201848IND60738447220221120141044.0210524e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073844722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnoop, M.10aGrowth, geographic concentration and stability analysis of coir products export from India  ap. 210-215.  aCoir is an important export commodity, giving income and employment opportunity to a number of people across the country. Present study tries to analyse growth and instability of coir products export to major importing countries and also looks into the geographic concentration and stability of direction of trade. Highest growth rate in export quantity (85.66%) and value of export (81.71%) was for China, whereas growth in unit value of export was highest for South Korea (7.47%). High instability in export quantity, value of export and unit value was found for China. Most other importing countries were having low instability, except unit value of export to UK and USA. Geographic concentration was not much high either for quantity or value of export. Markov chain analysis showed China as the most stable importing country with high probability of retention (0.89), whereas, South Korea emerged as the most unstable importer with least probability of retention.

However, it is unclear whether they are a proper animal model. Thus, we compared the metabolism of quercetin in Wistar rats (rats), Balb/c mice (mice) and Mongolian gerbils (gerbils). METHODS: We determined the levels of quercetin metabolites, quercetin-3-glucuronide (Q3G), quercetin-3′-sulfate (Q3′S) and methyl-quercetin isorhamnetin (IH), in the plasma, lungs and livers of three species of animals by high-performance liquid chromatography after acute and/or chronic quercetin administration. The metabolic enzyme activities in the intestinal mucosal membrane and liver were also investigated. RESULTS: First, we found that after acute quercetin administration, the Q3′S level was the highest in gerbils. However, after long-term supplementation (20 weeks), Q3G was the dominant metabolite in the plasma, lungs and livers followed by IH and Q3′S in all animals, although the gerbils still had a higher Q3′S conversion ratio. The average concentrations of total quercetin concentration in the plasma of gerbils were the highest in both short- and long-term studies. The activities of uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase, phenolsulfotransferase and catechol-O-methyltransferase were induced by quercetin in a dose- and tissue-dependent manner in all animals. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, in general, after long-term supplementation the metabolism of quercetin is similar in all animals and is comparable to that of humans. However, the accumulation of quercetin and Q3′S conversion ratio in gerbils are higher than those in the other animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acatechol O-methyltransferase 3aenzyme activity 3agerbils 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aisorhamnetin 3aliver 3alungs 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amice 3amucosa 3aquercetin 3arats 3auridine1 aLin, Yi-Chin1 aLin, Yi-Ling1 aLi, Jianjun,1 aChuang, Cheng-Hung0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 55, no. 1 p.413-422dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-015-0862-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245010500202300001600307520131800323592002801641650000801669650001101677650001301688650001401701650001501715650001901730650001701749650001801766650001901784650001101803650002201814650002201836650002701858650002801885650001501913650002001928653001301948653001701961653001701978653002001995700001702015700001902032700001502051700006002066773011002126856008202236852000902318655001202327IND60525787520221122154807.0190401e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052578752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2016.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjouina, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3557-410310aToxicological consequences of experimental exposure to aluminum in human intestinal epithelial cells  ap. 108-116.  aAluminum (Al), a non-essential element, is ubiquitous in industrialized societies. Whereas adult intake is estimated between 3 and 12 mg/day according to dietary aluminum studies conducted in many countries, it is not known if aluminum may have a toxic effect on intestinal epithelium. The aim of this work was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and RNA expression patterns induced in HT-29 cells by aluminum. Both classical toxicological methods and a global transcriptomic approach were used. Cytotoxicity determined by MTT assay showed a time and dose dependent decrease of cell viability in aluminum treated cells compared to control cells. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry revealed that aluminum induced accumulation of cells in phase G0/G1, associated with a decrease in the proportion of cells in S and G2/M phases. Aluminum led to apoptosis as evidenced by nuclear morphology changes and mitochondrial membrane perturbations, and induced reactive oxygen species generation. Transcriptomic pattern argued in favor of pro-tumorigenic and pro-inflammatory effects of aluminum in intestinal epithelial cells. These results highlight several pathways by which aluminum has a disturbing impact on intestinal epithelial cells, supporting that the effects of aluminum on intestine warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aadults 3aaluminum 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aindustrialization 3aintestinal mucosa 3amitochondrial membrane 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicology 3atranscriptomics 0aAluminum 0aHT-29 cells 0aCytotoxicity 0aTranscriptomics1 aEsquerre, N.1 aDesreumaux, P.1 aVignal, C.1 aBody-Malapel, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3392-42290 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2016 May, v. 91 p.108-116dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2016.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008400166300001800250520103000268592002801298650001001326650002001336650001601356651002101372773012101393856005101514852000901565655001201574IND50087936420221119212626.0140412e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008793642DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2010.5415182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrytsai, A.10aPlanetary wave peculiarities in Antarctic ozone distribution during 1979–2008  ap. 3139-3151.  aSatellite ozone data over the Antarctic region have been analysed for 1979–2008. Quasi-stationary wave (QSW) characteristics are obtained for the September–November period for the latitudinal range 50–80° S. Two time intervals for the wave amplitude changes are discussed: 1979–early 1990s, when the amplitude was increasing, and mid-1990s–2000s, when long-term amplitude changes did not have sufficient statistical reliability. A systematic change of the minimum position in quasi-stationary ozone distribution is studied. It is shown that an eastward minimum shift lasted during 1979–2008. Characteristics of the Fourier harmonics in ozone distribution are considered. Tendencies in the amplitudes and phases of the main wave components with zonal numbers 1 and 2 are determined. Amplitude dependence on zonal number is studied for the 1979–2008 averaged data. It is shown that this dependence obeys the power law with factors 0.7–1.6 for daily amplitudes and 1.9–2.6 for QSW in zonal ozone distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aozone 3aozone depletion 3aozonosphere 3aAntarctic region0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2011 June 10, v. 32, no. 11 p.3139-3151dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.541518  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015400168520188400322592002802206650001502234650002102249650001302270650003002283650001002313650001102323650001402334650002002348650001302368650001502381650002202396653002602418653001402444653001302458653000802471653001002479653001102489700002102500700002902521700002402550700003102574700003002605773010602635856008702741852000902828655001202837IND60782810420221122132240.0220824e20221020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078281042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1296982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadi, Zahra12aA DFT study on the therapeutic potential of carbon nanostructures as sensors and drug delivery carriers for curcumin molecule: NBO and QTAIM analyses  aIn this research, the interactions of curcumin molecule with fullerene C₆₀ (F-C₆₀), carbon nanosheet (CNS), and carbon nanotube (CNT) as carbon nanostructures were investigated for drug delivery purposes employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Two phases of gas and water were considered for DFT calculations on the investigated models. A stabilized complex of curcumin and nanostructures was obtained in both phases according to the values of adsorption energy. An exothermic reaction was seen according to the negative values of adsorption energy. It was found from the calculations of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) that the values of electron density in critical points of bond (ρᵣ) were low and positive in all hydrogen bonding complexes. The results of the calculations also indicated the existence of weak interaction forces for noticeable and successful unloading of the curcumin from the carriers at target sites. The density of states (DOS) was investigated to evaluate the effect of molecular adsorption on the electronic properties of the nanostructures, and the results showed that F-C₆₀ was closer to the Fermi energy (red line) than other nanostructures. The values of adsorption energy in the gas phase were higher than those in the water phase, indicating a stronger interaction of the molecule with the nanostructures in the gas phase. According to the values of adsorption energy, curcumin interacted stronger with F-C₆₀ in comparison with other nanostructures. The values of ∆Eg after adsorption of curcumin were − 0.21 eV, − 0.01 eV, and − 0.001 eV for F-C₆₀, CNS, and CNT, respectively, showing that F-C₆₀ was more sensitive than CNS and CNT. The calculations carried out in this study indicated that the nanostructures could be applied as suitable carriers for delivering curcumin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3acurcumin 3adensity functional theory 3adrugs 3aenergy 3afullerene 3aheat production 3ahydrogen 3ananosheets 3aquantum mechanics 0aCarbon nanostructures 0aFullerene 0aCurcumin 0aDFT 0aQTAIM 0aSensor1 aNouraliei, Milad1 aYousefi-Siavoshani, Asal1 aJavadian, Hamedreza1 aChalanchi, Saber Mohammadi1 aHashemi, Seyedeh Sedigheh0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 651 p.129698-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1296983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009600160500002000256520143600276592002801712596006801740650002201808650002301830650002901853650002501882650002401907650001301931650001201944650002201956650001201978650002701990650001502017650002402032650001602056700002402072700002102096700002502117700002802142700006302170700006502233773013502298856007402433852000902507655001202516IND60672472320221119233744.0191016e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067247232DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.132342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoop, Betina L.10aVacuum curcumin infusion in cooked oysters (Crassostrea gigas) to increase their shelf life  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCurcumin solutions were infused into cooked oysters by vacuum and the best solution was chosen to inhibit growth of total mesophilic and total psychrophilic bacteria in oysters during storage. Shelled cooked oysters were immersed in three different curcumin solutions (130 μg/mL): tween, ethanol (3.5% of alcohol), and white wine (3.5% of alcohol). Oysters immersed in curcumin solution were subjected to vacuum‐infusion at 200 mbar for 20 min. Raman spectra showed that curcumin was present in all solutions. However, the oysters infused with curcumin white wine solution showed best results. After that, oysters were immersed in curcumin white wine solution and vacuum‐infused under 200 mbar for 1, 3, and 20 min, packaged and stored at 4°C for 14 days. 27.30 μg of curcumin/g of oyster infused into oysters for 20 min was the most effective concentration against mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria during storage. The physicochemical characteristics of oysters were preserved. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Curcumin is a bioactive compound with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and was used in this research. Positive antimicrobial effect was observed through increased shelf life of cooked oysters, opening up possibilities for industrial purposes. In addition, the vacuum infusion can be an alternative for incorporation of natural additives in food products as a substitute with chemical additives.  aPublisher supplied data  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acurcumin 3aethanol 3anatural additives 3aoysters 3apsychrophilic bacteria 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3awhite wines1 aCargnin, Mariana A.1 aFidler, Fernanda1 aRibeiro, Deise H.

Problematic DNA replication can lead to genomic instability and therefore carcinogenesis. Numerous mechanisms work together to achieve this tight control and increasing evidence suggests that post‐translational modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation) of DNA replication proteins play a pivotal role in this process. Here we discuss such modifications in the light of a recent article that describes a novel role for the deubiquitinase (DUB) USP7/HAUSP in the control of DNA replication. USP7 achieves this function by an unusual and novel mechanism, namely deubiquitination of SUMOylated proteins at the replication fork, making USP7 also a SUMO DUB (SDUB). This work extends previous observations of increased levels of SUMO and low levels of ubiquitin at the on‐going replication fork. Here, we discuss this novel study, its contribution to the DNA replication and genomic stability field and what questions arise from this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3acarcinogenesis 3aphosphorylation 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitination1 aFreire, Raimundo0 tBioEssays.g2016 Sept., v. 38, no. 9 p.863-868dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2016000963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013700166520134700303592002801650650002201678650001101700650000901711650001101720650001601731653003401747653002701781653001601808653003801824653003801862700001801900700001501918700005701933773009001990856008502080852000902165655001202174IND60756509620221118194419.0220328e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075650962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1225672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haiquan10aCombined heat and power dynamic economic dispatch considering field operational characteristics of natural gas combined cycle plants  aCombined heat and power dynamic economic dispatch (CHPDED) is one of the key technologies for the efficient operation of natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants in integrated energy systems. In this study, based on the actual operational characteristics of NGCC plants at combined heat and power mode, a plant advanced loads variation capacity model is developed. The advanced loads variation capacity models of NGCC plants are integrated into the CHPDED model to guarantee the feasibility of the dispatched demands. Moreover, a field operational data based simplification method for the advanced loads variation capacity model is proposed to alleviate the computational burden. The field operational data of an actual NGCC station is taken to perform case studies. The calculation cases show that all the dispatched demands calculated from the CHPDED model with advanced loads variation capacity models are feasible. Furthermore, the influence of the heat load variation process on the power load adjustment process is employed to achieve better dispatch results. Compared with CHPDED models in the existing research, the CHPDED model with advanced loads variation capacity models significantly improves the feasibility of the dispatched demands, thereby enhancing the real application value of CHPDED in the field operation of NGCC plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic dispatch 3aenergy 3aheat 3amodels 3anatural gas 0aCombined heat and power (CHP) 0aEconomic dispatch (ED) 0aFeasibility 0aNatural gas combined cycle (NGCC) 0aCombined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)1 aZhou, Jianxin1 aSi, Fengqi1 aNord, Lars O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2734-58210 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122567-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1225673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016900167500001900336520139300355592002801748650001301776650000801789650001101797650001601808650001101824650001301835650001001848650001301858650001901871651001001890653001201900653003501912653001201947653001301959700001701972700001601989700001502005700001602020700001202036700001402048700001702062700001502079700001502094700001502109773010702124856008702231852000902318655001202327IND60715058520221120122255.0201118e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071505852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Tian10aNitrate debuts as a dominant contributor to particulate pollution in Beijing: Roles of enhanced atmospheric oxidizing capacity and decreased sulfur dioxide emission  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImplementation of strict emission mitigation measures since 2013 has significantly changed air pollutants in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH), China. Observations show that ozone (O₃) concentrations have increased by 62.40% (27.84%) and SO₂ concentrations have decreased by 56.42% (35.07%) during particulate pollution episodes in Beijing (BTH) in the autumn from 2013 to 2015. The measured nitrate concentration in Beijing has increased markedly, which to a large degree offsets the sulfate decrease caused by SO₂ emission mitigation. Using the WRF-Chem model, we demonstrate that the enhanced nitrate formation is primarily attributed to increasing atmospheric oxidizing capacity (AOC) and decreasing sulfate competition for base ions. A 9.41–46.24% (7.58–40.97%) decrease in OH radical (O₃) concentrations in October 2015 reduces nitrate and fine particulate matters (PM₂.₅) concentrations by 2.51–18.18% and 3.15–18.90% in Beijing, respectively. Based on the scenario in October 2015, if the SO₂ emission increases by 20.00–100.00%, the PM₂.₅ concentration increases by 3.02–11.21%, but the nitrate level decreases by 2.48–21.87% simultaneously. Our results suggest that the nitrate aerosol has become a dominant contributor to particulate pollution in Beijing and that decreasing AOC is critical to mitigate nitrate and PM₂.₅ concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aautumn 3aenvironment 3amodels 3anitrates 3aozone 3asulfates 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aNitrate 0aAtmospheric oxidizing capacity 0aSulfate 0aWRF-Chem1 aBei, Naifang1 aZhao, Shuyu1 aWu, Jiarui1 aLiu, Suixin1 aLi, Xia1 aLiu, Lang1 aWang, Ruonan1 aZhang, Xiu1 aTie, Xuexi1 aLi, Guohui0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 244 p.117995-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01517naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245012700159300002000286520056500306592002800871650002600899650001700925650001700942700005800959773014901017856007601166852000901242655001201251IND60747060020221118071954.0210811e20210728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074706002DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c070062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Xin-Yue10aPyridine-Conjugated Pillar[5]arene: From Molecular Crystals of Blue Luminescence to Red-Emissive Coordination Nanocrystals  ap. 11976-11981.  aA luminescent molecular crystal (P5bipy) and a Cu(I)-coordinated luminescent nanocrystal (Cu(I)-P5bipy) have been prepared concurrently using one conjugated pillar[5]arene macrocycle via a facile supramolecular self-assembling strategy.

The effects of this predicted weather change on pre‐emergence (PRE) herbicide efficacy have been inadequately explored. Using an extensive database, spanning 252 unique weather environments, the efficacy of atrazine, acetochlor, S‐metolachlor, and mesotrione, applied PRE alone and in combinations, was modeled on common weed species in corn (Zea mays L.). RESULTS: Adequate rainfall to dissolve the herbicide into soil water solution so that it could be absorbed by developing weed seedlings within the first 15 days after PRE application was essential for effective weed control. Across three annual weed species, the probability of effective control increased as rainfall increased and was maximized when rainfall was 10 cm or more. When rainfall was less than 10 cm, increasing soil temperatures had either a positive or negative effect on the probability of effective control, depending on the herbicide(s) and weed species. Herbicide combinations required less rainfall to maximize the probability of effective control and had higher odds of successfully controlling weeds compared with the herbicides applied individually. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study highlight the importance of rainfall following PRE herbicide application. As rainfall becomes more variable in future, the efficacy of common PRE herbicides will likely decline. However, utilizing combinations of PRE herbicides along with additional cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical weed control methods will create a more sustainable integrated weed management system and help U.S. corn production adapt to more extreme weather. © 2021 The Authors.

Consumption of AFB1-contaminated agricultural products and the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma have received widespread attention. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether zinc supplementation could inhibit AFB1-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in HepG2 cells and the mechanism of this inhibition. Our data suggest that zinc sources can relieve a certain degree of AFB1-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by protecting against apoptotic body formation and DNA strand breaks, affecting S phase cell cycle arrest, reducing 8-OHdG formation, inhibiting global DNA hypomethylation and regulating gene expression in antioxidation, zinc-association and apoptosis processes. Consequently, zinc stabilizes the integrity of DNA and improves cell survival.These data provides new insights into the protective role of zinc in alleviating AFB1-induced cytotoxicity and mediating epigenetic changes in hepatocytes, demonstrating that zinc sources have detoxification properties in mycotoxin-induced toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aaflatoxin B1 3aagricultural products 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenicity 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acytotoxicity 3adietary mineral supplements 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenotoxicity 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3aprotective effect 3atoxicology 3azinc 0aZinc 0aAflatoxin B1 0aCytotoxicity 0aGenotoxicity 0aDetoxification 0aHepG2 cells1 aLv, Yangjun1 aHuang, Kunlun1 aLuo, Yunbo1 aXu, Wentao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2887-40950 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2016 June, v. 92 p.17-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2016.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001200112245012600124300001600250520139600266592002801662650002001690650002401710650001101734650001101745650001901756650001701775650001801792650000901810650001301819650003201832650001001864651001401874653001501888653001201903653001801915653002801933700001201961700001801973773012501991852000902116655001202125IND60738447720221120144617.0210524e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073844772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajad, 10aAssessment of above ground biomass and carbon stock of tropical rain-forest tree species from Java, Yogyakarta, Indonesia  ap. 238-242.  aThe study was conducted in the mixed plantation of tropical rain-forest species of Java Island, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Forests act as a source or sinks for atmospheric CO₂ to store from the atmosphere in different carbon pools by trees in a forest stand. The objectives of the study were to evaluate tree biomass, carbon stock, and absorb carbon dioxide and to expose the impacts of the basal area on biomass, carbon stocks, and absorb CO₂. The sample was selected by a simple random sampling method in the study site. Tree diameter at breast height point, height, and the crown cover were measured as primary source data. The tree basal area showed a strong positive correlation on tree biomass, carbon stocks and absorb CO₂, and value of R² is closed to 1, although when the basal area was increases with an increase in biomass, carbon stock sand absorb CO₂ of both sample trees. Average basal area was 1.850m², total biomass is 4.276-ton, carbon stocks was 2.13 tons and CO₂ absorptions were 7.84 ±61.21 tons in Spondias dulcis and more as compared to Monoon lingifolium which shows suitability and its quality of the site. Proper scientific management and proper utilization of the forest stand can be significant measures to enhance the potential of the forest to be stored and sink more carbon and can be included for CDM and REED++ under Kyoto protocol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpondias dulcis 3aaboveground biomass 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aforest stands 3asand 3atreaties 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aIndonesia 0aBasal area 0aBiomass 0aCarbon stocks 0aAbsorbed carbon dioxide1 aJawad, 1 aAhmed, Naseer0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.238-242dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011800161300001800279520228800297592002802585650002102613650002602634650003102660650002502691650001702716650001702733650001102750650001702761650002702778650001102805650001302816650000902829650000702838650001302845650001502858650002202873650002002895700002602915700002702941700001702968700001702985700001203002700001803014700001303032700001503045773012503060856007403185852000903259655001203268IND60747060320221118072016.0210811e20210802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074706032DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo02951c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasumuzzaman, Md10aGenomic and in vitro properties of the dairy Streptococcus thermophilus SMQ-301 strain against selected pathogens  ap. 7017-7028.  aCumulative studies have suggested that probiotic bacterial strains could be an effective alternative in inhibiting conditions caused by foodborne and vaginal pathogens. The use of genomic techniques is becoming highly useful in understanding the potential of these beneficial microorganisms. This study presents some genomic and in vitro properties of the Streptococcus thermophilus SMQ-301 strain against foodborne and vaginal pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Gardnerella vaginalis) to validate its use in dairy food formulations. Genomic analyses include bacteriocin production, stress response systems, antioxidant capability, and RAST-based functional annotation. In vitro investigations focused on the antimicrobial effects of the S. thermophilus SMQ-301 cell-free solution (CFS) against the selected pathogens after enzymatic actions and pH treatments, assessment of cytotoxic effects using murine RAW264.7 cells, and assessment of organic acid production levels using supplementary carbon sources. The results show that the S. thermophilus SMQ-301 genome possesses essential pathways for stress management, antioxidant activities, and bacteriocin production. For the first time, the bacteriocin-producing peptides of S. thermophilus SMQ-301 are reported, which gives an insight into its inhibitory potential. In vitro, the CFS of S. thermophilus SMQ-301 had significant (P < 0.05) antimicrobial effects on the selected pathogens, with S. aureus ATCC25923 being the most resistant. All antimicrobial activities of the CFS against the selected pathogens were eliminated at pH 6.5 and 7.0. S. thermophilus SMQ-301 CFS yielded the highest lactic (25.58 ± 0.24 mg mL⁻¹) and acetic (5.53 ± 0.12 mg mL⁻¹) acid production levels, with 1% fructooligosaccharide (P < 0.05). The S. thermophilus SMQ-301 strain also lowered murine RAW264.7 cell activities from 101.77% (control) to 80.16% (T5 – RAW264.7 cells + 1 × 10⁹ CFU mL⁻¹ cells) (P < 0.05). This study showed that although the S. thermophilus SMQ-301 strain had excellent genomic characteristics, the in vitro effects varied markedly against all three pathogens. In all, the S. thermophilus SMQ-301 strain has promising applications as a potential probiotic in the food and allied industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGardnerella vaginalis 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abacteriocins 3acarbon 3acytotoxicity 3afructooligosaccharides 3agenome 3agenomics 3amice 3apH 3apeptides 3aprobiotics 3astress management 3astress response1 aEvivie, Smith Etareri1 aOgwu, Matthew Chidozie1 aLi, Bailiang1 aDu, Jincheng1 aLi, Wan1 aHuo, Guicheng1 aLiu, Fei1 aWang, Song0 tFood & function.g2021 Aug. 2, v. 12, no. 15 p.7017-7028dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo02951c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245014100151300001600292500001400308500002000322520146900342592002801811596005901839596005901898596004401957596006402001650002102065650002502086650001302111650001502124650001402139650001402153650002302167650002302190650001302213650001002226650001602236650002402252650001802276650001102294650001202305650001502317650003202332650002802364650002402392650001302416700001402429700001502443700001702458700001802475700001802493700001502511700005302526773012402579856007302703852000902776655001202785IND60718286120221122053250.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071828612DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.131942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rui10aKnockout of SlNPR1 enhances tomato plants resistance against Botrytis cinerea by modulating ROS homeostasis and JA/ET signaling pathways  ap. 569-579.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTomato is one of the most popular horticultural crops, and many commercial tomato cultivars are particularly susceptible to Botrytis cinerea. Non‐expressor of pathogenesis‐related gene 1 (NPR1) is a critical component of the plant defense mechanisms. However, our understanding of how SlNPR1 influences disease resistance in tomato is still limited. In this study, two independent slnpr1 mutants were used to study the role of SlNPR1 in tomato resistance against B. cinerea. Compared to (WT), slnpr1 leaves exhibited enhanced resistance against B. cinerea with smaller lesion sizes, higher activities of chitinase (CHI), β‐1, 3‐glucanases (GLU) and phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase (PAL), and significantly increased expressions of pathogenesis‐related genes (PRs). The increased activities of peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and decreased catalase (CAT) activities collectively regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis in slnpr1 mutants. The integrity of the cell wall in slnpr1 mutants was maintained. Moreover, the enhanced resistance was further reflected by induction of defense genes involved in jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) signaling pathways. Taken together, these findings revealed that knocking out SlNPR1 resulted in increased activities of defense enzymes, changes in ROS homeostasis and integrity of cell walls, and activation of JA and ET pathways, which confers resistance against B. cinerea in tomato plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31571893cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31371847cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201906350075cChina Scholarship Council  a6202018cNatural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acell walls 3achitinase 3acultivars 3adefense mechanisms 3adisease resistance 3aethylene 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahorticultural crops 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3amutants 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3atomatoes1 aWang, Liu1 aLi, Yujing1 aZhao, Ruirui1 aZhang, Yuelin1 aSheng, Jiping1 aMa, Peihua1 aShen, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7458-21330 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 Dec., v. 170, no. 4 p.569-579dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245009200215500001900307520186600326592002802192650004402220650001602264650001502280650004102295650001802336650001402354650001702368650001902385650003302404650001102437650001402448653002102462653001402483653002002497653002202517653001302539700002102552700002202573700002402595700001802619700002402637700001902661700002002680700001902700700005802719700002202777700002502799773011902824856008802943852000903031655001203040IND60697774620221120215839.0201023e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069777462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1398662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherer, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3031-456410aComparative assessment of microplastics in water and sediment of a large European river  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAquatic ecosystems are globally contaminated with microplastics (MP). However, comparative data on MP levels in freshwater systems is still scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study is to quantify MP abundance in water and sediment of the German river Elbe using visual, spectroscopic (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) and thermo analytical (pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry) methods. Samples from eleven German sites along the German part of the Elbe were collected, both in the water and sediment phase, in order to better understand MP sinks and transport mechanisms. MP concentrations differed between the water and sediment phase. Sediment concentrations (mean: 3,350,000 particles m⁻³, 125–5000 μm MP) were in average 600,000-fold higher than water concentrations (mean: 5.57 particles m⁻³, 150–5000 μm MP). The abundance varied between the sampling sites: In sediments, the abundance decreased in the course of the river while in water samples no such clear trend was observed. This may be explained by a barrage retaining sediments and limiting tidal influence in the upstream parts of the river. Particle shape differed site-specifically with one site having exceptionally high quantities of spheres, most probably due to industrial emissions of PS-DVB resin beads. Suspended MP consisted predominantly of polyethylene and polypropylene whereas sediments contained a higher diversity of polymer types. Determined MP concentrations correspond well to previous results from other European rivers. In a global context, MP levels in the Elbe relate to the lower (water) to middle section (sediment) of the global range of MP concentrations determined for rivers worldwide. This highlights that elevated MP levels are not only found in single countries or continents, but that MP pollution is an issue of global concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aenvironment 3afreshwater 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3apyrolysis gas chromatography 3arivers 3asediments 0aPlastic polymers 0aAbundance 0aVisual analysis 0aPyrolysis GC–MS 0aATR-FTIR1 aWeber, Annkatrin1 aStock, Friederike1 aVurusic, Sebastijan1 aEgerci, Harun1 aKochleus, Christian1 aArendt, Niklas1 aFoeldi, Corinna1 aDierkes, Georg1 aWagner, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4402-32341 aBrennholt, Nicole1 aReifferscheid, Georg0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 738 p.139866-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1398663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007000140245010400210500002000314520250800334592002802842650002102870650001202891650002402903650002402927650001402951650001002965650001802975700002102993700002903014773013503043856007403178852000903252655001203261IND60672472920221119233933.0191016e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067247292DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.131822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakayode, Olugbenga Abiola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7936-452210aSize characterization of moringa (Moringa oleifera) seeds and optimization of the dehulling process  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe size of moringa seeds was characterized, and the dehulling process parameters were optimized. The effects of moisture content, feed rate, operational speed, and beater‐drum clearance on dehulling efficiency were studied. A 4 × 5 central composite rotatable design was employed, and multiple linear regression was utilized for analyzing data at 5% significant level. Experimental results were used to validate predicted optimum conditions. Processing parameters were related to dehulling efficiency using developed mathematical models. Maximum dehulling efficiencies of 81.14, 85.66, and 96.03% were obtained for the small, medium, and big sizes respectively. The moringa seed size and other processing factors were found to have significant effect on the dehulling efficiency. Predicted optimum values of 83.62, 88.18, and 99.69% for small‐, medium‐, and big‐sized categories, respectively, were obtained at 9.38%wet basis moisture content, 1.35 kg/min feed rate, 844.61 rpm dehulling speed, and 6.38 mm beater‐drum clearance. The experimental values were 84.33, 88.97, and 99.76% for small‐, medium‐, and big‐sized categories, respectively, under the optimal conditions. Variations between values obtained experimentally and predicted were negligible and statistically insignificant; therefore, the selected models were adjudged to adequately predict the dehulling efficiencies for all the size categories. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Despite the benefits derived from moringa seeds, dehulling of the seeds has been a tedious operation. Considering this, a moringa dehuller was developed, and the performance was evaluated. However, for an efficient system, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of the various important factors influencing the dehulling process and their interactions. The approach of considering one factor per time consumes time and is unrealistic to obtain the right optimal conditions; making it impractical to optimize the dehulling process using such approach. Considering this, RSM was employed to optimize the moringa dehulling process parameters. Mathematical models were developed to predict responses during the dehulling process using RSM. For efficient machine performance, the seeds were graded into various sizes and the effects of moisture content, feed rate, operational speed, and beater‐drum clearance on the dehulling efficiency were investigated and optimized. Results obtained in the study would be useful to moringa seed processors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3ahulling 3amathematical models 3aregression analysis 3aseed size 3aseeds 3awater content1 aAkpan, David Eyo1 aOjoawo, Olayemi Olubunmi0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2019 Oct., v. 42, no. 6 p.e13182-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.131823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245014100217300001600358520121000374592002801584650001201612650001401624650001201638650002201650650001001672650003101682650001301713650001901726650001201745650001301757650001301770650003001783650001301813653002001826653002501846653002501871653003101896653002501927653000901952653000901961653000701970653000801977653000801985700002401993700002502017700002502042700002002067700002502087700002602112700002802138700002202166700002302188700002202211700002502233773009002258856008502348852000902433655001202442IND60661585020221118070742.0190923e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066158502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitiushkina, Natalia V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0179-319110aComparative analysis of expression of mutant and wild-type alleles is essential for reliable PCR-based detection of MET exon 14 skipping  ap. 267-274.  aMET exon 14 skipping (exon 14Δ) mutations are associated with tumor sensitivity to a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, however clinical testing for MET gene status remains complicated. We developed a simple allele-specific PCR cDNA-based test, which allowed for the identification of MET exon 14Δ allele in 35 (2.5%) out of 1415 EGFR mutation–negative lung carcinomas (LCs). MET exon 14Δ was significantly associated with elderly age and non-smoking status of the patients. A total of 34 (97%) out of 35 tumors carrying MET exon 14Δ showed preferential expression of the mutated allele; this imbalance was attributed to the down-regulation of the expression of the wild-type gene copy. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of genomic exon 14 splice site mutations in 24/35 (68.6%) cases, which showed MET exon 14 skipping by PCR. In addition to LCs described above, some carcinomas demonstrated low-abundance MET exon 14Δ-specific signal. Low-level expression of MET exon 14Δ allele may potentially compromise the results of allele-specific PCR-based tests, therefore comparison of the level of expression of mutated and normal alleles is essential for the reliability of MET gene testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3acarcinoma 3aelderly 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aexons 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3alung neoplasms 3amutants 3amutation 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atyrosine 0aLung carcinomas 0aMET exon 14 mutation 0aSplice site mutation 0aAllele-specific expression 0aAlternative splicing 0aAdCa 0acDNA 0aLC 0aLOH 0aPCR1 aKholmatov, Maxim M.1 aTiurin, Vladislav I.1 aRomanko, Alexandr A.1 aYatsuk, Olga S.1 aSokolova, Tatiana N.1 aIvantsov, Alexandr O.1 aKuligina, Ekatherina Sh1 aStepanov, Ilya A.1 aBelyaev, Alexey M.1 aTogo, Alexandr V.1 aImyanitov, Evgeny N.0 tBiochimie.g2019 Oct., v. 165 p.267-274dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245013700162520142100299592002801720650000801748650001501756650001101771650001301782650001801795650002001813650001601833653002001849653003101869653001701900653001401917653002701931700001601958700001501974700001501989700001902004700001602023700001702039700001702056773009002073856008502163852000902248655001202257IND60756510320221118195107.0220328e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075651032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1225742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Fan10aExperimental investigation on co-firing residual char and pulverized coal under MILD combustion using low-temperature preheating air  aCo-firing residual char and pulverized coal can apply the residual char in pulverized coal combustion equipment, whose difficulties lie in poor ignition performance and low burnout efficiency. For the first time, residual char and bituminous coal fuel blend is experimentally co-fired under moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) conditions. MILD co-combustion is achieved with low-temperature preheating air in a pilot-scale furnace. The co-firing experiments include swirl low-NO flame combustion, MILD combustion through symmetrical secondary air jets, and MILD combustion through an asymmetrical secondary air jet. The pilot-scale tests reveal that MILD co-combustion through the asymmetrical single nozzle achieves the lowest peak temperature and the most uniform distributions of temperature, heat flux, and gas compositions in the furnace. The NO emission of MILD co-combustion through the asymmetrical air jet is decreased by 57% compared with swirl low-NO flame co-combustion. The burnout rate of MILD co-combustion through the asymmetrical air jet reaches 94%. Considering more uniform in-furnace distribution, lower NO emission, and higher burnout rate, MILD combustion through the asymmetrical single nozzle shows more obvious advantages than that through symmetrical air nozzles. Overall, the present study further widens the fuel flexibility of MILD combustion even to residual char fuel blend.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion 3aenergy 3afurnaces 3aheat transfer 3apulverized coal 3atemperature 0aMILD combustion 0aLow-temperature preheating 0aNO emissions 0aCo-firing 0aPilot-scale experiment1 aLi, Pengfei1 aZhang, Tai1 aZu, Daohua1 aCheng, Pengfei1 aLiu, Yaowei1 aMi, Jianchun1 aLiu, Zhaohui0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122574-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1225743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012100177300001600298520162400314592002801938650002301966650002401989650001702013650002102030650001502051650001602066650002802082650001302110650001002123650002002133650002302153650001402176650001802190650002402208650001102232650001202243650001402255650001502269650001402284653001602298653001202314653000702326653002302333653001302356653000902369700003102378700001802409700002002427700002302447773009002470856008502560852000902645655001202654IND60661585120221118070730.0191024e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066158512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrewal, Jaspreet Singh10aEvaluation of clan CD C11 peptidase PNT1 and other Leishmania mexicana cysteine peptidases as potential drug targets  ap. 150-160.  aLeishmania mexicana is one of the causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans. There is an urgent need to identify new drug targets to combat the disease. Cysteine peptidases play crucial role in pathogenicity and virulence in Leishmania spp. and are promising targets for developing new anti-leishmanial drugs. Genetic drug target validation has been performed on a number of cysteine peptidases, but others have yet to be characterized. We targeted 16 L. mexicana cysteine peptidases for gene deletion and tagging using CRISPR-Cas9 in order to identify essential genes and ascertain their cellular localization. Our analysis indicates that two clan CA, family C2 calpains (LmCAL27.1, LmCAL31.6) and clan CD, family C11 PNT1 are essential for survival in the promastigote stage. The other peptidases analysed, namely calpains LmCAL4.1, LmCAL25.1, and members of clan CA C51, C78, C85 and clan CP C97 were found to be non-essential. We generated a gene deletion mutant (Δpnt1) which was severely compromised in its cell growth and a conditional gene deletion mutant of PNT1 (Δpnt1: PNT1flox/Δ pnt1:HYG [SSU DiCRE]). PNT1 localizes to distinct foci on the flagellum and on the surface of the parasite. The conditional gene deletion of PNT1 induced blebs and pits on the cell surface and eventual cell death. Over-expression of PNT1, but not an active site mutant PNT1C134A, was lethal, suggesting that active PNT1 peptidase is required for parasite survival. Overall, our data suggests that PNT1 is an essential gene and one of a number of cysteine peptidases that are potential drug targets in Leishmania.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aLeishmania mexicana 3aactive sites 3aantileishmanials 3acell death 3acell growth 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3acysteine 3adrugs 3aessential genes 3aetiological agents 3aflagellum 3agene deletion 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3amutants 3aparasites 3apeptidases 3avirulence 0aCRISPR-Cas9 0aU6SnRNA 0aT7 0aCysteine peptidase 0aParasite 0aPNT11 aCatta-Preta, Carolina M.C.1 aBrown, Elaine1 aAnand, Jayanthi1 aMottram, Jeremy C.0 tBiochimie.g2019 Nov., v. 166 p.150-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010700168500001400275520127000289592002801559650002501587650001601612650001701628650001201645650001801657650002801675650001101703650001501714650001701729650003201746650001301778650001501791650001701806650001701823650001501840651001101855651001801866700003001884700002001914700002601934700002301960773013401983856008302117852000902200655001202209IND60721526020221119112621.0201224e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072152602DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101206402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeni, Dumitru 10aSilphium perfoliatum—A Herbaceous Crop with Increased Interest in Recent Years for Multi-Purpose Use  aNAL-light  aSilphium perfoliatum is a perennial crop native to North America that has been the subject of increased scientific interest in recent years, especially in Europe. It is drought- and frost-resistant, which makes it suitable for cultivation in Europe on marginal lands that are not used for growing other crops. This review analyzed the distribution and purposes of the cultivation of Silphium perfoliatum worldwide, as well as its biomass yields and characteristics as a feedstock for biogas production and other purposes. A total of 121 scientific publications on Silphium perfoliatum were identified, with the highest number (20 papers) published in 2019. It was found that higher biomass yields can be obtained at higher precipitation levels, with the use of fertilizers and an adequate type of plantation. The mean dry matter yield of Silphium perfoliatum was 13.3 Mg ha⁻¹ DM (dry matter), and it ranged from 2 to over 32 Mg ha⁻¹ DM. In some countries, Silphium is used as a forage crop mainly due to its high crude protein content (from 4.9% to 15% DM), depending on the vegetation phase. Silphium perfoliatum is a promising perennial crop in terms of energy and other benefits for biodiversity, soil quality and applications in medicine and pharmacology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilphium perfoliatum 3aagriculture 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3acrude protein 3adry matter accumulation 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3aforage crops 3agas production (biological) 3amedicine 3aperennials 3apharmacology 3asoil quality 3avegetation 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aStolarski, Mariusz  Jerzy1 aBordiean, Anna 1 aKrzyżaniak, Michał,1 aDębowski, Marcin 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Dec. 16, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101206403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245007600175520132800251592002801579650001901607650002401626650001901650650001501669653001701684653001901701653002201720653002001742653001401762700006301776700005801839700006101897700006301958773009002021856008502111852000902196655001202205IND60756510420221118195115.0220328e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075651042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1225752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelaziz, Khaled R.10aPerformance improvement of a Savonius turbine by using auxiliary blades  aRenewable energy sources have proved their importance on a global scale as an optimum alternative for fossil fuels. Wind energy is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy due to its availability. Savonius turbine is considered one of the best vertical axis wind turbines for converting the kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy at low wind speeds. The current work investigates the enhancement in the performance of conventional Savonius turbines using two configurations of auxiliary blades that are employed to enhance flow characteristics in the overlap region. The performance of the Savonius turbine, fitted with auxiliary blades, is compared with a newly developed turbine where the gap ratio is studied. The numerical simulation is carried out by solving unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes equations (URANS) using ANSYS fluent package. SST k-ω turbulence model is used to resolve the flow characteristics through the turbine, and it is validated and verified using previous experimental and numerical works. The current investigation results proved that the best power coefficient of the Savonius turbine augmented with curved and straight auxiliary blades increased by 8.4% and 9%, respectively. For the newly developed turbine, the optimum power coefficient increased by 13.6%.  aPublisher supplied data 3akinetic energy 3amathematical models 3aturbulent flow 3awind power 0aWind turbine 0aSavonius rotor 0aConventional type 0aAuxiliary blade 0aGap ratio1 aNawar, Mohamed A.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8157-154X1 aRamadan, Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6229-80071 aAttai, Youssef A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7883-97441 aMohamed, Mohamed H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8609-150X0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122575-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1225753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245011700171300001800288520139400306592002801700650001701728650001201745650001201757650002001769650001801789650001201807650002201819650002301841650001501864650004301879650001101922650001901933700002801952700002701980700002802007773012502035856007402160852000902234655001202243IND60747060620221118071949.0210811e20210802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074706062DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo03230a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres Dominguez, Edwin A.10aMolecular mechanisms from insulin-mimetic effect of vitamin D: treatment alternative in Type 2 diabetes mellitus  ap. 6682-6690.  aDiabetes mellitus is a complex and multifactorial disease with a global prevalence that exceeds 425 million people. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by a state of insulin resistance, which leads to metabolic alterations that aggravate the state of health of people. Vitamin D deficiency appears to play an important role in the triggering mechanisms of insulin resistance. In this review, an analysis is made of the biochemical mechanisms associated with the insulin-mimetic effect of vitamin D, its supplementation being a possible nutritional strategy for the T2DM treatment. The current scientific evidence is extensive regarding the dose of vitamin D used for an insulin-mimetic effect. However, clinical trials and systematic reviews show statistical differences on glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin levels of patients with T2DM, associated with activation mechanisms of transcription factors related to genes of the glucide metabolism and the insulin receptor, and the regulation of intracellular Ca²⁺ insulin concentrations. Likewise, an indirect mechanism associated with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects has been shown that also leads to sensitivity to the insulin receptor. The use of a specific dose of vitamin D could be an effective alternative in the T2DM treatment, which would reduce the risk of complications derived from hyperglycemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acalcium 3aglucose 3aglycohemoglobin 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptors 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apeople 3arisk reduction1 aMeza Peñafiel, Abigail1 aGómez Pedraza, Arturo1 aMartínez Leo, Edwin E.0 tFood & function.g2021 Aug. 2, v. 12, no. 15 p.6682-6690dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo03230a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006100137245012700198300001800325500001900343500001100362520175800373592002802131596005802159650001902217650001902236650001502255650000902270650001402279650001802293650002902311650002502340650002202365650002402387650002002411650000902431650002002440651001102460700005602471700002002527773012602547856007102673852000902744655001202753IND60738373720221119221809.0210524e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073837372DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.62872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArpaia, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0455-304310aBiosafety of bee pollinators in genetically modified agro‐ecosystems: Current approach and further development in the EU  ap. 2659-2666.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aBee pollinators are an important guild delivering a fundamental input to European agriculture due to the ecological service they provide to crops in addition to the direct economic revenues from apiculture. Bee populations are declining in Europe as a result of the effects of several environmental stressors, both natural and of anthropic origin. Efforts are ongoing in the European Union (EU) to improve monitoring and management of pollinator populations to arrest further declines. Genetically modified (GM) crops are currently cultivated in a limited area in Europe, and an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is required prior to their authorization for cultivation. The possible impacts of GM crops on pollinators are deemed relevant for the ERA. Existing ecotoxicological studies indicate that traits currently expressed in insect‐resistant GM plants are unlikely to represent a risk for pollinators. However, new mechanisms of insect resistance are being introduced into GM plants, including novel combinations of Cry toxins and double strand RNA (dsRNA), and an ERA is required to consider lethal and sublethal effects of these new products on nontarget species, including insect pollinators. The evaluation of indirect effects linked to the changes in management practices (e.g. for herbicide‐tolerant GM crops) is an important component of EU regulations and a requirement for ERA. This paper reviews current approaches used to test the sensitivity of pollinators to GM plants and their products to determine whether sufficient data are being provided on novel GM plants to satisfy EU risk assessment requirements. © 2021 The Authors.

J. Biol. Macromol. 102 (2017) 425–430). However, rifampicin contains a p-diphenol group and compounds with such a moiety have been shown before to reduce tyrosinase-generated o-quinones. Rifampicin also shows strong absorption in a region completely overlapping with the visible absorption band of dopachrome, the oxidation product of L-tyrosine and L-dopa, whose concentration is measured spectrophotometrically in the standard enzymatic assay to monitor the activity of tyrosinase. We have demonstrated that rifampicin is also rapidly oxidized by o-quinones generated from catechols by tyrosinase or by treatment with sodium periodate. Smaller changes of absorbance at 475 nm during oxidation of L-dopa by tyrosinase in the presence of rifampicin do not result from enzyme inhibition but from oxidation of rifampicin by dopaquinone, which leads to rapid decrease of rifampicin absorption in this range. The actual reaction rates are not affected, which we have demonstrated by measurements of oxygen consumption. Rifampicin behaves therefore as other compounds with reducing properties, such as ascorbic acid, hydroquinone, hydrazine derivatives, and flavonoids, some of which have also been incorrectly described before as inhibitors of tyrosinase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aL-dopa 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aascorbic acid 3aenzyme inhibition 3aflavonoids 3ahydrazine 3ahydroquinone 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3aoxygen consumption 3aquinones 3arifampicin 3asodium 3atyrosine 0aRifampicin 0aTyrosinase 0ap-Diphenol1 aWojtasek, Hubert0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 216 p.830-835dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.2173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245010100136300001600237520099200253592002801245650001201273650001901285650001901304650001201323650002401335650001601359651002101375651001001396653002001406653000801426653000801434653003301442653001901475700002001494773012501514852000901639655001201648IND60738448420221120144628.0210524e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073844842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Syed Rouhullah10aBias correction of climate model outputs for climate change impact assessment in Central Kashmir  ap. 281-286.  aThe impacts of climate change are often quantified by impact models whereas impact models typically require high resolution unbiased input data, global and regional climate models are in general biased, their resolution is often lower than desired. Thus, many users of climate model data apply some form of bias correction and downscaling. In this study two correction functions using two methods viz. modified difference approach and linear scaling method were applied for local bias correction of maximum temperature (T max), minimum temperature min) and precipitation data at monthly scales and validated to minimize the bias between the modelled (HAD GEM2-ES-GCM) and observed climate data for the Central Kashmir of great Himalayas. Correction functions derived using linear scaling method at monthly time scale for T max , min and precipitation were found to be better than modified difference approach for bias correction of the climate data to bring it to close to observed data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aecology 3ameteorological data 3atemperature 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aBias correction 0aGCM 0aRCM 0aModified difference approach 0aLinear scaling1 aKhan, Junaid N.0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.281-286dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245011200212300001600324520066000340592002801000650002801028650002801056650002001084700002401104700006301128773008601191856008501277852000901362655001201371IND60630112220221120044539.0190502e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063011222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatos, Miguel A.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7989-757510aApplication of machine learning to predict the multiaxial strain-sensing response of CNT-polymer composites  ap. 265-275.  aWe present predictive multiscale models of the multiaxial strain-sensing response of conductive CNT-polymer composites.

Overwintering TRW and TTW adults can continue to damage A. altissima trees and reproduce after they emerge from the soil each year. There is a lack of studies regarding the development of control measures during the overwintering period. A polyethylene terephthalate bottle trap (PETBT) and corrugated paper box trap (CPBT) were evaluated for their ability to trap TRW and TTW adults descending from trees to overwinter in the soil in Wutongshu and Shabatou locations in Ningxia, China. RESULTS: Significantly more overwintering TRW adults were caught by the PETBT than the CPBT. There were no significant differences in the TTW captures in PETBT when compared to the CPBT. Both PETBT and CPBT have little effect on trapping overwintering TTW adults. Further trapping studies showed that PETBT treatments significantly reduced overwintering TRW numbers caught in population monitoring trap nets placed on the A. altissima tree trunks (an average annual reduction of 42% than the untreated trees). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that PETBT is effective for trapping overwintering TRW adults. PETBT could be recommended as an alternative for managing TRW in the framework of integrated pest management. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a201304412cForestry Scientific Research in the Public Interest  a31770691cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFC1200400cNational Key R & D Program of China 3aAilanthus altissima 3aCurculionidae 3aintegrated pest management 3aoverwintering 3apaper 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3asoil 3atrees 3aChina1 aWen, Junbao0 tPest management science.g2021 June, v. 77, no. 6 p.2766-2772dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.63053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245010900178500001900287520167900306592002801985650002602013650001602039650001502055650001102070650001602081650000902097650001102106650001502117650002602132650001602158653001402174653002602188653001302214653001902227653000802246653000802254653000802262653000802270653000902278653001002287653001302297653000802310700001902318700002402337773010702361856008702468852000902555655001202564IND60715059520221122194303.0210305e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071505952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1180132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElessa Etuman, Arthur10aOLYMPUS: An emission model to connect urban form, individual practices and atmospheric pollutant release  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAt a time when many cities are rethinking their development and urban planning policies in order to cope with new economic, societal and environmental paradigms, the question arises as to which public policies should be favored in order to achieve current and future air quality objectives. Decision support for urban air pollution control can no longer rely solely on improved technologies, but must propose new modelling approaches that integrate urban organization, the individual and energy consumption practices. In this paper, we present the operating principles of the OLYMPUS model and discuss the results obtained during its implementation in two distinct territories. OLYMPUS is an activity-based model that - for a given urban organization - simulates the gaseous and particulate emissions related to the energy consumption of individuals for their mobility, combustion from residential heating, domestic activities and commercial building heating. The very heart of the simulation is to define, prioritize and spatialize the daily mobility of individuals, as well as to define the energy demand per building. The results are presented here for Ile-de-France - a dense metropolis highly served by public transport, housing 12 million inhabitants - and the Pays de la Loire - a polycentric urban area organized around medium-sized towns within a highly rural space. By implementing OLYMPUS on these two different territories, we demonstrate the very good transposability of the tool. In parallel, we propose a discussion of the parameters that most constrain the emissions in the model, and the opportunities for innovative scenarios dedicated to decision support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution control 3aair quality 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aheat 3amodels 3apollutants 3apublic transportation 3aurban areas 0aEmissions 0aAgent-based modelling 0aMobility 0aRoad transport 0aIdF 0aNOx 0aNO2 0aPDL 0aPM10 0aPM2.5 0aPPM fine 0aVOC1 aColl, Isabelle1 aRivera Salas, Virna0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 245 p.118013-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1180133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009500161300001800256520109700274592002801371650001501399650001601414650001601430650001901446650001001465650001601475650001901491650001801510650001801528651001301546700001701559700002301576700001701599700001501616773012101631856004801752852000901800655001201809IND50087938220221119212240.0140412e20110620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008793822DNAL7 a10.1080/014311610037475132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotes, M.10aRemote sensing of water quality parameters over Alqueva Reservoir in the south of Portugal  ap. 3373-3388.  aIn this study, the potential of MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) to describe variations of optically active substances over Alqueva artificial lake is investigated. Limnological laboratory analyses of the water samples collected monthly, from 2003 to 2006, are used in combination with MERIS. The water surface spectral reflectance is derived from Level1b MERIS data, using radiative transfer calculations to account for the atmospheric effects. The lake water spectral surface reflectance is combined with laboratory analyses of cyanobacteria total densities as well as chlorophyll a concentrations and empirical algorithms for both quantities are derived. The results obtained are compared with independent laboratory analyses from 2007, with good correlation coefficients obtained both for cyanobacteria (R = 0.93) and chlorophyll a(R = 0.80). The methodology proposed here has been developed to inexpensively monitor Alqueva Reservoir water quality in terms of cyanobacteria and chlorophyll a on a regular basis, and to provide useful information to the authorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3aimage analysis 3alakes 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3awater quality 3aPortugal1 aCosta, M.

Treatments consisted of dicamba (5.6 g a.e. ha⁻¹) plus glyphosate (8.7 g a.e. ha⁻¹) applied to soybean at R1 using 140, 105, 70, 35, 14, or 7 L ha⁻¹. Each carrier volume was applied with TT11002 and XR110015 nozzles which resulted in Fine and Coarse spray qualities, respectively. A colorimetric dye was included in spray solutions to quantify spray coverage of each treatment. RESULTS: Spray coverage decreased with carrier volume and ranged from 21% to 3%. Conversely, soybean injury increased as carrier volume decreased. Soybean height 14 days after treatment (DAT) was reduced 34% to 37% from carrier volumes of 70 to 140 L ha⁻¹; however, carrier volumes of 14 and 7 L ha⁻¹ resulted in 45% height reductions. By 28 DAT soybean height was similar among volumes of 35 to 140 L ha⁻¹ (39% to 42% reduction); however, volumes of 14 and 7 L ha⁻¹ resulted in 46% and 51% reductions, respectively. Grain yield was reduced 14% from treatment at 140 L ha⁻¹ and reductions increased with decreased carrier volume to 41% loss at 7 L ha⁻¹. Averaged across carrier volumes, Fine and Coarse sprays caused 30% and 26% yield loss, respectively. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that carrier volume profoundly affects soybean response to dicamba. Therefore, soybean response to sublethal dicamba doses applied at a constant carrier volume may not reflect physical drift exposure. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a230090cHatch project  cUS Department of Agriculture  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3acolorimetry 3adicamba 3adyes 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3agrain yield 3asoybeans 3aspray coverage 3aMississippi1 aCalhoun, Justin S1 aFerguson, Jason C1 aKruger, Greg R1 aBond, Jason A1 aJohnson, Ashli B1 aReynolds, Daniel B.,0 tPest management science.g2021 June, v. 77, no. 6 p.2719-2725dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.63003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006900153245011600222500001500338520179700353592002802150650001002178650002902188650001702217650001102234650002602245650001702271650002102288650001502309650002002324650002602344650001602370650002502386650001302411650001402424650001902438650001502457650001102472650001102483650002002494650001902514650002002533651001102553653002102564653001902585653002202604700003902626700007002665700002502735773011902760856008802879852000902967655001202976IND60697775120221120225546.0201023e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069777512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1398782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Carvalho, Débora Reis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8997-214510aTrophic diversity and carbon sources supporting fish communities along a pollution gradient in a tropical river  agolden set  aAnthropogenic activities can have a great influence on water quality and in the availability of habitat and food resources, which can promote changes in the trophic diversity and carbon sources sustaining aquatic communities. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the trophic diversity and the main carbon sources sustaining fish communities change along a pollution gradient. The study was carried out at eight sites distributed along the Rio das Velhas, a Brazilian river highly impacted by anthropogenic activities, in which the discharge of domestic and industrial sewage from the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH) presents a major source of pollution. Using carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) isotope ratios, we identified the major carbon sources/food sources of common fish species and calculated six metrics of trophic diversity. Autochthonous primary producers (algae, periphyton, and macrophytes) were the main carbon sources for all trophic guilds at all sites, but notably, sewage-derived organic matter was an additional significant carbon source to the fish community in the most polluted testing site. Here, the community was composed mainly by detritivorous and omnivorous fishes and exhibited greater ranges of carbon and nitrogen isotopic values, large total areas, high trophic diversity, small trophic redundancy, and less even distribution of trophic niches than the less polluted sites. We conclude that the trophic guilds, trophic diversity metrics, and carbon sources sustaining fish communities in the Rio das Velhas are highly influenced by the presence of pollution. Besides favoring omnivorous and detritivorous fishes, the input of sewage also provided an important food source to sustain the fish community from sites close to the MRBH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adetritivores 3afish communities 3afood chain 3afreshwater fish 3aindustrial wastewater 3amacrophytes 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3aomnivores 3aorganic matter 3aperiphyton 3arivers 3asewage 3astable isotopes 3atrophic levels 3awater pollution 3aBrazil 0aStables isotopes 0aRio das Velhas 0aAquatic pollution1 aAlves, Carlos Bernardo Mascarenhas1 aMoreira, Marcelo Zacharias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6769-55701 aPompeu, Paulo Santos0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 738 p.139878-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1398783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245016600162300001800328520100400346592002801350650000801378650001301386650001501399700001501414773012101429856004801550852000901598655001201607IND50087938320221119212045.0140412e20110620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008793832DNAL7 a10.1080/014311610037494282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomita, H.10aSampling error of daily mean surface wind speed and air specific humidity due to Sun-synchronous satellite sampling and its reduction by multi-satellite sampling  ap. 3389-3404.  aTo quantify the sampling error of wind speed (W) and the surface air specific humidity (Qₐ) resulting from Sun-synchronous polar-orbit satellite sampling and the effect of single- and multi-satellite sampling, we compared satellite-simulated data with true daily mean data using buoy data. True daily mean data were obtained by averaging buoy data at all available times over 24 h, while satellite-simulated data were the averages of buoy data sampled at satellite passing times (once or twice each day). The difference between true and satellite-simulated data was defined as the sampling error. The sampling error of the daily mean data of W and Qₐ depends considerably on the satellite observation time and location. Although the sampling error is fairly reduced if multi-satellite sampling is employed, a noticeable sampling error remains in some cases if a wrong sampling combination is employed. Therefore, multi-satellite data should be carefully used to obtain more accurate global data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ahumidity 3awind speed1 aKubota, M.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2011 June 20, v. 32, no. 12 p.3389-3404dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161003749428  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011100158300001600269500001400285500002000299520131900319592002801638596007901666596009801745650001201843650002301855650000901878650003401887650001801921650001501939650000901954650003001963650001501993650002102008650001002029650001202039650001902051650001802070700001102088700002002099700001402119700001702133700001802150700001302168700001602181700001402197700001502211700001902226700001502245700001702260773012402277856007302401852000902474655001202483IND60718286820221122032926.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071828682DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.131802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yinchao10aCombined linkage mapping and association analysis reveals genetic control of maize kernel moisture content  ap. 508-518.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe free moisture in crop kernels after being naturally dried is referred to as kernel moisture content (KMC). Maize KMC reflects grain quality and influences transportation and storage of seeds. We used an IBM Syn10 DH maize population consisting of 249 lines and an association panel comprising 310 maize inbred lines to identify the genetic loci affecting maize KMC in three environments. Using the IBM population detected 13 QTL on seven chromosomes, which were clustered into nine common QTL. Genome‐wide association analysis (GWAS) identified 16 significant SNPs across the 3 environments, which were linked to 158 genes across the three environments. Combined QTL mapping and GWAS found two SNPs that were located in two of the mapped QTL, respectively. Twenty‐three genes were linked with the loci co‐localized in both populations. Of these 181 genes, five have previously been reported to be associated with KMC or to regulate seed development. These associations were verified by candidate gene association analysis. Two superior alleles and one favorable haplotype for Zm00001d007774 and Zm00001d047868 were found to influence KMC. These findings provide insights into molecular mechanisms underlying maize KMC and contribute to the use of marker‐assisted selection for breeding low‐KMC maize.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016ZX08003003cMajor Project of China on New Varieties of GMO Cultivation  a2018JY0170cScience and Technology Research Program of Sichuan Municipal Education Commission 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acorn 3agenome-wide association study 3agrain quality 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3apopulation 3aseed development 3aseeds 3astorage 3atransportation 3awater content1 aHu, Yu1 aGuan, Zhongrong1 aLiu, Peng1 aHe, Yongcong1 aZou, Chaoying1 aLi, Peng1 aGao, Shibin1 aPeng, Hua1 aYang, Cong1 aPan, Guangtang1 aShen, Yaou1 aMa, Langlang0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 Dec., v. 170, no. 4 p.508-518dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011300159300001800272520126000290592002801550650002601578650001901604650001301623650002301636650001801659650002101677650001501698650002001713650001601733650001701749650001701766650001901783650001801802650002801820650001901848650001401867650001701881650001101898650001201909650001401921700001401935700001501949700001801964700001601982700001701998700001602015773012102031856007402152852000902226655001202235IND60667051120221121092610.0190919e20141218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066705112DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra12678e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Qingjian10aNear-infrared light-controlled drug release and cancer therapy with polymer-caged upconversion nanoparticles  ap. 5269-5276.  aHerein, a core–shell nanocomposite was fabricated by self-assembly of the photo-responsive copolymer with silica-coated upconversion nanoparticles for near-infrared light-controlled drug release and cancer therapy. Firstly, lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) co-doped with Yb³⁺ and Tm³⁺ were encapsulated with mesoporous silica as the core (MUCNPs). Then a folate conjugated light-responsive copolymer (PSMN-FA) was synthesized and coated on MUCNP as the shell via self-assembly. Anti-cancer drugs could be loaded into the mesopores of the silica layer before polymer coating. Upon near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation at 980 nm, the caged UCNPs emitted luminescence in the UV region, which could change the structure of the amphiphilic copolymer and separate it from the MUCNPs, immediately followed by the release of the pre-loaded drugs to the targeted cancer cells. Our model experiments in vitro verified that the nanocarrier MUCNPs@C18@PSMN-FAcan provide active tumor targeting to folate receptor over-expressed (FR+) tumor cells. Both in vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to evaluate the NIR-controlled drug release strategy and the promising application in anticancer therapy based on the polymer-UCNPs nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3acancer therapy 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3aencapsulation 3afolate receptors 3afolic acid 3ain vivo studies 3airradiation 3aluminescence 3ananocarriers 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anear infrared radiation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aporous media 3asilica 3athulium 3aytterbium1 aLi, Najun1 aJiao, Yang1 aChen, Dongyun1 aXu, Jiaying1 aXu, Qingfeng1 aLu, Jianmei0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 18, v. 5, no. 7 p.5269-5276dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra12678e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012000171520195300291592002802244650001302272650001202285650001302297650001902310650001002329650000902339650001602348650001302364650001502377650001102392650002602403650001902429653001602448653002402464653004202488653004002530653002502570653001502595653001802610700002402628773010202652856008702754852000902841655001202850IND60783759820221121060718.0220906e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078375982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1063512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukanya, Patra10aCloud radar perspective on tropical warm clouds associated with summer monsoon rainfall and warm rain onset process  aThe role of warm clouds in monsoon rainfall and the warm rain onset process are investigated using high-resolution cloud-sensitive radar measurements. Quality controlled data from Ka-band radar consisting of 1.8 million profiles during July–August 2015, have been explored. A method is devised using the Zₑ profiles, for identifying warm clouds whose cloud tops are confined below 5.3 km. Warm rain microphysical parameters are examined utilizing the complemented measurements from Disdrometer, rain gauge, and CloudSat data. The strong temperature inversion of 2 to 4 K km⁻¹ at 3 km explained the generation of shallow warm clouds. Strong low-level updraft and subsidence above the warm clouds are also evident. Contoured frequency by altitude diagram infers that 75% of Zₑ (velocity) dominates at −20 dBZₑ (−1 m s⁻¹). Simultaneous Disdrometer measurements revealed 78% of cases with zero-drop count and zero rain rates. The dominating non-precipitating characteristics of warm clouds are also confirmed from the CloudSat inferred cloud droplet effective radius below 10 μm. During the rainy episodes, peak at 0.91 mm in the drop size distribution suggests prominence of drizzle-sized drops. The precipitation caused by warm clouds accounts for a small fraction (28%) of the total rainfall. The warm rain onset process involving the transformation of smaller cloud droplets into big raindrops is investigated using the radar's three lower-order moments. Before cloud droplet to raindrop transition an intense spike in the spectral width (SW) is observed for a brief period in 98% of the cases. Therefore, SW, which infers turbulence, triggers the collision-coalescence of cloud droplets to form raindrops. This study provides a multi-observation-based perspective on the macro- and micro-physical characteristics of monsoon warm clouds and the onset of warm rain for a better representation in the global climate models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3adroplets 3amonsoon season 3aradar 3arain 3arain gauges 3aresearch 3asubsidence 3asummer 3atemperature inversion 3aturbulent flow 0aCloud radar 0aMonsoon warm clouds 0aShallow cumulus and cumulus congestus 0aMacro- and microphysical properties 0aCloud droplet growth 0aTurbulence 0aOnset of rain1 aKalapureddy, M.C.R.0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 Nov., v. 278 p.106351-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1063513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007800158300001800236520206600254592002802320650001102348650002602359650002102385650001102406650002302417650001902440650001502459650002402474650001002498700001802508700001402526700001502540700001802555700001802573700001302591700001502604700001702619700001702636700001502653773013402668856007502802852000902877655001202886IND60778295820221119024748.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829582DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cs01092a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Simian10aLateral layered semiconductor multijunctions for novel electronic devices  ap. 4000-4022.  aLayered semiconductors, represented by transition metal dichalcogenides, have attached extensive attention due to their unique and tunable electrical and optical properties. In particular, lateral layered semiconductor multijunctions, including homojunctions, heterojunctions, hybrid junctions and superlattices, present a totally new degree of freedom in research on electronic devices beyond traditional materials and their structures, providing unique opportunities for the development of new structures and operation principle-based high performance devices. However, the advances in this field are limited by the precise synthesis of high-quality junctions and greatly hampered by ambiguous device performance limits. Herein, we review the recent key breakthroughs in the design, synthesis, electronic structure and property modulation of lateral semiconductor multijunctions and focus on their application-specific devices. Specifically, the synthesis methods based on different principles, such as chemical and external source-induced methods, are introduced stepwise for the controllable fabrication of semiconductor multijunctions as the basics of device application. Subsequently, their structure and property modulation are discussed, including control of their electronic structure, exciton dynamics and optical properties before the fabrication of lateral layered semiconductor multijunction devices. Precise property control will potentially result in outstanding device performances, including high-quality diodes and FETs, scalable logic and analog circuits, highly efficient optoelectronic devices, and unique electrochemical devices. Lastly, we focus on several of the most essential but unresolved debates in this field, such as the true advantages of few-layer vs. monolayer multijunctions, how sharp the interface should be for specific functional devices, and the superiority of lateral multijunctions over vertical multijunctions, highlighting the next-phase strategy to enhance the performance potential of lateral multijunction devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiodes 3aelectrical properties 3aelectrochemistry 3afields 3aoptical properties 3asemiconductors 3atechnology 3atransition elements 3awills1 aDeng, Xiaonan1 aWu, Yifei1 aWang, Yuqi1 aKe, Shengxian1 aZhang, Shishu1 aLiu, Kai1 aLv, Ruitao1 aLi, Zhengcao1 aXiong, Qihua1 aWang, Chen0 tChemical Society reviews.g2022 May 23, v. 51, no. 10 p.4000-4022dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cs01092a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009700166300001200263520147800275592002801753650003801781650001601819650001201835650001301847650001301860650001001873650002001883650001501903650001201918650001101930650002201941650002201963650000901985650001401994650002502008650001202033651001602045653003002061653003002091653004302121653002502164653003202189653003802221653004002259653003502299653003002334653004002364653004002404653002702444773011402471856008202585852000902667655001202676IND60516005820221120190308.0190805e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051600582DNAL7 a10.1017/S20786336130003372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabarles, J.C.10aPhenotypic cluster and diversity analysis of native chickens in Western Visayas, Philippines  ap. 1-9.  aWestern Visayas has largest population of native chickens in the Philippines; however, data on the phenotypic and genetic diversity is limited. Eight hundred and ten chickens from 270 different flocks, from six provinces within the region were chosen for characterization. Data collected includes farmer selection practices, means of identifying genetic groups and information on phenotypic traits of native chickens. This information was analysed using statistical tools suggested by FAO. Phenotypic diversity and equitability of distribution were analysed using Simpson's diversity index and equality of distribution. Results showed that native chicken genetic resources are comprised of two types, the Jolo and Bisaya; the latter was further divided into Bisaya–Cluster I and Bisaya–Cluster II. Jolo chickens were the heaviest (P < 0.01) but comparable with Bisaya–Cluster II in terms of egg weight, head shape and phenotypic distance. They all had higher diversity and equitability of distribution in their plumage colour and pattern, though the iris and shank colour had higher diversity but had limited distributions. Bisaya–Cluster II and Jolo chickens had higher diversity and above average distribution in liveweight. They were also homogenous in feather morphology and distribution; head and breast shape, and skeletal variants. Thus, the observed diversities and distributions can be used in identifying genetic materials for any breeding undertakings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3abody weight 3abreasts 3abreeding 3achickens 3acolor 3adata collection 3aegg weight 3afarmers 3aflocks 3agenetic resources 3agenetic variation 3ahead 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aplumage 3aPhilippines 0aPhilippine native chicken 0aSimpson's diversity index 0aSimpson's equitability of distribution 0aphenotypic diversity 0aPhilippine poulet indigène 0al'indice de diversité de Simpson 0aSimpson équité de la distribution 0ade la diversité phénotypique 0apollo nativo de Filipinas 0ael índice de diversidad de Simpson 0aequidad de Simpson de distribución 0adiversidad fenotípica0 tAnimal genetic resources.g2013 Dec., v. 53 p.1-9dCambridge University PresswJournal:23118x2078-63447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S20786336130003373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015400174300001400328520172400342592002802066650002502094650002002119650001502139650001302154650001002167650001702177650001602194650002002210650001502230650002602245650002302271650001602294650002302310650002002333650002202353650001502375650001202390650001802402650002102420650001802441650001502459650002002474650002502494653001702519653001602536653001702552653001502569653001602584700002402600700002102624700002002645700002002665700002202685700002002707700002402727773011802751856008502869852000902954655001202963IND60525178020221118223203.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052517802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhazri, Abdelhafidh10aDiastereomeric and enantiomeric selective accumulation of cypermethrin in the freshwater mussel Unio gibbus and its effects on biochemical parameters  ap. 83-88.  aSynthetic pyrethroids are a family of chiral pesticides with a large number of stereoisomers. Cypermethrin (CYP) is used in a variety of agricultural crops, but also has public health and veterinary uses. In this work, the freshwater mussel (Unio gibbus) was chosen to evaluate the stereoselectivity of CYP through the use of gas chromatography with mass-spectrometry. The effects of CYP on mussels were examined by measuring neurotoxicity and oxidative stress biomarkers during its uptake. The investigation was performed under laboratory conditions using nominal CYP concentrations C1=100μg/L and C2=150μg/L over 96h. Preferential bioaccumulation of cis-CYP isomers was observed. Furthermore, enantiomeric characterization revealed enantioselective accumulation, most probably related to mussel metabolism. Antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)), and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined in digestive gland after 4days of exposure. CYP significantly inhibited acetylcholine esterase activity, by 51% and 57%, respectively, in mussels treated with 100 and 150μg/L doses. The highest and lowest CYP concentrations elicited an increase of 67 and 63%, respectively, in SOD activity compared to the controls, while CAT activity was increased by 65 and 73%. A statistically significant decrease in GSH levels (40%) was observed only with the highest CYP concentration tested (150μg/L). In addition, lipid peroxidation was significantly higher (67%) than in controls. These results provided information on CYP-enantioselective uptake and potential biomarkers that could be effectively applied for the biomonitoring of freshwater ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abioaccumulation 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3acrops 3acypermethrin 3aenantiomers 3aenzyme activity 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3agas chromatography 3aglutathione 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3amussels 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apublic health 3apyrethrins 3astereochemistry 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aCypermethrin 0aEnantiomers 0aGC–MS–MS 0aBiomarkers 0aUnio gibbus1 aSellami, Badreddine1 aDellali, Mohamed1 aCorcellas, Cayo1 aEljarrat, Ethel1 aBarceló, Damià,1 aBeyrem, Hamouda1 aMahmoudi, Ezzeddine0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2016 May, v. 129 p.83-88dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245011900162300001600281520194400297592002802241650000802269650002502277650001902302650001802321650001002339650001902349650002002368650001302388650001802401650001202419650002802431650001602459650001002475650001202485700001602497700002502513700002602538773011102564856007602675852000902751655001202760IND60586510620221122220358.0171213s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058651062DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv30n1Ab2052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinndorf, C.

We hypothesised that in-straw rehydration of slow-frozen embryos with sucrose and the addition of the antioxidant polydatin and l-ascorbic acid would increase post-thaw survival. The IVP embryos (n = 116) were generated in 7 replicates by aspirating oocytes from 2- to 8-mm follicles of abattoir ovaries, matured for 23h, fertilized with semen from 1 of 3 bulls using standard procedures, and cultured in SCF1 medium for 7 days (Owen et al. 2017 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 29, 129-130). Stage 7 embryos were slow-frozen using 1 of 4 protocols in a 2 × 2 factorial design: embryos were equilibrated in conventional slow-freezing media for 20min [1.5M ethylene glycol (EG) and 0.5M sucrose] with 1mm l-ascorbic acid or 1 μM polydatin, and loaded in the straw adjacent to columns of freezing medium or 0.75M EG and 0.6M sucrose and then seeded at -6°C, cooled at 0.5°Cmin-1, and plunged at –32°C. Embryos were thawed in air for 10s followed by 30s in 32 to 35°C water bath. Once straw columns were disrupted, embryos were allowed to equilibrate for 5min. Subsequently, embryos were washed and placed back in culture and re-expansion was assessed at 24 and 48h. Data (Table 1) were analysed by ANOVA with means separated by Tukey’s HSD. Results indicate that there was no main effect between the 2 antioxidants or the use of rehydration columns (P<0.05); however, there was higher (P<0.05) re-expansion for embryos frozen with polydatin and with rehydration column than embryos frozen with l-ascorbic acid and no rehydration column. This suggests that polydatin coupled with in-straw rehydration (0.75M EG and 0.6M sucrose) may improve post-thaw survival of IVP bovine embryos.

However, the identification of deadwood, a critical component of natural forests, continues to receive little attention around the world. Through a review of the existing literature, this study sought to promote consciousness and awareness on the value of deadwood using the case of Kenya’s natural forests in the wider context of biodiversity conservation and climate change. Results substantiate that deadwood in natural forests performs a vital function in forest biological and ecological functions. However, forest degradation through the removal of deadwood, even though widely neglected, results in considerable biodiversity loss and might alter natural forest ecosystems, thereby exacerbating the impacts of climate change. In Kenya, despite the recent sophistication of forest management tools, including the development of the Draft Forest Policy, 2020, and enactment of the Forest Conservation and Management Act, 2016, to increasingly recognize the more progressive forest management paradigms such as participatory forest management in natural forest management, the current deadwood management practice is faulty and could yield outcomes contrary to the policy intentions and the wider provisions of ecologically sustainable forest management. It is because major policy documents lack robust and explicit guidelines on achieving ecologically sustainable management of deadwood despite its centrality in providing ecosystem services and as a highly dependable source of energy resources for over 70% of the Kenyan population. Moreover, deadwood management appears to be affected by many complex biological, technical, policy, and socioeconomic factors that appear to be acting together against sustainable deadwood management. Still, perhaps most importantly, the absence of research on the topic is the most outstanding challenge. Therefore, in the future, improving the sustainable management of natural forests will require the restoration of deadwood and increasing consciousness on the value of deadwood through more research studies.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Education  aNRF-2020S1A5C2A01092978cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate change 3aconsciousness 3adead wood 3aenergy 3aforest conservation 3aforest policy 3aforests 3aresearch 3asustainable forestry 3aKenya1 aYeom, Chunho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4382-53230 tInternational journal of forestry research.g2021 Mar. 5, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:J000000092x1687-93767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/66476183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04326naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013100166300001600297500001500313520232800328592002802656650002002684650002202704650001402726650001902740650001002759650002602769650002602795650001802821650001602839650001302855650001302868650001902881650001902900650001502919650001402934650002102948650002102969650002202990650002303012650001403035650001903049650002103068650002603089650002303115650000903138650001703147651001103164651001003175653002603185653001603211653002403227653001703251653002303268653002003291700002303311700002403334700002003358700002103378700001903399773011603418856008503534852000903619655001203628IND60542519220221119054411.0190403e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZas, Rafael10aExploiting jasmonate-induced responses for field protection of conifer seedlings against a major forest pest, Hylobius abietis  ap. 212-223.  a2019-12-06  aHerbivore damage commonly initiates an increased synthesis of chemical defensive compounds in attacked plants. Such induced defences are a vital part of plant defence systems, but when herbivore pressure is high, as frequently occurs in man-made ecosystems such as agricultural and forest plantations, plants may suffer considerable damage before adequate induced defences build up. To prepare the plants for such conditions their induced defence may be artificially triggered by the exogenous application of different phytohormones involved in damage signalling. This method is already employed in agriculture but within forestry systems it has so far been restricted to promising laboratory results. The pine weevil, Hylobius abietis, causes damage by feeding on the bark of young conifer plants and it is one of the main threats to successful regeneration in the Palaearctic region. Here we present results from a large scale field experiment where we triggered the induced defences of conifer seedlings using exogenous application of the chemical elicitor methyl jasmonate. To enhance the generality of the results different species were planted under extremely different environmental conditions; Maritime pine and Monterrey pine in Spain, and Scots pine and Norway spruce in Sweden. Weevil damage, chemical defences, and seedling growth were studied during the two growing periods following planting. In general, treated plants showed increased quantitative defences, and were less attacked, less wounded, less girdled and showed lower mortality rates than their untreated counterparts. Effects were mostly dose dependent, although some interactive effects with tree species were observed. The treatment initially caused a growth reduction but it was later compensated by the benefit, in terms of growth, of being less damaged. The measures that are currently taken to protect forest plantations against this harmful pest all around Europe have enormous economic costs and cause important environmental hazards. Elicitation of inducible defences in seedlings in the nursery appears to be an attractive alternative to these measures. To our knowledge, this is the first field study that explores the applicability of chemical elicitors of induced defences as a way to protect forest plantations against biotic threats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseedling growth 3aPalearctic region 3aseedlings 3aeconomic costs 3atrees 3aenvironmental hazards 3afield experimentation 3adose response 3aPicea abies 3aplanting 3aconifers 3aPinus pinaster 3aagroecosystems 3aherbivores 3aelicitors 3amethyl jasmonate 3aPinus sylvestris 3achemical defenses 3agrowth retardation 3amortality 3aplant hormones 3aHylobius abietis 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest plantations 3abark 3aforest pests 3aSweden 3aSpain 0aMethyl jasmonate (MJ) 0aForest pest 0aSeedling protection 0aGrowth costs 0aPalaearctic region 0aInduced defence1 aBjörklund, Niklas1 aNordlander, Göran,1 aCendán, César1 aHellqvist, Claes1 aSampedro, Luis0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 313 p.212-223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002000183245013100203300001200334506007600346520097400422592002801396506003701424650002201461650001001483650002701493650001701520650001201537650001201549650001101561650001401572650001801586650002601604650001901630700002501649773009301674856004501767852000901812655001201821IND4492813520221207080302.0150220e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449281352DNAL7 a207163462pmid7 aPMC29306362pmcid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-3-742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooke, Basil D10aMajor effect genes or loose confederations?

The rapid development of genetically modulated resistance to insecticides is postulated to develop in two distinct ways: By selection for single major effect genes or by selection for loose confederations in which several factors, not normally associated with each other, inadvertently combine their effects to produce resistance phenotypes. Insecticide resistance is a common occurrence and has been intensively studied in the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, providing a useful model for examining how insecticide resistance develops and what pleiotropic effects are likely to emerge as a consequence of resistance. As malaria vector control becomes increasingly reliant on successfully managing insecticide resistance, the characterisation of resistance mechanisms and their pleiotropic effects becomes increasingly important.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3agenes 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3amalaria 3amodels 3aphenotype 3apublic health 3aresistance mechanisms 3avector control1 aKoekemoer, Lizette L0 tParasites & vectors.g2010 Dec., v. 3, no. 1 p.202-202dSpringer-Verlagx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-3-74  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010400172300001600276520210300292592002802395650001102423650000902434650002502443650002002468650002202488653000802510653000802518653000702526653000602533653000802539653000902547653000802556653000602564653000902570653000802579653000602587653000702593653000902600653000902609653000902618653000902627653002502636653002102661653001302682653002202695653002902717653002002746700002002766700001702786700001702803700001502820700001502835700002502850773010002875856008602975852000903061655001203070IND60527097820221118042058.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052709782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoiseau, Nicolas10aAssessing the multicomponent aspect of coral fish diversity: The impact of sampling unit dimensions  ap. 815-823.  aThe influence of variations in sampling unit dimensions on the assessment of fish species structuring has been widely documented. However, this issue has been restricted to a very limited range of community and population indices (mainly species richness and density). Here, we have investigated this issue through the analysis of 13 diversity indices related to 3 diversity components (number of species, evenness and functional diversity). We analyzed a large set of 257 standardized underwater visual census (UVC) transects dealing with 254 coral fish species. The sensitivity of the indices to the variation in sampling unit dimensions was studied by comparing a range of 55 couples of transect length and width representing 34 sampling surfaces. We found that the extent and profile of the sensitivity to changes in transect dimensions strongly varied both from one index to another and from one dimension to another (length and width). The most sensitive indices were more strongly impacted by variation in length than width. We also showed that for a fixed transect surface, the couple of chosen length and width may alter the assessment of indices related to each of the three main diversity components studied. Some widely used diversity indices, such as species richness and Shannon index, appeared to be very sensitive to changes in transect length and width. In contrast, while still very little used in coral fish studies, two functional diversity indices (FDiv, FEve), and to a lesser extent an evenness index (Berger–Parker), remained robust in the face of change in sampling dimensions. By showing that the variation in sampling dimensions (length, width and surface) may impact diversity indices in a contrasting manner, we stress the need to take into account the sensitivity of the indices to this criterion in the process of selection of the indices to be analyzed in diversity studies. Finally, we found that 30m long*5m wide transects might be a suitable compromise size for assessing the patterns of each of the three major complementary components of coral fish diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorals 3afish 3afunctional diversity 3aselection index 3aspecies diversity 0aUVC 0aMAE 0aSD 0aS 0aDmg 0aH′ 0a1-D 0aJ 0aHeip 0a1/d 0aQ 0aFD 0aFRic 0aFEve 0aFDis 0aFDiv 0aFunctional diversity 0aSpecies richness 0aEvenness 0aIndex sensitivity 0aSampling unit dimensions 0aVisual censuses1 aGaertner, J.-C.1 aKulbicki, M.1 aMérigot, B.1 aLegras, G.1 aTaquet, M.1 aGaertner-Mazouni, N.0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.815-823dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245011100160300001600271520219900287592002802486650000802514650002502522650001802547650001502565650001602580650001002596650001902606650001902625650001802644650001902662650002002681650001302701650001802714650002702732650001102759650001502770650001202785650001102797650002802808650001002836650002002846650001802866700001602884700002502900700002602925773011102951856007603062852000903138655001203147IND60586510720221122220409.0171213s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058651072DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv30n1Ab2072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, M.

We hypothesised that optimizing oocyte and embryo culture conditions would lead to a higher post-thaw embryo survival rate. The experiment was replicated 9 times in a factorial design with 3 oocyte maturation media: TCM-199 plus 10% serum and gonadotropins (control), BO-HEPES-IVM (BO, IVF Bioscience UK), and HMM (HEPES-buffered maturation medium) and 3 embryo culture media: BO-IVC (BOC), BBH7 (Cooley Biotech, Gainesville, FL, USA), and SCF1 (SOF for Conventional Freezing 1; Owen et al. 2017 Reprod Fertil Dev. 29, 129-130). Bovine oocytes (n = 2907) were aspirated from 2- to 8-mm follicles of abattoir ovaries, matured at 38.5°C for 22 to 24h in 5% CO2 (control) or in BO and HMM in air, fertilized with semen from 1 of 3 bulls, and cultured in BOC, BBH7, and SCF1 at 38.5°C in 5.5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2. Cleavage and blastocyst rates were evaluated at Day 3 and 7, respectively, after IVF. Selected stage 7 blastocysts were slow frozen using 1.5M ethylene glycol supplemented with 1mm l-ascorbic acid for 20min (equilibration). The embryos were cooled to and seeded at –6°C, and then cooled to -32°C at 0.5°C/min. Embryos were thawed and re-expansion was assessed at 24 and 48h. Data (Table 1) was arcsin transformed and analysed by ANOVA, and means separated by l.s.d. Results indicate that oocytes matured in BO and embryos cultured in SCF1 had a higher blastocyst rate than all oocytes matured in control medium and all embryos cultured in BBH7 (P<0.05). However, oocytes matured in control medium and embryos cultured in BOC had lower post-thaw re-expansion rates than other treatment groups (P<0.05). These results suggest that a combination of oocyte maturation and embryo culture media plays an important role in post-thaw embryo survival, al though interactions of present treatments need to be further evaluated.

A trial was initiated to quantify the impact of five vegetation control treatments on Eucalyptus smithii R.T.Baker. to determine the potential loss in growth and differential costs against which this growth loss could be linked. Five treatments were developed to suit the predicted vegetation load at the site and varied according to weeding intensity (high, moderate and low weeding) or area around the tree that was weeded (no vegetation control, a 2 m row weeding and complete vegetation control). The vegetation control treatments were imposed at planting and maintained until canopy closure (16.4 months). Tree growth was monitored throughout the rotation and this, together with the cost of the various establishment and weeding operations, were used to make treatment comparisons. Weed growth was rapid following planting, with competition-induced divergence in tree growth occurring from 52 d. Rotation-end volume for the Weedfree check (414 m³ ha⁻¹) and Row weeding treatment (394 m³ ha⁻¹) were significantly different from the Weedy check (319 m³ ha⁻¹), with the Moderate (374 m³ ha⁻¹) and Low (371 m³ ha⁻¹) weeding intensity treatments intermediate but not significantly different from each other, nor from the other treatments. The financial performance (expressed as bare land value [BLV] with 6% discounting) of the Weedfree check outperformed the other treatments and was 37% higher than the Weedy check. The BLVs of the Moderate and Low weeding intensity treatments were similar to each other, indicating that these treatments were both feasible in terms of financial performance. However, the 2 m Row weeding had c. 10% higher BLV than the Moderate and Low weeding intensity treatments, and could be considered as a viable alternative to the Weedfree check. Sensitivity analysis conducted on the data in terms of local or exogenous risks indicated that between the treatments, differences in response to either local or global market risks were minor. Thus, small changes in cost and price levels, or larger changes in applicable discount rate, would not alter the ranking of the vegetation control treatments, with the Weedfree check (High weeding intensity) being the best in terms of financial performance, and the Weedy check the worst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3acanopy 3adiscount rate 3aforests 3aland values 3aplanting 3aprices 3arisk factors 3atree growth 3atrees 3aweeds 3aworld markets 3aSouth Africa 0abare land value 0acompetition 0aEucalyptus smithii 0ainternal rate of return 0amerchantable volume 0aweed management1 aAhtikoski, Anssi1 aMorris, Andrew R0 tSouthern forests.g2018 July 3, v. 80, no. 3 p.241-250dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000154x2070-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/20702620.2017.13411143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245006900163300001600232520090500248592002801153650002201181650001801203650002501221650001901246650001101265650002301276650001701299650001301316650001701329650001301346650001801359650001101377650002801388653002501416653002001441653002201461653002301483653001801506700001601524700001301540773015201553856007801705852000901783655001201792IND60522663520221117212032.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052266352DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1981-1-2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElstner, E.

Potato slices (ca. 3 mm thick) or discs (with ca. 5 mm diameter) from potato slices show enhanced ethane formation after TBZ - treatment exhibiting maximal rates ca. two hours after treatment, indicating enhanced unsaturated fatty acid peroxidation.

The improved capacity and excellent cycling stability of the as-prepared Mn₂O₃ microspheres could be attributed to the porous hollow structures, which can reduce diffusion length for lithium ions and electrons, and also can enhance structural integrity for buffering the volume expansion during the discharge/charge processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanodes 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrons 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amanganese oxides 3amicroparticles 3apyrolysis1 aXu, Shihao1 aYin, Zhichen1 aZhang, Yuanguang1 aLu, Lu0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 30, v. 6, no. 96 p.93532-93538dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra19334j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245013400198300001800332506007600350520157200426592002801998506003702026650001902063650001302082650002802095650001802123650002402141650001602165650001102181650001202192650002102204650002002225650001302245650001502258650001402273650001102287650002102298650002902319650002902348650002602377650003002403653001902433653002902452653001602481653001702497653001202514653001602526653001602542653002402558653003002582700001802612700001702630700002602647700001702673773011902690856007502809852000902884655001202893IND60568320720221207091554.0170505e20131206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056832072DNAL7 a10.1021/pr400535z2doi7 aPMC38641192pmcid7 a240798182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ya-Juan10aIdentification of GABAC Receptor Protein Homeostasis Network Components from Three Tandem Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Approaches  ap. 5570-5586.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aγ-Amino butyric acid type C (GABAC) receptors inhibit neuronal firing primarily in retina. Maintenance of GABAC receptor protein homeostasis in cells is essential for its function. However, a systematic study of GABAC receptor protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network components is absent. Here coimmunoprecipitation of human GABAC-ρ1-receptor complexes was performed in HEK293 cells overexpressing ρ1 receptors. To enhance the coverage and reliability of identified proteins, immunoisolated ρ1-receptor complexes were subjected to three tandem mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analyses, namely, gel-based tandem MS (GeLC–MS/MS), solution-based tandem MS (SoLC–MS/MS), and multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). From the 107 identified proteins, we assembled GABAC-ρ1-receptor proteostasis network components, including proteins with protein folding, degradation, and trafficking functions. We studied representative individual ρ1-receptor-interacting proteins, including calnexin, a lectin chaperone that facilitates glycoprotein folding, and LMAN1, a glycoprotein trafficking receptor, and global effectors that regulate protein folding in cells based on bioinformatics analysis, including HSF1, a master regulator of the heat shock response, and XBP1, a key transcription factor of the unfolded protein response. Manipulating selected GABAC receptor proteostasis network components is a promising strategy to regulate GABAC receptor folding, trafficking, degradation and thus function to ameliorate related retinal diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3acalnexin 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aglycoproteins 3aheat shock response 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aneurons 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein folding 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3areceptors 3aretina 3aretinal diseases 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aunfolded protein response 0aGABAC receptor 0atandem mass spectrometry 0ainteractome 0aproteostasis 0afolding 0atrafficking 0adegradation 0aheat shock response 0aunfolded protein response1 aHan, Dong-Yun1 aTabib, Tracy1 aYates, John R.,cIII,1 aMu, Ting-Wei0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2013 Dec. 06, v. 12, no. 12 p.5570-5586dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr400535z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04185naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012900164300001400293506002800307520275400335592002803089506003703117650001603154650001903170650002803189650001703217650001203234650002303246650001603269650001303285650002103298653002703319653001603346653001903362653001203381653001403393653002803407653001603435653001203451700001803463773015203481856008503633852000903718655001203727IND60784539320221207123821.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078453932DNAL7 a10.15408/kauniyah.v10i1.48992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendrival10aPerbandingan keanekaragaman hymenoptera parasitoid pada agroekosistem kedelai dengan aplikasi dan tanpa aplikasi insektisida  ap. 48-58.  aResource is Open Access  aAbstrak Sistem pengelolaan tanaman kedelai dengan penggunaan insektisida sintetik yang intensif akan menurunkan keanekaragaman jenis Hymenoptera parasitoid.

Abstract The management system of soybean agroecosystem with an intensive use of synthetic insecticides will reduce the diversity of parasitoid Hymenoptera species. The study aimed to compare the diversity of the parasitoids in soybean agroecosystem with and without insecticide application. The collection of the parasitoid used insect net and yellow tray. The results showed that the diversity index of the parasitoids during vegetative and generative growth of the soybean with the insecticide application was lower than the one without the insecticide application, which both were classified as moderate. The evenness indices during vegetative and generative growth were high. The richness index in vegetative phase with insecticide application was classified as low (0<2.3955≤2.5), while in the generative phase was classified as moderate (0<3.6118≤4). The richness index on the vegetative (0<2.6229≤4) and generative (0<3.8287≤4) from the agroecosystem soybean without insecticide application were classified as moderate. The similarity without insecticide application was lower than the one with insecticide application. The application of insecticide affects the species richness index (in the generative phase) and the similarity, that the value is lower than the one without insecticide.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHymenoptera 3aagroecosystems 3ainsecticide application 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3amanagement systems 3aparasitoids 3asoybeans 3aspecies richness 0aHymenoptera parasitoid 0aInsektisida 0aKeanekaragaman 0aKedelai 0aDiversity 0aHymenoptera Parasitoids 0aInsecticide 0aSoybean1 aKhalid, Abdul0 tAl-Kauniyah: Jurnal Biologi.g2017 Apr., v. 10, no. 1 p.48-58dUniversitas Islam Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah JakartawJournal:27782x2502-67207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15408/kauniyah.v10i1.48993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245010000194300001800294500002000312520140700332592002801739596005901767596006001826650003401886650002401920650001601944650001401960650002401974650001901998650001802017650002902035650002402064650001602088650001702104650001902121650002102140650002702161650001702188650001302205650001702218700001602235700001602251700001702267700001602284700005502300773012402355856007302479852000902552655001202561IND60771516320221117222412.0220325e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077151632DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.74022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8165-700910aTenuifolin ameliorates chronic restraint stress‐induced cognitive impairment in C57BL/6J mice  ap. 1402-1412.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe general consensus is that stress affects the central nervous system and can lead to cognitive problems. The root of Polygala tenuifolia (P. tenuifolia) is a well‐known traditional Chinese medicine used for improving brain function. Tenuifolin (TEN) is the major constituent of P. tenuifolia and has a promising neuroprotective property. The purpose of this study was to investigate the alleviating effect of TEN on cognitive impairment induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) and its mechanism. Our results showed that CRS exposure resulted in impaired cognitive performance in C57BL/6J mice, as indicated by decreased responses in Y‐maze, novel objects recognition, and step‐through passive avoidance tests. TEN treated daily orally (10 and 20 mg/kg) for 30 days reversed these behavior changes. Meanwhile, TEN could significantly regulate interleukin (IL)‐6 and IL‐10 levels in the hippocampus. TEN inhibited the toll‐like receptor 4/nuclear factor‐kappa B‐mediated inflammation, as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone levels in serum. Most importantly, we found that TEN also upregulated the expressions of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor, tropomyosin kinase B, glucocorticoid receptor, glutamate receptor 1, and synapse‐associated proteins. Collectively, these data suggest that TEN has a potential improvement effect on memory loss caused by CRS.  aPublisher supplied data  a81773930cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFC1602105cthe National Key R & D Program of China 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPolygala tenuifolia 3ablood serum 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acorticosterone 3acorticotropin 3aglucocorticoid receptors 3aglutamate receptors 3ahippocampus 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3amemory disorders 3aneuroprotective effect 3aphytotherapy 3aresearch 3atropomyosins1 aHuang, Hong1 aJiang, Ning1 aZhang, Yiwen1 aLv, Jingwei1 aLiu, Xinmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6452-46450 tPhytotherapy research.g2022 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.1402-1412dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.74023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014100169520165900310592002801969650002001997650002002017650002002037650001502057650003302072650001302105650001602118653002702134653001502161653002702176653004702203653002502250700002002275700001602295700001602311700002102327700002802348773011402376856008602490852000902576655001202585IND60746042020221116173633.0220118e20220105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074604202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1267462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiangfei10aTowards a better understanding of deep convolutional neural network processes for recognizing organic chemicals of environmental concern  aDeep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has proved to be a promising tool for identifying organic chemicals of environmental concern. However, the uncertainty associated with DCNN predictions remains to be quantified. The training process contains many random configurations, including dataset segmentation, input sequences, and initial weight, etc. Moreover, the DCNN working mechanism is non-linear and opaque. To increase confidence to use this novel approach, persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances (PBTs) were utilized as representative chemicals of environmental concern to estimate the prediction uncertainty under five distinguished datasets and ten different molecular descriptor (MD) arrangements with 111,852 chemicals and 2424 available MDs. An internal correlation coefficient test indicated that the prediction confidence reached 0.98 when a mean of 50 DCNNs’ predictions was used instead of a sing DCNN prediction. A threshold for PBT categorization was determined by considering costs between false-negative and false-positive predictions. As revealed by the guided backpropagation–class activation mapping (GBP-CAM) saliency images, only 12% of all selected MDs were activated by DCNN and influenced decision-making process. However, the activated MDs not only varied among chemical classes but also shifted with different DCNNs. Principal component analysis indicated that 2424 MDs could transform into 370 orthogonal variables. Both results suggest that redundancy exists among selected MDs. Yet, DCNN was found to adapt to redundant data by focusing on the most important information for better prediction performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3atoxicity 3auncertainty 0aPrediction uncertainty 0aRedundancy 0aGuided backpropagation 0aGradient-weighted class activation mapping 0aOrganic contaminants1 aZhang, Xianming1 aWang, Luyao1 aLi, Yuanxin1 aMuir, Derek C.G.1 aZeng, E.

High contents of p-cymene, styrene and γ-terpinene were observed in MLX-B grapes sampled from Beizhen, China. In addition, benzaldehyde and methyl benzoate were major contained in MLX-C grapes sampled from Zhangzhou, China. The PCA results revealed effective differentiation of samples from different geographical origin based on the information obtained from GC-IMS. Furthermore, sensory evaluation showed that the aroma characters of grapes from different geographical origin were significantly different (P ≤ 0.05).

In the absence of moisture, the adsorption capacity of the triethylenetetramine-aminated solid amine fiber (SF-AM-TETA) for CO₂ could be 0.75 mmol g⁻¹ through physical adsorption of pores inherited from the bio-texture of sisal fibers. The adsorption capacity of SF-AM-TETA was greatly promoted by the presence of moisture, which could reach 4.20 mmol g⁻¹ at room temperature. After 7 adsorption–desorption cycles, the regenerated fiber showed a adsorption capacity of 3.92 mmol g⁻¹, 93% regeneration efficiency, which confirmed that SF-AM-TETA was capable of keeping its stability and CO₂ adsorption capacity even after numbers of regeneration cycles. Furthermore, in order to better interpret the adsorption behavior and adsorption kinetics of the solid amine fiber SF-AM-TETA, two models were applied to fit CO₂ adsorption experimental data at different temperatures. The results indicated that the solid amine fiber tended to absorb CO₂ by a physical process in the absence of moisture while the chemical absorption was the main process occurring in the presence of moisture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical bonding 3acopolymerization 3amodels 3asisal1 aChen, Siyu1 aChen, Yuan1 aChen, Shuixia1 aMa, Nianfang1 aWu, Qinghua0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 29, v. 6, no. 76 p.72022-72029dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra14627a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03625naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010800171520218000279592002802459650002602487650001302513650002302526650002202549650002202571650001902593650001702612650000902629650001802638650002102656650001102677651001002688653001302698653001902711653002102730653002102751653001502772700001902787700002002806700002202826700002202848700002002870700002102890700002402911773010102935856008603036852000903122655001203131IND60759728820221118041537.0220103e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075972882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLami, Francesco10aHabitat type and community age as barriers to alien plant invasions in coastal species-habitat networks  aSand shore ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to alien plant invasions. While most of the abiotic drivers of alien success have been identified, less is known on the role of biological processes driving the invasion. Studying the interactions between alien and native plant communities across different habitats and along the ecological succession (i.e. community maturity) can elucidate the dynamics of alien invasions in dune systems.In this study, we sampled alien and native plant communities in 100 patches across 10 natural coastal landscapes in NE Italy. The patches represented three main habitat types (foredune, backdune and salt marsh, which differ in terms of sea storm-related disturbance and soil salinity) distributed along a gradient of community maturity (i.e. number of years since the plant community was completely eroded by a sea storm). We analysed the effects of alien/native status, habitat type and maturity on species richness and colonization potential of plant species pools. Colonization potential was estimated by applying for the first time on plant data a species-habitat network approach, which allowed us to assess in detail the effect of each plant community on the others.In backdune habitats, alien plant species richness was negatively related with community maturity, which in turn had a positive effect on native species richness. Colonization potential was positively influenced by age for native communities and negatively for alien communities in salt marshes. Among habitat types, backdune patches were also particularly prone to alien invasions and very efficient donors of alien plants to other patches. Salt marshes were in general very resistant to invasion but potentially acting as secondary reservoirs for some backdune alien species.This study identified backdune habitats as key nodes for alien plant introduction and spread in coastal ecosystems, underlining the importance of maintaining mature undisturbed patches as a barrier to alien invasions. This information could prove pivotal in optimizing monitoring and management efforts of alien plant species in these ecosystems, as well as in conservation prioritization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological succession 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aplant communities 3aprioritization 3asalt marshes 3asand 3asoil salinity 3aspecies richness 3astorms 3aItaly 0aBackdune 0aExotic species 0aInvasion ecology 0aPlant succession 0aSand dunes1 aVitti, Stefano1 aMarini, Lorenzo1 aPellegrini, Elisa1 aCasolo, Valentino1 aTrotta, Giacomo1 aSigura, Maurizia1 aBoscutti, Francesco0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 133 p.108450-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007100168300001600239500001900255500001100274520140600285592002801691650001401719650001601733650001501749650001001764650001501774650002101789650001701810650002501827650001701852650001401869650001601883650002801899773014701927856008202074852000902156655001202165IND60685716720221123035230.0200306e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068571672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-019-03420-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlasiak, Janusz10aSenescence in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration  ap. 789-805.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex eye disease underlined by the death of photoreceptors and degeneration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris (CC). The mechanism(s) responsible for massive and progressive retinal degeneration is not completely known. Senescence, a state of permanent inhibition of cell growth, may be induced by many factors important for AMD pathogenesis and results in senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that releases growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases and other molecules inducing inflammation and other AMD-related effects. These effects can be induced in the affected cell and neighboring cells, leading to progression of AMD phenotype. Senescent cells also release reactive oxygen species that increase SASP propagation. Many other pathways of senescence-related AMD pathogenesis, including autophagy, the cGAS–STING signaling, degeneration of CC by membrane attack complex, can be considered. A2E, a fluorophore present in lipofuscin, amyloid-beta peptide and humanin, a mitochondria-derived peptide, may link AMD with senescence. Further studies on senescence in AMD pathogenesis to check the possibility of opening a perspective of the use of drugs killing senescent cells (senolytics) and terminating SASP bystander effects (senostatics) might be beneficial for AMD that at present is an incurable disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3acell growth 3achemokines 3adeath 3aepithelium 3afluorescent dyes 3ainflammation 3amacular degeneration 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3aproteinases 3areactive oxygen species0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2020 Mar., v. 77, no. 5 p.789-805dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03420-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011800171520145000289592002801739650002601767650002501793650002501818650002801843650001601871650002901887650002601916650002701942650001101969653002001980653002602000653004602026653002302072653001202095653001702107700001202124700001402136700001602150700001702166773011902183856008802302852000902390655001202399IND60727514220221122000340.0220103e20210620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072751422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1451802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaojuan10aEffect of economic growth on environmental quality: Evidence from tropical countries with different income levels  aThe growth of the economy in the tropics is faster than that in the rest of the world. However, whether this growth can have impacts on the environmental quality in the tropics is still a question. Here, we first introduce the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity as an environmental indicator and then investigate the relationships between gross domestic product per capita, sectoral economies, and the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity for different income countries in the tropics from 1995 to 2018. By using panel models, we find that there exists a significantly negative effect of the growth of gross domestic product per capita on terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity in the full panel and at low-income and lower middle-income levels but not at the upper middle-income level. The sectoral economies have different effects on the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity at different income levels. Interestingly, the industrial sector dominates the degradation of the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity in the lower middle-income countries; the agricultural sector exerts a significantly negative impact on the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity at the low-income and upper middle-income levels, but largely offset by the growth of the service sector. These findings suggest that the balance between economic development and the natural environment is required for economic sustainability in the tropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3acarbon sequestration 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental indicators 3aenvironmental quality 3agross domestic product 3aincome 0aEconomic growth 0aEnvironmental quality 0aTerrestrial carbon sequestration capacity 0aSectoral economies 0aTropics 0aPanel models1 aLi, Xia1 aShi, Hong1 aYan, Yuchao1 aWen, Xiaoxia0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 20, v. 774 p.145180-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1451803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014000170300001500310520153200325592002801857650001101885650002901896650002101925650001701946650002501963650001101988650001601999650000902015650001802024650002002042650001302062650001102075650002002086650001602106650002202122650002102144650001502165650002302180650001102203650001502214650001602229650001002245650001602255650001402271650001102285650002002296650001202316700001802328700001702346700002002363700002002383700002102403773009402424856008102518852000902599655001202608IND60120250520221120064355.0150201e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012025052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-014-9744-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoumare, Abdoulaye10aEffect of Eucalyptus camaldulensis amendment on soil chemical properties, enzymatic activity, Acacia species growth and roots symbioses  ap. 97-106.  aThis study aimed to test the effect of Eucalyptus litter on growth, roots symbioses status and nutrition of Sahelian acacia’s seedlings. Sangalkam sandy soil was amended with two levels (1 and 5 %) of Eucalyptus litter. As control of the effect of litter addition, sandy soil was amended with 1 and 5 % of maize litter. In addition, a control without amendment was established to highlight any changes caused by amendments. Eucalyptus litter impact on A. senegal, A. seyal and A. albida was determined by comparing plants grown in amended treatments to plants grown in both control treatments. Results indicated that Eucalyptus litter leads to changes in soil pH and phenol content. These changes negatively affect plant growth, their symbiotic status (mycorrhization, nodulation), and their nutrition (leaf chlorophyll content, total carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus in shoots). Likewise, soil enzymatic activities were modified. Acid phosphatase was higher in Eucalyptus litter amended soil than in control while alkaline phosphatase was higher in control soil than in Eucalyptus litter amended soil. Positive correlations were recorded between roots symbioses and shoots mineral content suggesting that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus and N-fixing symbiosis promote mineral uptake and storage in leaves. However, polyphenolic content of added litter was negatively linked to roots symbioses and growth of tested acacias. Results showed also, Eucalyptus litter impact on acacias growth was genotype and dose dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aacid phosphatase 3aagroforestry 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3agenotype 3aleaves 3amineral content 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen content 3anodulation 3anutritional status 3aphenol 3aphosphorus 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asandy soils 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil amendments 3asoil pH1 aManga, Anicet1 aFall, Saliou1 aHafidi, Mohamed1 aNdoye, Ibrahima1 aDuponnois, Robin0 tAgroforestry systems.g2015 Feb., v. 89, no. 1 p.97-106dSpringer-Verlagx0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-014-9744-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009500184300001600279500001500295520151600310592002801826650002401854650002601878650002101904650001201925650001801937650000901955650001801964650001801982650002602000650001002026650001602036650001702052650001802069650001002087650002802097650001802125650002002143650006402163650001402227650007402241650003402315650002602349650002602375650004802401653002702449700002402476700002202500700002602522700002202548700001902570700001902589700002102608773010002629856008102729852000902810655001202819IND4482529920221122125008.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448252992DNAL7 a210739772pmid7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2010.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrefort, Thomas10aCleavage of resveratrol in fungi: Characterization of the enzyme Rco1 from Ustilago maydis  ap. 132-143.  a2019-12-06  aUstilago maydis, the causative agent of corn smut disease, contains two genes encoding members of the carotenoid cleavage oxygenase family, a group of enzymes that cleave double bonds in different substrates. One of them, Cco1, was formerly identified as a β-carotene cleaving enzyme. Here we elucidate the function of the protein encoded by the second gene, termed here as Ustilago maydis Resveratrol cleavage oxygenase 1 (Um Rco1). In vitro incubations of heterologously expressed and purified UM Rco1 with different carotenoid and stilbene substrates demonstrate that it cleaves the interphenyl Cα–Cβ double bond of the phytoalexin resveratrol and its derivative piceatannol. Um Rco1 exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity, as suggested by the lack of activity on carotenoids and the other resveratrol-related compounds tested. The activity of Um Rco1 was confirmed by incubation of U. maydis rco1 deletion and over-expression strains with resveratrol. Furthermore, treatment with resveratrol resulted in striking alterations of cell morphology. However, pathogenicity assays indicated that Um rco1 is largely dispensable for biotrophic development. Our work reveals Um Rco1 as the first eukaryotic resveratrol cleavage enzyme identified so far. Moreover, Um Rco1 represents a subfamily of fungal enzymes likely involved in the degradation of stilbene compounds, as suggested by the cleavage of resveratrol by homologs from Aspergillus fumigatus, Chaetomium globosum and Botryotinia fuckeliana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetomium globosum 3asubstrate specificity 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aenzymes 3asmut diseases 3acorn 3abeta-carotene 3apathogenicity 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3agenes 3aresveratrol 3acell biology 3aUstilago zeae 3afungi 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression 2aOxygenasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aStilbenesxmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aUstilagoxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aSclerotinia fuckeliana1 aScherzinger, Daniel1 aLimón, M.

Field experiments were conducted near Manhattan, Kansas over a period of 18 years. Walnut (Juglans nigra L.) trees were originally planted in rows 12.2 m apart. During the first 15 years of the study, smooth brome yield averaged 5,800 kg/ha. Sixteen to eighteen years after establishment, forage yields average 286 g/m²under tree canopies (2.4 from tree row) and 346 g/m²in the center between the rows on a north to south orientation compared to 497 g/m²in the open. Forage heights ranged from 39 to 120 cm depending on year and followed the same trends by location as dry matter yields. Although no differences were found in forage quality among locations, crude protein, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber averaged 20.4, 31.3, and 57.1 %, respectively, for forages harvested in May 2012 and July 2011, compared to 13.9, 19.2, and 36.4 % respectively, for forages harvested in October 2010.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus inermis 3aJuglans nigra 3aacid detergent fiber 3aalley cropping 3acrude protein 3adry matter accumulation 3afield experimentation 3aforage quality 3aforage yield 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aplanting 3atrees 3awalnuts 3aKansas1 aFick, Walter H.0 tAgroforestry systems.g2015 Feb., v. 89, no. 1 p.107-112dSpringer-Verlagx0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-014-9745-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245007900179300001800258520108000276592002801356650001701384650002401401650001601425650001501441650002101456650001301477653002201490653002901512653001601541653001101557653001601568700002401584700002801608700002601636700002301662700002001685773012401705856008601829852000901915655001201924IND60525311820221118030757.0190318e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052531182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez Recalde, Mercedes10aCarrageenan and agaran structures from the red seaweed Gymnogongrus tenuis  ap. 1370-1378.  aThe galactan system biosynthesized by the red seaweed Gymnogongrus tenuis (Phyllophoraceae) is constituted by major amounts of κ/ι-carrageenans, with predominance of ι-structures, which were isolated by extraction with hot water in high yield (∼45%). A small amount of non-cyclized carrageenans mostly of the ν-type was also obtained. Besides, 12% of these galactans are agaran structures, which were present in major quantities in the room temperature water extracts, but they were also found in the hot water extract. They are constituted by 3-linked β-d-galactose units partially substituted on C-6 with sulfate or single stubs of β-d-xylose and 4-linked residues that comprise α-l-galactose units partially sulfated or methoxylated on C-3 or sulfated on C-3 and C-6 and 3,6-anhydro-α-l-galactose. Related structural patterns were previously found for agarans synthesized by other carrageenophytes. Results presented here show that these agarans are low molecular weight molecules independent of the carrageenan structures, with strong interactions between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGymnogongrus 3aambient temperature 3acarrageenan 3amacroalgae 3amolecular weight 3asulfates 0aSulfated galactan 0aPolysaccharide structure 0aCarrageenan 0aAgaran 0aRed seaweed1 aCanelón, Dilsia J.1 aCompagnone, Reinaldo S.1 aMatulewicz, María C.1 aCerezo, Alberto S.1 aCiancia, Marina0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 136 p.1370-1378dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011100174300001300285506002800298520130200326592002801628506003701656650004401693650002801737650002301765650001101788650002001799650001301819650001701832650001301849650002401862650002801886653002201914653002501936700002301961700002701984700002002011773020302031856008802234852000902322655001202331IND60784540020221207132124.0200702e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078454002DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.afssaae.2020.003.012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendrawan, Yusuf10aCharacterization of Pseudomonas fluorescens polyhydroxyalkanoate produced from molasses as a carbon source  ap. 1-10.  aResource is Open Access  aPolyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a biopolymer produced by various types of bacteria under conditions of unbalanced growth. One of the bacteria generating PHA is Pseudomonas fluorescens with a carbon source in the form of molasses. This study aimed to determine the effect of molasses concentration and incubation period on biomass and PHA characteristics. This study utilised two factors, such as molasses concentration of 40, 60, 80 g/L, and incubation period for 3, 5, 7 days. The research result indicated the highest biomass yield was obtained from the treatment of 40 g/L molasses concentration and in 7-day incubation period, with dry cell weight values of 1,955 g/L, PHA weight of 0.756 g/L, dry cell yield of 2.036%, and PHA yield of 39.06%, respectively. The visual characteristics of PHA samples were indicated with brownish and granular state, while the melting point and functional groups were identical to pure polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). The characteristics of the PHB structure obtained from Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, depicting: C = O esters, CH3, CH2, -C-O-, -C-O-C Polymers, and C-C. The melting point of PHA samples,using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis, was 166.4 oC and an enthalpy of -13.885 J/g with 9.5% degree of crystallisation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acrystallization 3aenthalpy 3afood science 3amolasses 3apolyhydroxybutyrate 3asustainable agriculture 0aincubation period 0apolyhydroxyalkanoate1 aAlvianto, Dikianur1 aSumarlan, Sumardi Hadi1 aWibisono, Yusuf0 tAdvances in Food Science, Sustainable Agriculture, and Agroindustrial Engineering.g2020 July, v. 3, no. 1 p.1-10dUniversitas Brawijaya, Fakultas Teknologi PertanianwJournal:27915x2622-59217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21776/ub.afssaae.2020.003.013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010900166520132500275592002801600650002301628650002101651650003601672650000901708650002001717650001701737650001901754653004001773653002301813653001701836653001301853653001501866700001601881700001601897700001301913700005601926773012201982856008102104852000902185655001202194IND60731322120221120072932.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073132212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1113222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Shanshan10aInactivation of polyphenol oxidase by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma: Kinetics and mechanisms  aCold plasma-induced inactivation of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in plant-derived foods has been recognized, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study aimed to elucidate the kinetics and mechanisms of PPO inactivation using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. The PPO solution (2 mL) was treated with DBD plasma at different times. The results showed that PPO activity decreased by 70.2%, 85.7%, and 94.2% after DBD plasma exposure at 19.4, 26.4, and 32.6 W, respectively, for 3 min. The PPO inactivation curves were well fitted by the Weibull and logistic models. DBD plasma exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of PPO, suggesting the disruption of its tertiary structure. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that DBD plasma caused the unfolding of PPO, thereby increasing content of β-sheets and decreasing the α-helices. DBD plasma also induced the oxidative degradation and carbonylation of PPO. After DBD plasma exposure at 26.4 W for 3 min, the surface hydrophobicity of PPO decreased by 60.9%, and the sulfhydryl content declined by 31.2% (p < 0.05). In summary, DBD plasma induced significant changes in the structure and oxidative modification of PPO, which might be responsible for the loss of its enzymatic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWeibull statistics 3acatechol oxidase 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acold 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 0aDielectric barrier discharge plasma 0aPolyphenol oxidase 0aInactivation 0aKinetics 0aMechanisms1 aFan, Liumin1 aMa, Yunfang1 aDu, Juan1 aXiang, Qisen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3052-09690 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 145 p.111322-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1113223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013400160300002000294520070000314592002801014650003301042650001701075650001001092650002101102650001101123650003201134650004401166650001601210700001601226700001801242700001401260700001801274700001601292700001401308773012401322856007401446852000901520655001201529IND60640997720221118100742.0190505e20160812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064099772DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra14640f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhenzhen10aClindanones A and B and cladosporols F and G, polyketides from the deep-sea derived fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides HDN14-342  ap. 76498-76504.  aFour new tetralone derivatives, clindanones A and B (1 and 2) and cladosporols F and G (3 and 4), together with three known biogenetically related polyketides (5–7), were isolated from the deep-sea derived fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides HDN14-342.

The physical and nutritional quality of wheat bread enriched with 20 % sprouted oat flour was compared. The polyphenols and γ-aminobutyric acid increased, while the content of starch and β-glucan in the mixed bread was gradually decreased. The specific volume of mixed bread reached the maximum with a 19.79 % reduction of area fraction and a 31.36 % increase cell density when sprouting for 72 h. Two digestible starch fractions with different digestion rates were observed from the LOS-CPS fitted starch digestograms. The microstructure revealed that large type A wheat starch was gelatinized after baking, whereas small type B wheat starch and oat starch were wrapped in protein-β-glucan complexes. This study suggests that properly sprouting has the potential to obtain nutritional bread with low starch digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreads 3adigestible carbohydrates 3adigestion 3afood chemistry 3amicrostructure 3aoat flour 3aoat starch 3apolyphenols 3astarch 3atexture 3awheat 3awheat starch 0aBread 0aSprouted oat 0aβ-glucan 0aGluten 0aStarch digestion1 aWang, Chong1 aLi, Ranqing1 aGuan, Xiao1 aHuang, Kai1 aZhang, Yu0 tFood chemistry: X.g2022 Oct. 30, v. 15 p.100428-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27262x2590-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fochx.2022.1004283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015800157300001800315520144200333592002801775650003501803650001901838650003101857650002201888650001201910650001301922650001301935650000901948650001401957650001501971653002101986653000902007653001502016700002202031700002202053700001902075700002102094700001902115700002502134700002802159700002302187773011902210856007502329852000902404655001202413IND60568321120180516000000.0170505e20131206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056832112DNAL7 a10.1021/pr400578h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangé, Alain10aElevated Concentrations of Milk β2-Microglobulin Are Associated with Increased Risk of Breastfeeding Transmission of HIV-1 (Vertical Transmission Study)  ap. 5616-5625.  aThere is increasing evidence to support a relationship between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transmission through breastfeeding and milk host factors. We analyzed skim milk proteome to further determine the contribution of host factors to the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis was performed on nine case–control pairs of HIV+ transmitter/nontransmitter mothers, and specific biochemical assays on two selected proteins were assessed in an independent validation set of 127 samples. 33 identified proteins were differentially expressed between HIV+ transmitter and nontransmitter mothers. Among them, β2-microglobulin was significantly higher in the maternal transmitter than in the nontransmitter groups (p value = 0.0007), and S100A9 was significantly higher in the early maternal transmitter cases (before 4 months of age) compared with the nontransmitters (p value = 0.004). β2-Microglobulin correlated with milk and plasma HIV viral load and CD4+ cell count, whereas S100A9 correlated with the estimated timing of infection of the infant through breastfeeding. Finally, β2-microglobulin concentration in milk could accurately predict the risk of HIV-1 postnatal transmission by breastfeeding (p value < 0.0001, log-rank test). In conclusion, milk β2-microglobulin and S100A9 are host factors that are found to be associated with mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3abreast feeding 3agene expression regulation 3amass spectrometry 3amothers 3aproteins 3aproteome 3arisk 3askim milk 3aviral load 0aHIV transmission 0amilk 0aproteomics1 aTuaillon, Edouard1 aViljoen, Johannes1 aNagot, Nicolas1 aBendriss, Sophie1 aBland, Ruth M.1 aNewell, Marie-Louise1 aPerre, Philippe van de,1 aSolassol, Jérôme0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2013 Dec. 06, v. 12, no. 12 p.5616-5625dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr400578h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007800163300001300241520183000254592002802084650001602112650002702128650001102155650001302166650001502179650002702194650001602221650001802237650001902255650001702274650001402291650001502305650001702320650001302337650001102350650001502361650001102376650001802387650001102405651001202416700002602428700001702454700001702471700001802488700002302506700001502529773011702544856008102661852000902742655001202751IND60120250820221122032104.0150216e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012025082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-014-4223-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbda, Ahlem10aMutagenicity and genotoxicity of drinking water in Guelma region, Algeria  ap. 4223.  aIn this study, a battery of genotoxicity assays for monitoring drinking water was performed to assess the quality of the water resulting from the treatment plants. Five different types of samples were collected: raw water (P1), treated after pre-chlorination (P2), treated after decantation (P3), treated post-chlorination (P4), and consumers’ taps (P5–P12). This study aims to evaluate the formation/occurrence of mutagenic and/or genotoxic compounds in surface drinking waters treated with chlorine disinfectant, during four seasonal experiments: summer, autumn, winter, and spring between 2012 and 2013 by bacterial reverse mutation assay in both Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains with or without metabolic activation system (S9 mix) and Allium cepa root meristematic cells, respectively. All of water samples, except at P1, P2, and P5 in summer; P1 in autumn; and P1 and P3–P12 in spring without S9 mix, and at P1 and P2 in summer and P6 and P8–P12 in spring with S9 mix, were found to be mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA98. However, only P11 and P12 in winter were found to be mutagenic for TA100 without S9 mix. The tested preparations in Allium anaphase–telophase test revealed a significant decrease in mitotic index (MI) and a simultaneous increase in chromosome aberrations (CAs) compared to the control. The bridge, stickiness, vagrant chromosomes, and disturbed chromosome aberrations were observed in anaphase–telophase cells. Physicochemical analysis, trihalomethanes (THMs), romoform (CHBr₃), chloroform (CHCl₃), bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl₂), and dibromochloromethane (CHBr₂Cl) levels in water samples were also determined. The results show also that this short-term battery tests are applicable in the routine monitoring of drinking water quality before and after distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aautumn 3achlorine 3achloroform 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosomes 3adisinfectants 3adrinking water 3agenotoxicity 3ameristems 3amonitoring 3amutagenicity 3amutation 3aspring 3astickiness 3asummer 3awater quality 3awinter 3aAlgeria1 aBenouareth, Djamel E.1 aTabet, Mouna1 aLiman, Recep1 aKonuk, Muhsin1 aKhallef, Messaouda1 aTaher, Ali0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Feb., v. 187, no. 2 p.4223-4223dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4223-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245009800215300001600313500001900329520157400348592002801922650001501950650002101965650001801986650001102004650002002015650001902035650001102054650002202065650001602087700006002103700006402163773014702227856008202374852000902456655001202465IND60685717120221123020014.0200306e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068571712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-020-03463-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderstraeten, Jacques1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5736-108310aLight entrainment of retinal biorhythms: cryptochrome 2 as candidate photoreceptor in mammals  ap. 875-884.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe mechanisms that synchronize the biorhythms of the mammalian retina with the light/dark cycle are independent of those synchronizing the rhythms in the central pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The identity of the photoreceptor(s) responsible for the light entrainment of the retina of mammals is still a matter of debate, and recent studies have reported contradictory results in this respect. Here, we suggest that cryptochromes (CRY), in particular CRY 2, are involved in that light entrainment. CRY are highly conserved proteins that are a key component of the cellular circadian clock machinery. In plants and insects, they are responsible for the light entrainment of these biorhythms, mediated by the light response of their flavin cofactor (FAD). In mammals, however, no light-dependent role is currently assumed for CRY in light-exposed tissues, including the retina. It has been reported that FAD influences the function of mammalian CRY 2 and that human CRY 2 responds to light in Drosophila, suggesting that mammalian CRY 2 keeps the ability to respond to light. Here, we hypothesize that CRY 2 plays a role in the light entrainment of retinal biorhythms, at least in diurnal mammals. Indeed, published data shows that the light intensity dependence and the wavelength sensitivity commonly reported for that light entrainment fits the light sensitivity and absorption spectrum of light-responsive CRY. We propose experiments to test our hypothesis and to further explore the still-pending question of the function of CRY 2 in the mammalian retina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3acircadian clocks 3acryptochromes 3ahumans 3alight intensity 3aphotoreceptors 3aretina 3aspectral analysis 3awavelengths1 aGailly, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9259-38131 aMalkemper, E.

In this research, “enhanced Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (eDPSIR)” sustainability framework was applied to deal with water shortage in Yazd, an arid province of Iran. Then, the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique was integrated into the driven components of eDPSIR, to quantify the inter-linkages among fundamental anthropogenic indicators (i.e. causes and effects). The paper’s structure included: (1) identifying the indicators of DPSIR along with structuring eDPSIR causal networks, (2) using the DEMATEL technique to evaluate the inter-relationships among the causes and effects along with determining the key indicators, (3) decomposing the problem into a system of hierarchies, (4) employing the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique to evaluate the weight of each criterion, and (5) applying complex proportional assessment with Grey interval numbers (COPRAS-G) method to obtain the most conclusive adaptive policy response. The systematic quantitative analysis of causes and effects revealed that the root sources of water shortage in the study area were the weak enforcement of law and regulations, decline of available freshwater resources for development, and desertification consequences. According to the results, mitigating the water shortage in Yazd could be feasible by implementation of such key adaptive policy-responses as providing effective law enforcement, updating the standards and regulations, providing social learning, and boosting stakeholders’ collaboration.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesertification 3adeveloping countries 3afreshwater 3aissues and policy 3alaw enforcement 3alearning 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aquantitative analysis 3asemiarid zones 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3awater shortages 3aIran1 aChitsaz, Nastaran0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Feb., v. 187, no. 2 p.4225-4225dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4225-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245015500175300001400330506002800344520175500372592002802127506003702155650002202192650001802214650001302232650001202245650001602257650001602273650001202289650001202301650002202313650001902335650002502354650002202379650001902401650001302420650001202433650002402445650001502469650002202484650001302506650001702519653000802536653001502544653000802559700003002567773013302597856008802730852000902818655001202827IND60784540420221207132109.0190425e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078454042DNAL7 a10.20961/carakatani.v34i1.282642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurwahyuni, Endah14aThe Effect of Calcium on Photosynthetic Rate due to ABA and Proline Behaviour of Oil Palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.)

Calcium is known as an element that plays an essential role in determining the response of plant resistance to drought through biochemical activity. This study aimed to determine the role of calcium in changing photosynthesis activity in order to increase the resistance to drought stress. The treatment was arranged in factorial of 3 x 4 in a split plot Randomized Complete Block Design replicated three times. The first factor was the dose of calcium application consisted of 0 (control/without calcium), 0.04, 0.08 and 0.12 g. The second factor was the intensity of drought stress, which referred to the Fraction of Transpirable Soil Water method consisted of 1 (control/field capacity), 0.35 (moderate drought) and 0.15 (severe drought). The measurement data of stomatal aperture, Abscisic Acid (ABA) content, chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, proline content, nitrate reductase activity and photosynthesis rate that fulfill the assumption of homogeneity and normality were analyzed using variance at 95% accuracy and continued using DMRT. Moreover, regression analysis were determined of relationship between the treatment and parameters. The results revealed that drought resulted in a decline in leaf water potential and stomatal aperture. The effects of calcium on chlorophyll and carotenoid under drought stress could not be explained in this study. However, the application of calcium has a significant effect on decreased ABA, increased proline and nitrate reductase activity resulting in an increase in the photosynthetic rate of oil palm seeds in drought stress.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aElaeis guineensis 3aabscisic acid 3aagronomy 3acalcium 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afield capacity 3aleaf water potential 3anitrate reductase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplanting 3aproline 3aregression analysis 3asoil water 3astomatal movement 3avariance 3awater stress 0aABA 0acarotenoid 0aNRA1 aPutra, Eka Tarwaca Susila0 tCaraka Tani.g2019 Mar., v. 34, no. 1 p.31-42dUniversitas Sebelas Maret, Faculty of AgriculturewJournal:27906x2599-25707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20961/carakatani.v34i1.282643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010400164300001800268520107800286592002801364650001901392650001201411650001601423650002501439650001101464650002101475650001701496650001301513650002401526650002001550650001301570650001501583653001201598653001601610653001101626653001501637653002501652700002501677700002401702700002401726700002401750700002301774700002101797773011901818856007501937852000902012655001202021IND60568321320221122193415.0170505e20131206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056832132DNAL7 a10.1021/pr400583h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrambilla, Francesca10aShotgun Protein Profile of Human Adipose Tissue and Its Changes in Relation to Systemic Amyloidoses  ap. 5642-5655.  aIn systemic amyloidosis, accumulation of misfolded proteins as extracellular amyloid fibrils in tissues causes severe organ dysfunction, but the molecular events of tissue damage related to amyloid deposition are still largely unknown. Through the use of the MudPIT proteomic approach, comprehensive protein profiles of human amyloid-affected adipose tissue from patients and its control (non-amyloid-affected) counterpart were acquired. Label-free comparison between patients and controls made it possible to highlight differences related to the presence of amyloid, by describing up- and down-represented proteins, connected into interacting networks. In particular, extracellular matrix (ECM), protein folding, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial functions were among the most affected structural/functional pathways. The reported results, obtained with no a priori hypotheses, represent a significant step forward in the clarification of the molecular mechanisms involved in amyloidoses at tissue level and are the premise for understanding protein misfolding diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aamyloid 3aamyloidosis 3aextracellular matrix 3ahumans 3alipid metabolism 3amitochondria 3apatients 3aprotein composition 3aprotein folding 3aproteome 3aproteomics 0aamyloid 0aamyloidosis 0aMudPIT 0alabel-free 0ahuman adipose tissue1 aLavatelli, Francesca1 aDi Silvestre, Dario1 aValentini, Veronica1 aPalladini, Giovanni1 aMerlini, Giampaolo1 aMauri, Pierluigi0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2013 Dec. 06, v. 12, no. 12 p.5642-5655dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr400583h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015700172300001300329520157600342592002801918650001501946650001601961650001201977650001201989650002002001650001602021650001202037650001102049650002302060650002502083650001502108650003502123650001902158650002202177650001902199650001202218650001302230650001502243650000902258650002202267650001702289650002302306650001602329650001502345651001902360651001202379651001802391700002202409700002302431700002702454773011702481856008102598852000902679655001202688IND60120251020221120181656.0150216e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012025102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-014-4227-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFagbeja, Mofoluso A.12aA GIS-based assessment of the suitability of SCIAMACHY satellite sensor measurements for estimating reliable CO concentrations in a low-latitude climate  ap. 4227.  aAn assessment of the reliability of the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY) satellite sensor measurements to interpolate tropospheric concentrations of carbon monoxide considering the low-latitude climate of the Niger Delta region in Nigeria was conducted. Monthly SCIAMACHY carbon monoxide (CO) column measurements from January 2,003 to December 2005 were interpolated using ordinary kriging technique. The spatio-temporal variations observed in the reliability were based on proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, seasonal variations in the intensities of rainfall and relative humidity, the presence of dust particles from the Sahara desert, industrialization in Southwest Nigeria and biomass burning during the dry season in Northern Nigeria. Spatial reliabilities of 74 and 42 % are observed for the inland and coastal areas, respectively. Temporally, average reliability of 61 and 55 % occur during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Reliability in the inland and coastal areas was 72 and 38 % during the wet season, and 75 and 46 % during the dry season, respectively. Based on the results, the WFM-DOAS SCIAMACHY CO data product used for this study is therefore relevant in the assessment of CO concentrations in developing countries within the low latitudes that could not afford monitoring infrastructure due to the required high costs. Although the SCIAMACHY sensor is no longer available, it provided cost-effective, reliable and accessible data that could support air quality assessment in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair quality 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon monoxide 3acartography 3aclimate 3acoasts 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloping countries 3adry season 3ageographic information systems 3aimage analysis 3aindustrialization 3ainfrastructure 3akriging 3alatitude 3amonitoring 3arain 3arelative humidity 3ariver deltas 3aseasonal variation 3atroposphere 3awet season 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aNigeria 3aSahara Desert1 aHill, Jennifer L.1 aChatterton, Tim J.1 aLonghurst, James W.

Continued disposal of these compounds to the environment leads to development of various lethal diseases in both humans and animals. In this paper, we report a soil borne bacterium, B2-DHA that can be used as a vehicle to effectively remove chromium from the contaminated sources. B2-DHA is resistant to chromium with a MIC value of 1000 µg mL ⁻¹ potassium chromate. The bacterium has been identified as a Gram negative, Enterobacter cloacae based on biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene analysis. TOF-SIMS and ICP-MS analyses confirmed intracellular accumulation of chromium and thus its removal from the contaminated liquid medium. Chromium accumulation in cells was 320 µg/g of cells dry biomass after 120-h exposure, and thus it reduced the chromium concentration in the liquid medium by as much as 81%. Environmental scanning electron micrograph revealed the effect of metals on cellular morphology of the isolates. Altogether, our results indicate that B2-DHA has the potential to reduce chromium significantly to safe levels from the contaminated environments and suggest the potential use of this bacterium in reducing human exposure to chromium, hence avoiding poisoning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3achromium 3afarming systems 3aforests 3agenes 3ahumans 3ametallurgy 3amining 3apoisoning 3apotassium 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil bacteria 3awastes 0aBioremediation 0achromium 0aEnterobacter cloacae 0ahuman health 0asoil borne bacterium 0atannery effluents1 aNahar, Noor1 aNawani, Neelu N.1 aJass, Jana1 aHosāina, Khāleda,1 aSaud, Zahangir Alam1 aSaha, Ananda K.1 aGhosh, Sibdas1 aOlsson, Björn,1 aMandal, Abul0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2015 Sept. 19, v. 50, no. 11 p.1136-1147dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2015.10476703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008000161506002800241520202700269592002802296506003702324650001502361650001002376650001102386650001602397650001402413650001902427650001402446650001502460650002302475650002502498651001102523700001502534700001302549700001602562700001502578773012802593856007802721852000902799655001202808IND60784540520221207132106.0220411s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078454052DNAL7 a10.34133/2022/97534272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xinguang10aPrediction of the Maturity of Greenhouse Grapes Based on Imaging Technology  aResource is Open Access  aTo predict grape maturity in solar greenhouses, a plant phenotype-monitoring platform (Phenofix, France) was used to obtain RGB images of grapes from expansion to maturity. Horizontal and longitudinal diameters, compactness, soluble solid content (SSC), titratable acid content, and the SSC/acid of grapes were measured and evaluated. The color values (R,G,B,H,S,and I) of the grape skin were determined and subjected to a back-propagation neural network algorithm (BPNN) to predict grape maturity. The results showed that the physical and chemical properties (PCP) of the three varieties of grapes changed significantly during the berry expansion stage and the color-changing maturity stage. According to the normalized rate of change of the PCP indicators, the ripening process of the three varieties of grapes could be divided into two stages: an immature stage (maturity coefficient Mc<0.7) and a mature stage (after which color changes occurred) (0.7≤Mc<1). When predicting grape maturity based on the R,G,B,H,I,and S color values, the R,G,and I as well as G,H,and I performed well for Drunk Incense, Muscat Hamburg, and Xiang Yue grape maturity prediction. The GPI ranked in the top three (up to 0.87) when the above indicators were used in combination with BPNN to predict the grape Mc by single-factor and combined-factor analysis. The results showed that the prediction accuracy (RG and HI) of the two-factor combination was better for Drunk Incense, Muscat Hamburg, and Xiang Yue grapes (with recognition accuracies of 79.3%, 78.2%, and 79.4%, respectively), and all of the predictive values were higher than those of the single-factor predictions. Using a confusion matrix to compare the accuracy of the Mc’s predictive ability under the two-factor combination method, the prediction accuracies were in the following order: Xiang Yue (88%) > Muscat Hamburg (81.3%) > Drunk Incense (76%). The results of this study provide an effective way to predict the ripeness of grapes in the greenhouse.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3agrapes 3agreenhouses 3aimmatures 3amaturity stage 3aphenomics 3aprediction 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aFrance1 aLinlin, Wu1 aGe, Dong1 aYao, Mingze1 aBai, Yikui0 tPlant phenomics.g2022, v. 2022dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)wJournal:27538x2643-65157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.34133/2022/97534273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008300170300001300253520159500266592002801861650001301889650002901902650002001931650001901951650001401970650001201984700002001996700002802016700002402044700003402068700002702102773011702129856008102246852000902327655001202336IND60120251120221120181641.0150216e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012025112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-014-4232-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Claudete R.10aSediment studies associated with drilling activity on a tropical shallow shelf  ap. 4232.  aEnvironmental monitoring studies were developed in an area located on the outer shelf in the Potiguar Basin, Brazilian equatorial margin. This tropical shelf represents a modern, highly dynamic mixed carbonate-siliciclastic system. Field sampling was carried out during 3 cruises surrounding a shallow-water exploratory well to compare sediment properties of the seafloor, including grain size, texture, mineral composition, carbonate content, and organic matter, prior to drilling with samples obtained 3 and 12 months after drilling. The sample grid used had 16 stations located along 4 radials from 50 m the well up to a distance of 500 m. Sediments were analyzed in the first 0–2 cm and 0–10 cm layers. The results show that sedimentary cover around the well is dominated by bioclastic sediments, poor to very poorly sorted. Only minor sedimentological variations occurred in the area affected by drilling operations. The most noticeable effects were observed during the second cruise, in terms of a change in grain size distribution associated to a slight increase in siliciclastic content. This impact occurred in the most surficial sediment (0–2 cm), in the radials closest to the well (50 m), and could suggest the effects of drilling. However, in the third cruise, 1 year after drilling, the sediments return to show the same characteristics as in the first cruise. These results show no significant sedimentological variations due to drilling activity and indicate that ocean dynamics in this area was high enough to recover the environment original characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrilling 3aenvironmental monitoring 3amineral content 3aorganic matter 3asediments 3atexture1 aVital, Helenice1 aMelo, Germano, Jr.cJr.1 aSouza, Cleuneide R.1 ada Silva Nogueira, Mary Lucia1 aTabosa, Werner Farkatt0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Feb., v. 187, no. 2 p.4232-4232dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4232-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013500171300001800306520180200324592002802126650002702154650001102181650001502192650002502207650001602232650001402248650001302262650003802275650002002313650002102333650001202354650002002366650001402386650001602400650001302416651001902429653003402448653003202482653002802514700006202542700001902604700001602623773010002639856008602739852000902825655001202834IND60535006920221117160403.0190319e20140929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053500692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, Kelly10aEvaluation and validation of a serum bactericidal antibody assay for Haemophilus influenzae type b and the threshold of protection  ap. 5650-5656.  aPrior to routine immunisation, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) was a major cause of serious bacterial infections, particularly in young children. In the United Kingdom, introduction of the Hib conjugate vaccine into the national childhood immunisation schedule has led to a sustained decline in invasive Hib disease across all age-groups. Evaluation of the immune response to Hib conjugate vaccines involves measurement of serum IgG antibodies against the capsular polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (PRP) polysaccharide by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with accepted short-term and long-term protective thresholds of ≥0.15μg/mL and ≥1.0μg/mL, respectively. These levels were derived by passive immunisation or immunisation with pure polysaccharide, and their relevance for protection following immunisation with conjugate vaccines remains unclear. This study aimed to modify and optimise a serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) assay to evaluate the functional activity of Hib antibodies generated following Hib conjugate vaccination. Validation of the Hib SBA assay was deemed acceptable for all assay parameters tested. A strong correlation between anti-PRP IgG concentrations and SBA titres was observed in vaccinated adults (r=0.81), as well as infants after primary immunisation at 2, 3, and 4 months (r=0.635) and after the 12-month booster (r=0.746). The assay identified some children with high anti-PRP IgG but low SBA activity and vice versa. The predictive protective SBA titre corresponding to a post-booster anti-PRP IgG of 1.0μg/mL was 8. Thus, the optimised Hib SBA assay was specific and reproducible and correlated with anti-PRP IgG. Such assays may have a role in evaluating immune responses to conjugate vaccines in addition to measuring capsular antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aadults 3aantibodies 3abacterial infections 3ablood serum 3achildhood 3achildren 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfants 3apolysaccharides 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aUnited Kingdom 0aHaemophilus influenzae type b 0aSerum bactericidal antibody 0aCorrelate of protection1 aLadhani, Shamez N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0856-24761 aFindlow, Helen1 aBorrow, Ray0 tVaccine.g2014 Sept. 29, v. 32, no. 43 p.5650-5656dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015900169520132300328592002801651650002501679650001001704650001101714650002301725650001001748650000701758650003301765650001401798650003201812653001101844653002501855653001601880653001301896653002201909653003101931653003101962653003501993653003302028653003002061653003902091653002902130653002802159653005002187653004602237653003202283653003702315653004102352653006102393700001602454700002602470700002102496773012202517856008102639852000902720655001202729IND60731322520221120064659.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073132252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1113282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLotfy, Shereen N.10aEffects of pH on headspace volatiles and properties of Maillard reaction products derived from enzymatically hydrolyzed quinoa protein-xylose model system  aThe enzymatically hydrolyzed quinoa protein (E-HQP) was used as a main precursor of a wide range of thermal process flavours. Identification of the volatile compounds generated from the reaction of E-HQP-xylose model mixture at different initial pH values (5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) was performed using a solid phase microextraction - GC-MS technique. The content of free amino acids, colour intensity and radical scavenging activity of the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) formed at each pH were determined. The results revealed a great influence of the pH values on chemical composition and odour profile of the generated volatiles. The studies showed that low pH favoured formation of furans, furanones and cyclopentanones. In contrast, the pyrazines comprised the highest yield of the total volatiles at pH 9. A positive correlation was found between increasing the pH values and browning intensity of MRPs. The antioxidant activity of MRPs and total content of free amino groups showed a gradual decrease by increasing the pH. A correlation was found between the antioxidant activity of MRPs and the volatile compounds generated at each pH. Principle component analysis clearly elucidated a distinct separation among the investigated E-HQP-xylose model mixtures based on the volatile compounds generated at different pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3afurans 3aheadspace analysis 3aodors 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyrazines 3asolid phase microextraction 0aQuinoa 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aAntioxidant 0aBrowning 0aMaillard reaction 0aLeucine (PubChem CID:6106) 0aXylose (PubChem CID:95259) 0aNinhydrin (PubChem CID:200661) 0aCdCl2 (PubChem CID:16211524) 0aEthanol (PubChem CID:702) 0aAcetic acid (PubChem CID:11182567) 0aDPPH (PubChem CID:74358) 0aBHT (PubChem CID:31404) 0aSodium dodecyl sulfate (PubChem CID: 3423265) 0a2,5- dimethypyrazine (PubChem CID: 31252) 0aTrolox (PubChem CID: 40634) 0aFluorescein (PubChem CID: 16850) 0aHydrochloric acid (PubChem CID: 313) 0a2,2′-azobis (2-methylpropionamide) (PubChem CID: 1969)1 aSaad, Rasha1 aEl-Massrey, Khaled F.1 aFadel, Hoda H.M.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 145 p.111328-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1113283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010500156300002000261520144300281592002801724650004401752650001401796650001501810650001901825650001701844650001901861650001301880650001801893650002601911650002801937650001501965650001801980650001901998650001502017650001202032650002402044650001602068650001402084650000702098650003302105650002102138650003702159700001402196700001802210700002102228700001702249700001502266700001602281700001302297700001502310700001902325700001602344773012502360856007402485852000902559655001202568IND60640998220221118105225.0190505e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064099822DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra14657k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassaro, M.10aDual drug-loaded halloysite hybrid-based glycocluster for sustained release of hydrophobic molecules  ap. 87935-87944.  aA dual drug-loaded HNT–CD glycocluster delivery system based on halloysite nanotubes and carbohydrate functionalized cyclodextrin was developed by a green protocol using solvent-free microwave irradiation. The nanohybrid was employed for concurrent load and release of silibinin and curcumin. The new delivery system was characterized by means of TGA, FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM and DLS. These techniques confirm the successful loading of the two drugs in the system. SEM and DLS measurements highlighted that the nanomaterial preserves a tubular structure with an average hydrodynamic radius of ca. 200 nm. The release of the drugs from the HNT glycocluster was investigated by means of UV-vis spectroscopy at two different pH values simulanting the typical physiological conditions of either gastric or intestinal fluids. Enzyme-linked lectin assays (ELLA) demonstrated that highly mannoside–cyclodextrins HNT entities display high affinity towards mannose selective ConA lectin. Biological assays showed that the new drug delivery system exhibits anti-proliferative activity against the investigated cell lines. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed ELLA results and it showed a high propensity of this drug delivery system to cross cell membranes and to penetrate into the cell nucleus. The results revealed that the synthesized multicavity system is a material of suitable size and nanoarchitecture to transport drugs into living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abioassays 3acell lines 3acell membranes 3acell nucleus 3aconcanavalin A 3acurcumin 3acyclodextrins 3adrug delivery systems 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahalloysite 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestines 3amannose 3amicrowave radiation 3ananohybrids 3ananotubes 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aRiela, S.1 aBaiamonte, C.1 aBlanco, J.

Public and private entities have invested in programs aimed at adopting the best agricultural management practices (BMP). BMP is a general formulation of recommended criteria and, therefore, not universally fit all problems. For example, the corrective measures taken so far demonstrate difficulties in selecting and allocating BMPs aligned to the space-time hydrological variability within the watershed. This research analyses the spatio-temporal dynamics of BMP pollution patterns. The study is built on the concept of critical source areas of runoff pollution from agricultural practices in the Colombia Andes. Fieldwork was conducted with the participation of farmers to collect spatial data of the current management operations for potato (Solanum tuberosum), tree tomato (Solanum betaceum), and dairy agriculture. A Soil Water Assessment model is used to simulate agricultural and hydrological processes. The model was calibrated using observed discharge, nitrate-N (NO₃—N), and soluble phosphorus (P) concentrations at a monthly scale. The origin of pollution at the catchment scale was used applying the critical source areas (CSAs) method. This paper proposes for this analysis a new spatio-temporal CSA index (ST-CSA) to represent the behavior of the CSAs simultaneously in space and time. For this, several aggregated CSA in time were analyzed for monthly and annual time steps. Results indicate that there is an essential difference in the aggregation of CSA in time, and pollution location changes significantly using the ST-CSA. As expected, the highest number of CSAs occurs during the rainy months. However, these CSAs are located in the region with the lowest precipitation levels in the agricultural areas dominated by potato, tree tomato, and dairy agriculture located within the watershed. These areas vary significantly from 24.07% of the entire area of the basin (1034.348 km²), and it could reach a maximum value of 61.78%. Despite the model uncertainties, the results highlight the importance of identifying spatio-temporal CSAs to select BMPs with the highest potential of nitrogen and phosphorus losses reduction - such as the adaptation of fertilization schedules - applicable to the study watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum betaceum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aagricultural land 3abasins 3adairy cattle 3aeutrophication 3afarmers 3agood agricultural practices 3alakes 3amodel uncertainty 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3apotatoes 3arunoff 3asoil water 3asoluble phosphorus 3aspace and time 3aspatial data 3awatersheds 3aAndes region 3aColombia 0aCritical source areas 0aSpatio-temporal modeling 0aBest management practices 0aColombian Andes1 aSrinivasan, Raghavan1 aCorzo, Gerald1 aArango, David1 aSolomatine, Dimitri0 tEcological engineering.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.105810-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010400170300001600274520095600290592002801246650002901274650001201303650002301315650001701338650001301355650001201368650001101380650001901391650001301410650001201423650001801435650002001453650001801473653002401491653001501515653002001530653001901550653002901569700001601598700002001614700002201634700001901656700002101675700002001696700001801716700001901734773010601753856008701859852000901946655001201955IND60536500720221119193447.0190409e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053650072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.07.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Kengo10aIncreased ethanol production from sweet sorghum juice concentrated by a membrane separation process  ap. 821-825.  aThe aim of this investigation was to attain high ethanol concentration by concentrating sweet sorghum juice using a two-step membrane separation process.

Changes of pH and carbon system parameters in surface waters of three seaweed farms along a latitudinal range in China were compared, on the weeks preceding harvesting, with those of the surrounding seawaters. Results confirmed that seaweed farming is efficient in buffering acidification, with Saccharina japonica showing the highest capacity of 0.10 pH increase within the aquaculture area, followed by Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (ΔpH = 0.04) and Porphyra haitanensis (ΔpH = 0.03). The ranges of pH variability within seaweed farms spanned 0.14–0.30 unit during the monitoring, showing intense fluctuations which may also help marine organisms adapt to enhanced pH temporal variations in the future ocean. Deficit in pCO₂ in waters in seaweed farms relative to control waters averaged 58.7 ± 15.9 μatm, ranging from 27.3 to 113.9 μatm across farms. However, ΔpH did not significantly differ between day and night. Dissolved oxygen and Ωₐᵣₐg were also elevated in surface waters at all seaweed farms, which are benefit for the survival of calcifying organisms. Seaweed farming, which unlike natural seaweed forests, is scalable and is not dependent on suitable substrate or light availability, could serve as a low-cost adaptation strategy to ocean acidification and deoxygenation and provide important refugia from ocean acidification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGracilariopsis lemaneiformis 3aPorphyra 3aSaccharina japonica 3aacidification 3acarbon 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironment 3amacroalgae 3aocean acidification 3apH 3arefuge habitats 3aChina 0aSeaweed 0aAquaculture 0aAcidification 0apH 0aCarbonate chemistry1 aAgustí, Susana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0536-72931 aYu, Yan1 aHuang, Yuzhou1 aChen, Weizhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3825-49811 aHu, Jing1 aLi, Chao1 aLi, Ke1 aWei, Fangyi1 aLu, Yitian1 aXu, Caicai1 aChen, Zepan1 aLiu, Shengping1 aZeng, Jiangning1 aWu, Jiaping1 aDuarte, Carlos M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1213-13610 tScience of the total environment.g2021 July 01, v. 776 p.145192-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1451923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012800163520159400291592002801885650001301913650001001926650002101936650002001957650002001977650001101997650001502008650001002023650001402033650001802047650002602065653001202091653003002103653001902133653003302152653002502185700001702210700002002227700001402247700001602261700001902277700001302296700001202309700001502321700001502336700001602351700001702367700001602384700001802400773009802418856008202516852000902598655001202607IND60731322720221117164522.0211219e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073132272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1190922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Xiaoyun10aMicroRNA-23b prevents aortic aneurysm formation by inhibiting smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching via FoxO4 suppression  aPhenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is essential for the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). MicroRNA-23b (miR-23b) has recently been shown to play a vital role in maintaining the VSMC contractile phenotype; however, little is known about the role of miR-23b in the formation of AAAs. Here, we investigated whether miR-23b prevents AAA formation by inhibiting VSMC phenotypic switching.We administered angiotensin II (Ang II, 1000 ng/kg/min) or vehicle to 10–12-week-old male apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE⁻/⁻) or C57BL/6J mice via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps for 4 weeks.The expression of miR-23b was significantly reduced in the aorta during the early onset of AAA in angiotensin II-treated ApoE⁻/⁻ mice and in human AAA samples. In vitro experiments showed that the suppression of SMC contractile marker gene expression induced by Ang II was accelerated by miR-23b inhibitors but inhibited by mimics. In vivo studies revealed that miR-23b deficiency in Ang II-treated C57BL/6J mice aggravated the formation of AAAs in these mice compared with control mice; the opposite results were observed in miR-23b-overexpressing mice. Mechanistically, miR-23b knockdown significantly increased the expression of the transcription factor forkhead box O4 (FoxO4) during VSMC phenotypic switching induced by Ang II. In addition, a luciferase reporter assay showed that FoxO4 is a target of miR-23b in VSMCs.Our study revealed a pivotal role for miR-23b in protecting against aortic aneurysm formation by maintaining the VSMC contractile phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaneurysm 3aaorta 3aapolipoprotein E 3agene expression 3agenetic markers 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3amales 3aphenotype 3asmooth muscle 3atranscription factors 0amiR-23b 0aAbdominal aortic aneurysm 0aAngiotensin II 0aVascular smooth muscle cells 0aPhenotypic switching1 aChen, Qixian1 aZhang, Jiechang1 aZhou, Wei1 aChen, Lijun1 aChen, Jingjing1 aDeng, Na1 aLi, Wei1 aLiu, Danan1 aWang, Long1 aShi, Linyan1 aSun, Weihong1 aSong, Haoyu1 aZhong, Lintao0 tLife sciences.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 288 p.119092-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1190923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003900151245015900190520095000349592002801299650002501327650002201352650001601374650001601390650000901406650001401415650001901429650001201448650001601460650001001476650002301486650002101509650001301530653002101543653001501564653002101579700007101600700001901671700002101690700002601711700003501737700002101772700004301793700002701836700004001863773010601903856008602009852000902095655001202104IND60688246320221118103645.0200501e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068824632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRigueto, Cesar Vinicius Toniciolli10aWater hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) roots, an amazon natural waste, as an alternative biosorbent to uptake a reactive textile dye from aqueous solutions  aThe effluents generated by the textile industries are potential environmental pollutants due to the presence of toxic dyes. Biosorption is a promising way for the removal of these contaminants from effluents. This technique is preferred when wastes are used as biosorbents. In this sense the use of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), a macrophyte that causes eutrophication, can be an alternative for dyes biosorption. This work aimed to evaluate the potential of water hyacinth roots as biosorbent for the removal of BF − 4B red reactive dye from aqueous media. In the biosorption kinetic assays, equilibrium time was reached in about 110 min, with 95% of dye removal. Pseudo−second order and Elovich models were adequate to represent the biosorption kinetic profile. The isotherms indicated that the biosorption process is favorable, tending to the Langmuir model with a maximum monolayer biosorption capacity of 43.28 mg g⁻ ¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3adyes 3aeffluents 3aeutrophication 3afabrics 3amacrophytes 3aroots 3asorption isotherms 3atextile industry 3atoxicity 0aTextile effluent 0aMacrophyte 0aWaste management1 aPiccin, Jeferson Stefanello1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7901-81011 aDettmer, Aline1 aRosseto, Marieli1 aDotto, Guilherme Luiz1 ade Oliveira Schmitz, Ana Paula1 aPerondi, Daniele1 ade Freitas, Thainá Stéphanie Martins1 aLoss, Raquel Aparecida1 aGeraldi, Claudineia Aparecida Queli0 tEcological engineering.g2020 May 01, v. 150 p.105817-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007400172300001600246520144300262592002801705650001901733650000901752650002001761650002101781650001601802650001101818653002401829653002601853653001801879653001301897653001801910700002101928700002801949773009801977856008702075852000902162655001202171IND60564945620221117224804.0180830e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056494562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.01.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUusitalo, Antti10aEvaluation of a small-scale waste heat recovery organic Rankine cycle  ap. 146-158.  aIn recent years, the use of small-scale organic Rankine cycles (ORC) in exhaust gas heat recovery of reciprocating engines has been intensively studied. In this paper, the working fluid selection and experimental results of a small-scale ORC unit utilizing exhaust heat of a diesel engine are presented and discussed. Based on the working fluid selection study, siloxane MDM was evaluated as the most suitable fluid for the experimental system. The experiments were conducted with the aim of studying and analyzing the capability of the ORC process of recovering heat from the diesel engine exhaust. The high pressure MDM vapor was expanded through an expansion valve; thus, no power was extracted from the experimental setup and the main focus was on studying the performance of the process heat exchangers. The system under study was identified to be capable of efficiently recovering the waste heat of the exhaust gases, and the potential of using high molecular weight and high critical temperature fluids as the working fluids in high-temperature, small-scale ORC applications was confirmed. It was concluded that when using siloxane MDM as the working fluid, the requirements for the process sealing to withstand low vacuum conditions as well as the effective removal of non-condensable gases during the operation can be identified as one of the major challenges in achieving the targeted power output from this type of ORC systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiesel engines 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3amolecular weight 3atemperature 3avapors 0aWaste heat recovery 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aOrganic fluid 0aSiloxane 0aHeat transfer1 aHonkatukia, Juha1 aTurunen-Saaresti, Teemu0 tApplied energy.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 192 p.146-158dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.01.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245011800212300001600330500001900346500001100365506007600376520070400452592002801156506003701184650001701221650001401238650001701252650001001269650001701279650002501296650001401321700002501335700001901360773014701379856008201526852000901608655001201617IND60685717720221207131937.0200306e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068571772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-019-03422-92doi7 aPMC70586772pmcid7 a318933122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMammadzada, Parviz14aThe role of hypoxia-inducible factors in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a gene therapy perspective  ap. 819-833.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding the mechanisms that underlie age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has led to the identification of key molecules. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) have been associated with choroidal neovascularization and the progression of AMD into the neovascular clinical phenotype (nAMD). HIFs regulate the expression of multiple growth factors and cytokines involved in angiogenesis and inflammation, hallmarks of nAMD. This knowledge has propelled the development of a new group of therapeutic strategies focused on gene therapy. The present review provides an update on current gene therapies in ocular angiogenesis, particularly nAMD, from both basic and clinical perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3acytokines 3agene therapy 3agenes 3ainflammation 3amacular degeneration 3aphenotype1 aCorredoira, Pablo M.1 aAndré, Helder0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2020 Mar., v. 77, no. 5 p.819-833dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03422-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010900171300001800280520136200298592002801660650002501688650001401713650001801727650001401745650001401759650002001773650001801793650001601811650000901827650001101836650001401847650001101861650001301872653002001885653001601905653001501921653002901936653002201965700002001987700001602007700001902023700001802042773010002060856008602160852000902246655001202255IND60535007220221117160325.0190319e20140929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053500722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chenyang10aRepeated antigen painting and sublingual immunotherapy in mice convert sublingual dendritic cell subsets  ap. 5669-5676.  aThe sublingual mucosa (SLM) is utilized as the site for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) to induce tolerance against allergens. The contribution of SLM-dendritic cells (SLM-DCs) has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to examine the dynamics and phenotype of SLM-DCs after topical antigen painting and SLIT. SLM-DCs were histologically evaluated after FITC painting. A novel murine Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP) model was generated and change in SLM-DCs after SLIT was examined. The density of SLM-DCs was clearly lower compared with the buccal mucosa and dorsal surface of the tongue. Topical FITC painting on the SLM induced maximal recruitment of submucosal DCs (smDCs) at 6h, but most smDCs had vanished at 24h. Repeated painting on the SLM induced exhaustion and conversion of the smDC phenotype. CD206highCD11clow round-type cells with fewer dendrites and less lymph node migration capacity became dominant. In the murine model of JCP, SLIT efficiently inhibited clinical symptoms and allergen-mediated immunological responses. SLIT markedly reduced the number of SLM-DCs, converted to the round-type dominant phenotype and inhibited the activation of regional lymph node DCs. Topical antigen painting on the SLM induced rapid exhaustion and conversion of smDCs. The unique dynamics of SLM-DCs may contribute to tolerance induction in SLIT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aallergens 3aanimal models 3adendrites 3ahay fever 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3alymph nodes 3amice 3amucosa 3aphenotype 3atongue 3avaccines 0aDendritic cells 0aOral mucosa 0aPollinosis 0aSublingual immunotherapy 0aSublingual mucosa1 aOhno, Tatsukuni1 aKang, Siwen1 aTakai, Toshiro1 aAzuma, Miyuki0 tVaccine.g2014 Sept. 29, v. 32, no. 43 p.5669-5676dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245012200165300001600287506002800303520118600331592002801517506003701545650001601582650001801598650000901616650001401625650000901639650001101648650001901659650002101678650001301699653002701712653000801739653001901747773013501766856008801901852000901989655001201998IND60784541120221207132329.0181029e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078454112DNAL7 a10.20961/carakatani.v25i1.157522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartati10aPengaruh macam ekstrak bahan organik dan zpt terhadap pertumbuhan planlet anggrek hasil persilangan pada media kultur  ap. 101-105.  aResource is Open Access  aThis research aimed to study the effect of kinds of culture media composition added with organic matter (soya bean extract, corn extract and fish emulsion) and PGR concentration to the growth of each cross breed orchid explants.

Studies on ecosystem functions and services of woody vegetation require robust estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). However, most methods have been developed for comparatively undisturbed forest ecosystems. As they are not tailored to accurately quantify AGB of small and irregular growth forms, their application on these growth forms may lead to unreliable or even biased AGB estimates in disturbance-prone dryland ecosystems. Moreover, these methods cannot quantify AGB losses caused by disturbance agents. Here we propose a methodology to estimate individual- and stand-level woody AGB in disturbance-prone ecosystems. It consists of flexible field sampling routines and estimation workflows for six growth classes, delineated by size and damage criteria. It also comprises a detailed damage assessment, harnessing the ecological archive of woody growth for past disturbances. Based on large inventories collected along steep gradients of elephant disturbances in African dryland ecosystems, we compared the AGB estimates generated with our proposed method against estimates from a less adapted forest inventory method. We evaluated the necessary stepwise procedures of method adaptation and analyzed each step’s effect on stand-level AGB estimation. We further explored additional advantages of our proposed method with regard to disturbance impact quantification. Results indicate that a majority of growth forms and individuals in savanna vegetation could only be assessed if methods of AGB estimation were adapted to the conditions of a disturbance-prone ecosystem. Furthermore, our damage assessment demonstrated that one third to half of all woody AGB was lost to disturbances. Consequently, less adapted methods may be insufficient and are likely to render inaccurate AGB estimations. Our proposed method has the potential to accurately quantify woody AGB in disturbance-prone ecosystems, as well as AGB losses. Our method is more time consuming than conventional allometric approaches, yet it can cover sufficient areas within reasonable timespans, and can also be easily adapted to alternative sampling schemes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3aarid lands 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3aherbivores 3asavannas 3awildfires 0aDamage assessment 0aDisturbance impacts 0aTree growth classes 0aMethod comparison 0aFlexible sampling strategy 0aTree allometry 0aWoody aboveground biomass1 aDobler, Magnus1 aNiedeggen, Daniela1 aLinstädter, Anja0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Feb., v. 135 p.108466-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01728naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009000166300001400256506002800270520038400298592002800682506003700710650001900747650002300766650001800789650002200807650001300829651001700842651001300859653002400872653001800896653001900914700002100933700002000954700002100974700002000995700002301015700002301038773014301061856008101204852000901285655001201294IND60784541420221207132335.0170131e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078454142DNAL7 a10.22353/mjbs.2003.01.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamsaraev, B.B.10aStructur e and Functioning of Micr obial Community of Mineral Springs in Central Asia  ap. 37-42.  aResource is Open Access  aThe microbial mats of dif ferent types of springs in Central Asia (Zabaikalye and Mongolia) are described.

Herein, 808 nm light-driven yolk–shell GdOF:Nd³⁺/Yb³⁺/Er³⁺@SiO₂ microcapsules were developed with thermal-sensing and heating bifunctions. Under 808 nm excitation, sensitive thermometry was implemented by monitoring thermoresponsive emission from ²H₁₁/₂/⁴S₃/₂ levels of Er³⁺; meanwhile, the addition of Nd³⁺ with rich metastable intermediate levels and the yolk–shell configuration with large specific surface area triggered efficient light-to-heat conversion via enhanced nonradiative channels. The potentiality of dual-functional samples for controlled subcutaneous photothermal treatment was validated through ex vivo experiments, and the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli was also elaborately evaluated. Results open a general avenue for designing and developing upconverting platforms with sensitive thermal-sensing and efficient heating bifunctions, which makes a significant step toward the achievement of real-time controlled PTT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3amaterials science 3amonitoring 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atherapeutics 0ayolk−shell structure 0aupconversion 0athermometry 0alight-to-heat conversion 0aantibacterial activity1 aZhao, Xiaoqi1 aZhang, Zhiyu1 aGuo, Chongfeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0177-43690 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 9, no. 50 p.43438-43448dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b127533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245012100176300002600297520137200323592002801695650002201723650001601745650003901761650001201800650002001812650001301832650002901845650001601874700002401890700001601914700002501930700001701955700001801972700001801990773010602008856008802114990002302202852000902225655001202234IND60098531120221121025037.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009853112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.01.1592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellestor, Franck10aMeiotic segregation of complex reciprocal translocations: direct analysis of the spermatozoa of a t(5;13;14) carrier  ap. 2433.e17-2433.e22.  aOBJECTIVE: To directly study the meiotic segregation of a complex reciprocal translocation (CCR) as well as the occurrence of an interchromosomal effect. DESIGN: In situ sperm fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. SETTING: Department of Cytogenetics and INSERM research center. PATIENT(S): A male carrier of a balanced complex reciprocal translocation t(5;13;14)(q23;q21;q31). INTERVENTION(S): Sperm samples from the carrier and direct FISH analysis on sperm slide preparations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Meiotic segregation pattern determined on sperm nuclei and estimation of the incidence of unbalanced spermatozoa and an interchromosomal effect (ICE). RESULT(S): Only 27% of spermatozoa displayed a normal or balanced chromosome complement. The rate of unbalanced sperm was 69.4%, including different types of 3:3, 4:2, and 5:1 segregations. There was no evidence for the occurrence of an interchromosomal effect in autosomal chromosomes, but the gonosomes displayed a statistically significant increase in disomy rates. CONCLUSION(S): These results are consistent with the formation of a hexavalent configuration at the pachytene stage of meiosis and a high prevalence of imbalance production.

Future climate change scenarios suggest that the Western Australian wheat-belt is likely to see greater future reductions in rainfall than other regions, together with a further increase in temperatures. While these changes appear adverse for water-limited rain-fed agriculture, a close analysis of the changes and their impacts reveals a more complex story. Twentieth century changes in rainfall, temperature and atmospheric CO₂ concentration have had little or no overall impact on wheat yields. Changes in agricultural technology and farming systems have had much larger impacts. Contrary to some claims, there is no scientific or economic justification for any immediate actions by farmers to adapt to long-term climate change in the Western Australian wheat-belt, beyond normal responses to short-term variations in weather. Rather than promoting current change, the most important policy response is research and development to enable farmers to facilitate future adaptation to climate change. Research priorities are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aresearch and development 3aarid lands 3afarmers 3arainfed farming 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3arain 3agrain yield 3aWestern Australia 0aadaptation1 aPannell, David J.0 tClimatic change.g2013 May, v. 118, no. 2 p.167-181dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0623-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009700162300001600259520186600275592002802141650002002169650001902189650001302208650001502221650001802236650002702254650001902281650001102300650001602311650000902327650003602336650002402372650001202396650001402408650000702422650002002429650001602449650001602465653001602481653001402497653001302511653001502524653001002539700002002549700002102569773015302590856007902743852000902822655001202831IND60522660120221117212231.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052266012DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1980-9-10212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHager, Achim10aATP-dependent Proton Transport into Vesicles of Microsomal Membranes of Zea mays Coleoptiles  ap. 783-793.  aATP-dependent proton pumps were found in the vesicles of microsomal membrane fractions of maize coleoptiles. Two membrane fractions isolated by density gradient centrifugation were identified by the aid of marker enzymes and electron microscopic analysis. Membrane fraction A largely consisted of vesicles of smooth ER and of the Golgi complex, fraction B predominantly of vesicles of plasmalemma and rough ER.The pH-indicator, neutral red, was used to measure changes in pH in the vesicles after ATP addition. Due to the binding of protonated neutral red molecules (NRH⁺) to negative charges of the energized membrane, a strong metachromasy of NRH⁺-absorption can be observed. Therefore, in order to accurately measure A pH a pH-dependent change in absorption of neutral red covering the whole NR-spectrum was set up as difference spectra. The commonly employed method of measuring AA of neutral red at just one wavelength (525 nm) leads to entirely incorrect results.It could be demonstrated that the ATP-dependent translocation of H⁺-ions into the interior of the vesicles was most efficient at pH 7. Acidification, which reaches its maximum 10-15 min after ATP addition, can be reverted by adding CCCP.An ATP-dependent proton-translocation into the vesicles of fraction B was also observed, however, the proton translocation is less than that found in fraction A in relation to the amount of protein found in each.The membrane fraction A displays a strong oxidation of NADH subsequently followed by an alkalization of the medium. This process cannot be reverted by adding CCCP. NADH oxidation at membranes of fraction A is consequently not an integral part of a redox-pump.A possible significance of the ATP-dependent proton pump in membranes of the ER and Golgi fraction of coleoptiles is discussed in connection with auxin induced elongation growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGolgi apparatus 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aZea mays 3aabsorption 3aacidification 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aalkalinization 3aauxins 3acoleoptiles 3acorn 3adensity gradient centrifugation 3aelectron microscopy 3aenzymes 3aoxidation 3apH 3aplasma membrane 3aproton pump 3awavelengths 0aProton Pump 0aH+-ATPase 0aZea mays 0aColeoptile 0aAuxin1 aFrenzel, Roland1 aLaible, Dorothee0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 35, no. 9-10 p.783-793dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1980-9-10213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014400169520095900313592002801272650001901300650001501319650001301334650003801347653001601385653004901401653001801450653001201468653002201480700001501502700001701517700001701534700001501551700001701566700001801583700002501601700001901626700001701645773010001662856008701762852000901849655001201858IND60783430620221120061928.0220824e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078343062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1337082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Haoran10aSimultaneous determination of succinate-dehydrogenase-inhibitor fungicide traces in cereals by QuEChERS preparation and UPLC-MS/MS analysis  aA method for the simultaneous determination of 19 succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide residues in 8 kinds of cereals was established by combining UHPLC-MS/MS with the improved QuEChERS method. MgSO₄ and octadecylsilane (C₁₈) were used as the dispersive-solid phase extraction sorbent. The proposed method had good linearity in the range of 10–100 µg/L with correlation coefficients (R² > 0.99). The limit of quantification of 19 fungicides was 10 µg/L, which is the minimum addition level of the method. The fortified recoveries of 19 SDHI fungicides at three levels were ranged from 79.57 % to 126.25 %. The developed method was utilized for the analysis of 45 real cereal samples, only 5 samples were detected with SDHI fungicides. The contents of the fungicides detected in the real samples are far lower than the MRL. The results indicated that the proposed method is reliable for detecting SDHI fungicides in cereals.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood chemistry 3afungicides 3asorbents 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 0aUHPLC-MS/MS 0aSuccinate dehydrogenase inhibitor fungicides 0aMultiresidues 0aCereals 0aModified QuEChERS1 aLi, Minmin1 aLiu, Xiaowei1 aYang, Jiajie1 aLi, Xueyao1 aChen, Jieyin1 aDai, Xiaofeng1 aSimal-Gandara, Jesus1 aKong, Zhiqiang1 aLi, Zhizhong0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 396 p.133708-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1337083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013700164300001800301520106200319592002801381650000801409650002301417650001601440650001101456650002201467650001301489650001401502650001101516650001101527650001901538650002501557700001301582700001901595700001601614700001801630700001501648700001801663700001801681700005801699773017101757856008001928852000902008655001202017IND60600982220221120041724.0180705e20170816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060098222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b021212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Changjian10aImproving the Surface Properties of CeO2 by Dissolution of Ce3+ to Enhance the Performance for Catalytic Wet Air Oxidation of Phenol  ap. 9090-9097.  aSurface properties of nanoceria can strongly affect the catalytic performance in oxidation reactions. In this work, a simple but efficient post-treatment, where H₂O₂ is used as a complexing agent to dissolve Ce³⁺ from the surface of CeO₂ nanorods with the help of ultrasonic treatment, is carried out to tune the surface properties and increase their catalytic performance for catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) of phenol. It is found that the dissolution of Ce³⁺ from the surface of CeO₂ nanorods can create more surface defects and result in a much rougher surface. The H₂O₂–ultrasonic treatment can also increase Ce³⁺ concentration, create more surface oxygen vacancies, and narrow the band gap of CeO₂ nanorods. These properties enable H₂O₂–ultrasonic-treated CeO₂ nanorods (CeO₂-H₂O₂-sf) to possess strong oxidizing ability to effectively oxidize phenol. Additionally, for the sake of comparison, other post-treatments, including calcination, H₂O₂, and ultrasonic–H₂O, are also imposed on CeO₂ nanorods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3acerium 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3aprocess design 3aultrasonic treatment1 aFu, Jile1 aChen, Jiaxiang1 aWen, Yaoyao1 aFasan, Paul O1 aZhang, Hua1 aZhang, Nuowei1 aZheng, Jinbao1 aChen, Bing-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7207-74860 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Aug. 16, v. 56, no. 32 p.9090-9097dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b021213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03899naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012900166300001600295520219800311592002802509650002802537650001502565650002102580650001002601650002202611650001102633650001202644650001802656650001902674650001302693650001402706650001702720650001302737650002102750650001202771650001102783650001302794650000902807650001402816650002802830650003302858650002802891650001002919650001002929650001002939650001202949650001502961650001502976650001802991651001003009700002303019700001903042700001803061773011603079856008103195852000903276655001203285IND60515218720221117232055.0160312e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051521872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-015-0266-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManivannan, A.10aCharacterization of Indian clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.) genotypes using qualitative morphological traits  ap. 483-493.  aClusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.) is commonly known as guar, a legume with drought hardiness suited to arid regions remained a neglected and underutilized crop till the shale rush began, of late it got momentum in the international market, and it became one of the most promising industrial crops in India. Seeds of clusterbean are used for extraction of gum which is called guar gum or guaran. Guar gum—a galactomannan polysaccharide—has many uses such as in the oil and petroleum industries (shale energy production or oil fracking), food industries, pharmaceutical industries, paper industries and mining fields. India is the major producer and exporter of guar to the world market. There is a tremendous variability available in Indian clusterbean germplasm, our objective of the present study to characterize and evaluate the Indian clusterbean genotypes using morphological qualitative traits. Forty-two genotypes collected across India were characterized for seven morphological traits: stem type, growth habit, leaflet texture, leaflet margin, leaflet size, flower colour and seed colour across three locations during kharif (rainy season) 2013. Coefficients of variation and principal component analysis revealed variability among the genotypes for the qualitative traits evaluated. PCA analysis showed that genotypes namely PNB, T local, HGS 884, RGC 471, MRSG6 were very different from each other. Cluster analysis separated genotypes into two major groups: one of vegetable genotypes (PNB, T local, M local, HVG2-30 and Amrit 11), and the other of gum genotypes. Among the gum genotypes RGC1066, RGC197 and FS277 formed a distinct sub cluster as they possess single stems (unbranched type), while the genotypes with white flower colour namely RGC936 and RGC471 formed a different sub cluster. The genotype MRSG6 showed brown seed with distinct grade of N 200 B which was distinctly unique and differed from the predominant grey-seeded group Correlation analysis among the traits showed that leaflet texture (pubescence) and leaflet shape (narrow) correlated highly with gum genotypes, on the contrary glabrous broad leaflets were linked with vegetable genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyamopsis tetragonoloba 3aarid zones 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3adrought tolerance 3aenergy 3aflowers 3afood industry 3agalactomannans 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agrowth habit 3aguar gum 3aindustrial crops 3alegumes 3amining 3amomentum 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apharmaceutical industry 3aprincipal component analysis 3apulp and paper industry 3aseeds 3ashale 3astems 3atexture 3avegetables 3awet season 3aworld markets 3aIndia1 aAnandakumar, C.

Local adaptation can lead to reproductive isolation of populations at different elevational zones and thus produce elevational genetic structuring, while phenotypic plasticity does not produce elevational genetic structuring. In this study, we examined the effects of elevation and fragmentation on genetic diversity and structure of Polylepis australis populations, where individuals exhibit phenological differences in flowering along an elevational gradient. We assessed the polymorphism of amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in adults and saplings from one conserved and one fragmented forest covering elevations from 1600 to 2600 m asl. Over 98% of variation was found within populations, and we found very low and similar genetic differentiation along elevational gradients for adults and saplings in both continuous and fragmented forests. In addition, there was no significant relationship between genetic diversity and elevation. Results indicated that phenological differences along elevational gradients are more likely caused by phenotypic plasticity than local adaptation, and fragmentation does not appear to have affected genetic diversity and differentiation in the studied populations. Results therefore imply that if necessary, seeds for reforestation purposes may be collected from different elevations to the seeding or planting sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aaltitude 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aflowering 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aphenology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplanting 3areforestation 3areproductive isolation 3asaplings 3aseeds 3asowing 3aArgentina1 aMorales Diez de Ulzurrun, Laura,1 aHensen, Isabell1 aRenison, Daniel0 tAustral ecology.g2017 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.288-296dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.124323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245012800210300001600338520209800354592002802452650001802480650001702498650001002515650002602525650001802551650002602569650000702595650001302602650002302615650002002638653002002658653003402678653001702712653002602729700001102755700002202766773010802788856008602896852000902982655001202991IND60622710520221120130435.0210114e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062271052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, David S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4224-917312aA statistical determination of the contribution of viscoelasticity of aqueous carbohydrate polymer networks to drug release  ap. 511-519.  aIn this study the relationship between the viscoelasticity/mechanical properties of metronidazole-containing aqueous polymer networks composed of HEC and PVP and drug release was statistically modelled. The networks were characterised using oscillatory analysis and drug release was performed using dissolution analysis (pH 7.4). Statistical modelling of the rheological properties and their relationship with drug release was performed using Analysis of Variance, Multivariate Analysis of Variance and stepwise regression. Modelling of drug release was performed using both the Korsmeyer-Peppas and Peppas-Sahlin models to understand the mechanism of drug release and the contributions of network swelling/erosion and diffusion on drug release. HEC and PVP were shown to significantly enhance the rheological properties of the networks. Furthermore, rheological synergy was observed whenever PVP was added to HEC and was due to non-covalent bond formation between these polymers. The magnitude of this synergy increased as functions of increasing concentrations of each polymer. Drug release was dependent on the concentration of HEC and independent of the presence of PVP. The release of metronidazole from networks composed of HEC 3% w/w and PVP (1–5% w/w) was controlled by network swelling/erosion whereas for the networks containing PVP and 5% and 10% w/w HEC, the dominant mechanism of drug release was diffusion. Limited correlation was observed between network rheological properties and drug release. It is suggested that this is due to dissociation of the HEC-PVP interactions and dissolution of PVP during drug release, resulting in a network structure whose properties are dominated by those of HEC. This is the first study that has statistically examined the role of binary polymer network viscoelasticity on drug release. Based on the findings of this study, caution should be shown when formulating aqueous networks with enhanced rheological properties as these effects may not necessarily contribute to other primary determinants of device performance, notably drug release.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3adissociation 3adrugs 3amechanical properties 3ametronidazole 3amultivariate analysis 3apH 3apolymers 3astatistical models 3aviscoelasticity 0aViscoelasticity 0aAqueous carbohydrate networks 0aDrug release 0aStatistical modelling1 aYu, T.1 aAndrews, Gavin P.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 206 p.511-519dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245019500166300001600361520134200377592002801719650002201747650001201769650001001781650001201791650001001803650001301813650001401826650001401840650000901854650001201863650002501875650000901900650002601909650001001935651001001945700002101955700002201976700002101998773011602019856008102135852000902216655001202225IND60515218820221117232107.0160312e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051521882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-015-0264-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyala, Marcela10aDiversity of phenotypic (plant and grain morphological) and genotypic (glutenin alleles in Glu-1 and Glu-3 loci) traits of wheat landraces (Triticum aestivum) from Andalusia (Southern Spain)  ap. 465-475.  aForty-six landraces from Andalusia, region in southern Spain, were characterized for plant, spike and grain morphology and for HMWGs and LMWGs composition. Up to five botanical varieties were identified among these materials based in four morphological traits. According to grain colour, nine accessions showed heterogeneity. The remaining morphological traits showed wide variation. The analysis for HMWGs and LMWGs showed that the variation of these lines indicates that up to 77 genotypes could be found in these 46 accessions. The analysis for the HMWGS, detected a novel allele for Glu-A1 (subunit 1‴) found in four lines (BGE012113 var. aureum; BGE013163 var. hostianum; BGE012196 and BGE026948 var. lutescens), and for Glu-D1 (subunits 3*+T2) present in only one line derived from the BGE036374, var. aestivum. For the LMWGs a new allele for the Glu-B3 locus was detected. The allelic variation at the Glu-1 and Glu-3 showed a clear risk of genetic erosion due to the low frequency of some alleles. The characterization of these landraces could permit the evaluation of the relationship between the uses of these flours and the composition of their seed storage proteins. The recovery of old varieties or landraces is significant for farmers who can plant the materials and benefit from their potential value in the marketplace.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalleles 3acolor 3afarmers 3aflour 3agenotype 3aglutenins 3alandraces 3aloci 3amarkets 3aphenotypic variation 3arisk 3aseed storage proteins 3awheat 3aSpain1 aGuzmán, Carlos,1 aPeña, Roberto J.1 aAlvarez, Juan B.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2016 Mar., v. 63, no. 3 p.465-475dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-015-0264-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245008600173300002400259520130100283592002801584650001701612650001101629650001301640650001601653650001701669650001501686650001501701650001301716650001601729650001001745700001701755700002001772700001901792700001601811700002401827773010401851856008801955990002302043852000902066655001202075IND60098531520221121024950.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009853152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolat, Ibrahim10aOsseous metaplasia of the cervix and endometrium: a case of secondary infertility  ap. 2434.e1-2434.e4.  aOBJECTIVE: To report a case of osseous metaplasia of the cervix and endometrium as a cause of secondary infertility. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Istanbul Bakirkoy Women and Children Teaching and Research Hospital. PATIENT(S): A 31-year-old patient with secondary infertility owing to osseous metaplasia of the endometrium and cervix in whom uterine perforation occurred during the removal of bone fragments. INTERVENTION(S): Diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy and laparotomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Visualization of the disappearance of the osseous metaplasia region with transvaginal ultrasound examination after the hysteroscopy intervention. RESULT(S): Osseous metaplasia lesions are removed by operative hysteroscopy. During this operation, laparotomy was done because of perforation of the uterine wall, and the perforated area was repaired. Two weeks after surgery, the patient underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination, and the abnormal ultrasound appearance had resolved. CONCLUSION(S): As a rare cause of infertility, osseous metaplasia can be seen in the cervix and the endometrium. If osseous metaplasia is deep enough during operative hysteroscopy, uterine perforation may occur. Clinicians must be careful for this reason, especially in cases of deep osseous metaplasia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acervix 3achildren 3aendometrium 3ahysteroscopy 3alaparotomy 3ametaplasia 3apatients 3aultrasonics 3awomen1 aSahin, Orhan1 aYildirim, Gonca1 aKaraman, Erbil1 aErim, Adnan1 aTekirdag, Ali Ismet0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 June, v. 95, no. 7 p.2434.e1-2434.e4dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012700164300001600291500002000307520172200327592002802049650001102077650001102088650001702099650001602116650003302132650001502165650001602180650001202196650001402208650001702222650001602239650001402255650001302269650002202282650000902304650001402313650001902327650001002346650001502356650001402371651001102385700002502396700002602421773011402447856007302561852000902634655001202643IND60587973820221119135957.0180103e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058797382DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.124472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilveira, Andréa P.10aLife history and population dynamics of a tree species in tropical semi‐arid climate: A case study with Cordia oncocalyx  ap. 329-340.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn semi‐arid climates, plant population dynamics are strongly influenced by the amount and temporal distribution of rainfall. We monitored a population of the tree species Cordia oncocalyx (Boraginaceae) for 24 months in the dry thorny woodland of semi‐arid northeastern Brazil, to investigate which life‐history traits allow this tree to be locally dominant. We used horizontal life tables and a Lefkovitch matrix and tested for relationships among demographic parameters of seedling, infant, juvenile, immature, virginile and reproductive ontogenetic stages with rainfall and canopy openness. Germination and recruitment occurred in the rainy months, and dry‐season mortality occurred only in seedlings (76% and 100%, first and second years, respectively) and infants (3% and 6%). Juveniles showed greater height growth under more open canopies (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.24), suggesting that light availability influences growth. The population growth rate was λ = 1.0336, and the highest sensitivity occurred in the infant‐juvenile transition. Our results show light as a restrictive growth factor for plants in the juvenile stage and confirm the strong influence of rainfall on the dynamics of trees in a seasonally dry environment. The formation of a persistent seed bank with germination concentrated at the rainfall onset but spreading over the rainy season are strategies that hedge bets before establishment. The formation of a bank of infants, which can resume growth as soon as there is water, hedges bets after establishment. We attribute the positive population growth rate of Cordia oncocalyx to survival strategies allowing bet‐hedging both before and after establishment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordia 3acanopy 3acase studies 3acorrelation 3adry environmental conditions 3adry season 3agermination 3ainfants 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3alife tables 3amortality 3aontogeny 3apopulation growth 3arain 3aseedlings 3asemiarid zones 3atrees 3awet season 3awoodlands 3aBrazil1 aMartins, Fernando R.1 aAraújo, Francisca S.0 tAustral ecology.g2017 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.329-340dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.124473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01353naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245010100171300001600272520021900288592002800507650002300535650002100558650001200579650001100591650001500602650001900617653001400636653001500650653001800665653002100683653002500704700002100729773015300750856007900903852000900982655001200991IND60522660520221117212229.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052266052DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1980-9-10252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiedenmann, Gottfried10aRunning Activity Patterns of Females and Last Larval Instars of the Cockroach Leucophaea maderae  ap. 816-818.  aVirgin females of Leucophaea maderae reveal a circadian rhythm in their locomotor activity which is superimposed by the ovarial cycle.

The urban fringe is a complex and uncertain environment in which to manage threatened species with the intersection of fragmented natural habitats, built environments and human populations generating novel, poorly understood interactions. In this context, management frameworks must incorporate ecological processes as well as social considerations. Here, we explore how biodiversity sensitive urban design might improve the fate of the golden sun‐moth, and threatened species generally, in urban fringe environments. We: (i) developed an expert‐informed Bayesian Belief Network model that synthesizes the current understanding of key determinants of golden sun‐moth population viability at sites experiencing urbanizing pressure; (ii) quantified the nature and strength of cause‐effect relationships between these factors using expert knowledge; and (iii) used the model to assess expectations of moth population viability in response to different combinations of management actions. We predict that adult survival, bare ground cover and cover of resource plants are the most important variables affecting the viability of golden sun‐moth populations. We also demonstrate the potential for biodiversity sensitive urban design as a complementary measure to conventional management for this species. Our findings highlight how expert knowledge may be a valuable component of conservation management, especially in addressing uncertainty around conservation decisions when empirical data are lacking, and how structured expert judgements become critical in supporting decisions that may help ameliorate extinction risks faced by threatened species in urban environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiodiversity 3aexpert opinion 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3ahuman population 3amodels 3amoths 3apopulation viability 3athreatened species 3auncertainty 3aurban areas 3aviability 3aAustralia1 aGarrard, Georgia E.1 aKutt, Alex S.1 aWintle, Bonnie C.1 aChee, Yung En1 aBackstrom, Anna1 aBainbridge, Brian1 aUrlus, Jake1 aBrown, Geoff W.1 aTolsma, Arn D.1 aYen, Alan L.1 aNew, T.

Larvae were raised in 120‐L tanks with biological filter systems, and fed on recently hatched Artemia nauplii, using two feeding management protocols: (a) fed once per day at 2000 h (high density – HD) and (b) half of the ration provided at 2000 h, complemented at 0800 h the following day by a replacement of the nauplii consumed up to a maximum of the full ration (low density with replacement – LDWR). Each treatment consisted of six replicates. The consumption of nauplii was estimated prior to the feeding times. Consumption varied according to time of day, ontogenetic development, and feeding protocol. The larvae ingested more nauplii during the daytime at most developmental stages. Ingestion rates were similar during the day under both treatments, but at night the higher density of prey in the HD treatment caused a higher encounter rate and increased ingestion of nauplii by the larvae. Among the performance indicators only survival was greater in HD in comparison with LDWR; productivity and dry weight were similar. The results indicate a circadian trophic rhythm in M. amazonicum, with the encounter rate being an important mechanism for the capture of prey during the night. A second mechanism – probably the visual system – aids the perception of prey during the daytime. Based on these results, we suggest that feeding captive Amazon river prawn larvae only once a day would be appropriate and economically beneficial. Further work is necessary to determine the most effective time that this single feed should be applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aMacrobrachium 3abiofilters 3acircadian rhythm 3afeeds 3aingestion 3anauplii 3apredation 3ashrimp 3aAmazon River1 aNew, Michael B.1 aValenti, Wagner C.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2012 Oct., v. 43, no. 5 p.659-669dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2012.00599.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009400162300001600256520057800272592002800850650001300878650001400891650002300905650002300928650001600951700002200967700001700989700001601006700002301022700002201045773010301067856007501170852000901245655001201254IND60578776420221116153418.0170814e20140117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057877642DNAL7 a10.1021/ol403351x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, David R.10aStereocontrol in Asymmetric SE′ Reactions of γ-Substituted α,β-Unsaturated Aldehydes  ap. 468-471.  aAsymmetric SE′ reactions of (E)- and (Z)-γ-substituted-α,β-unsaturated aldehydes have been studied for the stereocontrolled preparation of nonracemic alcohols.

The trend is an important environmentally friendly bioremediation technique for decontaminating polluted sites. The possibility of using algae as a bio-accumulator for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from polluted coastal areas was investigated in this study. The ability of eight algae species in Abu Qir Bay, east of Alexandria, to accumulate polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides was investigated. The total concentration of Σ16PAHs in the examined algae species ranged from 158.70 to 128.03 ng/g (average: 136 ng/g). High levels of total carcinogenic PAHs (ΣcPAHs) were recorded in the studied algae, with an average of 59.25% from the total PAHs. The observed ratio of benzo[a]pyrene to the total PAHs was extremely high (7.89%) (average: 10.78 ng/g). The diagnostic ratios of PAHs pointed to various pyrogenic sources. The concentrations of Σ7PCBs in the studied algae ranged from 9.71 to 8.46 ng/g (average: 9.05 ng/g). Medium penta-CBs (PCB101, PCB118) and hexa-CBs (PCB138, PCB153) were the dominant homologs. Total pesticides concentrations varied between 21.07 and 16.67 ng/g (average: 18.52 ng/g). Due to their relative high solubility in seawater, γ-HCH and heptachlor presented the highest average concentration in the studied algae species. PAHs represented 85% of the total detected POPs in the studied algae, and Pterocladia capillacea showed the highest accumulation level. The studied algae demonstrated a high capacity for bio-extraction of carcinogenic POPs, confirming its use as a bio-accumulator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPterocladia 3abioremediation 3acarcinogenicity 3acoasts 3aheptachlor 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aseawater 3asolubility 3atechnology 3aMediterranean Sea1 aSalem, D.

Fifteen monomeric and dimeric ellagitannins were identified in BRS. For ANN modeling, extraction time, extraction temperature, and solvent concentration were set as input variables, and total ellagitannin content was set as output variable. The trained ANN had a mean squared error value of 0.0102 and a regression correlation coefficient of 0.9988. The predicted optimal extraction conditions for maximum total ellagitannin content were 63.7% acetone, 4.21 min, and 43.9 °C. The actual total ellagitannin content under the optimal extraction conditions was 13.4 ± 0.0 mg/g dry weight, and the prediction error was 0.75 ± 0.27%. This study is the first attempt to analyze the composition of ellagitannins in BRS and to determine optimal extraction conditions for maximum total ellagitannin content from BRS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus occidentalis 3aacetone 3aalgorithms 3afood chemistry 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aBlack raspberry seeds 0aEllagitannin 0aAccelerated solvent extraction 0aArtificial neural network 0aGenetic algorithm 0aOptimization1 aKim, Ryun Hee1 aLim, Taehwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9584-01461 aKim, Jaecheol1 aKim, Suna1 aKim, Hyoung-Geun1 aHwang, Keum Taek0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 396 p.133712-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1337123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169300001600286500001900302520143400321536040801755592002802163650001402191650001602205650002802221650002902249650001602278650001402294650002202308650001302330650001302343650002802356650001402384650001702398650002002415651001202435653002402447653002802471653002302499653003802522653002302560700002002583700001802603700002102621700002102642700001902663700002402682700001902706700002102725700001902746700002102765773011502786856008602901852000902987655001202996IND60718165520221118212400.0210128e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071816552DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2020.17222742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyadi, Sawsen10aNitrogen assimilation under different nitrate nutrition in Tunisian durum wheat landraces and improved genotypes  ap. 924-934.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of nitrate were studied in wheat varieties grown in hydroponic culture: two landraces (Azizi and Bidi), and two improved genotypes (Om Rabiaa and Khiar) from Tunisia. Nitrogen (N) supply generally induced an increase in plant height in all varieties, albeit to a different extent; interestingly, landraces exhibited the same N Uptake Efficiency (NUpE) as other varieties, and a lower Nitrogen Utilization Efficiency (NUtE); in contrast, improved genotypes exhibit a better NUtE at high N. Nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was sensibly and constitutively higher in the improved genotypes in the roots, while NRA was strongly influenced by nitrate supply in the leaves of Bidi landrace. Glutamine synthetase (GS) activity was similar in all varieties studied, in contrast, ferredoxin-glutamate synthase (Fd- GOGAT) activity and occurrence were increased by nitrate. Intriguingly, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity followed an opposite behaviour with respect to GOGAT. Glucose-6P-dehydrogenase (G6PDH), which provides reductants for N assimilation, increased in roots upon nitrate supply, but the different plastidial and cytosolic isoforms differently changed in the different varieties studied. The data suggest that landraces present higher metabolic flexibility as compared with improved cultivars; therefore, the metabolic changes observed could be suitable for the identification of factors limiting the NUtE.  aThis work was supported by grants from the Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture and the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Information and Communication Technologies.

These types of field plots are difficult to find or not available for experimental use. This study examined crop yield and soil water variability resulting from nonuniform irrigation applications as a surrogate for soil variability within an otherwise homogeneous field. The study conducted at Logan, UT, in 1989 on a Millville silt loam soil (coarse-silty, carbonatic, mesic Typic Haploxeroll) used a drip irrigation system with spatially variable application rates. The mean dripper application rate was 5.6 L/h with a standard deviation of 3.18 L/h and a spatial-correlation range of 5.3 m. Corn (Zea mays L.) was grown in 0.75-m-wide rows at a plant density of 8.9 plants/m² in 30 by 15 m plots. Irrigation-scheduling treatments were (i) a predetermined calendar schedule (NPT), and (ii) optimized for the nonuniformity of the irrigation system (OPT). There were three replicates. Soil water, crop height, and crop-yield variability exhibited spatial structures similar to the applied-irrigation variability, but crop-yield variability (mean CV of 0.227) was less than the irrigation variability (CV of 0.57). Crop yield was highly correlated to the dripper flow rate and was 13% higher on the OPT than on the NPT schedule. Nonuniform irrigation can be used to induce a desired spatial pattern of available soil water. Irrigation scheduling methods should consider soil variability and irrigation uniformity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaploxerolls 3aZea mays 3aapplication rate 3acorn 3acrop yield 3airrigation scheduling 3amicroirrigation 3aplant available water 3aplant density 3asilt loam soils 3asoil heterogeneity 3astandard deviation 3aUtah1 aHanks, R.

Ancient strains of rice could potentially be productive in unfavorable conditions for cultivation; modern strains sharing genetic traits with ancient rice may contribute useful genetic diversity. To understand the variation in Japanese rice, a comparison of seed sizes and chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences was conducted, on modern rice accessions from diverse geographical areas, and eleven populations with seven reference populations of rice seed remains from 800 BC to 1500 AD. The populations of rice seed remains shared short grain shape and a specific chloroplast genotype with modern Japanese and worldwide rice accessions. This morphology and genotype may have been introduced to Japan along with farming techniques. Variability of seed shape and diversity of the nuclear genome both reduced through time, indicating genetic erosion in Japanese rice. Greater diversity in the populations of rice seed remains, taken together with archaeological and historical evidence, suggests that older rice populations had genetic traits that could adapt to unfavorable conditions of cultivation, such as flooding and low temperatures. Modern landraces share a genome structure with rice seed remains populations, which suggests that the modern landraces may have useful breeding traits such as tolerance of flooding and low temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3abreeding 3achloroplasts 3aclimate 3afarming systems 3aflooding tolerance 3agenetic traits 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3alandraces 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3arice 3atemperature 3aJapan1 aKamijo, Nobuhiko1 aTabuchi, Hiroaki1 aHanamori, Kuniko1 aMatsuda, Ryuji1 aSuginomori, Junko1 aSato, Yo-Ichiro1 aUdatsu, Tetsuro1 aIshikawa, Ryūji,0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2016 Mar., v. 63, no. 3 p.447-464dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-015-0262-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011100169300002000280520136400300592002801664650001101692650001401703650001101717650002201728650001201750650001101762650001501773650001901788650002501807650001601832700005801848773017301906856008002079852000902159655001202168IND60600982920221122005404.0180705e20171122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060098292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b021462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoahene, Philip E.10aHigher Alcohols Synthesis: Experimental and Process Parameters Study over a CNH-Supported KCoRhMo Catalyst  ap. 13552-13565.  aThe present work investigated the effects of operating conditions (temperature (T), pressure (P), and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)) on the higher-alcohols synthesis reaction, using a downward-flow fixed-bed reactor. The carbon nanohorn (CNH)-supported KCoRhMo catalysts with compositions of 9% K, 4.5% Co, 1.5% Rh, and 15 wt % Mo were used for this study. The Design Expert software was used to analyze the interaction effects of T (290–370 °C), P (800–1400 psig), and GHSV (2.4–4.8 m³(STP)/kgcₐₜ/h) on CO conversion, alcohols, and hydrocarbon product selectivities, as well as their respective yields. The validity of the models was assessed by statistical tests: test of significance and coefficient of determination (R²) values. The recorded R² values suggested that the quadratic models generated could sufficiently depict the experimental data. Increasing temperature and pressure in the ranges of 290–350 °C and 800–1400 psig, respectively, resulted in corresponding increases in CO conversions; however, with increasing GHSV, the CO conversion decreased monotonically. Numerical optimization assessments of the models selected the optimum operating conditions to be 325 °C, 1320 psig, and 2.4 m³(STP)/kgcₐₜ/h to give the maximum ethanol and higher alcohols space time yields of 0.126 and 0.177 g/gcₐₜ/h, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acomputer software 3aethanol 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3aprocess design 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature1 aDalai, Ajay K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3083-22170 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Nov. 22, v. 56, no. 46 p.13552-13565dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b021463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01320naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300001600271520032600287592002800613650005000641650001900691650001500710650002000725650003100745700001700776700002200793700001800815773009000833856007400923852000900997655001201006IND60439202420221119112514.0151024e200008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043920242DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024904602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangani, F.10aGraphite-lined capillary column for the separation of BTEX mixture and other volatile organic compoundc (VOCs)  ap. 217-220.  aA very fast method for continous monitoring of BTEX compounds in different matrices is described.

This makes the selection of a statistic model more difficult for describing opposite classes. To address this issue, this article developed an unsupervised change-detection approach for multitemporal SAR images that specifies a priori knowledge about the spatial characteristics of the classes through Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and embeds it into the Expectation-Maximization (EM) iteration process. It is based on the consideration that each pixel in the difference image is unique due to its neighbourhood, although some of them may have the same pixel value. Thus, under the hypothesis that local and global a priori knowledge are independent sources, a global-local a priori model is developed through Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The EM algorithm allows one to estimate the statistical parameters of the opposite classes associated with this a priori model. As a consequence, the change-detection result can be obtained within the framework of Bayes. Visual and quantitative results obtained on real multitemporal SAR image data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art ones for SAR image change detection.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [61806163, 61702158, 61703332].  aPublisher supplied data  a61702158a61703332cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aZhao, Zhiqiang,1 aHuo, Lina1 aChen, Hao1 aQiu, Yuan0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 40, no. 2 p.734-758dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.15192763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245010600187300001600293520149900309592002801808650005601836650001601892650001001908650002201918650001301940650001601953650002201969650001001991650001202001650001802013650002202031650003402053650002802087650001302115650007902128650001002207650004202217653001002259653001302269653002002282653001302302700001702315700001902332700001602351700001602367700001302383700001602396700001602412773012002428856008502548852000902633655001202642IND50067984920221117020843.0190403e20130927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006798492DNAL7 a238349662pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Dongsheng10aswIFN-β promotes genetic mutation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Marc-145  ap. 174-178.  aThis result, for the first time, demonstrates that under swine interferon-β (swIFN-β) immune pressure molecular variation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) accelerates. PRRSV-A1 strain was continuously propagated in Marc-145 cells primed with swIFN-β for 20 passages to develop RRRSV-A1βf20 strains while PRRSV-A1f20 was control without swIFN-β respectively. NSP2, ORF3, ORF5 and ORF6 genes of these strains were amplified, cloned and sequenced. Sequencing analysis indicated that PRRSV-A1βf20 had 43 nucleotide mutations while PRRSV-A1f20 had only 14 in NSP2, ORF3, ORF5 and ORF6. The ratio of mutative nucleotides between them was 307%. Amino acid variations were 24 in RRRSV-A1βf20 and 5 in PRRSV-A1, so that mutation in RRRSV-A1βf20 appeared to be 4.8 times faster than that in PRRSV-A1. The ratio of non-synonymous (NS) mutations to synonymous (S) mutations, named NS/S, was 3 in RRRSV-A1βf20 and 0.625 in PRRSV-A1f20. The nucleotide mutation rate of NSP2 ORF3 ORF5 and ORF6 of PRRSV-A1βf20 were 3.8%, 2.3%, 4.5%, 0.57% and their NS/S were 5, 2, 6 and 1 respectively, which is much higher than those in PRRSV-A1f20. Thus the mutative frequency of PRRSV passaged under swIFN-β immune pressure was significantly faster than that without swIFN-β.

The full-length cDNA sequence was cloned and characterized from a TIA-producing species, Rauvolfia verticillata, using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. The new cDNA was named as RvDXR and submitted to GenBank® to be assigned with an accession number (DQ779286). The fulllength cDNA of RvDXR was 1804 bp containing a 1425 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 474 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 51.3 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.88. Comparative and bioinformatic analyses revealed that RvDXR showed extensive homology with DXRs from other plant species and contained a conserved transit peptide for plastids, an extended Pro-rich region and a highly conserved NADPHbinding motif in its N-terminal region owned by all plant DXRs. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that DXRs had two groups including a plant and bacterial group; RvDXR belonged to angiosperm DXRs that were obtained from Synechocystis through gene transfer according to the phylogenetic analysis. The structural modeling of RvDXR showed that RvDXR had the typical V-shaped structure of DXR proteins. The tissue expression pattern analysis indicated that RvDXR expressed in all tissues including roots, stems, leaves, fruits and followers but at different levels. The lowest transcription level was observed in followers and the highest transcription was found in fruits of R. verticillata; the transcription level of RvDXR was a little higher in roots and stems than in leaves. The cloning and characterization of RvDXR will be helpful to understand more about the role of DXR involved in R. verticillata TIA biosynthesis at the molecular level and provides a candidate gene for metabolic engineering of the TIAs pathway in R. verticillata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRauvolfia 3aSynechocystis 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3afruits 3agene transfer 3agenes 3aindole alkaloids 3aisoelectric point 3aleaves 3ametabolic engineering 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3aphosphates 3aphylogeny 3aplastids 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3aroots 3astems 3aterpenoids 3atissues 0aCloning 0aCharacterization 0aDXR Gene 0aRauvolfia verticillata1 aChen, Rong1 aChen, Min1 aYang, Chunxian1 aWang, Qiang1 aGong, Yifu0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 62, no. 3-4 p.296-304dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2007-3-4213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245011300184300001200297520140100309592002801710650002101738650001501759650001501774650002701789650000901816650001001825650002301835650001101858650001001869650002101879650001501900650002201915650000901937650001801946650001101964650002001975650001901995650000702014650002302021650001502044650002502059700003102084700002902115700003302144773012402177856008102301852000902382655001202391IND60515219420221117231942.0160414e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051521942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-2801-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmazán-Sánchez, Perla Tatiana10aTextile Wastewater Treatment Using Iron-Modified Clay and Copper-Modified Carbon in Batch and Column Systems  ap. 100.  aTextile wastewater was treated by adsorption in batch and column systems using electrochemically modified montmorillonite clay and activated carbon. Textile wastewater was obtained from a denim manufacturing process; according to the characterization of wastewater, non-biodegradable organic matter was found and it limits the application of biological treatments, and then an alternative method was evaluated. The adsorption process was performed with natural and modified materials; iron-modified montmorillonite was prepared at pH 7 using iron electrodes and activated carbon was treated with copper electrodes at pH 2, and 10–12 % of iron and copper respectively were found in the modified materials. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), color, and total organic carbon (TOC) were evaluated; the adsorption capacities for color were 50, 37, and 44 U PtCo/g for natural clay, activated carbon, and iron-modified clay, respectively. Adsorption kinetics of COD, color, and TOC data were best adjusted to Elovich model and isotherms data to Freundlich model, indicating chemisorption on heterogeneous materials. The regeneration of materials was performed in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide. Continuous systems were evaluated for color and TOC. Fe-modified clay was the best adsorbent, and data were best adjusted to Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achemical oxygen demand 3aclay 3acolor 3acontinuous systems 3acopper 3adenim 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3aorganic matter 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aLinares-Hernández, Ivonne1 aSolache-Ríos, Marcos J.1 aMartínez-Miranda, Verónica0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2016 Apr., v. 227, no. 4 p.100-100dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-2801-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013200170300001600302500001900318520151200337536018901849592002802038650000802066650001202074650001302086650001902099650001402118650002202132650001302154653001702167653001502184653002502199653001002224653001602234700002002250700002702270700002602297700002602323773011502349856008602464852000902550655001202559IND60718165820221118212332.0210128e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071816582DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2020.17538452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScoppola, Anna10aPhylogenetic relationships and taxonomic issues in Gastridium (Poaceae) inferred from plastid and nuclear DNA sequence analysis  ap. 947-960.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGastridium P. Beauv. is a Mediterranean-Paleotropical member of the Poaceae family, whose species number and diversity are still imperfectly known. We examined patterns of DNA diversity at two plastid (trnH-psbA, trnL-F) and one nuclear (ITS) DNA markers in 44 individuals of the four taxa (Gastridium lainzii, G. phleoides, G. scabrum, G. ventricosum) recently recognised by different authors, based on morpho-ecological descriptors. Diversity data were explored with multiple statistical and phylogenetic tools, and integrated with available GenBank sequences of Gastridium and closely related genera. Despite the limited variability detected, evidence of within-taxon genetic cohesion and estimates of molecular divergence comparable with those of species in the same subtribal lineage (Agrostidinae) were recovered. The identified plastid genealogies are congruent with a subdivision of the genus into four distinct species, coherently with collected morphological descriptors. Phylogenetic reconstructions with ITS were less corresponding to the four taxa, possibly due to reticulation and polyploidization. The broader plastid and nuclear tree topologies were consistent with previous assessments, highlighting the overall little resolution of species and genera within Agrostidinae, and the close relationships shared by Gastridium and Triplachne. The hypothesis of closely related, but separately evolving, lineages within Gastridium is discussed, suggesting a re-evaluation of its current taxonomy.  aThis research was supported by MIUR (Ministry for Education, University and Research), Law 232/2016, “Department of excellence” and the “Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo” Donation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPoaceae 3acohesion 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3ataxonomy 0aAgrostidinae 0aGastridium 0amediterranean region 0anrDNA 0aplastid DNA1 aCardoni, Simone1 aPellegrino, Mariangela1 aLópez-Tirado, Javier1 aSimeone, Marco Cosimo0 tPlant biosystems.g2020 Nov. 1, v. 154, no. 6 p.947-960dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2020.17538453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01278naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013600167300001600303520025000319592002800569650002400597650001500621650001100636650001100647653001500658653001500673700001600688700001900704773015300723856007900876852000900955655001200964IND60522661320221117212047.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052266132DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1980-9-10332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfletschinger, J.14aThe Primary Structure o f the Monomeric Hemoglobin (Erytrocruorin) Component CTT IV o f Chironomus thummi thummi (Insecta, Diptera)  ap. 840-843.  aThe primary structure of the monomeric hemoglobin (Erythrocruorin) CTT IV from larvae of Chironomus thummi thummi (Diptera) is presented.

However, the pharmacokinetics of dietary source of SLs remain largely unknown. In this open-label and single-dose trial, sixteen healthy volunteers consumed 150 g of Brussels/witloof chicory juice containing 48.77 μmol SLs in 5 min. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected before and after chicory consumption in 24 h. No SLs were detected in the serum, urine, and fecal samples before chicory consumption in all of the participants. Chicory consumption increased lactucin, 11β,13-dihydrolactucin, and their glucuronide/sulfate conjugates, rather than lactucopicrin and 11β,13-dihydrolactucopicrin, as well as glycosylated SLs in biological samples. The peak concentration of total SLs in serum reached 284.46 nmol/L at 1 h, while, in urine, this peak was 220.3 nmol between 2 and 6 h. The recovery of total SLs in blood, urine, and feces was 7.03%, 1.13%, and 43.76% of the ingested dose, respectively. Human fecal suspensions with intestinal microbiota degraded glycosylated SLs in chicory, and converted lactucopicrin and 11β,13-dihydrolactucopicrin to lactucin and 11β,13-dihydrolactucin, respectively. Collectively, Brussels/witloof chicory SLs are poorly bioavailable and they undergo partial gut microbial and phase II metabolism in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium intybus 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3achicory 3adigestive system 3adosage 3afeces 3aglycosylation 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajuices 3apharmacokinetics 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3asulfates 3aurine1 aHe, Luanying 1 aZheng, Jiakun 1 aLi, Qing 1 aLiu, Xiuping 1 aWang, Dongliang 0 tNutrients.g2020 Nov. 28, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121236753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010700164300001800271520161700289592002801906596004401934596006601978650001902044650001202063650001402075650002102089650002202110650002602132650000902158650001302167650001402180650002002194650001402214650001302228650001502241650000902256700005402265700001802319700001602337773016202353856008302515852000902598655001202607IND60774611520221122043741.0221002e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077461152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-021-03452-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Y. -D.10aRedox-reactive contaminant removal using biochar-coated metals: the role of electrochemical properties  ap. 4209-4220.  aThe reductive removal of redox-reactive contaminants, including 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 4-chlorophenol, chromate, and selenate, using biochar-coated metals and the relationship between reduction kinetics and electrochemical properties of biochar-coated metals were examined. To investigate the role of electrochemical properties, one-electron-transfer electrochemical reduction and oxidation mediators were used to determine electron-accepting capacities (EACs) and electron-donating capacities (EDCs) of biochar, zero-valent iron [Fe(0)], FeS, zero-valent zinc [Zn(0)], biochar-coated Fe(0), biochar-coated FeS, and biochar-coated Zn(0). Kinetic analysis showed that biochar coating resulted in decreasing the reductive transformation of contaminants by biochar-coated metals, suggesting that the sorbed molecules were further reduced to reduction products. Biochar, metals, and biochar-coated metal EDCs were an order of magnitude higher than their EACs, ranging between 11.01 and 38.61 mmol e⁻/g. The linear relationship between the EDCs and kinetic rates revealed that electron transfer from the core metal to sorbed contaminant oxidation is responsible for the reductive removal. A significant and irreversible EDC decrease generates electrons for the reductive transformation. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt to examine the electrochemical properties of metal-biochar composites and their relationship with reduction kinetics of various contaminants. Our results indicate that biochar-coated metals can be used as a sorbent and reductant for redox-reactive contaminants in subsurface environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020R1A2C1010855cMinistry of Education  aP0008421cKorea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology 3a4-chlorophenol 3abiochar 3achromates 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironmental science 3airon 3akinetics 3aoxidation 3areducing agents 3aselenates 3asorbents 3atechnology 3azinc1 aOh, S. -Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6272-51521 aRajagopal, R.1 aRyu, K. -S.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2022 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.4209-4220dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03452-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008900166300001600255520057300271592002800844650002700872650001600899650001500915650001100930650001200941650001600953653001500969653002800984653001801012700002401030700001601054700002201070700002401092773015301116856007901269852000901348655001201357IND60522661420221117212057.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052266142DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1980-9-10342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrai, Melchiorre10aESR Spectra o f Normal Human Serum after Treatment with Complement Activating Agents  ap. 844-847.  aWe describe the appearance of a free-radical signal in the ESR spectrum of normal human serum incubated with several complement activating agents.

M.10aImpact of partial confinement of reservoir lotic–lentic transition region on its sediment trapping efficiency  ap. 3797-3818.  aReservoir lotic–lentic transition regions typically show significant spatial and temporal hydro-sedimentological variability, highly influenced by their geometry. Previous assessment of the geometrical dependence of reservoir siltation overlooked potential impacts of internal structural alteration of such regions on their sediment trapping efficiency (STE). This study tested a hypothesis that partial confinement of such regions—a relatively inexpensive intervention—can generally increase their STE, thus contributing to sediment management with enhanced siltation control. Three-dimensional computational modelling of hydrodynamics and transport and deposition of suspended cohesive sediments was used to estimate STE for an idealised lotic–lentic transition region with subtropical characteristics under no-confinement and two types of partial confinement. A well-known and tested model was used with a thoroughly verified, mesh independent, numerically stable and mass conserving scenario modelling approach. Over 50 physically sound steady-state scenarios reproduced ranges of hydro-sedimentological and environmental conditions. Wind drove large-scale horizontal and vertical recirculating flow structures with which partial confinement interfered causing hydrodynamic discontinuity between ensuing upstream and downstream portions of the transition region. The study hypothesis was confirmed under such flow-pattern interference, as partial confinement increased STE by up to 16% relatively to corresponding unconfined setups. Transient conditions and other types of transition regions in real reservoirs need further investigation, but this finding is generally in-line with ‘pre-reservoir’ effects and had not been shown before. Such enhanced localised settling within lotic–lentic transition regions caused by partial confinement can provide additional control over reservoir siltation when considered in combination with other sediment management alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental science 3ageometry 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3asediments 3atechnology1 aRauen, W.

The n-butanolic fraction obtained from successive fractionation of the methanolic extract exhibited activity against HepG2 (IC₅₀ = 2.6 μg/ml). Therefore, this fraction was subjected to separation using different chromatographic techniques. Five compounds, 1-5, were isolated and identified as: (22S,25S)-16β,22,26-trihydroxy-cholest-4- en-3-one-16-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-xylopyranoside (1), (22S,25S)-16β,22,26-trihydroxy- cholest-4-en-3-one-16-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)-β-d-glucopyranoside (2), sucrose (3), d-pinitol (4) and 3β-hydroxy-5α-pregn-16(17)en-20-one-3-O-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→2)- [β-d-xylopyranosyl-(1→3)]-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-D-galactopyranoside (5) on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical data. The three steroidal compounds 1, 2 and 5 were also tested against the same cell line HepG2 and their IC₅₀ values were 2.4, 2.2 and 1.1 μg/ml, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribulus 3achromatography 3acytotoxicity 3afractionation 3aglycosides 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethanol 3aneoplasm cells 3aspectroscopy 3asucrose 0aTribulus macropterus 0aCholestane Glycosides 0aCytotoxic1 aEl-Nahas, Hanan A.1 aEl-Wakil, Eman A.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 62, no. 5-6 p.319-325dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2007-5-6023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013000163300001800293520087000311592002801181650001301209650002301222650002701245650001901272650002301291650001701314650002201331650000901353650002301362650000701385650001501392700005501407700001601462700005501478773016201533856008301695852000901778655001201787IND60774611720221122054240.0221002e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077461172DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-021-03277-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaheem, K.10aEnergy efficient removal of COD from landfill leachate wastewater using electrocoagulation: parametric optimization using RSM  ap. 3625-3636.  aIn the present work, electrocoagulation method was employed using iron/aluminium electrodes for COD removal in the treatment of landfill leachate. The process was optimized with variables such as initial pH, applied current, initial COD and electrolysis time experimentally varied as per CCD design to know their influence on chosen response variables viz.

The optimum conditions found were pH 5, applied current 0.5 A, initial COD concentration 5450 ppm and application time 9 min to achieve 64.25% efficiency with 0.59 W hour per gram removal of COD. The results prove that electrocoagulation process could be suitably used as an effective method for treatment of leachate.

Similarly the recent reduction in the cost of thermal infrared cameras also offers new promise in this field, as they have the advantage over conventional RGB cameras of being able to distinguish animals based on their body heat and being able to detect animals at night. However, the use of drone-mounted thermal infrared cameras comes with several technical challenges. In this article, we address some of these issues, namely thermal contrast problems due to heat from the ground, absorption and emission of thermal infrared radiation by the atmosphere, obscuration by vegetation, and optimizing the flying height of drones for a best balance between covering a large area and being able to accurately image and identify animals of interest. We demonstrate the application of these methods with a case study using field data and make the first ever detection of the critically endangered riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) in thermal infrared data. We provide a web-tool so that the community can easily apply these techniques to other studies (http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/aricburk/uav_calc/).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abody temperature 3acameras 3acase studies 3aflight 3aheat 3ainfrared radiation 3amonitoring 3arabbits 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 3awildlife1 aRashman, Maisie1 aWich, Serge1 aSymons, Andy1 aTheron, Cobus1 aLongmore, Steve0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 40, no. 2 p.439-467dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.15583723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245015700202500002000359520160000379592002801979650001102007650001202018650000902030650001602039700006302055700002502118700002402143700005802167773011702225856007402342852000902416655001202425IND60771514720221117222510.0220325e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077151472DNAL7 a10.1002/vetr.10652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLooijen, Maty G.

The aim of this study was to determine the agreement of grading different parameters, and combinations of those, in radiographs of the spinous processes of the equine thoracolumbar spine in the scope of a pre‐purchase examination. We hypothesized that agreement is variable and interpretation of these radiographs is difficult. METHODS: Radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine of healthy horses (N = 100) were assessed by three observers. Spinous processes were separately graded for interspinous space width, modelling, radiopacities, radiolucencies and isolated opacities dorsally. Inter‐ and intra‐observer agreement was assessed for individual and combinations of parameters. RESULTS: Agreement (inter‐ and intra‐observer) was good for the following parameters: interspinous space width, isolated opacities dorsally, beak‐shaped formations craniodorsally and modelling cranioventrally. The agreement increased slightly for a sum of specific parameters such as radiopacities, modelling, dorsal abnormalities and related abnormalities involving increased opacity, modelling and osseous cyst‐like lesions. Agreement for the total radiographic abnormalities per back was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Grading of thoracolumbar radiographs in horses without back pain showed good inter‐ and intra‐observer agreement for specific parameters and these should be used in future grading of spinous processes. Limitations should be considered in pre‐purchase examinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahorses 3aopacity 3apain 3aradiography1 aHanousek, Katherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9771-82191 aMaree, Jacques T.

Phytoremediation is used as a progressive rehabilitation strategy to stabilize tailings sites, reduce soil erosion and immobilize heavy metal contaminants. However, in order to develop successful and sustainable phytoremediation methods, native plants must overcome several abiotic stressors. This review examines publicly available literature to determine the potential of repurposed tailings materials, in the form of rock dust nanoparticles (RDNPs), as a nanopriming agent to improve seed germination and seedling vigor of native boreal forest species, for mine reclamation purposes. The review of literature on the effects of nanopriming with metal- and non-metal-based nanoparticles (NPs) on germination percentage (GP) and seedling vigor index (SVI), suggests that nanopriming techniques could be a useful strategy to improve GP and SVI. Overall, the majority of the literature reported an equal or increased GP and an increase in SVI in nanoprimed seeds. Most of the literature employs the use of nanopriming techniques in agricultural practices, which creates an opportunity to expand on nanotechnologies for land reclamation purposes using native boreal forest species. A review of literature on RD application as a soil amendment, reveals the discrepancies in results regarding plant growth and development, likely due to the variability in mineral composition and stability between RD sources. However, by utilizing RDNPs as a seed priming agent, essential or beneficial elements may become more readily available for seedling uptake. The availability of essential and beneficial nutrients at functional concentrations indicates that RD from Pine Cove Mine in Newfoundland, Canada could potentially be utilized as RDNPs as a seed priming agent. Further research is required to determine the effects of RDNPs as a seed priming agent in improving GP and SVI of native boreal forest species for mine reclamation purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aboreal forests 3adust 3aenvironment 3aheavy metals 3aindigenous species 3aland degradation 3aland restoration 3amineral content 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3asoil amendments 3asoil erosion 3avigor 0aNanopriming 0aNative species 0aLand reclamation 0aRock dust 0aSeed germination 0aSeedling vigor1 aGalagedara, Lakshman1 aThomas, Raymond1 aCheema, Mumtaz1 aSobze, Jean-Marie0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 25, v. 775 p.145139-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1451393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245008700212300001600299520152600315592002801841596010301869596008701972650001902059650002102078650002602099650002502125650001702150650001902167650002302186650002302209650002502232650001502257650001802272650001702290650001102307650001602318650001802334650001202352650002502364650001002389651002202399651001002421700002902431700002802460700002002488700001902508700002102527700001802548773014202566856008102708852000902789655001202798IND60621504120221117050259.0181119e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062150412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-018-1143-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Marcos, Daphne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6239-651X10aSoil carbon stocks and exchangeable cations in monospecific and mixed pine forests  ap. 831-847.  aMany studies highlight the role of mixed versus monospecific forests to supply numerous ecosystem services. Most reports of positive mixture effects on carbon storage focus on mixtures that combine tree species with contrasting traits, but little is known on the effect of mixing species that are expected to behave quite similarly as they belong to the same genus. In this study, we assessed the effect of mixed versus monospecific stands of Pinus sylvestris and P. pinaster on carbon storage and exchangeable cations along the soil profile, based on research with six triplets in the northern Iberian Peninsula (Spain). One soil pit of at least 40 cm depth was dug at each plot for organic and mineral horizons characterization. Two trends were found: in the topsoil, higher values of carbon stock and total organic carbon were found in P. sylvestris stands, lower in P. pinaster stands and intermediate in mixed stands; this pattern was related to the C/N ratio of the forest floor. In the intermediate soil layers, it tends to be higher in mixed stands and is related to percentage of fine roots and to the greater thickness of the first mineral horizon. Differences in soil exchangeable cations among stands were related to the total organic carbon content. These results improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying soil carbon accumulation in mixed stands and emphasize the use of mixtures as a strategy to combat climate change, due to the advantage in the accumulation of carbon in the subsoil layers.  aPublisher supplied data  aFORMIXING.

It was observed that analytes usually have higher mass responses than their equimolar deuterated analogs leading to quantification discrepancy. The standard addition method was adopted on dimethyl azelate (DMA) and d₆-dimethyl azelate (d₆-DMA) to investigate possible reasons for this behavior. Cross contribution of mass responses, intermolecular deuterium–hydrogen exchange during chromatographic separation, and deviation in mass ionization response of C–H against C–D bonds were studied. GC–MS analysis revealed that neither cross contribution of ions nor H²/H exchange was responsible for the difference in responses between DMA and d₆-DMA. On the other hand, a study of carbon nucleus relaxation conducted by¹³C-NMR showed that relaxation rate of carbonyl carbon in d₆-DMA is faster than DMA (9 and 3 s⁻¹, respectively). This indicates rapid interaction between spin of deuterium nucleus with spin of unpaired electrons in the structure. Accordingly, DMA has more electrons in triplet/singlet state (i.e., unpaired electrons) in each time moment promoting propagation of radicalization reactions inside the electron impact chamber. In conclusion, this should increase the response of total ion current (TIC) and generate overestimated results for equimolar ratios of analytes such as dimethyl azelate, dimethyl adipate and dimethyl phthalate against their deuterated counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adeuterium 3adimethyl phthalate 3aelectrons 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aionization 3aions1 aKhanfar, Mohammad1 aAl-Hiari, Yusuf0 tChromatographia.g2015 Feb., v. 78, no. 3-4 p.251-258dSpringer-Verlagx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-014-2842-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245016400211300001600375520176000391536012002151592002802271650000902299650001402308650001002322650001302332650001402345650002002359650001902379650001202398650001502410650002702425653002902452653004402481653002002525653002802545700002102573700006202594773013302656856008202789852000902871655001202880IND60778960120221117224413.0220603e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077896012DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X2110385292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumartinet, Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4635-890810aOutcomes and postoperative complications after transpelvic urethrostomy used as first-line surgery in 38 male cats with obstructive lower urinary tract disease  ap. 558-564.  aThis article aimed to report on the short- and long-term outcomes after transpelvic urethrostomy (TPU) as a first-line surgery to treat obstructive lower urinary tract disease (OLUTD) in male cats. A retrospective review and follow-up owner telephone questionnaire for cats with OLUTD undergoing TPU as a first-line surgery between 2013 and 2019, at a single referral hospital, were performed. A minimum follow-up period of 1 year was required to be included in the study. Short- and long-term complications were defined as those that occurred, respectively, within or after the first 4 weeks postoperatively. Thirty-eight male cats were included. The short-term complication rate was 18%. Idiopathic lower urinary tract disease (ILUTD) and stomal stenosis (SS) were the two most frequent short-term complications. Long-term complications were reported in 34% of the cats and included ILUTD, urinary tract infection and SS. The mortality rate was 5%. Eighty-two percent of the owners were satisfied with the postoperative outcome. The most common reason for owner dissatisfaction was the occurrence of SS, especially because these complications required multiple surgical revisions to be definitively managed. The long-term quality of life was considered to be good to very good by 89% of the owners. Ninety-one percent of the cats were free of clinical urinary signs at the time of the questionnaire completion. TPU can be an acceptable first-line surgical technique to treat cats with OLUTD. Most cats experienced a good to very good quality of life after TPU. Most complications were transient or manageable medically. Most of the major complications were SS, which can be technically challenging to address and may require multiple revision surgeries.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3ahospitals 3amales 3amedicine 3amortality 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3asurgery 3atelephones 3aurinary tract diseases 0aTranspelvic urethrostomy 0aobstructive lower urinary tract disease 0astomal stenosis 0aurinary tract infection1 aBernard, Fabrice1 aBernardé, Antoine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0600-73640 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2022 June, v. 24, no. 6 p.558-564dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X2110385293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245011800183520167400301592002801975650002202003650001002025650001502035650001002050650002202060650001002082650001902092650001302111650001402124650000902138650001002147650001102157650001502168650001802183650000902201650002402210650001902234650001802253653001002271653002102281653000902302653000902311653001202320773011302332856009002445852000902535655001202544IND60688243620221118095604.0201213e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068824362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2020.1063502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorst, Gerhard van der,10aComputer Aided Sperm Analysis (CASA) in domestic animals: Current status, three D tracking and flagellar analysis  aComputer Aided Sperm Analysis is currently well established in domestic animals. Apart from sperm concentration and sperm motility assessment (percentage groupings, kinematics groupings) sperm morphology, sperm viability, sperm fragmentation and the acrosome reaction are automated as part of modern CASA systems. This review cum new original research paper focuses on providing baseline data on sperm concentration and motility in common domestic species of animals of proven fertility including bull, boar, horse, ram, goat, dog, donkey, chicken. There is a great need to establish quantitative baseline values for sperm quality, breed differences and to develop and apply relevant sperm functional tests that relates to fertilization outcome. These approaches need to be standardized. Two new approaches are presented in this work that are complimentary to CASA and provide a whole range of new visualizations and parameters that may assist to define sperm function and quality better. The first new approach shows how Two-D analysis using X and Y coordinates of CASA can be converted to Three-dimensional (3ᴰ) tracks. This method shows how sperm movement can be visualized in 3ᴰ despite several shortcomings. The second approach of flagellar analysis through the use of the FAST programme (Flagellar and Sperm Tracking) of the University of Birmingham group represents a new development and provides several new quantitative measures such as flagellar speed and energy output (in Watts) expended by each sperm. Together with CASA and other sperm functional parameters, FAST may provide new and novel insights in sperm biology and assist in fertility assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome reaction 3aasses 3aautomation 3aboars 3abreed differences 3abulls 3acell viability 3achickens 3acomputers 3adogs 3agoats 3ahorses 3akinematics 3anormal values 3arams 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 3asperm quality 0aSperm 0aDomestic animals 0aCASA 0aFAST 0aThree-D0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2020 Sept., v. 220 p.106350-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2020.1063503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008300169300001600252520106600268592002801334650004401362650002201406650002201428650002101450650002101471650001301492650004401505650001701549650002001566650001801586650002301604650002201627650002101649650002301670650003801693650003701731650001901768653002401787653001701811653003001828653002801858653004301886653003601929653003501965653004702000700001902047700001702066700001702083700001702100700001902117700001502136773010802151856008602259852000902345655001202354IND60525310020221118031050.0190318e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052531002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.09.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Huiqiong10aSynthesis of alginate derivative via the Ugi reaction and its characterization  ap. 757-763.  aIn this research, the systematic evaluation of fundamental properties of the alginate derivative (Ugi-Alg) synthesized by the Ugi reaction is presented. The structure of Ugi-Alg with the degree of substitution of 23.24% was confirmed by FT-IR and 1H NMR spectrometers. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate the amorphous structure and the crystal structure change of Ugi-Alg, which is possibly ascribed to the destruction of inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding interactions during the Ugi reaction. From thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and fluorescence spectrophotometer, Ugi-Alg shows high thermal stability and good amphiphilic functionality with the critical aggregation concentration of 0.07g/L in 0.15mol/L aqueous NaCl solution. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image and dynamic light scattering (DLS) reveal that stable Ugi-Alg self-aggregated micelle with the average size of 162.3nm and ζ potential at about −31.7mV could form in the aqueous media, which presents tremendous potential in pharmacology and tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3ahydrogen bonding 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apharmacology 3asodium chloride 3aspectrometers 3aspectrophotometers 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atissue engineering 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aAlginate derivative 0aUgi reaction 0aAmphiphilic functionality 0aSelf-aggregated micelle 0aSodium alginate (PubChem CID: 6850754) 0aFormaldehyde (PubChem CID: 712) 0aOctylamine (PubChem CID: 8143) 0aCyclohexyl isocyanide (PubChem CID: 79129)1 aChen, Xiuqiong1 aLi, Jiacheng1 aFeng, Yuhong1 aShi, Zaifeng1 aWang, Xianghui1 aLin, Qiang0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 136 p.757-763dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.09.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01525naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011700153300001800270520044300288592002800731650001600759650001400775650002300789650001700812650001700829650001400846700001500860700001600875700001200891700001600903700001200919700001600931773013300947856007401080852000901154655001201163IND60685715120221122065530.0200306e20200305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068571512DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc09781c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Di10aSalen-based hypercrosslinked polymer-supported Pd as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for C–H halogenation  ap. 2889-2892.  aIn this work, we report the first use of a salen-based hypercrosslinked polymer-supported Pd catalyst to carry out C–H halogenation.

Fluctuations in meteorological factors can modify human behavior and affect suicidal rates. We hypothesize that high temperatures can be associated with an increase rate of suicidal attempts. We included all the patients admitted to Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC) due to suicide attempts between the years 2002–2017 and were residents of Southern Israel. We computed two sets of regression models: first, a time stratified case-crossover design to control for seasonality and individual differences. Results are presented as odds ratio (OR) with confidence interval (CI); and then, time-series analyses to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and the cumulative effect of temperature on the daily incidences of emergency department (ED) admissions after suicide attempts. We stratified the analyses by demographic variables to identify significant individual differences. We identified 3100 attempts, by 2338 patients who lived in Be'er Sheva between 16 and 90 years of age; 421 patients made 2+ attempts. Suicide attempts were associated with a 5 °C increase during the summer season (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.22–2.08) and a 5 °C increase in all seasons was associated with those who have made multiple attempts (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.0005–1.38). The cumulative effect of 5 °C increment is associated with more suicide attempts over 2 days (IRR 1.10, 95% CI 0.98; 1.24) and 5 days (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00; 1.08). The associations were greater for patients with psychiatric diagnosis and patients with multiple attempts. In a stratified analysis by individual characteristics we didn't find significant association. High temperatures and low amount of precipitations are evidently of great impact on people's susceptibility to suicidal behavior, especially for individuals who have had a prior suicide attempt. Our findings indicate the need for public health attention in the summer when temperature increases precipitously over days, especially for those who have made a prior suicide attempt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aat-risk population 3aconfidence interval 3aenvironmental impact 3amedical facilities 3ameteorological parameters 3apatients 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3asuicide 3asummer 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aIsrael 0aSuicide attempts 0aTemperature 0aCase-crossover 0aTime-series 0aCumulative effect1 aVodonos, Alina1 aHassan, Lior1 aShalev, Hadar1 aNovack, Victor1 aNovack, Lena0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 May, v. 184 p.109314-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010900157300001800266520130900284592002801593650001901621650002901640650001601669650001601685650001401701650001501715650001801730650001701748650006601765650000901831650001301840650001201853650001301865650001301878650005801891650001701949653002201966653002901988653001702017653002002034653002502054653002602079653001202105653001402117700002002131700002002151700001902171700002702190773011902217856007502336852000902411655001202420IND60568319520180516000000.0170505e20131206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056831952DNAL7 a10.1021/pr40032732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaum, Florian10aAnalysis of the Endogenous Peptide Profile of Milk: Identification of 248 Mainly Casein-Derived Peptides  ap. 5447-5462.  aMilk is an excellent source of bioactive peptides. However, the composition of the native milk peptidome has only been partially elucidated. The present study applied matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) directly or after prefractionation of the milk peptides by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or OFFGEL fractionation for the comprehensive analysis of the peptide profile of raw milk. The peptide sequences were determined by MALDI-TOF/TOF or nano-ultra-performance liquid chromatography–nanoelectrospray ionization-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS. Direct MALDI-TOF-MS analysis led to the assignment of 57 peptides. Prefractionation by both complementary methods led to the assignment of another 191 peptides. Most peptides originate from αS₁-casein, followed by β-casein, and αS₂-casein. κ-Casein and whey proteins seem to play only a minor role as peptide precursors. The formation of many, but not all, peptides could be explained by the activity of the endogenous peptidases, plasmin or cathepsin D, B, and G. Database searches revealed the presence of 22 peptides with established physiological function, including those with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, immunomodulating, or antimicrobial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalphaS1-casein 3aantimicrobial properties 3abeta-casein 3acathepsin D 3adatabases 3adesorption 3afractionation 3akappa-casein 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amilk 3apeptides 3aplasmin 3aproteome 3araw milk 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3awhey protein 0apeptide profiling 0abioactive peptides: milk 0aMALDI-TOF-MS 0aESI-MS: caseins 0aOFFGEL fractionation 0aHPLC prefractionation 0aplasmin 0acathepsin1 aFedorova, Maria1 aEbner, Jennifer1 aHoffmann, Ralf1 aPischetsrieder, Monika0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2013 Dec. 06, v. 12, no. 12 p.5447-5462dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr40032733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245012400174300001600298520127500314592002801589650002001617650001801637650002001655650001501675650002201690650002801712650001101740650001301751650002301764650001701787650001601804650001501820651001901835653001401854653001701868653001401885653001601899653002501915700002201940700002401962700002101986700002302007773011102030856008302141852000902224655001202233IND60759726920221118041334.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075972692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2021.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbert, Ágnes-Júlia10aSeed production of co-occurring species: Regenerative strategies, plant economic spectrum or architectural constraints?  ap. 121-129.  aAlthough plant clonality is an important reproductive strategy complementing seed reproduction, their interrelationship is seldom studied. We evaluated how plant clonality, together with plant economics spectrum and architectural constraints, affect the generative reproduction characteristics of co-existing grassland species. For this purpose, we collected data on seed number, seed mass and seed yield (seed mass x seed number) per shoot of 56 herbaceous species from temperate grasslands in the White Carpathian Mts. (SE Czech Republic).Clonality had a weaker effect on seed traits than leaf economics and plant architecture. Metamer size showed the strongest relationship to seed number per shoot, while leaf dry matter content and canopy height were the most important factors affecting average seed mass in the studied species. Seed yield was affected by both leaf nitrogen and metamer size but only for plants with long lived shoots (di- and polycyclic). The negative correlation between seed mass and seed number per shoot for our dataset was confirmed.Our study did not support the idea that clonality is the most important factor affecting seed production in grassland species and pointed out complex relationships of coordinated traits in coexisting species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplied ecology 3acanopy height 3adata collection 3agrasslands 3aherbaceous plants 3aleaf dry matter content 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aplant architecture 3areproduction 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3aCzech Republic 0aClonality 0aPlant traits 0aSeed mass 0aSeed number 0aWhite Carpathian Mts1 aBitomský, Martin1 aGötzenberger, Lars1 aMudrák, Ondřej1 aKlimešová, Jitka0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2022 Feb., v. 58 p.121-129dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2021.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01614naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007200158300001800230520050900248592002800757650002200785650002300807650002100830650001900851650001100870650001300881650001100894650001300905700001600918700001400934700001800948700001200966700001600978700001800994773013301012856007401145852000901219655001201228IND60685715220221122065521.0200306e20200305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068571522DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc09841k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lanning12aA β-allyl carbamate fluorescent probe for vicinal dithiol proteins  ap. 2857-2860.  aThe first β-allyl carbamate fluorescent probe, AC-green, was reported for specifically imaging vicinal dithiol proteins (VDPs) in living systems.

This disease is caused primarily by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila found in water and transmitted by aerosol inhalation. This pathogen has a slow growth rate and can “hide” in amoeba, making it difficult to monitor by the traditional culture method on selective media. Tap water samples (n = 358) collected across the United States were tested for L. pneumophila by both culture and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). The presence of other bacteria was quantified by heterotrophic plate counts (HPC). Residual disinfectant concentrations (free chlorine or monochloramine) were measured in all samples. Legionella pneumophila had the highest prevalence and concentration in the chlorinated water samples that had a free‑chlorine value of less than 0.2 mg Cl₂/L. In total, 24% (87/358) of the samples were positive for L. pneumophila either by qPCR or 3% (11/358) were positive by culture. In chloramine-treated samples, L. pneumophila was detected by qPCR in 21% (31/148) and 1% (2/148) by culture, despite a high monochloramine residual >1 mg Cl₂/L. Despite the presence of a high disinfectant residual (>1 mg Cl₂/L), HPC counts were substantial. This study indicates that both culture and qPCR methods have limitations when predicting a potential risk for disease associated with L. pneumophila in tap water. Measuring disinfectant residuals and quantifying HPC in water samples may be useful adjunct parameters for reducing Legionellosis' risk from public water supplies at high-risk locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aaerosols 3abacteria 3abreathing 3achlorine 3adisinfectants 3aenvironment 3alegionellosis 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3atap water 0aqPCR 0aHPC 0aCFU 0aUS EPA 0aCDC 0aCE 0aLegionella pneumophila 0aCulture 0aHeterotrophic bacteria 0aqPCR 0aMonitoring 0aResidual0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 20, v. 774 p.145142-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1451423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013000168520143000298592002801728650002201756650001801778650001901796650001601815650001201831650002301843650001401866650001901880650002101899650002501920653001601945653001801961653001901979700001901998700001602017700001802033700001502051700001802066700001702084700002202101700001902123700001802142773011402160856008602274852000902360655001202369IND60746040520221116173719.0220118e20220105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074604052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1267252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Sosan10aDeciphering van der Waals interaction between polypropylene and carbonated fly ash from experimental and molecular simulation  aPollution emitted from power plants, including a considerable amount of fly ash (FA) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), annually increases and is challenging from an environmentally friendly and sustainable point of view. To date, laboratory-scaled approaches cannot efficiently replace the FA-landfilling and mitigate the stress from CO₂ emission. Here, a practically operatable fundamental work by combining carbonated FA (C-FA)—immobilizing CO₂ in FA—and polypropylene (PP) matrix is reported and reveals abnormal mechanical and thermal features clarified by calculating van der Waals (vdW) interaction from an atomic scale. This is the first study wherein the interaction between instantaneous dipole moment-induced PP and fillers is simulated and examined. The vdW interactions at the (hetero)interfaces are –59.66, –82.30, and −224.39 kJ mol⁻¹ Å⁻² for PP, calcium oxide (CaO; before carbonation), and calcium carbonate (CaCO₃; after carbonation), respectively, which provides concrete theoretical support for interesting findings such as the independence of tensile strength on filler loadings and “well-grown” interface-induced higher conductivity characteristics of the composites. Therefore, this work can offer practical solutions to mitigate pollution, provide a new perspective on fundamental physical interactions, and guide the development of practical next-generation composite materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3afly ash 3amolecular dynamics 3apollution 3apolypropylenes 3atensile strength 3avan der Waals forces 0aCO2 capture 0aVan der Waals 0aDFT simulation1 aJin, Sung Hoon1 aKim, Yongha1 aSeo, Jin Sung1 aSo, Jae-Il1 aKim, Jincheol1 aLee, Yongjin1 aBaeck, Sung-Hyeon1 aShim, Sang Eun1 aQian, Yingjie0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Jan. 05, v. 421 p.126725-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1267253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245012100180520189500301592002802196650001302224650002402237650002202261650002002283650002502303650001002328650001802338650002202356650001502378650002202393650002002415650001902435650001602454653000802470653002502478653001802503653001702521653001302538700002202551700002602573700001802599773010402617856008502721852000902806655001202815IND60685105520221116234402.0200607e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068510552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Angela Maria da,10aConcentrations levels and effects of 17alpha-Ethinylestradiol in freshwater and marine waters and bivalves: A review  aPharmaceutical drugs are contaminants of emerging concern and are amongst the most frequent in the aquatic environment. Even though a vast literature indicate that pharmaceuticals exert negative impacts towards aquatic organisms, mainly in vertebrates, there is still limited information regarding the effects of these drugs in freshwater and marine bivalves. Marine bivalves have a high ecological and socio-economic value and are considered good bioindicator species in ecotoxicology and risk assessment programs. Furthermore, another lacking point on these studies is the absence of bioconcentration data, with no clear relationship between the concentration of drugs on tissue and the biological effects. 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a synthetic hormone with high estrogenic potency that was added to the Watch List adopted by the European Commission stating the priority substances to be monitored. Thus, this review summarizes the current knowledge on the concentration levels and effects of EE2 on freshwater and marine bivalves. The inclusion in the Watch List, the presence in freshwater and marine systems, and the impact exerted on aquatic biota, even at trace concentrations, justify the review devoted to this pharmaceutical drug. Globally the available studies found that EE2 induces individual and sub-individual (e.g. tissue, cellular, biochemical and molecular levels of biological organization) impacts in bivalves. Essentially, this estrogenic compound, even in trace concentrations, was found to have accumulated in wild and laboratory exposed bivalves. The most common effects reported were changes on the reproductive function and energy metabolism. The studies used in this review support keeping the EE2 on the Watch List and highlight the need to increase the number of monitorization studies since clear negative effects were exerted on bivalves by this drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic organisms 3abioaccumulation 3abioactive properties 3adrugs 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy metabolism 3afreshwater 3aindicator species 3arisk assessment 3asocioeconomics 3avertebrates 0aEE2 0aEstrogenic compounds 0aInvertebrates 0aAccumulation 0aToxicity1 aSilva, Mónica G.1 aSoares, Amadeu M.V.M.1 aFreitas, Rosa0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 June, v. 185 p.109316-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012300165520120300288592002801491650002501519650002501544650001001569650001001579650001301589650001301602650001101615650002101626650001601647653000901663653001301672653003001685653002101715700002201736700002501758773012201783856008101905852000901986655001201995IND60731320520221120054454.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073132052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1113012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeylan, Hacer10aImprovement of functional cake formulation using Jerusalem artichoke flour as inulin source and resistant starch (RS4)  aIn this study, wheat flour in cake formulation was replaced with resistant starch (RS), Jerusalem artichoke flour (JAF) and RS + JAF combination at the rate of 10, 20, 30 and 40%, and cake production was conducted with and without guar gum. The effects of guar gam, RS and JAF as individual and in combination on some physical, chemical and sensory cake properties were determined. The use of RS at high ratios, or JAF and RS + JAF combination over 10% ratios in cake formulation, decreased volume and symmetry index and increased hardness of the cake samples. The utilization of guar gum increased both the volume index and hardness of the cake samples. When JAF was used as an individual or in combination in cake formulation, crust and crumb L* and b* color values of cake reduced. JAF increased ash, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, Ca, K and Mg contents of cake samples from 1.52 g/100 g, 2778 mg GAE/kg, 17.9%, 44.1 mg/100 g, 141.3 mg/100 g and 17.7 mg/100 g up to 2.07 g/100 g, 4506 mg GAE/kg, 33.6%, 55.9 mg/100 g, 343.7 mg/100 g and 25.6 mg/100 g, respectively.

Breeding for CBSD resistant varieties that are also preferred by farmers is an integral part of managing the disease. The main objective of the study was to determine the genetic relationship between farmer-preferred varieties from Mozambique with those from Tanzania whose resistance to CBSD is known and some of which are being used as parents in quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection studies. To achieve this, 103 genotypes collected from farmers’ field in three provinces of Mozambique were genotyped together with five varieties from Tanzania whose CBSD response is well known. Thirty-five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with a high minor allele frequency in East African landraces were used. Results indicated that seven Mozambican genotypes were genetically similar to either one of the four Tanzanian CBSD resistant genotypes while Xino Nn'gole was genetically identical to Namikonga a CBSD resistant variety, based on the SNPs used here. Little genetic differentiation was observed in cassava between provinces, with the majority of genetic variation distributed within individual genotypes (98%) rather than among provinces (2%). Both observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity in three provinces were generally high (Ho = 0.496) and (He = 0.455). There is a high likelihood that the eight genotypes similar/identical to those from Tanzania may share the same QTL associated with CBSD resistance thus should be further evaluated for agronomic traits as well as response to CBSD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCassava brown streak virus 3aManihot esculenta 3aagronomic traits 3acassava 3acrop production 3afarmers 3agene frequency 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3alandraces 3aparents 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aMozambique 3aTanzania 0afarmer preferred traits 0agenetic relationships1 aZacarias, Anabela1 aMondjana, Ana1 aMagaia, Hilário1 aFerguson, Morag1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7763-51730 tPlant genetic resources.g2018 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.533-543dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621180001263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012800162300001600290520140300306592002801709650002401737650002001761650002101781650002001802650002201822650001301844650004201857650003101899650002101930650000901951650002701960650003001987650001302017650001002030651001002040651001802050653002102068653001502089653002102104653002702125700001602152700001902168700005602187773012902243856008102372852000902453655001202462IND60652393220221118004028.0190712e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065239322DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621180001382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ning10aDevelopment of novel polymorphic microsatellite markers in the invasive plant shortawn foxtail (Alopecurus aequalis Sobol.)  ap. 564-567.  aShortawn foxtail (Alopecurus aequalis Sobol.) is an invasive and highly troublesome weed species originating from North America that has become widespread across China. Since its proliferation seriously threatens crop production worldwide, understanding its genetic diversity is critical for developing a forecasting system for integrated pest management plans. To accelerate the application of molecular markers in A. aequalis, this study aimed to develop a set of expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers using previous high-throughput sequencing data. In this study, a total of 1411 SSR loci were identified from 95,479 unigenes. Tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were the most abundant type with a frequency of 66.27%, followed by di- (24.95%) and tetra-nucleotide (8.78%). Among the loci, 584 primer pairs were successfully designed for marker development. Subsequently, a subset of 36 primer pairs was randomly selected and synthesized, of which 12 (33.33%) pairs successfully revealed abundant allelic polymorphism. Additionally, to investigate their utility, the genotypes of 160 individuals from 20 natural populations representing diverse wild genotypes of A. aequalis were analysed by using these 12 polymorphic markers. These novel SSR markers developed here are reliable and useful for genetic analysis on this invasive plant and will greatly enrich its genetic resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlopecurus aequalis 3acrop production 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintegrated pest management 3ainvasive species 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aunigenes 3aweeds 3aChina 3aNorth America 0aGenetic resource 0agrass weed 0amolecular marker 0asimple sequence repeat1 aYan, Yanyan1 aLau, Wai Tong,1 aWang, Jinxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5597-226X0 tPlant genetic resources.g2018 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.564-567dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621180001383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04501naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024001700134024002100151024003700172024004400209024001200253040001800265100002300283245006800306300001600374506017300390506007600563506003100639520170300670592002802373596011202401596004502513596007802558596005402636596005002690506003702740650001602777650001302793650002402806650001502830650001202845650001402857650000902871650001602880650002002896650001702916650001502933650001402948650001302962650001502975650002002990650002103010650003003031650002203061650001703083650001303100651001803113653000803131653000903139653000703148653000803155653002303163653002503186653001703211700002303228700002303251700001903274773010803293856008403401856011203485956008403597961001703681852000903698655001203707IND60525433120221207105005.0190318e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052543312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2016.04.0042chorus7 a3172652aris7 a10113/632862hdl7 a10.1016/j.still.2016.04.0042doi7 a10.1016/j.still.2016.04.0042chorusOpen8 ans11527  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Jane M.F.10aCorn stover harvest changes soil hydrology and soil aggregation  ap. 106-115.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIn the United States, commercial-scale cellulosic-ethanol production using corn (Zea mays L.) stover has become a reality. As the industry matures and demand for stover increases, it is important to determine the amount of biomass that can be sustainably harvested while safe-guarding soil quality and productivity. Specific study objectives were to measure indices of soil hydrological and aggregate stability responses to harvesting stover; since stover harvest may negatively impact soil hydrological and physical properties. Responses may differ with tillage management; thus, this paper reports on two independent studies on a tilled (Chisel field) and untilled field (NT1995 field). Each field was managed in a corn/soybean (Glycine max [Merr.]) rotation and with two rates of stover return: (1) all returned (Full Return Rate) and (2) an aggressive residue harvest leaving little stover behind (Low Return Rate). Unconfined field soil hydraulic properties and soil aggregate properties were determined. Hydrological response to residue treatments in the Chisel field resulted in low water infiltration for both rates of residue removal. In NT1995 field, Full Return Rate had greater capacity to transmit water via conductive pathways, which were compromised in Low Return Rate. Collectively, indices of soil aggregation in both experiments provided evidence that the aggregates were less stable, resulting in a shift toward more small aggregates at the expense of larger aggregates when stover is not returned to the soil. In both fields, aggressive stover harvest degraded soil physical and hydrological properties. No tillage management did not protect soil in absence of adequate residue.  aPublisher supplied data  cNorth Central Regional SunGrant Center at South Dakota State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008213  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUS-DOE − Office of Biomass Productsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006160  cUSDA-ARS-REAPdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cUSDA-NIFAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aaggregate stability 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3achiseling 3acorn 3acorn stover 3acrop production 3aenergy crops 3aharvesting 3ahydrology 3aindustry 3ano-tillage 3asoil aggregates 3asoil aggregation 3asoil hydraulic properties 3asoil productivity 3asoil quality 3asoybeans 3aUnited States 0aASW 0aDASD 0aEF 0aMWD 0aResidue management 0aCellulosic bioenergy 0aSoil quality1 aStrock, Jeffrey S.1 aTallaksen, Joel E.1 aReese, Michael0 tSoil & tillage research.g2016 Aug., v. 161 p.106-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/632863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/1727_0.pdf  aUSDAUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015400167300001600321520181300337592002802150650001602178650001302194650002202207650002102229650002002250650001502270650001202285650002402297650001302321650002102334650001402355650002602369650002002395650001202415700002702427700002102454700002302475700002402498773011202522856008102634852000902715655001202724IND60585157020221116143911.0171103e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058515702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-017-9833-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarneros, Elena10aEffect of different cryoprotectant procedures on the recovery and maturation ability of cryopreserved Pinus pinea embryogenic lines of different ages  ap. 469-477.  aStrategies for genetic improvement programs of Pinus pinea L, an important tree species of the Mediterranean ecosystem, are focused on increasing pine nut yield. Somatic embryogenesis and cryopreservation of elite genotypes are emerging as key components of advanced forest breeding programs. This study was carried out with embryogenic lines of different ages obtained from selected half-sib families of the species. The effect of three cryoprotectant procedures on the recovery and maturation ability was tested in embryogenic lines that showed different growth rate, two of them at different ages. In general, cryopreservation drastically reduced growth rates of frozen and rewarmed tissues; however, the use of 5% PEG–sucrose–DMSO dramatically increased growth rates of rewarmed embryogenic cultures. Overall, embryogenic lines of stone pine were suitable for cryopreservation. Seven out of eight lines were recovered, although the initial growth rates were variable. Five of six lines including the three oldest ones were recovered using 5% PEG–sucrose–DMSO. No relation was observed between age and growth rate of embryogenic lines and their response to cryopreservation. The line 2F47 showed the most stable response after long-term subculture and recovery after cryopreservation, at different ages. On the contrary, younger embryogenic lines either recovered after cryopreservation or did not, depending on the applied procedure. Maturation of some of the older lines was restored or enhanced after cryopreservation. Somatic embryos were obtained in three out of five tested embryogenic lines recovered from cryopreservation. However, only a few plantlets from cryopreserved lines were regenerated indicating the process must be optimized further before it is a practical adjunct to breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinea 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agenetic improvement 3agenotype 3ain vitro studies 3aplantlets 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 3atissues1 aHernández, Inmaculada1 aToribio, Mariano1 aDíaz-Sala, Carmen1 aCelestino, Cristina0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2017 Oct., v. 53, no. 5 p.469-477dSpringer USx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-017-9833-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007200169300001600241520056700257592002800824650001900852650001300871650001100884650001200895651002100907651001900928651001000947653001600957653001700973653002400990653001701014700001801031700002301049700002201072773008601094856008501180852000901265655001201274IND60133104820221116145923.0150518e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310482DNAL7 a10.2989/00306525.2015.10055582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Peter G10aBlue Petrels Halobaena caerulea discovered breeding on Gough Island  ap. 193-194.  aThe Blue Petrel Halobaena caerulea breeds at five subantarctic island groups and at islands off southern Chile in a narrow latitudinal band from 47° to 56° S on either side of the Antarctic Polar Front.

The discussion is illustrated with numerous examples of various types of materials that have been shown to intensify chemical and catalytic reactions, mass transfer, heat transfer, and momentum transfer processes, respectively. The role of process intensification in manufacturing of new, advanced materials is also discussed. In view of the importance of materials for process intensification, an update of the classical approach to the field of PI is postulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aequipment 3aheat transfer 3amanufacturing 3amass transfer 3amomentum 3aprocess design1 aYan, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8096-86220 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Apr. 30, v. 58, no. 22 p.9212-9222dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b014793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007600165300001800241520079400259592002801053650002301081650002301104650001901127650001001146650001601156650002201172653001401194653001301208653001401221653001801235653000901253700002001262700001301282700001501295700001801310700001701328700002001345700002201365700001301387700001901400700002001419773008101439856008101520852000901601655001201610IND60551442020221123045029.0161018e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055144202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhan-Xing10aDevelopment of a practical and scalable synthesis of anti-HBV drug Y101  ap. 9592-9600.  aThe process research and development of a practical and scalable synthetic method towards Anti-HBV Drug N-[N-benzoyl-O-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-l-tyrosyl]-l-phenylalaninol (Y101) was described.

As part of the collaboration between Medicinal Chemistry and Research active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), a fit for purpose route for the kilo scale synthesis of Y101 was developed. In contrast, the improved route described here did not require purification by column chromatography for all steps, and the formation of impurities was effectively suppressed.

This has resulted in environmental degradations in various forms. Harnessing biogas energy at household level can be a sustainable energy option for low income households. Based on primary data collected using a household survey and the use of propensity score matching model, this study analyses the contribution of biogas energy to reduction in firewood and charcoal consumption of households and its role in the management of cattle dung and human excreta in Ofla district, Ethiopia. The empirical findings show that the fuel wood and charcoal consumptions of biogas adopter households were on average reduced by 143.55 kg hh⁻¹ month⁻¹ (45% reduction) and 16 kg hh⁻¹ month⁻¹ (50.9% reduction) respectively compared to their non-adopter counterparts. Each biogas adopter household utilises about 2.1 kg day⁻¹, 7.2 kg day⁻¹ and 20 kg day⁻¹ of wet faeces, urine and cattle dung respectively via anaerobic digestion which would otherwise have been unsafely discharged into the local environment.  aAfrican Union Commission (AUC) for funding this study under the joint University of Ibadan and Pan African University training project.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acattle manure 3acharcoal 3adata collection 3aenergy 3afeces 3afuelwood 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3alow income households 3amodels 3arural areas 3aurine 3awaste management 3aEthiopia 0afuel wood 0acattle dung 0ahuman excreta1 aOlorunnisola, Abel0 tBiofuels.g2016 Sept. 2, v. 7, no. 5 p.479-487dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2016.11632113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009900168300001800267520192800285592002802213650001202241650001902253650002602272650001402298650001002312650001202322650001102334650001302345650001102358650001602369650001602385650001602401700002002417700006202437773011902499856008702618852000902705655001202714IND60686829620221121121906.0200319e20200217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068682962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b042912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarhat, A.10aLaminar Burning Velocity Measurement Using the Filtered Broadband Natural Emissions of Species  ap. 3772-3779.  aThe laminar flame speed plays a fundamental role in understanding hydrocarbon chemistry and is the basis of turbulent flame modeling. The main objective of this research is to visualize a flame and measure its speed using a new optical diagnostic technique, which is based on the natural radiative emissions of various species, mainly hydrocarbons, water, and carbon dioxide. This new technique has two main advantages over the Schlieren method. First, only one optical access is needed, and second, the preheat zone and the flame front can be observed, and their radiative emission can be quantified. In addition, the condition of the unburned gas in front of the flame can be studied using the new technique to evaluate some of the hypotheses behind unstretched flame speed measurement, such as the trivial change of the unburned gas state. To evaluate and validate the new optical diagnostic technique, the flame propagation of methane, oxygen, and nitrogen mixtures was studied using species infrared radiative emissions at broadband wavelengths in the range of 3.239–3.629 μm. The flame propagation was pictured using a high-speed infrared detector under constant pressure condition. The study was conducted at a mean initial gas pressure of 1.005 ± 0.0005 bar, a mean initial gas temperature of 296 ± 1.1 K, and four different equivalence ratios of approximately 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1. The flame speed measured using the new technique aligns well with the measured data from the literature using the Schlieren technique and simulated data using a detailed mechanism at the studied conditions. The measured data also show the presence of the radiative emission from the unburned gas. This observation contradicts the assumption of trivial temperature change of the unburned gas mixture during the flame propagation, which is widely used for unstretched flame speed measurement relative to the unburned gas state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3adiagnostic techniques 3aemissions 3afuels 3amethane 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3avelocimetry 3awavelengths1 aKumar, R.

V.10aGenome-wide marker-trait association analysis in a core set of Dolichos bean germplasm  ap. 1-11.  aAssociation mapping (AM), an alternative method of quantitative trait loci (QTL) discovery, exploits historic linkage disequilibrium (LD) present in natural populations. AM is effective in self-pollinated crops such as Dolichos bean as LD extends over longer genomic distance driven-by low rate of recombination and thereby requiring fewer markers for exploring marker-traits associations. A core set of Dolichos bean germplasm consisting of 64 accessions was evaluated for nine quantitative traits (QTs) during 2014 and 2015 rainy seasons and genotyped using 234 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. Substantial diversity was observed among the core set accessions at loci controlling QTs and 95 of the 234 SSR markers were found polymorphic. The structure analysis and low magnitude of fixation indices suggested weak population structure, which in-turn indicated the low possibility of false discovery rates in the marker-QTs association. The marker allele's scores were regressed onto phenotypes at nine QTs following general linear model and mixed linear model for exploring marker-QTs associations. Significantly higher number of SSR markers was found associated with genomic regions controlling nine QTs. A few of the markers such as KT Dolichos (KTD) 200 for days to 50% flowering, KTD 273 for fresh pod yield per plant and KTD 130 for fresh pods per plant explained ≥10% of the trait variations. The study could also identify a few SSR markers such as KTD 273, KTD 271 and KTD 130 linked to multiple traits. These linked SSR markers are suggested for validation for their use in marker-assisted Dolichos bean improvement programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDolichos 3aLablab 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acrops 3aflowering 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3alinear models 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotype 3aplant genetic resources 3apods 3apopulation structure 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3aself-pollination 3awet season 0aassociation mapping 0adiversity 0aGWAS 0aLab lab 0aMLM1 aRamesh, S.1 aGowda, M.

The identification of major-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for traits related to salinity tolerance and understanding of QTL × environment interactions (QEIs) can help in more precise and faster development of salinity-tolerant rice varieties through marker-assisted breeding. Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from IR29/Hasawi (a novel source of salinity) were screened for salinity tolerance in the IRRI phytotron in the Philippines (E1) and in two other diverse environments in Senegal (E2) and Tanzania (E3). QTLs were mapped for traits related to salinity tolerance at the seedling stage. RESULTS: The RILs were genotyped using 194 polymorphic SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms). After removing segregation distortion markers (SDM), a total of 145 and 135 SNPs were used to construct a genetic linkage map with a length of 1655 and 1662 cM, with an average marker density of 11.4 cM in E1 and 12.3 cM in E2 and E3, respectively. A total of 34 QTLs were identified on 10 chromosomes for five traits using ICIM-ADD and segregation distortion locus (SDL) mapping (IM-ADD) under salinity stress across environments. Eight major genomic regions on chromosome 1 between 170 and 175 cM (qSES1.3, qSES1.4, qSL1.2, qSL1.3, qRL1.1, qRL1.2, qFWsht1.2, qDWsht1.2), chromosome 4 at 32 cM (qSES4.1, qFWsht4.2, qDWsht4.2), chromosome 6 at 115 cM (qFWsht6.1, qDWsht6.1), chromosome 8 at 105 cM (qFWsht8.1, qDWsht8.1), and chromosome 12 at 78 cM (qFWsht12.1, qDWsht12.1) have co-localized QTLs for the multiple traits that might be governing seedling stage salinity tolerance through multiple traits in different phenotyping environments, thus suggesting these as hot spots for tolerance of salinity. Forty-nine and 30 significant pair-wise epistatic interactions were detected between QTL-linked and QTL-unlinked regions using single-environment and multi-environment analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of genomic regions for salinity tolerance in the RILs showed that Hasawi possesses alleles that are novel for salinity tolerance. The common regions for the multiple QTLs across environments as co-localized regions on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 12 could be due to linkage or pleiotropic effect, which might be helpful for multiple QTL introgression for marker-assisted breeding programs to improve the salinity tolerance of adaptive and popular but otherwise salinity-sensitive rice varieties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3abreeding programs 3achromosome mapping 3acrop production 3aepistasis 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ainbred lines 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3apleiotropy 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asegregation distortion 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aPhilippines 3aSenegal 3aTanzania1 aBimpong, IsaacKofi1 aBizimana, J.B.1 aPascual, EvangelineD.1 aArceta, Marydee1 aSwamy, B.P.

In this study, an uptake hydrogenase (hyd2293) from Ethanoligenens harbinense was overexpressed in C. tyrobutyricum and significantly affected the redox reactions and metabolic profiles. Compared to the parental strain (Ct-WT), the mutant strain Ct-Hyd2293 produced ~34% less butyrate, ~148% more acetate, and ~11% less hydrogen, accompanied by the emerging genesis of butanol. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that 666 genes were significantly differentially expressed after the overexpression of hyd2293, including 82 up-regulated genes and 584 down-regulated genes. The up-regulated genes were mainly involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolisms while the down-regulated genes were distributed in nearly all pathways. Genes involved in glucose transportation, glycolysis, different fermentation pathways and hydrogen metabolism were studied and the gene expression changes showed the mechanism of the metabolic flux redistribution in Ct-Hyd2293. The overexpression of uptake hydrogenase redirected electrons from hydrogen and butyrate to butanol. The key enzymes participating in the energy conservation and sporulation were also identified and their transcription levels were generally reduced. This study demonstrated the transcriptomic responses of C. tyrobutyricum to the expression of a heterologous uptake hydrogenase, which provided a better understanding of the metabolic characteristics of C. tyrobutyricum and demonstrated the potential role of redox manipulation in metabolic engineering for biofuel productions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium tyrobutyricum 3aacetates 3abiofuels 3abutanol 3abutyrates 3acarbohydrates 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironment 3afermentation 3aglycolysis 3ahydrogen 3amutants 3anutrient transport 3asporulation 3atranscriptomics 0aHydrogenase 0aTranscriptome1 aCheng, Chi1 aCao, Guangli1 aYang, Shang-Tian1 aRen, Nanqi0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 749 p.142022-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1420223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245005500164520133300219592002801552650001501580650002001595650001901615650001401634650001201648650000901660650002101669650000901690650001801699650001501717650001401732650001501746650001301761650001301774650001501787700002201802700001801824700002301842773012201865856008001987852000902067655001202076IND60648646520221122035659.0190701e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864652DNAL7 a10.3390/beverages50200402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGobbi, Laura 10aBiogenic Amines Determination in “Plant Milks”  a&ldquo;Plant milks&rdquo; are water-based beverages, such as, extracts from cereals, pseudo-cereals, oil seeds, legumes or fruits. Plant milk consumption is rising in European and North American markets due to problems related to cow milk allergies, intolerances, but also because of vegan diets and sensitivity to environmental issues. There is no specific regulation for these beverages, therefore their composition can vary considerably, even in the same category. The aim of this study is to characterize the main categories of cereal and pseudo-cereal milks on the market by studying the profile of 8 biogenic amines (histamine, serotonin, spermine, spermidine, putrescine, &beta;-phenylethylamine, cadaverine, tyramine) through a RP-HPLC/FD method with a pre-column derivatization. Biogenic amines are ubiquitous compounds, produced by the decarboxylation of the respective amino acids and they have been proposed as quality and safety markers of different foods and beverages. In the analyzed samples, the total biogenic amines content ranged from a minimum of 1.92 mg/L, to a maximum of 9.27 mg/L. The main biogenic amine found in the samples was histamine. The results show a low content of biogenic amines in all types of analyzed products. This ensures the quality and safety of cereal and pseudo-cereal milk samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadaverine 3adecarboxylation 3aderivatization 3ahistamine 3amarkets 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3aoils 3apseudocereals 3aputrescine 3aserotonin 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3atyramine 3avegan diet1 aCiano, Salvatore 1 aRapa, Mattia 1 aRuggieri, Roberto 0 tBeverages.g2019 June 04, v. 5, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27131x2306-57107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/beverages50200403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245015800162300002000320520153400340592002801874650002201902650001201924650002601936650003101962650001801993650000902011650001502020650001302035700001902048700002202067773012402089856007402213852000902287655001202296IND60669069520221116191627.0190920e20150810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066906952DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11268k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChurch, Andrew T.10aImproving the description of interactions between Ca²⁺ and protein carboxylate groups, including γ-carboxyglutamic acid: revised CHARMM22* parameters  ap. 67820-67828.  aA reliable description of ion pair interactions for biological systems, particularly those involving polyatomic ions such as carboxylate and divalent ions such as Ca²⁺, using biomolecular force-fields is essential for making useful predictions for a range of protein functions. In particular, the interaction of divalent ions with the double carboxylate group present in γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla), relevant to the function of many proteins, is relatively understudied using biomolecular force-fields. Using force-field based metadynamics simulations to predict the free energy of binding between Ca²⁺ and the carboxylate group in liquid water, we show that a widely-used biomolecular force-field, CHARMM22*, substantially over-estimates the binding strength between Ca²⁺ and the side-chains of both glutamic acid (Glu) and Gla, compared with experimental data obtained for the analogous systems of aqueous calcium–acetate and calcium–malonate. To correct for this, we propose and test a range of modifications to the σ value of the heteroatomic Lennard–Jones interaction between Ca²⁺ and the oxygen of the carboxylate group. Our revised parameter set can recover the same three association modes of this aqueous ion pair as the standard parameter set, and yields free energies of binding for the carboxylate–Ca²⁺ interaction in good agreement with experimental data. The revised parameter set recovers other structural properties of the ion pair in agreement with the standard CHARMM22* parameter set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acalcium 3achemical interactions 3agamma-carboxyglutamic acid 3aglutamic acid 3aions 3aprediction 3aproteins1 aHughes, Zak E.1 aWalsh, Tiffany R.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 10, v. 5, no. 83 p.67820-67828dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11268k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245016400209300001800373520168000391592002802071650001902099650001802118650001402136650001202150650002002162650001502182650002602197650001102223650002202234650001002256650001302266650000902279650001202288650001302300650002002313650001102333650001702344650002402361650001702385650001002402650001602412650002102428650001302449650001602462700001902478700001802497700001602515700001802531700001902549773011902568856008702687852000902774655001202783IND60686830320221120221454.0200319e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068683032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b043572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSo, Sunghyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1961-303X10aStudy on the Simultaneous Measurement of O₂ and CO Concentrations in the Exhaust Gas of a Methane/Air Flame Using Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy  ap. 3780-3787.  aOxygen (O₂) and carbon monoxide (CO) are produced in combustion reactions and are important gas species, which are closely related to combustion efficiency and production of air pollutants. O₂ generates thermal nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) by reacting with nitrogen in the air at high temperatures, and the presence of excess O₂ also affects the energy efficiency as a result of increasing exhaust heat energy. CO is generally well-known for being a toxic gas and is a crucial gas species produced by incomplete combustion. However, it is difficult to measure O₂ and CO level variations in a huge combustion system, such as used in steel annealing and power plant boilers, because of their harsh environment. Therefore, as a multi-species measurement technique, which is non-intrusive and has a high sensitivity and high response, tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy was chosen as the optical method used to measure O₂ and CO concentrations in exhaust gases. In this study, experiments were carried out to measure the O₂ and CO concentrations in an electrical furnace and a combustion system using direct absorption spectroscopy and wavelength modulation spectroscopy. The measured results were compared to those of a gas analyzer of the electrochemical sensor type. The O₂ and CO concentrations were measured in the exhaust gas produced from methane/air flame through adjustment of the equivalence ratio to form both fuel-lean and fuel-rich conditions. To measure the O₂ and CO concentrations precisely and without interference from other combustion products, visible and near-infrared wavelength regions at 760.8 and 2325.2 nm were selected, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aannealing 3aboilers 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3adiodes 3aenergy efficiency 3afuels 3afurnaces 3aheat 3amethane 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3apower plants 3asensors (equipment) 3aspectroscopy 3asteel 3atemperature 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3awavelengths1 aPark, Dae Geun1 aJeong, Nakwon1 aKim, Daehae1 aHwang, Jungho1 aLee, Changyeop0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 34, no. 3 p.3780-3787dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b043573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245004900174300001600223520093100239592002801170650002201198650002501220650001401245650001501259650002501274650001501299650002601314650001401340650001901354650001501373650002001388650002401408650001801432653002301450653002201473653000901495700001801504773010001522856008501622852000901707655001201716IND60693041220221122064344.0200504e20160902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069304122DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2016.11680212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanakraj, Sangeeta12aA comprehensive review on degummed biodiesel  ap. 537-548.  aBiodiesel is derived from renewable sources like vegetable oils, animal fats and recycled cooking oil.

The present review aimed to compile current, comprehensive information of degummed biodiesel production from different vegetable oils with diverse degumming techniques and also describe its fuel related properties, chemical composition and significant by-products. It is clear from this review that biodiesel manufactured from degummed feedstocks can be a promising alternative fuel for the diesel engine and could be a major step towards the creation of an environmentally friendly transportation fuel that is relatively clean on combustion.

Ambient air and soils were sampled and analyzed in five stations in the Metropolitan area of Barcelona (2018–2019); one located in a reference urban traffic site and four in the area of influence of an integrated waste management facility (IWMF) that included a solid waste incinerator. Seasonality was the main factor determining the PCDD/F composition, and involved lower values in the warmer months. This seasonal effect was related to enhanced photooxidation of PCDDs compared to PCDFs and faster depletion of the less chlorinated congeners due to volatility at higher ambient temperature; consistent with the compounds' octanol-air partition coefficients. The ratio 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorobenzofuran/1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorobenzofuran allowed, for the first time, identifying cases of preferential contributions of IWMF and traffic inputs, i.e. values of 0.06 and 0.32, respectively. Combination of this ratio with the airborne PCDD/F levels illustrated that the quantitative PCDD/F levels were not a useful criterion for elucidation between IWMF and traffic inputs.PCDD/Fs levels in soils ranged between 9.0 and 22 pg WHO-TEQ/g in the two sites closest to the IWMF, while the other sites, including the traffic site, showed values between 0.8 and 1.9 pg WHO-TEQ/g. The levels in the former group were higher than those observed in other urban areas and above 5 pg WHO-TEQ/g, which is a limit reference value in several European countries. The C₇ and C₈ observed congener distributions in all soils examined were different from those in the air samples and similar to those reported in sewage sludge from waste water treatment plants, not showing influences from IWMF or traffic PCDD/F inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aincinerators 3ametropolitan areas 3aphotooxidation 3aseasonal variation 3asewage sludge 3asolid wastes 3atraffic 3awaste incineration 3awastewater treatment 0aPCDD/Fs 0aUrban air 0aSoil 0aIntegrated waste management facility 0aTraffic inputs1 aAbalos, Manuela1 aAbad, Esteban1 aAdrados, Miquel A.1 aGomez, Anna1 aGallés, Pau1 aGrimalt, Joan O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7391-57680 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 753 p.142149-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010900157300001800266520155200284592002801836650001601864650002101880650001101901650001901912650001001931650001301941650001901954650001901973650001401992650001102006650001602017650001902033650001702052650001702069650002402086700001702110700001802127700001702145700001702162773012202179856007402301852000902375655001202384IND60681908320221119133741.0200121e20200120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068190832DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07248a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Zhaoxia10aMicrostructure and electrochemical performance of 3D hierarchical porous graphene/polyaniline composites  ap. 2989-2997.  aPorous graphene materials show outstanding performance in energy storage field due to their unique microstructure and properties. To construct 3D hierarchical porous graphene and combine with conductive polyaniline is an effective way to realize high energy density and good cycling stability. The interlamellar macroporous structure of 3D graphene was constructed by polystyrene (PS) microspheres and nickel foam as double templates. The mesoporous structure was etched in 3D macroporous graphene sheets by potassium hydroxide (KOH) chemical activation. And 3D hierarchical porous graphene (3D-hpGr) composited with polyaniline (PANI) by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization to obtain 3D-hpGr/PANI composites. The effect of the introduction of 3D-hpGr on microstructure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the composites was investigated. PANI nanowire arrays successfully decorate the surface of the 3D-hpGr sheets when the amount of 3D-hpGr reaches 40% (wt%). The specific capacitance of 3D-hpGr/PANI40 reaches 573 F g⁻¹ at 0.5 A g⁻¹, much higher than that of pure PANI (419 F g⁻¹). The retention ratio of 3D-hpGr/PANI40 retains 84% of its initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g⁻¹, and the cycling stability of all composites is higher than that of pure PANI (69%). The potential drop of 3D-hpGr/PANI composites decreases from 0.339 V to 0.139 V, and the energy density increases consequently. The energy density of 3D-hpGr/PANI40 reaches 31.2 W h kg⁻¹ at the power density of 0.709 kW kg⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3afoams 3agraphene 3amicroparticles 3amicrostructure 3ananowires 3anickel 3apolyaniline 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3aporous media 3apotassium hydroxide1 aKong, Lingxi1 aZou, Shengnan1 aZhao, Lanwei1 aYang, Lirong0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 10, no. 5 p.2989-2997dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07248a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245014000180300001600320500001100336520176600347592002802113650001802141650002902159650001402188650001102202650002002213650001102233650001902244650002102263650001802284650002202302650001502324700002302339700002302362700002602385773010102411856008102512852000902593655001202602IND60585158020221116143851.0171103e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058515802DNAL7 a10.1007/s12560-017-9314-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuintjer Tebbens, Radboud J.10aInsights from a Systematic Search for Information on Designs, Costs, and Effectiveness of Poliovirus Environmental Surveillance Systems  ap. 361-382.  aReview  aPoliovirus surveillance plays a critical role in achieving and certifying eradication and will play a key role in the polio endgame. Environmental surveillance can provide an opportunity to detect circulating polioviruses prior to the observation of any acute flaccid paralysis cases. We completed a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications on environmental surveillance for polio including the search terms “environmental surveillance” or “sewage,” and “polio,” “poliovirus,” or “poliomyelitis,” and compared characteristics of the resulting studies. The review included 146 studies representing 101 environmental surveillance activities from 48 countries published between 1975 and 2016. Studies reported taking samples from sewage treatment facilities, surface waters, and various other environmental sources, although they generally did not present sufficient details to thoroughly evaluate the sewage systems and catchment areas. When reported, catchment areas varied from 50 to over 7.3 million people (median of 500,000 for the 25% of activities that reported catchment areas, notably with 60% of the studies not reporting this information and 16% reporting insufficient information to estimate the catchment area population size). While numerous studies reported the ability of environmental surveillance to detect polioviruses in the absence of clinical cases, the review revealed very limited information about the costs and limited information to support quantitative population effectiveness of conducting environmental surveillance. This review motivates future studies to better characterize poliovirus environmental surveillance systems and the potential value of information that they may provide in the polio endgame.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus C 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aparalysis 3apeople 3apopulation size 3asewage 3asewage systems 3asewage treatment 3asurface water 3asystematic review 3awatersheds1 aZimmermann, Marita1 aPallansch, Mark A.1 aThompson, Kimberly M.0 tFood and environmental virology.g2017 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.361-382dSpringer USx1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-017-9314-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009600173300001600269520084100285592002801126650001101154650003301165650001001198650001301208650001201221650001001233650000901243650001101252650002101263650001901284650001401303651001701317653001601334653001901350653001001369653001701379653001501396700002201411700002001433700002401453773008601477856008501563852000901648655001201657IND60133105820221120181839.0150518e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310582DNAL7 a10.2989/00306525.2015.10295592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDean, W Richard J10aFluctuations in bird numbers on sewage treatment ponds in an arid environment, South Africa  ap. 145-153.  aRegular twice-monthly counts of birds associated with water at the Prince Albert sewage disposal facility recorded 69 species, of which 16 species (23.5%) were waterbirds (ducks, Red-knobbed Coot Fulica cristata and Little Grebe Tachybaptus ruficollis) and 21 species were shorebirds (30.9%).

The presence of both waterbirds and shorebirds showed an historic movement pattern, with peak numbers correlated with long-term average peak rainfall months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFulica 3adry environmental conditions 3aducks 3ahabitats 3amolting 3aponds 3arain 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3awaste disposal 3awaterfowl 3aSouth Africa 0abird counts 0abird movements 0aKaroo 0asewage ponds 0awaterbirds1 aMilton, Suzanne J1 aForsyth, Hugh P1 aTissiman, Dorrien R0 tOstrich.g2015 May 4, v. 86, no. 1-2 p.145-153dTaylor & Francisx1727-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2015.10295593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002200119024001900141040001800160100001900178245007900197300001800276506007600294520099000370592002801360506003701388650001401425650001301439650002001452650002301472650001401495650000901509651001201518700002301530700001701553773010501570856007701675852000901752655001201761IND4485269920221207071141.0120501e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448526992DNAL7 a10.2337/dc11-09452doi7 aPMC32208332pmcid7 a219944322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Baiju R.10aDiabetes Prevalence and Care in the MÃ©tis Population of Ontario, Canada  ap. 2555-2556.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: The MÃ©tis are a distinct Aboriginal people in Canada with a unique history, culture, and language. This study examined diabetes prevalence and care in the MÃ©tis of Ontario. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The 14,480 people in the citizenship registry of the MÃ©tis Nation of Ontario were linked with provincial health care databases to determine diabetes prevalence and processes of care. Rates were compared between the MÃ©tis and the general Ontario population. RESULTS: The age/sex standardized prevalence of diabetes for the MÃ©tis was 11.2%, nearly 25% higher than that of the general Ontario population. MÃ©tis were more likely to be hospitalized (12.7 vs. 10.7%) or require emergency room visits (36.1 vs. 27.7%). CONCLUSIONS: MÃ©tis people have an increased burden of diabetes that puts them at risk for complications and morbidity. Ensuring adequate access to and quality of care for diabetes is essential to maintain the health of the MÃ©tis people.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adatabases 3adiabetes 3ahealth services 3aindigenous peoples 3amorbidity 3arisk 3aOntario1 aCauch-Dudek, Karen1 aPigeau, Lisa0 tDiabetes care.g2011 Dec., v. 34, no. 12 p.2555-2556dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc11-09453Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011400175500001900289520178400308592002802092650002102120650000802141650001902149650002402168650001902192650001902211650001902230650001102249650001402260650001202274650001502286650000902301650001102310650001302321650002202334650001602356650001302372650001502385650002902400650001802429650002002447653000902467653002102476653001202497653002302509653000802532700002202540700001602562700002202578700002102600700005702621700002202678700006402700773011902764856008802883852000902971655001202980IND60713195320221122040050.0210121e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071319532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllmon, Elizabeth10aEffects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and abiotic stressors on Fundulus grandis cardiac transcriptomics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFollowing the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, extensive research has been conducted on the toxicity of oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the aquatic environment. Many studies have identified the toxicological effects of PAHs in estuarine and marine fishes, however, only recently has work begun to identify the combinatorial effect of PAHs and abiotic environmental factors such as hypoxia, salinity, and temperature. This study aims to characterize the combined effects of abiotic stressors and PAH exposure on the cardiac transcriptomes of developing Fundulus grandis larvae. In this study, F. grandis larvae were exposed to varying environmental conditions (dissolved oxygen (DO) 2, 6 ppm; temperature 20, 30 °C; and salinity 3, 30 ppt) as well as to a single concentration of high energy water accommodated fraction (HEWAF) (∑PAHs 15 ppb). Whole larvae were sampled for RNA and transcriptional changes were quantified using RNA-Seq followed by qPCR for a set of target genes. Analysis revealed that exposure to oil and abiotic stressors impacts signaling pathways associated with cardiovascular function. Specifically, combined exposures appear to reduce development of the systemic vasculature as well as strongly impact the cardiac musculature through cardiomyocyte proliferation resulting in inhibited cardiac function and modulated blood pressure maintenance. Results of this study provide a holistic view of impacts of PAHs and common environmental stressors on the cardiac system in early life stage estuarine species. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to simultaneously manipulate oil exposure with abiotic factors (DO, salinity, temperature) and the first to analyze cardiac transcriptional responses under these co-exposures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFundulus grandis 3aRNA 3aabiotic stress 3aaquatic environment 3ablood pressure 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3aenergy 3aestuaries 3ahypoxia 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aoxygen 3asalinity 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aFish 0aEarly life stage 0aCardiac 0aCombined stressors 0aOil1 aSerafin, Jennifer1 aChen, Shuai1 aRodgers, Maria L.1 aGriffitt, Robert1 aBosker, Thijs1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7727-14021 ade Guise, Sylvain1 aSepulveda, Maria S.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0473-57600 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 752 p.142156-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011500167300001600282500001500298520153000313592002801843650004301871650002301914650001701937650001801954650001101972650001801983650001802001650000802019650005202027650000902079650001802088650001202106650001702118650001202135650001402147650000802161650001802169650001702187651001102204653002202215700003002237700003302267773010102300856008102401852000902482655001202491IND60585158220221116143917.0171103e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058515822DNAL7 a10.1007/s12560-017-9300-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarti, Elisabet10aDetection of Potential Infectious Enteric Viruses in Fresh Produce by (RT)-qPCR Preceded by Nuclease Treatment  ap. 444-452.  a2019-12-06  aFoodborne illnesses associated with contaminated fresh produce are a common public health problem and there is an upward trend of outbreaks caused by enteric viruses, especially human noroviruses (HNoVs) and hepatitis A virus (HAV). This study aimed to assess the use of DNase and RNase coupled to qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively, to detect intact particles of human adenoviruses (HAdVs), HNoV GI and GII and HAV in fresh produce. Different concentrations of DNase and RNase were tested to optimize the degradation of free DNA and RNA from inactivated HAdV and murine norovirus (MNV), respectively. Results indicated that 10 µg/ml of RNase was able to degrade more than 4 log₁₀ (99.99%) of free RNA, and 1 U of DNase degraded the range of 0.84–2.5 log₁₀ of free DNA depending on the fresh produce analysed. The treatment with nucleases coupled to (RT)-qPCR was applied to detect potential infectious virus in organic lettuce, green onions and strawberries collected in different seasons. As a result, no intact particles of HNoV GI and GII were detected in the 36 samples analysed, HAdV was found in one sample and HAV was present in 33.3% of the samples, without any reasonable distribution pattern among seasons. In conclusion, RT-qPCR preceded by RNase treatment of eluted samples from fresh produce is a good alternative to detect undamaged RNA viruses and therefore, potential infectious viruses. Moreover, this study provides data about the prevalence of enteric viruses in organic fresh produce from Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3adeoxyribonucleases 3astrawberries 3apublic health 3ahumans 3afresh produce 3aHepatovirus A 3aDNA 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3amice 3aribonucleases 3aviruses 3agreen onions 3alettuce 3aNorovirus 3aRNA 3aorganic foods 3aAdenoviridae 3aBrazil 0aHepatitis A virus1 aFerrary-Américo, Monique1 aBarardi, Célia Regina Monte0 tFood and environmental virology.g2017 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.444-452dSpringer USx1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-017-9300-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008900163300001600252520084400268592002801112650001601140650001701156650001501173650001201188650002901200700001501229773008701244856004801331852000901379655001201388IND4487509920221116201926.0120927e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448750992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-011-0343-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Chuanmei10aFunctions of the Arabidopsis kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based motor proteins  ap. 887-899.  aPlants possess a large number of microtubule-based kinesin motor proteins. While the kinesin-2, 3, 9, and 11 families are absent from land plants, the kinesin-7 and 14 families are greatly expanded. In addition, some kinesins are specifically present only in land plants. The distinctive inventory of plant kinesins suggests that kinesins have evolved to perform specialized functions in plants. Plants assemble unique microtubule arrays during their cell cycle, including the interphase cortical microtubule array, preprophase band, anastral spindle and phragmoplast. In this review, we explore the functions of plant kinesins from a microtubule array viewpoint, focusing mainly on Arabidopsis kinesins. We emphasize the conserved and novel functions of plant kinesins in the organization and function of the different microtubule arrays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aembryophytes 3ainterphase 3akinesin 3amolecular motor proteins1 aDixit, Ram0 tProtoplasma.g2012 Oct., v. 249, no. 4 p.887-899dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-011-0343-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014600170300001800316520135800334592002801692650002301720650005201743650001201795650001601807650001401823650003101837650001801868650001001886650002001896650001301916650001901929650003301948650001401981650000901995650001702004650002002021653001302041653002702054653001502081653002002096653003002116653003202146653002302178700001902201700002302220700001902243700002102262700002302283773012702306856008302433852000902516655001202525IND60741902320221118004215.0210926e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074190232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuwul, Md.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are immune-compromised and may have a high risk of infection by the SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to detect common transcriptomic signatures and pathways between COVID-19 and CKD by systems biology analysis. We analyzed transcriptomic data obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and PBMC of CKD patients. We identified 49 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which were common between COVID-19 and CKD. The gene ontology and pathways analysis showed the DEGs were associated with “platelet degranulation”, “regulation of wound healing”, “platelet activation”, “focal adhesion”, “regulation of actin cytoskeleton” and “PI3K-Akt signalling pathway”. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network encoded by the common DEGs showed ten hub proteins (EPHB2, PRKAR2B, CAV1, ARHGEF12, HSP90B1, ITGA2B, BCL2L1, E2F1, TUBB1, and C3). Besides, we identified significant transcription factors and microRNAs that may regulate the common DEGs. We investigated protein-drug interaction analysis and identified potential drugs namely, aspirin, estradiol, rapamycin, and nebivolol. The identified common gene signature and pathways between COVID-19 and CKD may be therapeutic targets in COVID-19 patients with CKD comorbidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aaspirin 3acomorbidity 3aestradiol 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3akidney diseases 3amicroRNA 3amicrofilaments 3aprotein-protein interactions 3arapamycin 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptomics 0aCOVID-19 0aChronic kidney disease 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aSystems biology 0aTranscriptional signature 0aProtein-protein interaction 0aMolecular pathways1 aZhang, Chongqi1 aRahman, Md Rezanur1 aShahjaman, Md.1 aAlyami, Salem A.1 aMoni, Mohammad Ali0 tSaudi journal of biological sciences.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.5647-5656dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12399x1319-562X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007200171300001600243500001400259520184400273536011302117592002802230650002302258650001902281650001602300650001502316650002302331650001102354650001902365650001302384650001902397650001002416650001102426650001102437651001002448653000902458653001402467653001402481700001602495700001302511773011902524856008502643852000902728655001202737IND60732620320221121072726.0210331e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073262032DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2019.16002622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwarnkar, C.

From April, 2004 to March, 2018, a total of 89112 faecal samples were examined for flukes by sedimentation technique. An overall prevalence was maximum (6.08%) for Paramphistomum spp. followed by 0.19% for Schistosoma indicum and minimum (0.03%) for Fasciola gigantica. Prevalence of Paramphistomum spp. and S. indicum was significantly higher in semi-arid region (8.66 and 0.22%) compared to arid region (1.51 and 0.12%). The overall annual prevalence rates varied significantly from 1.69 to 9.70% for Paramphistomum spp, from 0.02 to 1.73% for S. indicum and from nil to 0.12% for F. gigantica. The prevalence of all the three flukes was found to be influenced significantly by month and season. For Paramphistomum spp, the overall monthly prevalence varied from 0.15% (Nov) to 16.60% (Jul). The seasonal prevalence was maximum during monsoon and minimum during winter. The occurrence of F. gigantica was sporadic in arid region as compared to regularity in semi-arid region. The monthly profile of S. indicum exhibited significantly higher prevalence (>0.20%) from May to August in arid region and from July to October in semi-arid region. A significant effect of agro-climatic region on prevalence of S. indicum was noticed only during monsoon season with higher incidence in semi-arid region (0.59%) as compared to arid region (0.25%). The study suggested that the fluke infections are present in endemic pattern in sheep flocks of Rajasthan (particularly in semi-arid region) and deserves serious attention. Therefore, it is important to obtain detail information on host parasite relationship and snail species which will aid for developing suitable control strategies.  aThe study was supported by ICAR, New Delhi under All India Network Programme on Gastrointestinal Parasitism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola gigantica 3aParamphistomum 3aSchistosoma 3aarid zones 3abiological rhythms 3aflukes 3amonsoon season 3aresearch 3asemiarid zones 3asheep 3asnails 3awinter 3aIndia 0aArid 0aRajasthan 0asemi-arid1 aKhan, F.

Newly emerged bees were collected and put into wooden boxes that were kept in an acclimatized chamber at 32°C and 70% humidity. Pollen samples were collected from Azadirachta indica, Mimosa tenuiflora, and Piptadenia stipulacea, and were added to food at doses of 0 (control group), 0.25%, 0.5% and 1.0%. Each dose of plant material was fed to 180 bees, and the bees were observed daily until the last one died. Statistical comparison of the survival curves was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The pollen of P. stipulacea significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the survival of honey bees, and only slight toxicity of A. indica pollen to honey bees was observed. The differences between the survival curves of bees fed with different doses of M. tenuiflora were not significant (P>0.05). In conclusion, although arthropods may aid the reproduction of plants through the dissemination of reproductive structures, the pollen of some species may be toxic to bees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aAzadirachta indica 3aMimosa tenuiflora 3aPiptadenia stipulacea 3aacclimation 3aapiculture 3ahoney 3ahumidity 3apollen 3aresearch 3asemiarid zones 3atoxicity 3aBrazil 0aHymenoptera 0aApidae 0apoisonous plants 0atoxic pollen1 aMaracajá, Patrício Borges1 aSakamoto, Sidnei Miyoshi1 aSoto-Blanco, Benito0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 49, no. 3 p.265-269dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.49.3.063Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02311naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011400153300001600267520118300283592002801466650004401494650001301538650001301551650001601564650002101580650001401601650004401615650002101659700002201680700001901702700001801721773013901739856007401878852000901952655001201961IND60668816220221119202443.0190920e20121213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066881622DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ta00212d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHai, Bin14aThe effect of particle surface facets on the kinetic properties of LiMn₁.₅Ni₀.₅O₄ cathode materials  ap. 759-769.  aLarge LiMn₁.₅Ni₀.₅O₄ single crystals in plate shape with (112) surface facets and octahedral shape with (111) surface facets were obtained by molten-salt synthesis.

The apparent chemical diffusion minima during Li extraction and insertion were correlated with the occurrence of the first-order phase transition, implying that phase boundary movement limits Li transport in the spinel cathodes. Despite a more ordered structure, nearly ten times less Mn³⁺ content, and increased two-phase boundary movement during delithiation and relithiation, the octahedral crystals exhibited superior rate capability and a larger chemical diffusion coefficient, suggesting the kinetic preeminence of (111) surface facets over (112).

However, how different N sources are dynamically involved in microbial processes and how they govern soil‐N transformations is poorly understood. A field experiment with half‐yield maize residue mulching was conducted in an Alfisol. The ¹⁵N‐labelled fertilizer and maize (Zea mays L.) residue were applied in the first year and then unlabelled ones were used in the following 4 years. The origins of newly formed fungal and bacterial residues were investigated by amino sugar‐specific ¹⁵N analysis. The aim was to gain insights into the microbial transformation dynamics of fertilizer‐N and maize residue‐N, as well as the maintenance of these exogenous N sources in soil. The initial transformation of fertilizer‐N into amino sugars was much more rapid than that of maize residue‐N. However, the eventual accumulation of maize residue‐N in amino sugars was significantly greater than that of fertilizer‐N. The transformation of maize residue‐¹⁵N into amino sugars was 3.5–6.7 times higher than that of fertilizer‐¹⁵N over the course of 5 years, implying a higher immobilization of maize residue‐derived N than fertilizer‐derived N in the soil. The effective transformation of maize residue‐N into microbial residues and the low level of maize residue‐derived mineral N accumulation suggested that a direct route probably dominated the microbial process. Moreover, the maize residue‐derived fungal glucosamine was more apt to accumulate than muramic acid, compared with that derived from fertilizer, suggesting that fungi contributed more to the direct assimilation of maize residue‐derived N. Such a pattern was mostly attributed to fungal decomposition of less bioavailable components of maize residue. Thus, maize residue‐N played a significant role in building soil organic N reserves, being a sustaining foundation for the effective utilization of fertilizer‐N by crops. HIGHLIGHTS: Fungal and bacterial residues derived from maize residue‐N and fertilizer‐N were investigated. Fungi dominated maize residue‐N immobilization mostly via direct route. Maize residue‐N had higher microbial immobilization efficiency than fertilizer‐N. Maize residue‐N contributed dominantly to the building of soil organic N pool.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDB15040200c“China Soil Microbiome Initiative: Function and regulation of soil ‐ microbial systems” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2016YFD0200307cNational Key Research & Development Program  a2017YFD0200100cNational Key Research & Development Program  a41501307cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41571238cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41630862cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41701257cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAlfisols 3aZea mays 3aagroecosystems 3abioavailability 3acorn 3acrops 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3aglucosamine 3aisotope labeling 3amulching 3amuramic acid 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil organic nitrogen 3astable isotopes1 aZhao, Yu1 aLiu, Xiao1 aZhou, Feng1 aZhang, Wei1 aShao, Shuai1 aHe, Hongbo1 aZhang, Xudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7386-12480 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2020 Mar., v. 71, no. 2 p.252-264dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl51589x1351-07547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.128593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001700158245007300175300001600248500001100264520106600275592002801341650001101369650001701380650002801397650001401425650000901439650002101448650001101469650000901480650001001489650001401499650001101513650001401524650001201538650002201550650001201572650002101584650003901605650001401644650001101658650002201669650001401691650002801705650003001733650001401763650006701777700003201844700002901876700002101905700001701926700001901943773009201962856004002054852000902094655001202103IND50074153120221118001712.0140321e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007415312DNAL7 a241883232pmid7 a10.1111/ele.122152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeil, Martin10aPartner manipulation stabilises a horizontally transmitted mutualism  ap. 185-192.  aLETTER  aMutualisms require protection from non‐reciprocating exploiters. Pseudomyrmex workers that engage in an obligate defensive mutualism with Acacia hosts feed exclusively on the sucrose‐free extrafloral nectar (EFN) that is secreted by their hosts, a behaviour linking ant energy supply directly to host performance and thus favouring reciprocating behaviour. We tested the hypothesis that Acacia hosts manipulate this digestive specialisation of their ant mutualists. Invertase (sucrose hydrolytic) activity in the ant midguts was inhibited by chitinase, a dominant EFN protein. The inhibition occurred quickly in cell‐free gut liquids and in native gels and thus likely results from an enzyme–enzyme interaction. Once a freshly eclosed worker ingests EFN as the first diet available, her invertase becomes inhibited and she, thus, continues feeding on host‐derived EFN. Partner manipulation acts at the phenotypic level and means that one partner actively controls the phenotype of the other partner to enhance its dependency on host‐derived rewards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aPseudomyrmex 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3achitinase 3adiet 3adigestive system 3aenergy 3agels 3ahosts 3amutualism 3anectar 3aphenotype 3asucrose 2aAcaciaxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aAntsxenzymology 2aChitinasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aFemale 2aLarvaxenzymology 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Nectarxchemistry 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistry 2aSymbiosis 2abeta-Fructofuranosidasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism.1 aBarajas‐Barron, Alejandro1 aOrona‐Tamayo, Domancar1 aWielsch, Natalie1 aSvatos, Ales1 aEubanks, Micky0 tEcology letters.g2014 Feb., v. 17, no. 2 p.185-192dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12215  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245004800167300001400215520087500229536023901104592002801343596003201371596002001403650001101423650001601434650002501450653002401475653001501499653001901514653001601533653002301549653001801572700002201590773012001612856008601732852000901818655001201827IND60765530220221121061824.0220130e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076553022DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2021.20009912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDey, Pankaj10aOn the statistical complexity of streamflow  ap. 40-53.  aIn this study, catchments are considered as complex systems, and information-theoretic measures are used to capture temporal streamflow characteristics. Emergence and self-organization are used to quantify information production and order in streamflow time series, respectively. The measure complexity is used to quantify the balance between emergence and self-organization in streamflow variability. The complexity measure is found to be effective in distinguishing streamflow variability for high and low snow-dominated catchments. The state of persistence – reflecting the memory of streamflow time series, is shown to be related to the complexity of streamflow. Moreover, it is observed that conventional causal detection methods are constrained by the state of persistence, and more robust methods are needed in hydrological applications considering persistence.  aThis work was supported by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India [grant number MOES/PAMC/H&C/41/2013-PC-II]; and the Science and Engineering Research Board through the J.C.

In this context, changes in iron solubility and isotopic composition of dissolved Fe during simulated atmospheric processing of industrial ash was investigated. Kinetic and equilibrium experiments were performed under UV/VIS light using ash from a Fe–Mn alloy metallurgical plant and a synthetic solution that mimics cloud water chemistry. The nature of the Fe species of the industrial ash was investigated by Mössbauer Spectroscopy, whereas ash and dissolved δ⁵⁶Fe values were measured by MC-ICP-MS. Mössbauer Spectroscopy revealed that α-hematite, magnetite, and poorly crystallized manganoferrite nanoparticles are the main Fe species. In the early-stage dissolution (until 60 min) a Fe isotope fractionation (Δ⁵⁶Feₛₒₗᵤₜᵢₒₙ₋bᵤₗₖ ₐₛₕ) of −0.284 ± 0.103‰ was found at the minimum contact time evaluated herein (i.e., 5 min) due to kinetic isotopic effects. In the late-stage dissolution (after 60 min) a Δ⁵⁶Feₛₒₗᵤₜᵢₒₙ₋ₐₛₕ of 0.227 ± 0.091‰ was found due to equilibrium isotopic effects. The kinetic isotope effect within one ash surface monolayer was modeled with an enrichment factor (ε) of −1‰ in ⁵⁶Fe/⁵⁴Fe ratio. Iron fractional dissolution undergone during different atmospheric processing time scales may release Fe with contrasted isotope compositions to solution, changing the original soluble Fe isotope signature (which is linked to its source). This might be especially important when the dissolution process goes from kinetic to near-equilibrium conditions, in which higher amounts of Fe are progressively released from ash surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalloys 3aatmospheric deposition 3aenvironment 3ahydrochemistry 3airon 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amagnetite 3asolubility 3aspectroscopy 0aIron isotope 0aIron dissolution 0aAerosol 0aCloud processing 0aIron oxide1 aFlament, Pascal1 ade Jong, Jeroen1 aMattielli, Nadine1 aDeboudt, Karine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0104-62811 aDhont, Guillaume1 aBychkov, Eugène1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3292-12050 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 259 p.118505-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1185053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245007400211300001600285506007600301520129000377592002801667506003701695650001601732650001501748650002201763650001701785650001201802650002001814650003401834650001901868700002501887700002901912700001701941773012801958856008202086852000902168655001202177IND60089384120221207134459.0141102e20110429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008938412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.0042doi7 aPMC70559312pmcid7 a214738532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Chang-Young10aMitotic kinases regulate MT-polymerizing/MT-bundling activity of DDA3  ap. 174-179.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMitotic kinases orchestrate cell cycle processes by phosphorylation of cell cycle regulators. DDA3, a spindle-associated phosphor-protein, is a substrate of mitotic kinases that control chromosome movement and spindle microtubule (MT) dynamics. Through a mass spectrometry analysis, we identified phosphorylation sites on the endogenous mitotic DDA3, which include Ser22, Ser65, Ser70, and Ser223. Phosphorylation of these residues converts interphase form of DDA3 to mitotic form by changing its biochemical activity, as unphosphorylated DDA3 processed both the MT polymerizing and bundling activities, whereas phosphor-mimic mutants lost both activities, only retaining the MT-binding activity. We found that mitotic kinases, such as Cdk1, Aurora A, and Plk1, phosphorylate DDA3 in vitro. Whereas Cdk1 and Aurora A negatively regulate MT-polymerizing and MT-bundling activities, Plk1 does not affect these activities. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of DDA3 by Aurora A and Plk1 inhibits the phosphorylation by other kinases, indicating that sequential phosphorylation is important for the regulation of DDA3 function. We conclude that kinases control the function of DDA3 in the cell cycle by regulating its MT-polymerizing/bundling activities through sequential phosphorylation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromosomes 3ainterphase 3amass spectrometry 3amicrotubules 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3apolymerization1 aCoppinger, Judith A.1 aYates, John R., IIIcIII1 aFang, Guowei0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Apr. 29, v. 408, no. 1 p.174-179dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245021400168520111500382592002801497650002101525650003001546650001901576650002501595653004001620653002901660653003501689700001801724700001601742700001901758700001501777773009101792856009001883852000901973655001201982IND60787521220221119151207.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078752122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ye10aAchieving remarkable enhancement on electromagnetic shielding performance in multi-walled carbon nanotube/polydimethylsiloxane composites via adding a small amount of metal micro-particles as scattering points  aHerein, a small amount of copper micro-particles (μ-Cu particles) were added into the multi-walled carbon nanotube/polydimethylsiloxane (PCNT) composites acting as electromagnetic wave (EMW) scattering points to enhance their EMW shielding performance. The μ-Cu particles/PCNT (PCNTC) composites were prepared by solvent-assisted and hot-press molding methods. Thanks to the high scattering of μ-Cu particles, which increases propagation paths of EMW inside the composites, remarkable enhancement on EMW shielding property could be achieved by adding small amount of conductive μ-Cu particles into the composites. The effects of the diameter and content of μ-Cu particles on the EMW SE of the composites were investigated in this study. Furthermore, the shielding mechanism of the composite to EMW was simulated and verified by an electromagnetic simulation. In addition, the reflection loss (SER) and reflectivity coefficient (R) were used to evaluate the shielding mechanism of the composites. The composites had low SER of 1.6 dB and R of 0.29 values, suggesting an absorption-type shielding mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3amicroparticles 3apolydimethylsiloxane 0aA.

These two species’ current and past relative biomasses (B/BMSY) were estimated using a length-based Bayesian biomass estimation method (LBB). The LLB method also estimated their asymptotic lengths (Lᵢₙf), current and optimum mean lengths at first capture (Lc; Lₒₚₜ_c₎, and their ratios of natural and fishing mortality to growth (M/K; F/K). In response to increasing fishing pressure, both species’ maximum lengths declined, along with their B/BMSY ratio, which declined for C. mystus from 1.7 in 1982 to 0.47 in 2020 and for C. nasus from 1.7 in 2006 (or earlier) to 0.17 in 2020. These assessments show that both of the two Coilia species are overfished, with C. nasus impacted more severely than C. mystus. The prospect for the recovery of these two species is briefly discussed. This contribution will help toward the management of the population of these two Coilia species and provides a basis for evaluating the effect of the 10-year fishing ban in the Yangtze River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aCoilia mystus 3abiomass 3aestuaries 3amortality 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aLi, Zengguang 1 aHu, Yongbin 1 aHuang, Chengwei 1 aTian, Siquan 1 aWan, Rong 1 aPauly, D.q(Daniel),0 tFishes.g2022 Apr. 19, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27137x2410-38887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes70300953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245009000204300001300294500002000307506007600327520168000403592002802083596005902111506003702170650001302207650002802220650001302248650002002261650001602281650001702297650001302314650002402327650001602351650001702367700006002384700002002444700001602464700001802480700002202498773012002520856007302640852000902713655001202722IND60626259020221207074459.0181220e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062625902DNAL7 a10.1111/jrh.123402doi7 aPMC62987952pmcid7 a305370732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeiger, Caroline K.10aDelivery of Preventive Oral Health Services by Rurality: A Cross‐Sectional Analysis  ap. 3-11.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE: Integrating oral health care into primary care has been promoted as a strategy to increase delivery of preventive oral health services (POHS) to young children, particularly in rural areas where few dentists practice. Using a multistate sample of Medicaid claims, we examined a child's odds of receiving POHS in a medical office by county rurality. METHODS: We used 2012‐2014 Medicaid Analytic extract claims data for 6,275,456 children younger than 6 years in 39 states that allowed Medicaid payment for POHS in medical offices. We used county‐level characteristics from the Area Health Resources Files, including a 3‐level measure of county rurality. We used logistic regression to estimate a child's odds of receiving POHS in a medical office by county rurality, while controlling for other patient and county characteristics. FINDINGS: POHS in medical offices were received by 7.8% of children. Rates of POHS in medical offices were higher in metropolitan (metro) counties (8.4%) than nonmetro adjacent to metro (5.8%) and nonmetro not adjacent to metro (4.3%). In adjusted analysis, children living in nonmetro not adjacent to metro (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64‐0.99) and adjacent to metro counties (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.59‐0.82) were significantly less likely to receive POHS in medical offices than children living in metro counties. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of POHS in medical offices among young Medicaid‐enrolled children, we found POHS rates were lowest in nonmetro counties. Given barriers to dental care in rural areas, states should take additional steps beyond allowing Medicaid reimbursement to increase delivery of POHS in medical offices.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adentists 3ahealth services 3aoral health 3aoral hygiene 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3arural health1 aKranz, Ashley M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0507-78001 aDick, Andrew W.1 aDuffy, Erin1 aSorbero, Mark1 aStein, Bradley D.0 tJournal of rural health.g2019 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.3-11dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44673x0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.123403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017800168300001400346520158100360592002801941650002201969650001001991650001702001650002502018650001002043650002002053650002102073650002102094650002402115650003702139650002002176650001402196650001802210650003202228700002002260700001502280700001802295700001902313700001902332700002002351700001802371700002002389700001802409700002002427773012602447856008202573852000902655655001202664IND60089384220221120033059.0141102e20110429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008938422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Kenji10aLucidenic acids-rich extract from antlered form of Ganoderma lucidum enhances TNFα induction in THP-1 monocytic cells possibly via its modulation of MAP kinases p38 and JNK  ap. 18-24.  aThe Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum) is one of the oriental fungi that has been reported to have immunomodulatory properties. Although effect of β-glucans from G. lucidum has been well documented, little is known about how other major bioactive components, the triterpenes, contribute to the immunomodulatory function of G. lucidum. Here, we showed that triterpenes-rich extract of antlered form of G. lucidum (G. lucidum AF) induces TNFα production in monocytic THP-1 cells. Furthermore, the extract also synergized with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce TNFα production in THP-1 cells, suggesting an immunostimulatory role of triterpenes-rich extract of G. lucidum AF. Notably, the extract enhanced LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), while it suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK. p38 Inhibitor suppressed TNFα production, while JNK inhibitor enhanced TNFα production, implying that synergistic effect of the extract may work by modulating p38 and JNK MAPKs. Moreover, we found that the triterpenes-rich extract of G. lucidum AF contains high amounts of lucidenic acids. Lucidenic acid-A, -F and -D₂, which seem to dominantly exist in the extract, were purified from the triterpenes-rich extract. We also identified Lucidenic acid-A and -F as modulators of JNK and p38, respectively. Thus, our data demonstrate that lucidenic acids-rich extract from G. lucidum AF enhances LPS-induced immune responses in monocytic THP-1 cells possibly via the modulation of p38 and JNK MAPKs activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aacids 3abeta-glucans 3abioactive properties 3afungi 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunomodulators 3alipopolysaccharides 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3asynergism 3atriterpenoids 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aShuto, Tsuyoshi1 aSato, Miki1 aOnuki, Kouhei1 aMizunoe, Shota1 aSuzuki, Shingo1 aSatō, Takashi,1 aKoga, Tomoaki1 aSuico, Mary Ann1 aKai, Hirofumi1 aIkeda, Tsuyoshi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Apr. 29, v. 408, no. 1 p.18-24dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245011700151300001600268520072200284592002801006650000801034650002101042650001501063650001701078650002201095650001301117650001401130650002101144700001601165700001501181700001601196700002701212773013901239856007401378852000901452655001201461IND60668816520221119202118.0190920e20121127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066881652DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ta00223j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Le10aTiO₂ nanotube arrays grafted with Fe₂O₃ hollow nanorods as integrated electrodes for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 122-127.  aNovel nano-heterostructures composed of Fe₂O₃ hollow nanorods on both the outer and inner surface of the aligned TiO₂ nanotube arrays (TNAs) have been fabricated by growing FeOOH nanospindles onto the TNAs, and then followed by thermal transformation in air.

Plants grown on a complete nutrient solution (control) were compared with those grown in a medium, which lacked one of macro- or microelements. The physiological state of the photosynthetic machinery in vivo was analysed after 14-days of deficient condition by the parameters of JIP-test based on fast chlorophyll a fluorescence records. In most of the nutrient-deficient samples, the decrease of photochemical efficiency, increase in non-photochemical dissipation and decrease of the number of active photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres were observed. However, lack of individual nutrients also had nutrient-specific effects on the photochemical processes. In Mg and Ca-deficient plants, the most severe decrease in electron donation by oxygen evolving complex (OEC) was indicated. Sulphur deficiency caused limitation of electron transport beyond PSI, probably due to decrease in the PSI content or activity of PSI electron acceptors; in contrary, Ca deficiency had an opposite effect, where the PSII activity was affected much more than PSI. Despite the fact that clear differences in nutrient deficiency responses between tomato and maize plants were observed, our results indicate that some of presented fluorescence parameters could be used as fluorescence phenotype markers. The principal component analysis of selected JIP-test parameters was presented as a possible species-specific approach to identify/predict the nutrient deficiency using the fast chlorophyll fluorescence records.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aZea mays 3acalcium 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3ahydroponics 3airon 3amagnesium 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient solutions 3anutrients 3aoxygen evolving complex 3aphenotype 3aphysiological state 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3asulfur 3atomatoes 0aMaize 0aTomato 0aNutrient deficiency 0aChlorophyll a fluorescence 0aJIP-test 0aPrincipal component analysis1 aOukarroum, Abdallah1 aAlexandrov, Vladimir1 aKouzmanova, Margarita1 aBrestic, Marian1 aZivcak, Marek1 aSamborska, Izabela A.1 aCetner, Magdalena D.1 aAllakhverdiev, Suleyman I.1 aGoltsev, Vasilij0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2014 Aug., v. 81 p.16-25dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245017300166300001600339520099600355592002801351650002601379650002201405650002001427650001001447650003501457651001001492653001901502653001401521653001301535653001501548653001801563653002501581653001001606700001901616700001401635700001201649700001701661700001101678700001801689700001701707773008901724856008401813852000901897655001201906IND60559749120221120223831.0161216e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055974912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yihui10aOccurrence and trophic magnification of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their methoxylated derivatives in freshwater fish from Dianshan Lake, Shanghai, China  ap. 932-938.  aIn this study, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) were analyzed in eleven freshwater fish species from Dianshan Lake, Shanghai, China. The highest concentrations of PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs were found in snakehead, with mean values of 38 ng g−1 lw and 4.2 ng g−1 lw, respectively. BDE-47 was the predominant congener of PBDEs, followed by BDE-154. Congener pattern variation of PBDEs was observed among different fish species, implying differences in biotransformation potential among fish. Yellow catfish showed highest concentrations of BDE-99, -153 and -183, suggesting that it is more resistant to debromination than any other fish analyzed in the present study. Trophic magnification factors were in the range of 1.35–1.81 for all the PBDE congeners, but not for 2′-MeO-BDE-68. Negative relationship was observed between PBDEs concentration and sample size (length and weight), indicating fish size dilution effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTachysurus fulvidraco 3abiotransformation 3afreshwater fish 3alakes 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aChina 0aYellow catfish 0aFish size 0aFood web 0aMetabolism 0aDebromination 0aStable isotope ratio 0aPBDEs1 aChen, Qiaofeng1 aDu, Xinyu1 aYin'ge,1 aQiu, Yanling1 aYe, Lu1 aZhu, Zhiliang1 aZhao, Jianfu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Dec., v. 219 p.932-938dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01846naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005700169300001600226520089100242592002801133650001201161650001101173650001901184650001501203650001801218650001101236650001601247700002101263700002001284700002001304773009401324856008101418852000901499655001201508IND60437465020221121040139.0151022e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043746502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-003-0425-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeeley, Thomas D.10aThorough warm-up before take-off in honey bee swarms  ap. 256-260.  aIn a bivouacked swarm of honey bees, most individuals are quiescent while a small minority (the scouts) are active in choosing the swarm's future nest site. This study explores the way in which the members of a swarm warm their flight muscles for take-off when the swarm eventually decamps. An infrared camera was used to measure the thoracic (flight muscle) temperatures of individual bees on the surface of a swarm cluster. These are generally the coolest bees in a swarm. The warming of the surface-layer bees occurred mainly in the last 10 min before take-off. By the time a take-off began, 100% of the bees had their flight muscles heated to at least 35°C, which is sufficient to support rapid flight. Take-offs began only a few seconds after all the surface-layer bees had their flight muscles warmed to at least 35°C, but exactly how take-offs are triggered remains a mystery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aflight 3aflight muscles 3ahoney bees 3anesting sites 3aswarms 3atemperature1 aKleinhenz, Marco1 aBujok, Brigitte1 aTautz, Jürgen,0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2003 June, v. 90, no. 6 p.256-260dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-003-0425-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013900172520244300311592002802754650001702782650000802799650001602807650001602823650001102839650001502850650002202865650001102887650001102898650001602909650001502925650001102940651001002951653001002961653004202971653001303013653003903026700001303065700001603078700001803094700001503112700001303127700001403140773010803154856008703262852000903349655001203358IND60741902820221118004128.0210729e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074190282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1185452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dongsheng10aImpact of inter-annual meteorological variation from 2001 to 2015 on the contribution of regional transport to PM2.5 in Beijing, China  aParticles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM₂.₅) in the ambient air are affected not only by local emissions but also by regional transport of the pollutant and its precursors, which may vary considerably under different meteorological conditions. This issue has been extensively investigated in terms of the contribution of regional transport to PM₂.₅ at different seasons in a specific year. However, the literature yields conflicting results, and the extent to which inter-annual meteorological variation affects the contribution of regional transport is not fully understood, especially in the long-term. Therefore, in this study, the WRF/CMAQ model was employed to investigate inter-annual variations in the contribution of regional transport to PM₂.₅ concentration in Beijing from 2001 to 2015. The emission inventory and model configurations were kept the same for the 15-year simulation to highlight the impact of inter-annual meteorological variations. The major findings can be summarized as follows: (1) inter-annual meteorological variation has an impact on both the PM₂.₅ concentration in Beijing and the contribution of regional transport; (2) the annual average PM₂.₅ concentrations in Beijing varied during the study period, from 75.3 μg/m³ in 2002 to 108.1 μg/m³ in 2003; (3) the years with high annual anomalies of PM₂.₅ was found during periods of low wind speed, high relative humidity, and low planetary boundary layer (PBL) height; (4) the annual variability was relatively small compared to the changes in seasonal because some seasons in a year are higher than their historical average values, and some are lower, which often negate each other, making the annual average close to the historical average; (5) the contribution of regional transport averaged 44.5% and ranged from 40.7% in 2007 to 48.5% in 2001. On a seasonal basis, the inter-annual fluctuation was more significant, with fluctuation rates of 43.0%, 25.5%, 25.0%, and 20.6% in winter, fall, spring, and summer, respectively; and (6) in general, there is a good positive correlation between the regional contribution and PM₂.₅ concentration in Beijing. Specifically, when the regional transport contribution is large, the PM₂.₅ concentration tends to be higher. This is especially true during years when both the concentration and contribution deviate significantly from the historical average.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3aair 3aenvironment 3ainventories 3amodels 3apollutants 3arelative humidity 3aspring 3asummer 3atroposphere 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aInter-annual meteorological variation 0aWRF/CMAQ 0aContribution of regional transport1 aXia, Lin1 aGuo, Xiurui1 aLang, Jianlei1 aZhou, Ying1 aWei, Lin1 aFu, Xinyi0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 260 p.118545-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1185453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002200142242012900164245011000293300001600403520064400419592002801063650001901091650001501110650000901125650001001134650001001144650001101154650001301165650001601178653002101194653002101215700002701236700002001263773012401283852000901407856007901416655001201495IND4462200120221120183033.0200513e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446220012DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.49.4.032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaftanoglu, Osman10aCría in vitro de abejas (Apis mellifera L.): efectos de los intervalos de alimentación en la supervivencia y el desarrollo10aRearing honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in vitro: effects of feeding intervals on survival and development  ap. 311-317.  aA new and simple technique was developed to rear honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in vitro. One day old larvae were grafted into Petri dishes and fed a basic diet at six different time intervals. There were no differences in the larval weights, survival rates or ovariole numbers of the bees among the groups that were fed at different intervals, but they were heavier and had larger ovaries than hive reared bees. It was shown that honey bees can be reared in vitro without replenishing their food daily. This simple mass provisioning technique reduces the labour involved, and enables the researcher to raise large number of bees in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aapiculture 3adiet 3ahoney 3alabor 3alarvae 3aresearch 3aresearchers 0ain vitro rearing 0afeeding interval1 aLinksvayer, Timothy A.1 aPage, Robert E.0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 49, no. 4 p.311-317dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.49.4.033Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03071naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011000169300001600279520173700295592002802032650001902060650002002079650000902099650002202108650001802130650000902148650001102157650001602168650001602184650002002200650002402220650003602244650002702280700002102307700002302328700002302351700002102374700002302395773012802418856008202546852000902628655001202637IND60089384520221119105926.0141102e20110429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008938452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneuji, Takeshi10aMechanisms involved in regulation of osteoclastic differentiation by mechanical stress-loaded osteoblasts  ap. 103-109.  aMechanical stress is known to be important for regulation of bone turnover, though the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we examined the effect of mechanical stress on osteoblasts using a novel compression model. Mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were embedded in three-dimensional (3D) gels and cultured with continuous compressive force (0–10.0g/cm²) for 48h, and the conditioned medium were collected. RAW264.7 cells were then incubated with the conditioned medium for various times in the presence of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). Conditioned medium was found to inhibit the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclasts induced by RANKL via down-regulation of the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), phosphorylation of IκBα, and nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. Interestingly, the conditioned medium also had a high level of binding activity to RANKL and blocked the binding of RANK to RANKL. Furthermore, the binding activity of conditioned medium to RANKL was reduced when the 3D gel was supplemented with KN-93, an inhibitor of non-canonical Wnt/Ca²⁺ pathway. In addition, expression level of osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA was increased in time- and force-dependent manners, and remarkably suppressed by KN-93. These results indicate that osteoblastic cells subjected to mechanical stress produce OPG, which binds to RANKL. Furthermore, this binding activity strongly inhibited osteoclastogenesis through suppression of TRAF6 and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, suggesting that enhancement of OPG expression induced by mechanical stress is dependent on non-canonical Wnt/Ca²⁺ pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIKappaB kinase 3abone metabolism 3agels 3amechanical stress 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factors1 aAriyoshi, Wataru1 aOkinaga, Toshinori1 aToshinaga, Akihiro1 aTakahashi, Tetsu1 aNishihara, Tatsuji0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Apr. 29, v. 408, no. 1 p.103-109dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245010800206300001800314500002000332520154200352592002801894596002101922596007201943596004302015596002502058650002002083650002702103650001102130650001202141650001402153650002202167650001202189650001702201650001102218650001602229650002702245650001402272650001302286700002102299700002102320700002302341700002502364773012002389856007302509852000902582655001202591IND60626259320221123015111.0181220e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062625932DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.149082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManhard, Christopher V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0452-991610aLocal adaptation of phenology revealed in outcrosses between spawning segments of a salmonid population  ap. 4698-4710.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLocal adaptation has been demonstrated in spatially or temporally distant animal populations but seldom in proximate populations. To address the scale of local adaptation in Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), two generations of hybrids between temporally separated spawning segments were made in a population of pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) and compared with controls to evaluate the genetic architecture underlying adult migration time and to test for declines in marine survival that resulted from outbreeding depression. Bayesian mixed‐effects models revealed that adult migration times in hybrid lines were intermediate to those of controls and that additive sources of genetic variation were significant, thereby indicating that local adaptation has acted on additive genetic variation in shaping this trait. Similarly, a line cross analysis revealed that an additive model best described the genetic architecture of adult migration time. In contrast, marine survival was generally similar between control and hybrid lines, which suggested that the effect of outbreeding upon marine survival was minimal at such a fine scale of genetic divergence. The implications of these results are that (a) local adaptation can facilitate genetic divergence of life history traits between proximate subpopulations; (b) artificial relaxation of natural barriers to gene flow can cause maladaptive shifts in life history traits; and (c) wild populations may harbour fine‐scale adaptive variation that supports productivity and sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data  cAlaska Sea Grant  cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Sea Grant  aNA060AR4170013cDepartment of Commerce  cUniversity of Alaska 3aBayesian theory 3aOncorhynchus gorbuscha 3aadults 3aanimals 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3alife history 3amodels 3aoutbreeding 3aoutbreeding depression 3aphenology 3aspawning1 aAdkison, Milo D.1 aHard, Jeffrey J.1 aSmoker, William W.1 aGharrett, Anthony J.0 tMolecular ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 27, no. 23 p.4698-4710dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.149083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002100185245008600206300001100292506007600303520210600379592002802485506003702513650005302550650001402603650001402617650002802631650001502659650001202674650002302686650002402709650000902733650001502742651001802757700002202775700002602797773015802823856007802981852000903059655001203068IND60548036420221207115121.0160903e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054803642DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-4-442doi7 aPMC21317532pmcid7 a178948782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendoza, Jason A10aTelevision viewing, computer use, obesity, and adiposity in US preschool children  ap. 44.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: There is limited evidence in preschool children linking media use, such as television/video viewing and computer use, to obesity and adiposity. We tested three hypotheses in preschool children: 1) that watching > 2 hours of TV/videos daily is associated with obesity and adiposity, 2) that computer use is associated with obesity and adiposity, and 3) that > 2 hours of media use daily is associated with obesity and adiposity. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using nationally representative data on children, aged 2–5 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2002. Our main outcome measures were 1) weight status: normal versus overweight or at risk for overweight, and 2) adiposity: the sum of subscapular and triceps skinfolds (mm). Our main exposures were TV/video viewing (≤ 2 or > 2 hours/day), computer use (users versus non-users), and media use (≤ 2 or > 2 hours/day). We used multivariate Poisson and linear regression analyses, adjusting for demographic covariates, to test the independent association between TV/video viewing, computer use, or overall media use and a child's weight status or adiposity. RESULTS: Watching > 2 hours/day of TV/videos was associated with being overweight or at risk for overweight (Prevalence ratio = 1.34, 95% CI [1.07, 1.66]; n =1340) and with higher skinfold thicknesses (β = 1.08, 95% CI [0.19, 1.96]; n = 1337). Computer use > 0 hours/day was associated with higher skinfold thicknesses (β = 0.56, 95% CI [0.04, 1.07]; n = 1339). Media use had borderline significance with higher skinfold thicknesses (β = 0.85, 95% CI [-0.04, 1.75], P=0.06; n = 1334) CONCLUSION: Watching > 2 hours/day of TV/videos in US preschool-age children was associated with a higher risk of being overweight or at risk for overweight and higher adiposity–findings in support of national guidelines to limit preschool children's media use. Computer use was also related to higher adiposity in preschool children, but not weight status. Intervention studies to limit preschool children's media use are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadiposity 3acomputers 3across-sectional studies 3aguidelines 3aobesity 3apreschool children 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atelevision 3aUnited States1 aZimmerman, Fred J1 aChristakis, Dimitri A0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2007 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.44-44dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-4-443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014300157300001800300520116600318592002801484650001701512650001501529650001501544650002101559650001701580650000901597650000901606650001501615650002901630650001901659650001801678650003301696650002201729650002101751700001801772700001301790700001801803700001901821773014001840856007401980852000902054655001202063IND60668816920221119202249.0190920e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066881692DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ta00246a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Guobo12aA phosphorus–nitrogen containing dendrimer reduces the flammability of nanostructured polymers with embedded self-assembled gel networks  ap. 1677-1687.  aA novel phosphorus–nitrogen containing dendrimer DPC–PAMAM has been obtained by the functionalization of amine terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) with diphenyl phosphoryl chloride (DPC), which is used to modify polyurethane (PU) as an intumescent flame retardant. The gel-phase network, made up of a number of nanofibers, is formed by the self-assembly of DPC–PAMAM dendrimer, which is embedded in the PU matrix by in situ polymerization. The results from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimeter testing indicate that the addition of the DPC–PAMAM gelator improves thermal stability and reduces significantly the flammability (including peak heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), average mass loss rate (AMLR), etc.) of PU resin. Furthermore, incorporating the DPC–PAMAM gelator into the polymer matrix enhances the strength of PU resin. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that a compact and dense intumescent char is formed for PU composites filled with DPC–PAMAM after combustion, which results in the improvement of flame-retardant properties of the polymer matrix by condensed phase flame retardancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimeters 3acombustion 3adendrimers 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3agels 3aheat 3ananofibers 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aYang, Jianguo1 aWang, Xu1 aGao, Jianrong1 aLiang, Huading0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Jan. 2, v. 1, no. 5 p.1677-1687dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ta00246a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008800168520151500256592002801771650002801799650000801827650001601835650001901851650001001870650002001880650001601900650001401916650002001930650003101950650001101981650001601992650001402008650001402022650001802036653002102054653001502075653001502090700001802105700001902123700001702142773011502159856008502274852000902359655001202368IND60755143820221119163959.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075514382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1051242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Congshan14aThe RNA modification in Echinococcus granulosus cysts revealed by mass spectrometry  aRNA modifications, as one of epigenetic mechanisms, are important and conserved mechanisms for maintaining the homeostasis of organisms. Little is known about RNA modifications in Echinococcus granulosus, an obligate parasite that inhabits mammals and gives rise to a huge public health and economic impact. Here, we focused on the RNA modification characteristics of E. granulosus for the first time by using mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze 47 types of RNA modifications in E. granulosus total RNA. Furthermore, the E. granulosus homologs of writer enzymes preforming RNA modifications were identified, and their gene expression pattern at different developmental stages were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis. Finally, 23 types of RNA modifications were found in E. granulosus cysts total RNA, of which m¹A, Ψ and m⁵C are the most abundant. The homologs of writer enzymes involved in these modifications were identified in the E. granulosus genome, with the dynamic gene expression during the different parasitic developmental stages. This work confirms that E. granulosus retains the conserved RNA modification mechanism during evolution, suggesting the important role of RNA modification in regulating its development and parasitic process. Moreover, the differences of amino acid sequences of RNA modification writer enzymes between parasite and host make it possible to use these enzymes as the candidate drug targets in the follow-up in-depth researches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aRNA 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3adrugs 3aeconomic impact 3aepigenetics 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenome 3ahomeostasis 3ainfection 3aparasites 3apublic health 0aRNA modification 0aEpigenetic 0aUPLC-MS/MS1 aCao, Jianping1 aZhang, Haobing1 aYin, Jianhai0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Dec., v. 96 p.105124-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1051243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016100167520183900328592002802167650001902195650001702214650001602231650003002247650001502277650001702292650001602309650001102325651001802336651001002354653003102364653004102395653005802436653001602494700005402510700001702564700005702581700001402638773010702652856008702759852000902846655001202855IND60741903020221118004311.0210708e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074190302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1185492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wei10aAppreciable role of stratospheric polar vortex in the abnormal diffusion of air pollutant in North China in 2015/2016 winter and implications for prediction  aThe longer predictability limit and downward impact on the extratropical circulations and weather have made the winter Stratospheric Polar Vortex (SPV) variability a new source for sub-seasonal prediction in extratropical wintertime. Using the PM2.5 observation data and high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data during 2014–2019, we investigate the characteristics of SPV and its linkage to the tropospheric meteorological condition during the abnormal PM₂.₅ diffusion event in North China in 2015/2016 winter. Results show that this diffusion event includes two stages: rapid diffusion stage (December 22–28, 2015) and persistent diffusion stage (January 1–23, 2016). The tropospheric meteorological condition in both stages was characterized by enhanced northerlies over North China, which dominantly led to the anomalous PM₂.₅ concentration drop. An active coupling process between SPV and surface Arctic Oscillation (AO) is found at the persistent diffusion stage, rather than at the rapid diffusion stage. The amplified tropospheric waves associated with the negative AO in the end of December propagated upward and helped split the SPV into two sub-vortices respectively over North Atlantic and North Asia in the beginning of January; the SPV weakening signal then propagated downward, helping intensify the negative AO since January 11, which further strengthened the northerly as well as PM₂.₅ diffusion over the entire East Asia. This case study demonstrates that the stratosphere-troposphere coupling effectively favors and extend the duration of PM₂.₅ diffusion, and the weakening of SPV provides a long lead information (1–2 weeks) to the meteorological diffusion condition, thus showing appreciable potential for extending the predictability limit of meteorological diffusion condition in North China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3acase studies 3aenvironment 3ameteorological parameters 3aprediction 3astratosphere 3atroposphere 3awinter 3aArctic region 3aChina 0aStratospheric polar vortex 0aStratosphere-troposphere interaction 0aMeteorological diffusion condition for air pollutants 0aNorth China1 aYu, Yueyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1885-30741 aYin, Zhicong1 aChen, Haishan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2403-31871 aGao, Meng0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 259 p.118549-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1185493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245011600216506010400332506007600436520098900512592002801501506003701529650004101566650002201607650001801629650003301647650002001680650001101700650001501711653001001726653002001736653002701756653003501783653001301818653002101831700002401852700002601876700002001902773011501922856008602037852000902123655001202132IND60787521820221207113335.0220906e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078752182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRigby, Alexander M.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3244-327110aLUCST: A novel toolkit for Land Use Land Cover change assessment in SWAT+ to support flood management decisions  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLand Use Land Cover (LULC) change is widely recognised as one of the most important factors impacting the hydrological response of river basins. SWAT+, the latest version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, has been used extensively to assess the hydrological impacts of LULC change. However, the process of making and assessing such changes in SWAT+ is often cumbersome and non-intuitive, thereby reducing its usability amongst a wider pool of applied users. We address this issue by developing a user-friendly toolkit, Land Use Change SWAT + Toolkit (LUCST), that will: (1) allow the end-user to define various LULC change scenarios in their study catchment, (2) run the SWAT+ model with the specified LULC changes, and (3) enable interactive visualisation of the different SWAT+ output variables. A good System Usability Score (79.8) and positive feedback from end-users promises the potential for adopting LUCST in future LULC change studies. https://youtu.be/QygBidYr4cQ.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acomputer software 3aflood control 3aland use and land cover maps 3aland use change 3arivers 3awatersheds 0aSWAT+ 0aLand use change 0aHydrological modelling 0aOpen-source JavaScript package 0aFlooding 0aVisual analytics1 aButcher, Peter W.S.1 aRitsos, Panagiotis D.1 aPatil, Sopan D.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2022 Oct., v. 156 p.105469-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009500157300001800252500002000270520178800290592002802078596003702106596005802143596007702201650000802278650002702286650002602313650002302339650001502362650001002377650001302387650002302400650001402423650003502437651001202472651001402484700002702498700002202525700002002547700006202567773012002629856007302749852000902822655001202831IND60626259520221123023958.0181220e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062625952DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.147822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shenglin10aGenomic parallelism and lack thereof in contrasting systems of three‐spined sticklebacks  ap. 4725-4743.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aParallel evolution and the extent to which it involves gene reuse have attracted much interest. Whereas it has theoretically been predicted under which circumstances gene reuse is expected, empirical studies that directly compare systems showing high and low parallelism are rare. Three‐spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), where freshwater populations have been independently founded by ancestral marine populations, represent prime examples of phenotypic and genomic parallelism, but cases exist where parallelism is low. Based on RAD (restriction site associated DNA) sequencing, we analysed SNPs and chromosome inversions in populations in Denmark and Greenland showing low and high parallelism, respectively. We identified parallelism across freshwater populations in Greenland at genomic regions previously identified to be associated with marine–freshwater divergence. These same markers also separated Danish marine and freshwater sticklebacks, albeit to a weaker extent. Hence, parallelism was not absent in Denmark but possibly constrained by spatially and temporally varying selection. Divergence time estimates found one Danish freshwater population to be much older than the others. It also deviated strongly with respect to parallelism and may represent earlier postglacial colonization based on a different pool of standing variation and eliciting different adaptive responses to freshwater conditions. These findings provide empirical support to previous suggestions that the time since replicate populations had access to a common pool of standing variation is a major factor determining gene reuse. At last, based on the observed parallelism in the Greenlandic system we discuss the predictability of adaptive responses in newly established populations.  aPublisher supplied data  aVKR022523cThe Villum Foundation  aMarGencEU Interreg (Øresund‐Kattegat‐Skagerrak)  a1323‐00158AcDanish Council for Independent Research, Natural Sciences 3aDNA 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3achromosome inversions 3aempirical research 3afreshwater 3agenes 3agenomics 3aparallel evolution 3aphenotype 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aDenmark 3aGreenland1 aFerchaud, Anne‐Laure1 aGrønkjær, Peter1 aNygaard, Rasmus1 aHansen, Michael M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5372-48280 tMolecular ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 27, no. 23 p.4725-4743dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.147823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008800168300001600256520114000272592002801412650002301440650002101463650001701484650001301501650001001514650001801524650001401542650001101556650001201567653001901579653002501598653002301623653003401646653000901680653000701689653000701696653000901703653000801712700001801720700001401738700001501752700001901767773012301786856008501909852000901994655001202003IND60543303720221118092616.0190410e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054330372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zi-Ping10aIdentification and characterization of the 14-3-3 gene family in Hevea brasiliensis  ap. 121-127.  aThe 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved phospho-specific binding proteins involved in diverse physiological processes. Although the genome-wide analysis of this family has been carried out in certain plant species, little is known about 14-3-3 protein genes in rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). In this study, we identified 10 14-3-3 protein genes (designated as HbGF14a to HbGF14j) in the latest rubber tree genome. A phylogenetic tree was constructed and found to demonstrate that HbGF14s can be divided into two major groups. Tissue-specific expression profiles showed that 10 HbGF14 were expressed in at least one of the tissues, which suggested that HbGF14s participated in numerous cellular processes. The 10 HbGF14s responded to jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) treatment, which suggested that these HbGF14s were involved in response to JA and ET signaling. The target of HbGF14c protein was related to small rubber particle protein, a major rubber particle protein that is involved in rubber biosynthesis. These findings suggested that 14-3-3 proteins may be involved in the regulation of natural rubber biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHevea brasiliensis 3abinding proteins 3abiosynthesis 3aethylene 3agenes 3ajasmonic acid 3aphylogeny 3arubber 3atissues 0a14-3-3 protein 0aGenome-wide analysis 0aHevea brasiliensis 0aSmall rubber particle protein 0aBiFC 0aET 0aJA 0aSRPP 0aY2H1 aLi, Hui-Liang1 aGuo, Dong1 aTang, Xiao1 aPeng, Shi-Qing0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2014 July, v. 80 p.121-127dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002600142242012400168245011100292300001600403520107800419592002801497650001901525650001501544650000901559650001601568650002101584650001601605650001401621650002301635650001301658650001201671651001101683653002701694653000901721653002001730653002801750653002101778700002701799700002401826700002501850773012401875852000901999856007902008655001202087IND4462200320221120235138.0200513e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446220032DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.49.4.052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrighenti, Deodoro M.10aOptimización de los componentes de una dieta energética para las abejas africanizadas a través del modelo de mezclas10aOptimization of the components of an energetic diet for Africanized bees through the modelling of mixtures  ap. 326-333.  aThe Africanized bee Apis mellifera in Brazil possess a migratory tendency when there is a lack of food, so for that reason, it is common for beekeepers to supply an energetic diet to encourage fixed apiculture. This often consists of sucrose inverted using lemon juice, as beekeepers in remote rural areas cannot obtain citric acid for this purpose. In order to determine the optimum composition for these energetic diets, it is necessary to carry out both laboratory and field studies, to evaluate different proportions among the components usually used by the beekeepers for this supplementary feed. For these experiments, an appropriate statistical methodology, for instance, using the modelling of mixtures, allows a reduction in the number of treatments necessary. The present work studied the optimization of the following components: water, sugar and lemon juice, used in an energetic diet to maximize the longevity of bees kept in the laboratory. Our results showed that the optimum mixture was 47.50% water, 46.25% granulated sugar together with 6.25% lemon juice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aapiculture 3abees 3acitric acid 3afeed supplements 3alemon juice 3alongevity 3amigratory behavior 3aresearch 3asucrose 3aBrazil 0aAfricanized honey bees 0adiet 0acurves of level 0aextreme vertices design 0aprocess variable1 aBrighenti, Carla R.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, resistance determinant screening, plasmid electroporation and sequence comparisons were performed. High rates of clindamycin (92.5%, 270/292) and erythromycin (92.8%, 271/292) resistance were observed. Additionally, 88.2% (60/68) of the ST59 MRSA isolates and 78.9% (15/19) of the ST239 MRSA isolates had constitutive resistance to clindamycin, while 82.0% (123/150) of the ST5 MRSA isolates showed inducible clindamycin resistance. The ermB gene was identified in 80.9% (55/68) of the ST59 isolates but was not detected in ST5 and ST239 MRSA isolates. Detection rates of ermA were high in the ST5 (99.3%, 149/150) and ST239 (89.5%, 17/19) MRSA isolates, but no ermA-positive ST59 MRSA isolates were identified. The ermC gene, observed to be harbored on similar, transmissible plasmids ranging in size from 2402 to 2473 bp, were found in different MRSA lineages. Summarily, high erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rates were observed in MRSA isolates. ST59 and ST239 MRSA isolates primarily exhibited constitutive resistance, while ST5 MRSA isolates showed inducible resistance phenotypes. ermA and ermB genes were frequently carried by specific MRSA clones, while ermC gene was present within small transmissible plasmids in all lineages. Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance genes transfer between MRSA isolates in healthcare settings remains a problem, and infection control procedures should be applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aclindamycin 3adisease control 3aelectroporation 3aerythromycin 3aevolution 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3ainfection 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aplasmids 3aChina 0aClindamycin resistance 0aerm gene 0aPlasmid1 aZhuang, Hemu1 aJi, Shujuan1 aSun, Lu1 aZhao, Feng1 aWu, Dandan1 aShen, Ping1 aJiang, Yan1 aYu, Yunsong1 aChen, Yan0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Dec., v. 96 p.105127-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1051273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245005100179300001600230500000900246520061800255592002800873650000800901650002400909650001400933650001200947650001400959650001000973650002200983650001901005650001301024650001401037650001401051650001301065651001701078700001701095700001601112773020601128856009401334852000901428655001201437IND60665938420221120153036.0191028e198010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066593842DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1980.00472425000900040032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOscarson, D.

The oxidation is not affected by flushing N₂ or air through the sediment suspensions, nor does the addition of HgCl₂ to the system eliminate the conversion of As(III) to As(V). The oxidation is an abiotic process with microorganisms playing a relatively minor role in this system. Because As(III) is more toxic and sorbed to a lesser extent by sediments than As(V), the suspended and bottom sediments may potentially alleviate the toxicity of As(III) through abiotic oxidation in aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaquatic environment 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3alakes 3amercuric chloride 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3asediments 3atoxicity 3aSaskatchewan1 aHuang, P.

However, concerns remain as to the potential detrimental effects of both the immobilized ZVI and the adsorbed pollutants as the treated system could undergo transformations over time. Accordingly, plans for soil remediation by in situ immobilization of sorbents should include a long-term monitoring of the treated systems. Here, we report on a comparative study in which artificially Cu-contaminated sandy and organic soils characterized by different metal binding capacities were treated by either (i) in situ immobilization of ZVI in the soils, or (ii) by a ZVI amendment followed by magnetic retrieval of formed ZVI-Cu complexes prior to plant growth studies. The latter relies on the combination of the high metal adsorption capacity and magnetism of ZVI. Two plant species, Lactuca sativa (lettuce) and Brassica juncea (Indian mustard) were used to assess the efficiency of the two treatment methods in eliminating the bioavailable fraction of Cu. Overall, the results showed that, if soil remediation by in situ immobilization reduces the bio-accessible fraction of Cu, treatment using ZVI amendment followed by magnetic separation performs better. The latter resulted in less Cu accumulated in the shoots and roots of plants. In parallel to the plant growth study, we used MetPLATE™, a short-term bioassay based on the inhibition of the β-galactosidase enzyme by the bioavailable fraction of heavy metal cations, to predict the efficiency of the two treatment methods with regard to the elimination of Cu phyto-toxicity. The results of the bioassay confirmed the trends of phyto-toxicity results, suggesting that MetPLATE™ could be an adequate alternative to the more expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming plant growth studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aLactuca sativa 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abeta-galactosidase 3abinding capacity 3abioassays 3acations 3acopper 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alabor 3alettuce 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3amonitoring 3aorganic soils 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil remediation 3atoxicity 0aSoil 0aCopper 0aRemediation 0aZVI 0aMagnetic separation 0aMetPLATE™ 0aToxicity1 aGhoveisi, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2457-91391 aBitton, Gabriel1 aBonzongo, Jean-Claude J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8431-77230 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Dec., v. 219 p.9-18dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245009700207520080200304592002801106650001601134650001901150650001201169650001701181650001001198650001701208650002501225653002301250653004201273653001201315653001201327653001801339700005801357700005201415700006301467700005601530773011501586856008201701852000901783655001201792IND60787522220221119145247.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078752222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2022.1022792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheung, Alice Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7973-022X10aPollen–pistil interactions: It takes two to tangle but a molecular cast of many to deliver  aExplosive advances have been made in the molecular understanding of pollen-pistil interactions that underlie reproductive success in flowering plants in the past three decades. Among the most notable is the discovery of pollen tube attractants [1∗,2∗]. The roles these molecules play in facilitating conspecific precedence thus promoting interspecific genetic isolation are also emerging [3–5]. Male-female interactions during the prezygotic phase and contributions from the male and female gametophytes have been comprehensively reviewed recently. Here, we focus on key advances in understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of how these interactions overcome barriers at various pollen-pistil interfaces along the pollen tube growth pathway to facilitate fertilization by desirable mates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattractants 3aconspecificity 3afemales 3agametophytes 3amales 3apollen tubes 3areproductive success 0aPlant reproduction 0aMalectin-like domain receptor kinases 0aFERONIA 0aGPI-APs 0aRALF peptides1 aDuan, Qiaohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9016-89041 aLi, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4537-80501 aJames Liu, Ming-Che1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0032-12881 aWu, Hen-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2108-38480 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2022 Oct., v. 69 p.102279-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2022.1022793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245007400205300001100279506007600290520178800366592002802154506003702182650001102219650002302230650001302253650002002266650000802286650001202294650001602306650002102322650001602343650001102359650001602370650002102386651001402407700002402421700002402445700002102469773015802490856007802648852000902726655001202735IND60548036820221207115130.0160903e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054803682DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-4-482doi7 aPMC20822762pmcid7 a179107542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGregory, Cria O10aActivities contributing to energy expenditure among Guatemalan adults  ap. 48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Guatemala has experienced a substantial increase in overweight and obesity in recent years, yet physical activity patterns and consequent energy expenditure are largely unexplored in this population. METHODS: To describe overall physical activity levels (PAL) and activities contributing to daily energy expenditure, we analyzed time spent in daily activities as reported by 985 women and 819 men, living in rural and urban areas of Guatemala in 2002–04. RESULTS: Physical activity levels recommended to prevent obesity (PAL ≥ 1.70) differed by residence/occupation among men (agricultural-rural: 77%; nonagricultural-rural: 36%; urban: 24%; P < 0.01), but not women (rural: 2%; urban: 3%; P = 0.5). Median energy expenditure was higher among agricultural-rural men (44 MET*h/d; MET = metabolic equivalent) compared to nonagricultural-rural (37 MET*h/d) and urban men (35 MET*h/d; P < 0.01); energy expenditure was slightly lower among rural compared to urban women (34 MET*h/d vs. 35 MET*h/d; P < 0.01). Occupation was the largest contributor to energy expenditure (19–24 MET*h/d); among women and nonagricultural-rural and urban men this was primarily of a light intensity. Energy expenditure in sedentary activities ranged from 2 MET*h/d among rural women to 6 MET*h/d among agricultural-rural men. Any sports/exercise time was reported by 35% and 5% of men and women, respectively. Nevertheless, the majority of participants believed they were significantly active to stay healthy. CONCLUSION: Overall, energy expenditure was low in the population not dedicated to agricultural occupations; an increased focus on active leisure-time behaviors may be needed to counterbalance reductions in energy expenditure consequent to sedentarization of primary occupations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aenergy expenditure 3aexercise 3alight intensity 3amen 3aobesity 3aoccupations 3arural population 3arural women 3asports 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aGuatemala1 aRamirez-Zea, Manuel1 aMartorell, Reynaldo1 aStein, Aryeh D.,0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2007 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.48-48dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-4-483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01897naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009600165300001400261520091500275592002801190650002301218650001401241650002001255650002001275650002401295650001601319650001701335700001401352773012601366856008201492852000901574655001201583IND60089385020221119110116.0141102e20110429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008938502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, In-Hyun10aDenitrosylation of S-nitrosylated OGT is triggered in LPS-stimulated innate immune response  ap. 52-57.  aO-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT)-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation has been revealing various aspects of functional significance in biological processes, such as cellular signaling and activation of immune system. We found that OGT is maintained as S-nitrosylated form in resting cells, and its denitrosylation is triggered in innate immune response of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophage cells. S-nitrosylation of OGT strongly inhibits its catalytic activity up to more than 80% of native OGT, and denitrosylation of OGT leads to protein hyper-O-GlcNAcylation. Furthermore, blockage of increased protein O-GlcNAcylation results in significant loss of nitric oxide and cytokine production. We propose that denitrosylation of S-nitrosylated OGT is a direct mechanism for upregulation of OGT activity by which immune defense is critically controlled in LPS-stimulated innate immune response.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acytokines 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3anitric oxide1 aDo, Su-Il0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Apr. 29, v. 408, no. 1 p.52-57dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009600169300001500265520185300280592002802133650001902161650002402180650002102204650001102225650001502236650001902251650001602270651001102286653001002297653000802307653000802315653000902323653000902332653000902341653000802350653000802358653000802366653001302374653002502387653001902412653000902431653002702440700006202467700002402529700002302553700002002576700001802596700002102614700001902635700002002654700001702674700002002691700002002711700001702731700002702748700002602775700002402801700002302825700005802848710006102906773010502967856008203072852000903154655001203163IND60618422520221118055617.0210114e20190325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061842252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2018.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimell, Birgit A.10aTransnational access to large prospective cohorts in Europe: Current trends and unmet needs  ap. 98-103.  aBiobank samples and data from studies of large prospective cohorts (LPC) represent an invaluable resource for health research. Efficient sharing and pooling of samples and data is a central pre-requisite for new advances in biomedical science. This requirement, however, is not compatible with the present scattered and traditional access governance structures, where legal and ethical frameworks often form an obstacle for effective sharing. Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is demanding increasingly rigorous administration from all those organisations processing personal data. The BBMRI-LPC project (Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure ― Large Prospective Cohorts) assembled 21 LPCs from 10 countries and two EU-wide multinational cohort networks with a key objective to promote collaborative innovative transnational research proposed by external researchers on the broad field of common chronic diseases, and analyze the gaps and needs involved. BBMRI-LPC organized three scientific calls to offer European investigators an opportunity to gain free of charge transnational access to research material available in the participating cohorts. A total of 11 high-quality research proposals involving multiple prospective cohorts were granted, and the access process in the individual projects carefully monitored. Divergent access governance structures, complex legal and ethical frameworks and heterogeneous procedures were identified as currently constituting substantial obstacles for sample and data transfer in Europe. To optimize the scientific value and use of these research resources, practical solutions for more streamlined access governance in collaborative projects are urgently needed. A number of infrastructure developments could be made to improve time-efficiency in access provision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiomedical research 3achronic diseases 3aethics 3agovernance 3ainfrastructure 3aresearchers 3aEurope 0aBBMRI 0aDTA 0aEEA 0aELSI 0aERIC 0aGDPR 0aLPC 0aMTA 0aPPP 0aBiobanks 0aTransnational access 0aCohort studies 0aGDPR 0aCollaborative research1 aTörnwall, Outi M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9017-98541 aHämäläinen, Iiro1 aWichmann, H.-Erich1 aAnton, Gabriele1 aBrennan, Paul1 aBouvard, Laurene1 aSlimani, Nadia1 aMoskal, Aurelie1 aGunter, Marc1 aZatloukal, Kurt1 aMinion, Joel T.1 aSoini, Sirpa1 aMayrhofer, Michaela T.1 aMurtagh, Madeleine J.1 avan Ommen, Gert-Jan1 aJohansson, Mattias1 aPerola, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4842-16672 afor the BBMRI-LPC Consortium (FP7 GA no. 313010)eauthor0 tNew biotechnology.g2019 Mar. 25, v. 49 p.98-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2018.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168520088400284592002801168650001501196650001301211650002701224650001601251650002201267650001701289650002801306653002801334653002201362653003901384653002601423653001601449653001101465653001301476653001001489653001801499653001501517653001601532653001101548653001601559653001101575700002801586700006001614773011501674856008201789852000901871655001201880IND60787522520221119145031.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078752252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2022.1022932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, R.

New insights into how enzymatic ROS-producing machinery is regulated by hormones or localized during development have provided a framework for understanding the mechanisms that control ROS accumulation patterns. Signaling-mediated increases in ROS can then modulate the activity of proteins through reversible oxidative modification of specific cysteine residues. Plants also control the synthesis of antioxidants, including plant-specialized metabolites, to further define when, where, and how much ROS accumulate. The availability of sophisticated imaging capabilities, combined with a growing tool kit of ROS detection technologies, particularly genetically encoded biosensors, sets the stage for improved understanding of ROS as signaling molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acysteine 3agrowth and development 3ametabolites 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3areactive oxygen species 0aReactive oxygen species 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aRespiratory burst oxidase homologs 0aClass III peroxidases 0aArabidopsis 0aTomato 0aEthylene 0aAuxin 0aAbscisic acid 0aRoot hairs 0aGuard cells 0aPollen 0aroGFP2-Orp1 0aHyPer71 aPostiglione, Anthony E.1 aMuday, Gloria K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0377-45170 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2022 Oct., v. 69 p.102293-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2022.1022933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014600173300001600319520181500335592002802150650002502178650001602203650001002219650000902229650002202238650001002260650000902270650001702279650001402296650001102310700002502321700002302346773010002369856004802469852000902517655001202526IND50063353220221120030741.0130324e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006335322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-012-9558-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Adeljean L.

Juveniles of 30 days-post-hatch were fed 40, 60, 80, or 160 mg esterified astaxanthin per kg diet (mg kg⁻¹) for 90 days. Skin coloration was analyzed using the hue, saturation, and luminosity model. Increased astaxanthin concentrations and duration on diet lead to improvements in skin color, that is, lower hues (~27–29 to ~14–17; redder fish), higher saturation (~77 to ~87 %), and lower luminosity (~43 to ~35 %). Fish fed 80 and 160 mg kg⁻¹ astaxanthin feed showed significant coloration improvements over fish fed lower astaxanthin feeds. Increasing both dietary astaxanthin concentration and time on the feed resulted in significant increases in total skin carotenoid concentration (0.033–0.099 μg mm⁻²). Furthermore, there was a significant linear relationship between hue and total skin carotenoid concentration. Compositionally, free astaxanthin and 4-hydroxyzeaxanthin were the major skin carotenoids. 4-hydroxyzeaxanthin was previously unreported for A. ocellaris. Carotenoid composition was affected by duration on diet. Fraction 4-hydroxyzeaxanthin increased by ~15 %, while free astaxanthin decreased equivalently. The transition from 4-hydroxyzeaxanthin to free astaxanthin appears to follow a reductive pathway. Results suggest that managing coloration in the production of A. ocellaris juveniles requires manipulation of both dietary astaxanthin concentration and period of exposure to astaxanthin containing diet. In order to achieve more orange–red-colored fish, feeding 80–160 mg kg⁻¹ esterified astaxanthin for an extended duration is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphiprion ocellaris 3aastaxanthin 3acolor 3adiet 3aexposure duration 3afeeds 3afish 3afish feeding 3ajuveniles 3amodels1 aO’Shea, Stephen K.1 aPomeroy, Harold F.0 tAquaculture international.g2013 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.361-374dSpringer-Verlagx0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-012-9558-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015500170300001600325520117000341592002801511650002201539650002801561650002001589650001001609650001501619650002501634650001201659650001101671650002201682650002201704650001201726650001501738650001101753653003701764653002301801653001201824653002201836653003701858700001901895700001601914700001801930700001701948700001801965773012301983856008502106852000902191655001202200IND60543304420221118093012.0190410e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054330442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yong-heng10aBase substitution mutations in uridinediphosphate-dependent glycosyltransferase 76G1 gene of Stevia rebaudiana causes the low levels of rebaudioside A  ap. 220-225.  aSteviol glycosides, extracted from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana (Bert) Bertoni, are calorie-free sugar substitute of natural origin with intensely sweet (Boileau et al., 2012). Stevioside and rebaudioside A are the two main kinds of the diterpenic glycosides. We analyzed the concentration of stevioside and rebaudioside A in Stevia leaves of about 500 samples (hybrid progenies) and discovered a mutation plant “Z05” with very low levels of rebaudioside A. Because UGT76G1, a uridinediphosphate-dependent glycosyltransferases, is responsible for the conversion from stevioside to rebaudioside A (Richman et al., 2005), so mutation identification was done by sequencing the candidate gene, UGT76G1. In this study molecular analysis of two strains revealed a heterozygotic nonsense mutation of c.389T > G (p.L121X) in UGT76G1. Meanwhile, we found some amino acid substitutions significant change the protein structure. And the difference of enzyme activity between two strains proved the lack of functionality of UGT76G1 of the mutation “Z05”. So the nonsense mutation and amino acid substitution mutation resulted in the low levels of rebaudioside A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStevia rebaudiana 3aamino acid substitution 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglycosides 3aglycosyltransferases 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3anonsense mutation 3aprotein structure 3asteviol 3astevioside 3asugars 0aStevia rebaudiana (Bert) Bertoni 0aLow-rebaudioside A 0aUGT76G1 0aNonsense mutation 0aAmino acid substitution mutation1 aHuang, Su-zhen1 aHan, Yu-lin1 aYuan, Hai-yan1 aGu, Chun-sun1 aZhao, Yan-hai0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2014 July, v. 80 p.220-225dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013900158300001800297500002000315520153700335592002801872596002901900650001901929650002601948650001601974650002801990650001102018650000902029650001002038650002402048650002702072650001602099650002102115650001302136650001802149650000902167650001802176650001402194650004102208650004302249650001602292650001002308650000902318650001302327700001802340700005402358773013402412856007302546852000902619655001202628IND60685526420221119082111.0200304e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068552642DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.145362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez, J.A.10aPseudomonas fluorescens LBUM677 differentially increases plant biomass, total oil content and lipid composition in three oilseed crops  ap. 1119-1127.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Pseudomonas spp. have been widely studied for their plant growth–promoting effects. However, their capacity to promote lipid accumulation in oilseed crops is not well characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Pseudomonas fluorescens LBUM677 on lipid accumulation in three oilseed crops: soybean (Glycine max), canola (Brassica napus) and corn gromwell (Buglossoides arvensis), a plant of high nutraceutical interest for its accumulation of the omega‐3 stearidonic acid. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pot experiments were conducted under controlled conditions where seeds were inoculated or not with LBUM677 and plants were harvested at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. A qPCR assay specifically targeting LBUM677 was used in parallel to correlate LBUM677 soil rhizosphere competency to growth promotion and seed lipid accumulation. Total oil seed content and fatty acid composition were analysed at seed maturity. Results showed that LBUM677 was able to establish itself in the rhizosphere of the three plant species at similar levels, but it differentially increased plant biomass, total oil content and lipid composition in a plant‐specific manner. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some species‐specific differences observed in P. fluorescens LBUM677's effect on different crops, the strain appears to be a generalist plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria of oilseed crops. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: LBUM677 shows great potential to be used as an inoculum to promote oil yield and fatty acid accumulation in oilseed crops.  aPublisher supplied data  cAtlantic Innovation Fund 3aBrassica napus 3aBuglossoides arvensis 3aGlycine max 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3acanola 3acorn 3acrops 3adietary supplements 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3agrowth promotion 3ainoculum 3alipid content 3aoils 3aoilseed crops 3aphytomass 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3aseeds 3asoil 3asoybeans1 aNovinscak, A.1 aFilion, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8150-534X0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 Apr., v. 128, no. 4 p.1119-1127dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.145363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04185naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245017200197300001800369500002000387520171700407592002802124596009002152596011602242596003902358596004002397596007602437596013602513596006902649650001902718650001502737650002002752650002202772650001502794650002202809650002702831650001102858650001202869650000902881700005502890700005902945700002703004700002603031700006703057700005903124700005903183700006303242700006303305700006103368773012003429856007303549852000903622655001203631IND60626260020221118062352.0181220e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062626002DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.148882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaboada, Sergi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1669-115210aImplications of population connectivity studies for the design of marine protected areas in the deep sea: An example of a demosponge from the Clarion‐Clipperton Zone  ap. 4657-4679.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe abyssal demosponge Plenaster craigi inhabits the Clarion‐Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the northeast Pacific, a region with abundant seafloor polymetallic nodules with potential mining interest. Since P. craigi is a very abundant encrusting sponge on nodules, understanding its genetic diversity and connectivity could provide important insights into extinction risks and design of marine protected areas. Our main aim was to assess the effectiveness of the Area of Particular Environmental Interest 6 (APEI‐6) as a potential genetic reservoir for three adjacent mining exploration contract areas (UK‐1A, UK‐1B and OMS‐1A). As in many other sponges, COI showed extremely low variability even for samples ~900 km apart. Conversely, the 168 individuals of P. craigi, genotyped for 11 microsatellite markers, provided strong genetic structure at large geographical scales not explained by isolation by distance (IBD). Interestingly, we detected molecular affinities between samples from APEI‐6 and UK‐1A, despite being separated ~800 km. Although our migration analysis inferred very little progeny dispersal of individuals between areas, the major differentiation of OMS‐1A from the other areas might be explained by the occurrence of predominantly northeasterly transport predicted by the HYCOM hydrodynamic model. Our study suggests that although APEI‐6 does serve a conservation role, with species connectivity to the exploration areas, it is on its own inadequate as a propagule source for P. craigi for the entire eastern portion of the CCZ. Our new data suggest that an APEI located to the east and/or the south of the UK‐1, OMS‐1, BGR, TOML and NORI areas would be highly valuable.  aPublisher supplied data  a679849cEuropean Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program ‘SponGES’  cThe Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) funded National Capability cruise on the RRS James Cook (JC120)  cThe Natural History Museum, London  cThe Swedish research council FORMAS  cThe National Ocean Partnership Program and the Office of Naval Research  aAgreement no. 603418cEuropean Union Seventh Framework Programme ‘Managing Impacts of Deep‐sea Resource Exploitation’ (MIDAS)  cUK Seabed Resources Ltd environmental baseline study (ABYSSLINE) 3aedible seaweed 3aextinction 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ahydrologic models 3amarine protected areas 3amining 3aprogeny 3arisk1 aRiesgo, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7993-15231 aWiklund, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8252-35041 aPaterson, Gordon L.

The volunteers were randomized on a low-phosphorous diet (n = 4) or a normal phosphorus diet (n = 4). Although high-altitude exposure caused a significant increase in plasma erythropoietin (EPO) (before high-altitude exposure: low phosphorus: median EPO 6.6 mIU/ml [interquartile range (IQR) 6.0; 8.2], normal phosphorus: median EPO 9.0 mIU/ml [IQR 7.9; 11.5]; at day 2: low phosphorus: median EPO 21.3 mIU/ml [IQR 19.5; 23.8], normal phosphorus: median EPO 19.4 mIU/ml [IQR 18.0; 20.8]), there was no consistent increase in plasma c-terminal FGF23 or plasma intact FGF23. We observed only a single, intermittent peak in c-terminal FGF23 levels after 5 h of maximal aerobic exercise.These data do not support a substantial effect of moderate hypoxia alone on the expression of FGF23, but they suggest that combined exercise and high-altitude exposure may temporarily induce FGF23 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aanimal models 3adiet 3aerythropoietin 3aexercise 3afibroblast growth factors 3ahuman physiology 3ahypoxia 3ametabolism 3aphosphorus 3avolunteers 0aHypoxia 0aEPO 0aFGF23 0aCKD-MBD metabolites1 aDederer, Juliane1 aKircher, Angelika1 aKlemis, Verena1 aLennartz, Claudia S.1 aUntersteller, Kathrin1 aWagenpfeil, Stefan1 aFliser, Danilo1 aWolf, Myles1 aHeine, Gunnar H.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2019 Dec., v. 29, no. 12 p.1361-1367dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2019.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011700165300001400282500001500296520130800311592002801619650001301647650000901660650001601669650002701685650001301712650001701725650002201742650001601764650001901780650001101799650001601810650001801826650001501844650002301859650001101882653001001893653001001903700001801913700001701931700002401948700001601972700001801988700001902006700001702025700002102042700001702063700001802080700001802098700001702116700001902133700001702152773012602169856008202295852000902377655001202386IND60089385520221119110102.0141102e20110429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008938552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Je Hein10aProteomic identification of an embryo-specific 1Cys-Prx promoter and analysis of its activity in transgenic rice  ap. 78-83.  a2019-12-06  aProteomic analysis of a rice callus led to the identification of 10 abscisic acid (ABA)-induced proteins as putative products of the embryo-specific promoter candidates. 5′-flanking sequence of 1Cys-Prx, a highly-induced protein gene, was cloned and analyzed. The transcription initiation site of 1Cys-Prx maps 96 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon and a TATA-box and putative seed-specific cis-acting elements, RYE and ABRE, are located 26, 115 and 124bp upstream of the transcription site, respectively. β-glucuronidase (GUS) expression driven by the 1Cys-Prx promoters was strong in the embryo and aleurone layer and the activity reached up to 24.9±3.3 and 40.5±2.1pmol (4MU/min/μg protein) in transgenic rice seeds and calluses, respectively. The activity of the 1Cys-Prx promoters is much higher than that of the previously-identified embryo-specific promoters, and comparable to that of strong endosperm-specific promoters in rice. GUS expression driven by the 1Cys-Prx promoters has been increased by ABA treatment and rapidly induced by wounding in callus and at the leaf of the transgenic plants, respectively. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the GUS construct in Arabidopsis suggested that the 1Cys-Prx promoter also has strong activity in seeds of dicot plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3arice 3aArabidopsis 3atranslation (genetics) 3aTATA box 3aOryza sativa 3atransgenic plants 3anucleotides 3aaleurone layer 3aleaves 3astart codon 3aabscisic acid 3aproteomics 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acallus 0aseeds 0agenes1 aJung, In Jung1 aKim, Dool Yi1 aFanata, Wahyu Indra1 aSon, Bo Hwa1 aYoo, Jae Yong1 aHarmoko, Rikno1 aKo, Ki Seong1 aMoon, Jeong Chan1 aJang, Ho Hee1 aKim, Woe Yeon1 aKim, Jae-Yean1 aLim, Chae Oh1 aLee, Sang Yeol1 aLee, Kyun Oh0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Apr. 29, v. 408, no. 1 p.78-83dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002700142242013900169245008500308300001300393520139100406592002801797650001901825650001201844650002301856650001401879650001301893650001501906650001201921650001101933653001501944653001501959653000801974653001401982700001701996700002302013700001702036700002002053773012102073852000902194856007902203961001302282655001202295IND4462462420221120224738.0200513e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446246242DNAL7 a10.3896/IBRA.1.50.1.012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanEngelsdorp, Dennis,10aUna encuesta sobre la gestión de las pérdidas de colmenas de abejas en los EE.UU., entre el otoño de 2009 hasta el invierno de 201012aA survey of managed honey bee colony losses in the USA, fall 2009 to winter 2010  ap. 1-10.  aThis study records the fourth consecutive year of high winter losses in managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in the USA. Over the winter of 2009–2010, US beekeepers responding to this survey lost an average of 42.2% of their colonies, for a total loss of 34.4%. Commercial beekeepers (those operating more than 500 colonies) experienced lower total losses as compared to sideline and backyard beekeepers. Similarly, operations that maintained colonies in more than one state and operations that pollinated almond orchards over the survey period had lower total losses than operations either managing colonies in one state exclusively or those not pollinating almonds. On average beekeepers consider acceptable losses to be 14.5%, and 65% of all responding beekeepers suffered losses in excess of what they considered acceptable. The proportion of operations that experienced losses and reported having no dead bees in their colonies or apiaries was comparable to that reported in the winter of 2008–2009. Manageable conditions, such as starvation and a weak condition in the fall were the leading self-identified causes of mortality as reported by all beekeepers. Commercial beekeepers were, however, less likely to list such manageable causes, instead listing poor queens, mites, and pesticides most frequently as the self-identified causes of mortality in their operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aalmonds 3ahoney bee colonies 3amortality 3aresearch 3astarvation 3asurveys 3awinter 0aHoney bees 0aoverwinter 0aUSA 0a2009-20101 aHayes, Jerry1 aUnderwood, Robyn M1 aCaron, Dewey1 aPettis, Jeffery0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 50, no. 1 p.1-10dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3896/IBRA.1.50.1.013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02768naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011900167300001200286500001500298520139700313592002801710650001501738650001801753650001701771650001601788650001101804650001901815650001901834650001501853650001801868650002501886650001301911653001101924653002201935653001501957653002401972653002501996653002502021700001602046700001402062700001702076700001502093773008502108856008402193852000902277655001202286IND60559750020221116143516.0161216e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055975002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xiaoran10aRole of bovine serum albumin and humic acid in the interaction between SiO2 nanoparticles and model cell membranes  ap. 1-8.  a2019-12-06  aSilica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) can cause health hazard after their release into the environment. Adsorption of natural organic matter and biomolecules on SiO2 NPs alters their surface properties and cytotoxicity. In this study, SiO2 NPs were treated by bovine serum albumin (BSA) and humic acid (HA) to study their effects on the integrity and fluidity of model cell membranes. Giant and small unilamellar vesicles (GUVs and SUVs) were prepared as model cell membranes in order to avoid the interference of cellular activities. The microscopic observation revealed that the BSA/HA treated (BSA-/HA-) SiO2 NPs took more time to disrupt membrane than untreated-SiO2 NPs, because BSA/HA adsorption covered the surface SiOH/SiO- groups and weakened the interaction between NPs and phospholipids. The deposition of SiO2 NPs on membrane was monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Untreated- and HA-SiO2 NPs quickly disrupted the SUV layer on QCM-D sensor; BSA-SiO2 NPs attached on the membranes but only caused slow vesicle disruption. Untreated-, BSA- and HA-SiO2 NPs all caused the gelation of the positively-charged membrane, which was evaluated by the generalized polarity values. HA-SiO2 NPs caused most serious gelation, and BSA-SiO2 NPs caused the least. Our results demonstrate that the protein adsorption on SiO2 NPs decreases the NP-induced membrane damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroscopy 3aphospholipids 3acytotoxicity 3ahumic acids 3aquartz 3ahealth hazards 3acell membranes 3aadsorption 3ananoparticles 3abovine serum albumin 3agelation 0asilica 0aMembrane gelation 0aHumic acid 0aMembrane disruption 0aSilica nanoparticles 0aBovine serum albumin1 aQu, Xiaolei1 aDing, Lei1 aHu, Jingtian1 aJiang, Wei0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Dec., v. 219 p.1-8dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013100165300001600296520116600312536029001478592002801768650002901796650001701825650001301842650002401855650001501879650001701894650001501911650001701926653001401943653002001957653002001977653001601997653001702013653001502030700001802045700001302063700001202076700001502088700001602103700001702119700001702136700001502153700001702168773014202185856008602327852000902413655001202422IND60765531820221121075326.0220819e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076553182DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.18303632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Ao10aSweet tea (Lithocarpus polystachyus rehd.) as a new natural source of bioactive dihydrochalcones with multiple health benefits  ap. 917-934.  aSweet tea (Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd.) has been consumed as herbal tea to prevent and manage diabetes for a long time. Recent studies indicate that sweet tea is rich in a variety of bioactive compounds, especially a class of nonclassical flavonoids, dihydrochalcones. In order to provide a better understanding of sweet tea and its main dihydrochalcones on human health, this review mainly summarizes related literature in the recent ten years, with the potential molecular mechanisms emphatically discussed. Phlorizin, phloretin, and trilobatin, three natural sweeteners, are the main dihydrochalcones in sweet tea. In addition, sweet tea and its dihydrochalcones exhibit plenty of health benefits, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, and anticancer effects, which are associated with the regulation of different molecular targets and signaling pathways. Therefore, sweet tea, as a rare natural source of dihydrochalcones, can be processed and developed into nutraceuticals or functional foods, with the potential application in the prevention and management of certain chronic diseases.  aThis study was supported by Local Financial Funds of National Agricultural Science and Technology Center, Chengdu (No. NASC2020KR02), the Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund (No. Y2020XK05), and the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFC1604405).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithocarpus polystachyus 3aantioxidants 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3aflavonoids 3afood science 3aherbal tea 3ahuman health 0aSweet tea 0adihydrochalcone 0ahealth benefits 0aantioxidant 0aantidiabetic 0aanticancer1 aLiu, Hong-Yan1 aLuo, Min1 aXia, Yu1 aYang, Xiao1 aLi, Hangyu,1 aWu, Ding-Tao1 aSun, Quancai1 aGeng, Fang1 aGan, Ren-You0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 Feb. 1, v. 62, no. 4 p.917-934dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.18303633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01439naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010000155300001600255520041100271592002800682650000800710650002400718650001200742650002000754650001300774650001300787650001400800700001600814700001900830700001700849700001700866773012300883856007401006852000901080655001201089IND60631125520221118113007.0190219e20190218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063112552DNAL7 a10.1039/c8gc03898h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qian10aCatalyst-free direct C(sp³)–H sulfenylation of xanthene derivatives using air as the oxidant  ap. 798-802.  aA catalyst-free direct C(sp³)–H sulfenylation has been achieved via the autoxidative cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) between xanthene derivatives and thiophenols in ethanol using air as the sole oxidant at room temperature.

Nevertheless, the term “Criollo” has numerous meanings and interpretations depending on if it is used by commercial users or botanists, growers or breeders. Our review aims to specify which cocoas can justifiably carry the Criollo name. “Criollo” is a botanical subspecies of Theobroma cacao, i.e. Theobroma cacao subsp. cacao; however, the true Criollos form just one of the ten currently accepted genetic groups in the species. We thus provide an overview of genetic studies on the subject (published or not), along with what is currently known about “True Criollo” or “Ancient Criollo” cacao trees. In fact, there are few representatives in collections that are duly acknowledged to be true Criollos, particularly in the two International Cocoa Genebanks, where only seven clones are available. It is nonetheless certain that some true Criollos do exist in other collections but have not been formally identified (by genetic studies) as members of the Criollo genetic group. Likewise, some true Criollos, be they cultivated or subspontaneous, exist in Mexico and Central and South America (Venezuela and Colombia). However, certain clones called “modern Criollos”, which are closely related to the true Criollos but arise from hybridization with other genetic groups, are more common.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3abotanists 3aclones 3acocoa beans 3agene banks 3agrowers 3ahybridization 3aprices 3aColombia 3aMexico 3aVenezuela1 aMotamayor, J.

A high energy emulsification method was employed for this purpose. An engine test bed was utilized to combust the emulsion in order to investigate emission gas concentrations such as CO, NOx, CO₂, O₂ and smoke. The emission concentrations of NOx and O₂ were decreased with increasing biodiesel concentration. However, the emission of CO₂ was increased with the increasing amounts of water. The highest concentration of NOx was found for B15. The physicochemical properties of BDB emulsion fuel in terms of viscosity and calorific value were also measured and investigated. Furthermore, biodiesel showed the highest viscosity compared to diesel and BDB fuels. The viscosity of BDB fuels was increased from B10 to B20. The increasing biodiesel concentration showed a decrease in calorific value. Hence, emulsified biodiesel fuel is a promising alternative fuel for reducing harmful emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3abiodiesel 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aemissions 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3asmoke 3aviscosity 0aBiodiesel/diesel blend 0aemulsification 0aemission gas concentration 0aphysicochemical properties 0aenvironmental fuel1 aSalahuddin, Bidita Binte1 aNoh, Nur Ajeerah Mohd1 aNizah, Rabiah1 aRashid, Suraya Abdul0 tBiofuels.g2016 July 3, v. 7, no. 4 p.337-343dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2015.11353743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245010300152300001800255500002000273520057900293592002800872650002400900650001300924650001100937650002400948650001700972700001500989700001801004700001601022773013901038856007301177852000901250655001201259IND60651672120221120091130.0190712e20140912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065167212DNAL7 a10.3390/su60963122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jian10aEvolutionary Game Analysis of Remanufacturing Closed-Loop Supply Chain with Asymmetric Information  ap. 6312-6324.  aJournal Article  aRemanufacturing is an effective means to realize energy saving and emission reduction. This paper develops an evolutionary game model with a two-echelon closed-loop supply chain to study evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) of manufacturers and retailers. Through analyzing evolutionary path of the game, we find that there are two possible evolutionary results affected by the profits of manufacturers. Price of remanufacturing products may be a critical factor that determines the ESS. Government subsidy is critical to promote the development of remanufacturing industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3aindustry 3amodels 3aprofits and margins 3asupply chain1 aDu, Weihao1 aYang, Fengmei1 aHua, Guowei0 tSustainability.g2014 Sept. 12, v. 6, no. 9 p.6312-6324dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su60963123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013600168300001600304520113000320592002801450650001701478650001901495650003001514650002001544650002601564650001101590650001501601650001901616650002801635651001401663651001801677653001501695653004501710653001601755653002901771653001801800700002301818700001501841700002801856700003101884700001801915700002401933700001801957700002101975700003201996700003402028700002202062773010002084856008402184852000902268655001202277IND60133103120221116150056.0150518e20150527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310312DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2014.9510212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEakin, Hallie10aInformation and communication technologies and climate change adaptation in Latin America and the Caribbean: a framework for action  ap. 208-222.  aDespite ongoing interest in deploying information and communication technologies (ICTs) for sustainable development, their use in climate change adaptation remains understudied. Based on the integration of adaptation theory and the existing literature on the use of ICTs in development, we present an analytical model for conceptualizing the contribution of existing ICTs to adaptation, and a framework for evaluating ICT success. We apply the framework to four case studies of ICTs in use for early warning systems and managing extreme events in the Latin American and the Caribbean countries. We propose that existing ICTs can support adaptation through enabling access to critical information for decision-making, coordinating actors and building social capital. ICTs also allow actors to communicate and disseminate their decision experience, thus enhancing opportunities for collective learning and continual improvements in adaptation processes. In this way, ICTs can both communicate the current and potential impacts of climate change, as well as engage populations in the development of viable adaptation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acommunications technology 3adecision making 3aearly warning systems 3amodels 3apopulation 3asocial capital 3asustainable development 3aCaribbean 3aLatin America 0aadaptation 0ainformation and communication technology 0adevelopment 0adisaster risk management 0aLatin America1 aWightman, Pedro M.1 aHsu, David1 aGil Ramón, Vladimir R.1 aFuentes-Contreras, Eduardo1 aCox, Megan P.1 aHyman, Tracy-Ann N.1 aPacas, Carlos1 aBorraz, Fernando1 aGonzález-Brambila, Claudia1 aPonce de León Barido, Diego,1 aKammen, Daniel M.0 tClimate and Development.g2015 May 27, v. 7, no. 3 p.208-222dTaylor & Francisx1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2014.9510213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001900150245009800169300001600267520090800283592002801191650001601219650001201235700001101247700001601258700001401274700001801288700001801306773008901324856008601413852000901499655001201508IND4449742320221120110502.0141111e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444974232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jin Peng10aOrthogonal-function spectrophotometry for the measurement of amylose and amylopectin contents  ap. 102-108.  aIn this study, orthogonal-function spectrophotometry (OFS) was used for the first time in the determination of amylose and amylopectin contents. A six-point quadratic orthogonal polynomial (QOP) was chosen for amylose determination at an interval of 8nm, and an inter-wavelength of 596nm. For amylopectin determination, a ten-point QOP was selected with an interval of 22nm and an inter-wavelength of 538nm. OFS was more precise, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.4–0.7 for both amylose and amylopectin content analyses. Dual-wavelength colorimetry (DWC) showed a SD of 1.3–2.5 and 3.8–4.6 for amylose and amylopectin content analyses, respectively. OFS has an acceptable recovery ratio and hence has an advantage over DWC in determining amylose and amylopectin concentration in solution without prior separation. OFS is an alternative method for the analysis of amylose and amylopectin content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose1 aYu, Bo1 aXu, XueMing1 aYang, Ne,1 aJin, Zhengyu,1 aKim, Jin Moon0 tFood chemistry.g2011 July 1, v. 127, no. 1 p.102-108dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01434naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100005700190245012100247300001800368506007600386520022900462592002800691506003700719650001400756650001400770650002300784650002300807700006600830773012000896856008301016852000901099655001201108IND60637597720221207113937.0190419e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063759772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b008582doi7 aPMC67197862pmcid7 a309335232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, D.

Herein, the influence of acid strength on hydride transfer was investigated via density functional theory. Based on energetic analysis, increasing acid strength can stabilize the carbenium ion and destabilize alkoxide species, resulting in significant improvement of hydride transfer performance. Notably, the hydride transfer reaction cannot occur at a weak acid site owing to difficulty in forming a stable H-shared intermediate, which perfectly coincides with experiments. More interestingly, the changing extent of energy for intermediates and transition states correlates well with the ionic character at various acid strengths. A stronger ionic character leads to a larger changing extent of energy. Therefore, the changing trends of activation energy barriers to acid strength can be predicated by comparing the strength of ionic character between reactants and transition states. The results are of referential significance to the development of highly efficient catalysts for C4 alkylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalkylation 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3ahydrides1 aCao, Jianlin1 aDang, Yu1 aFeng, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7299-56901 aLiu, Yibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2623-38681 aChen, Xiaobo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9180-01901 aYang, Chaohe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6995-91700 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 May 13, v. 58, no. 22 p.9314-9321dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b011253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245015100211300001400362520171800376592002802094650001502122650001602137650002102153650001102174650001902185650001902204650001302223650001402236650001502250650001502265650002002280650001502300650001202315650002902327650001702356650001402373650001402387650000702401650001402408650001502422650000902437650002402446650002102470650002202491650001902513650001002532651001202542653002102554653003002575653002502605653001902630653003302649653002202682700006402704700002302768700001802791700001502809700002002824700001902844773010702863856008602970852000903056655001203065IND60632868720221118182022.0200419e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063286872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuriel Yuste, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3221-696010aCascading effects associated with climate-change-induced conifer mortality in mountain temperate forests result in hot-spots of soil CO2 emissions  ap. 50-59.  aClimate change-induced tree mortality is occurring worldwide, at increasingly larger scales and with increasing frequency. How climate change-induced tree mortality could affect the ecology and carbon (C) sink capacity of soils remains unknown. This study investigated regional-scale drought-induced tree mortality, based on events that occurred after a very dry year (2012) in the Carpathians mountain range (Romania), which caused mortality in three common conifer species: Scots pine, Black pine, and Silver fir. This resulted in hot-spots of biogenic soil CO₂ emissions (soil respiration; Rs). Four to five years after the main mortality event, Rs-related soil CO₂ emissions under dead trees were, on average, 21% (ranging from 18 to 35%) higher than CO₂ emissions under living trees. Total (Rs) and heterotrophic (RH)-related soil CO₂ emissions were strongly related to alterations in the soil environment following tree mortality (e.g. changes in quantity and quality of soil organic matter, microclimate, pH or fine root demography). Moreover, the massive mortality event of 2012 resulted in greater presence of successional vegetation (broadleaf seedlings, shrubland and grasses), which may control the environmental factors that either directly or indirectly affected biotic soil fluxes (Rs and RH). Besides the well-known direct effects of climate change on soil CO₂ emissions, the cascading effects triggered by climate change-induced tree mortality could also exert a strong indirect impact on soil CO₂ emissions. Overall, climate change-induced tree mortality alters the magnitude of environmental controls on Rs and hence determines how the ecosystem C budget responds to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus sylvestris 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3adead wood 3ademography 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3afine roots 3agrasses 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amicroclimate 3amortality 3amountains 3apH 3aseedlings 3ashrublands 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3asoil respiration 3atemperate forests 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aRomania 0aSoil respiration 0aHeterotrophic respiration 0aSecondary succession 0aTree mortality 0aFine roots functional traits 0aCascading effects1 aFlores-Rentería, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1905-99371 aGarcía-Angulo, D.1 aHereş, A.-M.1 aBragă, C.1 aPetritan, A.-M.1 aPetritan, I.C.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2019 June, v. 133 p.50-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011700169300001600286520162700302592002801929650001201957650001501969650002301984650001202007650001702019650001202036651001002048773010402058856004802162852000902210655001202219IND4487795720221117192525.0120821e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448779572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-011-9347-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGreevy, Steven R.10aLost in translation: incomer organic farmers, local knowledge, and the revitalization of upland Japanese hamlets  ap. 393-412.  aUpland Japan suffers from extreme depopulation, aging, and loss of agricultural, economic, and social viability. In addition, the absence of a successor generation in many marginalized hamlets endangers the continuation of local knowledge associated with upland agricultural livelihoods and severely limits the prospects of rural revitalization and development. Resettlement by incomer organic farmers represents an opportunity to both pass on valuable local knowledge and rejuvenate local society. Survey and interview data are used to explore the knowledge dynamics at play in upland Japan between local and incomer organic farmers. Using a âknowledge cultureâ framework, socio-cultural and symbolic barriers and spatial conditions limiting local knowledge exchange are identified and analyzed. Despite a number of reasons to suggest affinity and natural alignment toward knowledge sharing, each groupâs ideas of âlegitimate knowledgeâ and acceptable behavior have contested the field of communication and confused the negotiation process. Building on previous studies of farmerâs knowledge networks, examples in this study suggest that negotiation between knowledge cultures can be facilitated by both active means and intrinsic factors, and be derailed because of physical and temporal symbolic references. The degree to which locals and incomers collaborate and identify with each other as stakeholders with a common future may determine the extent to which local knowledge, especially local knowledge from past agricultural regimes, can play a role within upland endogenous development.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarmers 3alivelihood 3aorganic production 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aJapan0 tAgriculture and human values.g2012 Sept., v. 29, no. 3 p.393-412dSpringer-Verlagx0889-048X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-011-9347-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245007700179300001600256520093300272592002801205650003001233650003501263650001601298650001101314650001801325650001701343653001401360653001901374653003101393653001101424653002101435700001901456773010001475856008401575852000901659655001201668IND60133103420221116150049.0150518e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310342DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2014.9523542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarnatak, Harish Chandra10aPerformance study of various spatial indexes on 3D geo-data in Geo-RDBMS  ap. 633-649.  aIn the emerging era of information and communication technologies, geotechnology is one of the fastest growing fields. Geo-RDBMS is very important and evolving aspect for GIS, as it can manage large volume of spatial data inside RDBMS. The utilization of RDBMS for geospatial data was one of the important focuses of GIS professionals in last decades to store and manage 2D geo-data. However, the support for 3D geo-data inside RDBMS is still limited and is a challenging task for RDBMS providers. In this study, data organization and performance assessment of 3D geo-data inside RDBMS are carried out. In this process, various file-based 3D data models such as CityGML, COLLADA and KML are migrated to geo-RDBMS to bring entire 3D geo-data in common platform. Various spatial indexing techniques viz. R-Tree, B-Tree, GiST, etc. are applied on these 3D data models and best indexing techniques are studied for 3D GIS operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunications technology 3ageographic information systems 3amethodology 3amodels 3aprofessionals 3aspatial data 0aGeo-RDBMS 0a3D data models 0alarge and complex geo-data 0a3D GIS 0aspatial indexing1 aKumar, Vaibhav0 tGeocarto international.g2015 July 3, v. 30, no. 6 p.633-649dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2014.9523543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005700155245019200212520128200404592002801686650002701714650002101741650001001762650003101772650001501803650001701818650001501835650001301850653002601863653001501889653001401904653001601918653000901934653001301943700005801956700006702014773009102081856009002172852000902262655001202271IND60713192920221122105822.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071319292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1285942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYen, Pei-Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6327-687810aEarly-life and chronic exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate enhances amyloid-β toxicity associated with an autophagy-related gene in Caenorhabditis elegans Alzheimer’s disease models  aThe widespread use of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has resulted in its ubiquitous presence in the environment, which has led to serious health concerns. One of these concerns is its possible link to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common neurodegenerative disease in aged individuals. This study investigated whether early-life and chronic exposure to DEHP affects AD via the toxicity of amyloid-β (Aβ), which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, using Caenorhabditis elegans AD models (strains CL4176 and CL2006). We show that early-life DEHP exposure increased Aβ toxicity in C. elegans strains CL4176 and CL2006. Early-life and chronic exposure to DEHP also significantly increased intracellular ROS levels and Aβ deposition in aged CL2006 nematodes. Moreover, it was found that DEHP-induced Aβ toxicity does not require transcription factors DAF-16 or SKN-1, while early-life and chronic exposure to DEHP significantly increased the accumulation of lysosome-related organelles and the mRNA levels of the autophagy-related gene bec-1 in aged CL2006 nematodes. Our findings suggest that early-life and chronic exposure to DEHP enhances Aβ toxicity, which may be associated with the autophagy–lysosomal degradation pathway in C. elegans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3achronic exposure 3agenes 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aorganelles 3apathogenesis 3aphthalates 3atoxicity 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aAmyloid-β 0aAutophagy 0aC. elegans 0aDEHP 0aLysosome1 aHow, Chun Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5219-38261 aHsiu-Chuan Liao, Vivian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4676-99530 tChemosphere.g2021 June, v. 273 p.128594-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1285943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01536naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006500164300001800229520038400247592002800631650001100659650002100670650002300691650002300714650001200737650001900749653001100768653001000779653001000789653001300799653001200812653001100824653003200835653003200867700001300899700001300912700001800925773008100943856008101024852000901105655001201114IND60551440720221121221027.0161018e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055144072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Chunyin10aMetal free amide synthesis via carbon–carbon bond cleavage  ap. 9615-9620.  aA metal-free oxidative coupling of methyl ketones and primary amines to amides has been developed.

People are very poor in the area, also beyond the areas close to the park. The average income is around 0.45 USD per person per day. People report food shortages in two out of the last five years. Even âthe least poor groupâ earns no more than an average of 2 USD/cap and day. Main incomes (80%) are derived from agriculture and non-farm incomes. There is a differential diversification pattern where poor people depend more on selling their labour within agriculture, while the less poor group depends more on non-farm activities. Environmental (forest and natural resources) incomes are low, compared to what is typically found in such rural areas, making up 6.3% of total incomes. Living close to the park incurs costs in the range of 2 to 20% of total household incomes, mainly through wildlife raiding crops and livestock; the scale depending on village location. The study documents that attempts to reduce tensions between local people and the park through outreach activities yield negligible results compared to the costs people incur, and do little to reduce the conflict-ridden park-people relations. Although the park may not necessarily be a âpoverty trapâ, it must be seen as yet another and substantial constraint for people securing their livelihoods. Increasing land scarcity, population densities, income inequalities all imply mounting pressures that aggravate resource use conflicts. Furthermore, the present situation with external political interference in selection and implementation of outreach activities is not conducive to progress. Given that 24% of Tanzania consists of wildlife protected areas, much more focused, rights-based and location specific approaches should be developed to reduce losses, and to secure local people's rights to income from the parks and due compensation for accrued costs. People should have formal rights to access park resources that can be subjected to controlled, sustainable harvesting. The present park management culture in terms of attitudes, values and norms needs to change through training in how to work with local people. Such interventions would help reduce conflict levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3acrops 3afood shortages 3aforests 3aharvesting 3aincome 3alabor 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3anational parks 3aoutreach 3apeople 3apolitics 3apopulation density 3apoverty 3aright of access 3arural areas 3awildlife 3aTanzania1 aJumane, Abdallah1 aWapalila, Gloria1 aSongorwa, Alexander0 tForest policy and economics.g2012 Aug., v. 21 p.20-31dElsevier B.V.x1389-93417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05079naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245008800206506007600294520341700370592002803787506003703815650001603852650001103868650001503879650001303894650001503907650002703922650003803949650001303987650001904000650001004019650001104029650002104040650001004061650001504071650002004086650002804106650001304134700001804147700002104165700002104186700001804207700002104225700002104246700001804267700002904285773012504314856007704439852000904516655001204525IND60648644320221207131451.0190701e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864432DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox80601872doi7 aPMC66166452pmcid7 a312268142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsredkar, Joško 10aUrinary Markers of Oxidative Stress in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction, restricted interest and repetitive behavior. Oxidative stress in response to environmental exposure plays a role in virtually every human disease and represents a significant avenue of research into the etiology of ASD. The aim of this study was to explore the diagnostic utility of four urinary biomarkers of oxidative stress. Methods: One hundred and thirty-nine (139) children and adolescents with ASD (89% male, average age = 10.0 years, age range = 2.1 to 18.1 years) and 47 healthy children and adolescents (49% male, average age 9.2, age range = 2.5 to 20.8 years) were recruited for this study. Their urinary 8-OH-dG, 8-isoprostane, dityrosine and hexanoil-lisine were determined by using the ELISA method. Urinary creatinine was determined with the kinetic Jaffee reaction and was used to normalize all biochemical measurements. Non-parametric tests and support vector machines (SVM) with three different kernel functions (linear, radial, polynomial) were used to explore and optimize the multivariate prediction of an ASD diagnosis based on the collected biochemical measurements. The SVM models were first trained using data from a random subset of children and adolescents from the ASD group (n = 70, 90% male, average age = 9.7 years, age range = 2.1 to 17.8 years) and the control group (n = 24, 45.8% male, average age = 9.4 years, age range = 2.5 to 20.8 years) using bootstrapping, with additional synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE), which was utilized because of unbalanced data. The computed SVM models were then validated using the remaining data from children and adolescents from the ASD (n = 69, 88% male, average age = 10.2 years, age range = 4.3 to 18.1 years) and the control group (n = 23, 52.2% male, average age = 8.9 years, age range = 2.6 to 16.7 years). Results: Using a non-parametric test, we found a trend showing that the urinary 8-OH-dG concentration was lower in children with ASD compared to the control group (unadjusted p = 0.085). When all four biochemical measurements were combined using SVMs with a radial kernel function, we could predict an ASD diagnosis with a balanced accuracy of 73.4%, thereby accounting for an estimated 20.8% of variance (p < 0.001). The predictive accuracy expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) was solid (95% CI = 0.691&ndash;0.908). Using the validation data, we achieved significantly lower rates of classification accuracy as expressed by the balanced accuracy (60.1%), the AUC (95% CI = 0.502&ndash;0.781) and the percentage of explained variance (R2 = 3.8%). Although the radial SVMs showed less predictive power using the validation data, they do, together with ratings of standardized SVM variable importance, provide some indication that urinary levels of 8-OH-dG and 8-isoprostane are predictive of an ASD diagnosis. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the examined urinary biomarkers in combination may differentiate children with ASD from healthy peers to a significant extent. However, the etiological importance of these findings is difficult to assesses, due to the high-dimensional nature of SVMs and a radial kernel function. Nonetheless, our results show that machine learning methods may provide significant insight into ASD and other disorders that could be related to oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aautism 3abiomarkers 3achildren 3acreatinine 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aetiology 3ahuman diseases 3amales 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3apeers 3aprediction 3asocial behavior 3asupport vector machines 3avariance1 aGosar, David 1 aMaček, Jerneja 1 aKumer, Kristina 1 aFabjan, Teja 1 aFinderle, Petra 1 aŠterpin, Saša 1 aZupan, Mojca 1 aJekovec Vrhovšek, Maja 0 tAntioxidants.g2019 June 20, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox80601873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016700154300002000321520041100341592002800752650001400780650001400794650002300808650002300831650001600854650002400870650001500894650001300909700001800922700001800940700001600958773013500974856007401109852000901183655001201192IND60639009320221118073430.0190501e20161206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063900932DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc07832j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Ying10aControllable selenium vacancy engineering in basal planes of mechanically exfoliated WSe₂ monolayer nanosheets for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution  ap. 14266-14269.  aEngineering intrinsic selenium vacancies (Se-vacancies) was achieved in mechanically exfoliated WSe₂ monolayer nanosheets (WSe₂ MLNSs) via an annealing treatment.

Here, we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of the Lyme borreliosis (LB) spirochaete Borrelia garinii in its marine cycle involving colonial seabirds and different host races of the seabird tick Ixodes uriae. Multilocus sequence analyses (MLSA) on eight chromosomal and two plasmid loci (ospA and ospC) indicate that B. garinii circulating in the marine system is highly diverse. Microevolution in marine B. garinii seems to be mainly clonal, but recombination and selection do occur. Sequence types were not evenly distributed among geographic regions, with substantial population subdivision between Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins. However, no geographic structuring was evident within regions. Results of selection analyses and phylogenetic discordance between chromosomal and plasmid loci indicate adaptive evolution is likely occurring in this system, but no pattern of host or vector‐associated divergence was found. Recombination analyses showed evidence for population admixture between terrestrial and marine strains, suggesting that LB spirochaetes are exchanged between these enzootic cycles. Importantly, our results highlight the need to explicitly consider the marine system for a complete understanding of the evolutionary ecology and global epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia garinii 3aIxodes uriae 3aLyme disease 3abacteria 3abasins 3aevolution 3afounder effect 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3aloci 3apopulation structure 3araces 3aseabirds 3asequence analysis 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBase Sequence 2aBirdsxparasitology 2aBorrelia burgdorferi Groupxclassificationxgenetics. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aIxodesxmicrobiology 2aLyme Diseasexepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aMultilocus Sequence Typing 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSelection, Genetic 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aAtlantic Ocean 0aPacific Ocean1 aBoulinier, Thierry1 aSertour, Natacha1 aCornet, Muriel1 aFerquel, Elisabeth1 aMcCoy, Karen D.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2011 Sept., v. 13, no. 9 p.2453-2467dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02515.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03800naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009200171520210800263592002802371650001502399650001302414650002302427650002702450650002002477650001102497650001402508650002402522650002002546650001102566650001302577650001102590650001602601650001302617651001002630653002302640653002302663653002202686653002002708700001502728700001502743700005502758700001402813700001602827700001802843700001702861700005402878700001502932700001802947700001902965700001602984700002003000773009103020856009003111852000903201655001203210IND60713193220221122105854.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071319322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1285972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mingyue10aMicrobially-driven sulfur cycling microbial communities in different mangrove sediments  aMicrobially-driven sulfur cycling is a vital biogeochemical process in the sulfur-rich mangrove ecosystem. It is critical to evaluate the potential impact of sulfur transformation in mangrove ecosystems. To reveal the diversity, composition, and structure of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the physicochemical properties and sediment microbial communities from an introduced mangrove species (Sonneratia apetala), a native mangrove species (Kandelia obovata) and the mudflat in Hanjiang River Estuary in Guangdong (23.27°N, 116.52°E), China. The results indicated that SOB was dominated by autotrophic Thiohalophilus and chemoautotrophy Chromatium in S. apetala and K. obovata, respectively, while Desulfatibacillum was the dominant genus of SRB in K. obovata sediments. Also, the redundancy analysis indicated that temperature, redox potential (ORP), and SO₄²⁻ were the significant factors influencing the sulfur cycling microbial communities with elemental sulfur (ES) as the key factor driver for SOB and total carbon (TC) for SRB in mangrove sediments. Additionally, the morphological transformation of ES, acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and SO₄²⁻ explained the variation of sulfur cycling microbial communities under sulfur-rich conditions, and we found mangrove species-specific dominant Thiohalobacter, Chromatium and Desulfatibacillum, which could well use ES and SO₄²⁻, thus promoting the sulfur cycling in mangrove sediments. Meanwhile, the change of nutrient substances (TN, TC) explained why SOB were more susceptible to environmental changes than SRB. Sulfate reducing bacteria produces sulfide in anoxic sediments at depth that then migrate upward, toward fewer reducing conditions, where it’s oxidized by sulfur oxidizing bacteria. This study indicates the high ability of SOB and SRB in ES, SO₄²⁻,S₂⁻ and S²⁻ generation and transformation in sulfur-rich mangrove ecosystems, and provides novel insights into sulfur cycling in other wetland ecosystems from a microbial perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromatium 3aKandelia 3aSonneratia apetala 3aacid volatile sulfides 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon 3aestuaries 3amangrove ecosystems 3aredox potential 3arivers 3asulfates 3asulfur 3atemperature 3awetlands 3aChina 0aMangrove ecosystem 0aSulfur-oxidization 0aSulfate-reduction 0aFunctional gene1 aFang, Anqi1 aYu, Xiaoli1 aZhang, Keke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4244-50351 aHe, Zhili1 aWang, Cheng1 aPeng, Yisheng1 aXiao, Fanshu1 aYang, Tony1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4238-80851 aZhang, Wei1 aZheng, Xiafei1 aZhong, Qiuping1 aLiu, Xingyu1 aNgan, A.

The biodiesel produced from soybean crude oil was prepared by method of alkaline catalyzed transesterification of soybean oil being blended with mineral diesel. Experiments were carried out using pure diesel (B0) and different blending ratios of B10, B20, B30, B40 and B50. The performance and emission characteristics of different blends were compared with the result from a standard diesel engine. The performance characteristics show that an increase in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and a decrease in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were observed using blend B20 at the maximum load as compared to mineral diesel. A BTE of 37.07% and 36.43% and a BSFC of 0.24 kg/kWh and 0.23 kg/kWh was observed with blend B20 and diesel respectively. In addition, it was observed that a significant reduction of CO, HC and smoke occurred with an increase of load as compared to pure diesel. However CO₂ and NOₓ emissions were slightly increased for all blends, which indicated complete combustion of fuel in the combustion chamber.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3afree fatty acids 3ahydrocarbons 3amixing 3anitrogen oxides 3apetroleum 3asmoke 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3atransesterification 0aSoya bean crude oil 0adiesel engine 0acombustion characteristics 0aexhaust emission 0aperformance1 aDas, D.0 tBiofuels.g2016 July 3, v. 7, no. 4 p.413-421dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2016.11479203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167300001600265520160500281592002801886650001901914650002201933650001201955650001201967650001401979650002001993650001702013650001502030650001202045650001702057650001502074650002302089650001102112650001102123650002402134653003202158653001502190653002302205653002502228653003402253653001602287700002402303700003302327700002002360700002402380773012902404856008102533961001302614852000902627655001202636IND60652392620221118004118.0190712e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065239262DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621180000722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortlas, Zoe M.10aVariation in floret size explains differences in wild bee visitation to cultivated sunflowers  ap. 498-503.  aWild and managed bees are needed to move sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) pollen, both to create hybrid seed and to encourage high, consistent yields when those hybrids are subsequently grown. Among floral traits that influence bee preference, floret size may be critical, as the depth of the corolla affects the accessibility of nectar. Sampling and observation of inbred maintainer (HA) lines were used to assess variation in floret size, and to measure any effects of floret size on pollinator visitation. Among 100 inbreds sampled, there was significant variation among the lines, with floret lengths of 6.8–9.9 mm. Floret length, measured before anthesis, was closely related to corolla depth during anthesis and was consistent between 2 years (environments). Pollinator observations on 30 inbred lines showed floret size explained a majority (52%) of the variation in wild bee preference, with a reduction in floret length of 2 mm more than doubling pollinator activity. Though honey bee, Apis mellifera L., colonies were located ≈ 60 m from the plots, near-zero honey bee activity in the sunflowers precluded an assessment of how strongly this managed pollinator is affected by floret length. Production of inbreds and hybrids with smaller florets could enhance sunflower pollination, but genetic markers for floret size are needed to facilitate selection, and an understanding of potential trade-offs also is required. Information on variation and heritability of other traits, such as pollen and nectar rewards, could help explain residual variation in wild bee visitation to sunflowers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aHelianthus annuus 3acorolla 3aflorets 3aflowering 3agenetic markers 3aheritability 3ahoney bees 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3ainbreeding 3ainsect pollination 3anectar 3apollen 3apollinating insects 0aAndrena helianthi Robertson 0aAsteraceae 0aecosystem services 0aHelianthus annuus L. 0aMelissodes trinodis Robertson 0apollination1 aTetlie, Jonathan R.1 aPrischmann-Voldseth, Deirdre1 aHulke, Brent S.1 aPrasifka, Jarrad R.0 tPlant genetic resources.g2018 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.498-503dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621180000723Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245013100216500001400347520177300361592002802134650001402162650002602176650002202202650001802224651001602242653000902258653001602267653002602283653002702309700002602336700002902362773009102391856009002482852000902572655001202581IND60713193420221122105829.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071319342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1285992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHensema, Thijs J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4731-393110aNon-targeted identification of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances at trace level in surface water using fragment ion flagging  aNAL-light  aThe extent of unidentified Per- and Poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) found in environmental samples has led to the development of non-targeted screening methods. The study presented here reports the use of liquid chromatography hyphenated with high resolution mass spectrometry to detect and identify unknown and unexpected PFASs by fragment ion flagging (FIF). By exploring all ion fragmentation spectra for several characteristic fragments including CₙF₂ₙ₊₁⁻, CₙF₂ₙ₋₁⁻, CₙF₂ₙ₋₃⁻, CₙF₂ₙ₋₇⁻, CₙF₂ₙ₋₁₁⁻ and CₙF₂ₙ₊₁O⁻ the presence of widely different PFAS species can be anticipated without the need for targeted screening methods. These fragments are then related to their precursor ion by retention time matching and subsequently identified. With this methodology 40 PFASs were (tentatively) identified in four surface water samples sampled throughout the Netherlands. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, four PFASs found through FIF are newly discovered species and have not been mentioned in any database or literature. This methodology eliminates the dependence on commonly reported full scan feature selection techniques such as mass defect filtering, homologous series detection and intensity threshold filtering, allowing the identification of PFASs at trace levels. Additionally, eight of the (tentatively) identified PFASs are not part of homologous series, stressing the shortcomings of commonly reported non-targeted PFASs screening methods and demonstrating the importance of more effective identification strategies such as FIF. Moreover, we like to emphasise that this approach is applicable to real-life environmental samples with PFASs at background concentration levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3asurface water 3aNetherlands 0aPFAS 0aTrace level 0aFragment ion flagging 0aNon-targeted screening1 aBerendsen, Bjorn J.A.1 avan Leeuwen, Stefan P.J.0 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 265 p.128599-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1285993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01563naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013900153300002000292520034100312592002800653650002300681650000900704650001700713650001800730650001000748650001700758650001400775700018200789700001900971700001700990773013501007856007401142852000901216655001201225IND60639009620221118073441.0190501e20161206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063900962DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc07841a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lu10aReversible pH-independent optical potassium sensor with lipophilic solvatochromic dye transducer on surface modified microporous nylon  ap. 14254-14257.  aA reversible and pH-independent fluorescent ion optode is introduced with an ionophore and surface confined solvatochromic dye transducer doped onto microporous nylon membranes.

However, the usefulness of TPL exponents as an ecological metric has been questioned, largely due to its apparent ubiquity in various complex systems. The aim of this study was to test whether TPL exponents vary systematically with potential drivers of animal aggregation in time and space and therefore capture useful ecological information of the system of interest. We derived community TPL exponents from a long‐term, standardised and spatially dense data series of abundance and body size data for a strongly size‐structured fish community in the North Sea. We then compared TPL exponents between regions of contrasting environmental characteristics. We find that, in general, TPL exponents vary more than expected under random conditions in the North Sea for size‐based populations compared to communities considered by species. Further, size‐based temporal TPL exponents are systematically higher (implying more temporally aggregated distributions) along hydrographic boundaries. Time series of size‐based spatial TPL exponents also differ between hydrographically distinct basins. These findings support the notion that TPL exponents contain ecological information, capturing community spatio‐temporal dynamics as influenced by external drivers.  aPublisher supplied data  a1498909cNatural Environment Research Council 3abasins 3abody size 3acommunity structure 3afish 3afish communities 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3aNorth Sea1 aBrede, Markus1 aTrueman, Clive N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4995-736X0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2019 Feb., v. 88, no. 2 p.290-301dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.129233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007400140245006200214300002000276520039500296592002800691650001700719650001400736650002300750650002100773650002200794650001100816650001800827650000900845650002700854700002600881700002500907700001900932700002300951773013600974856007401110852000901184655001201193IND60639009720221118073418.0190501e20161025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063900972DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc07845a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl TemimiThese authors contributed equally to this work., Abbas H.

Anhydrous ammonia stimulated the nitrification process more than equivalent applications of ammonium sulfate in limed and unlimed soil. The stimulating effect of urea was of the same general order as anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia applied to the soil raises the pH into a more nearly optimum range for nitrification and initially provides a base for the neutralization of the nitric acid produced. This process can be effective only so long as high concentrations of ammonia are present in the soil; in these soils, which nitrified at low rates, this period of time was long enough to initiate a good rate of nitrification. The stimulating effect may also occur with field applications of anhydrous ammonia, since an adequate concentration of ammonia is retained in a relatively small volume of soil. The stimulation of nitrification by anhydrous ammonia has not been definitely shown under field conditions; this has probably been due to failure to properly delineate the retention zone into a central core where ammoniacal nitrogen was high enough to be initially toxic to the nitrifiers and an optimum zone between the toxic concentration and that in untreated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aammonium nitrogen 3aammonium sulfate 3aanhydrous ammonia 3aneutralization 3anitric acid 3anitrification 3apH 3asandy soils 3atoxicity 3aurea1 aBlue, William G.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1957 July, v. 21, no. 4 p.392-396dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1957.03615995002100040010x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010900155300001600264520167600280592002801956650001001984650001301994650001702007650003102024650002502055650001702080650001102097650002102108650001102129650002202140650001702162650002602179650001302205650002302218650001602241650001402257650001402271650003602285650001002321700001802331700001702349700002102366773011002387856007402497852000902571655001202580IND60340828920221121213107.0150809e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034082892DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.121302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Hana10aAnti‐Inflammatory Activities of Rubus Fruit Anthocyanins in Inflamed Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells  ap. 300-309.  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate anti‐inflammatory activities of anthocyanin fractions (AF) from blackberries (BB), Korean raspberries (KR) and black raspberries (BR) and their major anthocyanins (cyanidin‐3‐glucoside [C3G] and cyanidin‐3‐rutinoside [C3R]) in inflamed intestinal epithelial Caco‐2 cells. Nitrite scavenging activity of C3G was significantly higher than that of C3R and the AF measured by a chemical method. All the AF and individual anthocyanins significantly inhibit nitric oxide (NO) secretion, inducible NO synthase expression and nuclear factor‐κB activation in the Caco‐2 cells exposed to conditioned medium (CM) from lipopolysaccharide‐stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In the CM‐stimulated Caco‐2 cells, C3G, BBAF and KRAF inhibited NO production significantly more than C3R and BRAF, and C3G and BBAF expressed nuclear factor E2‐related factor 2 significantly more than the control. The individual anthocyanins also significantly downregulated intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in Caco‐2 cell lines. The results suggest that anthocyanins in Rubus fruits, particularly C3G, may promote anti‐inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Rubus fruits are widely consumed in various ways including wine and raw fruits. These Rubus fruits have various physiological properties such as antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activities because of their substantial quantities of phenolic compounds, constituted mainly by anthocyanins. Our results show that Rubus fruits may have potential health benefit in inflamed intestinal epithelial cells, which may be attributed to their major anthocyanins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus 3aadhesion 3aanthocyanins 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3ablackberries 3afruits 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aintestinal mucosa 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3anitrites 3aphenolic compounds 3araspberries 3araw fruit 3asecretion 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3awines1 aYi, Hŭi-jae,1 aCho, Hyunnho1 aHwang, Keum Taek0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2015 June, v. 39, no. 3 p.300-309dFood & Nutrition Pressx0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.121303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008900162300001200251520136700263536018701630592002801817650001701845650001801862650002001880650001001900650001001910650001601920650001901936653001801955653002901973653001202002653001502014653001402029653003502043700002202078700002402100773011402124856007802238852000902316655001202325IND60761856820221120152430.0220104s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076185682DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2021-01242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwde, David N.10aForaging gene expression patterns in queens, workers, and males in a eusocial insect  ap. 1-9.  aReproductive division of labour is based on biased expression of complementary parental behaviours, brood production (egg-laying) by queens and brood care (in particular, brood-provisioning) by workers. In many social insect species, queens provision brood when establishing colonies at the beginning of a breeding season and reproductive division of labour begins with the emergence of workers. In many social insect species, the expression of foraging (for) mRNA is associated with the intensity of foraging behaviour and therefore brood-provisioning. However, only two studies have compared queen and worker for expression levels and neither accounted for transcript splice variation. In this study, we compare the expression level of the for-α transcript variant across four life stages of the queen caste, two behavioural groups of workers, and males of a eusocial sweat bee Lasioglossum laevissimum (Smith, 1853). Foundresses collected prior to the onset of the foraging season and males had the highest for-α expression levels. All active (post-hibernatory) queens and workers had similar for-α expression levels independent of behaviour. These results suggest that the for gene in L. laevissimum acts as a primer before foraging activity and that caste-specific expression patterns correlate with the timing of foraging activity in queens and workers.  aThis project was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grants to M.H.R. and A.S., and an NSERC Postgraduate scholarship to D.N.A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasioglossum 3abrood rearing 3agene expression 3agenes 3alabor 3aoviposition 3asocial insects 0aforaging gene 0aLasioglossum laevissimum 0aRT-qPCR 0aHalictinae 0asweat bee 0aovarian ground-plan hypothesis1 aSkandalis, Adonis1 aRichards, Miriam H.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2022, v. 100, no. 999 p.1-9dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2021-01243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009800173520181600271592002802087650002302115650001802138650001802156650001302174650001502187650001402202650002502216650001702241650003202258650002702290650001902317650001702336650001902353650001102372650001102383651001102394653001802405653001802423653001202441653001802453653001302471653002302484700007102507773011002578856008502688852000902773655001202782IND60774488420221118203752.0220509e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077448842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1193022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReineccius, Janika10aFirst long-term evidence of microplastic pollution in the deep subtropical Northeast Atlantic  aNo anthropogenic pollutant is more widespread in the aquatic and terrestrial environment than microplastic; however, there are large knowledge gaps regarding its origin, fate, or temporal variations in the oceans. In this study, we analyzed sediment trap material from the deep subtropical Northeast Atlantic (2000 m) in a long-term record (2003–2015) to assess the role of the deep ocean as a potential sink of microplastics. Microplastic particles were identified in all 110 analyzed samples with flux rates of 1.13–3146.81 items d⁻¹ m⁻². Calculated microplastic mass fluxes ranged between 0.10 and 1977.96 μg d⁻¹ m⁻², representing up to 8% of the particle flux. Between years, the composition of the different polymers changed significantly, dominated by polyethylene, whose amount was correlated with the lithogenic input. The correlation between polyethylene and the lithogenic fraction was attributed to an air transport pathway from northeast Africa and surrounding regions. The second most abundant polymer detected in our study was polyvinyl chloride, which is not correlated with lithogenic or biogenic particle flux fractions. Instead, we observed seasonality for polyvinyl chloride with recurring high fluxes in winter before the plankton bloom and significantly lower amounts in summer. Other polymers identified were polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and lower numbers of polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate. The average microplastic particle size for all samples and polymers was 88.44 ± 113.46 μm, with polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride having the highest proportion of small particles (<100 μm). Our findings provide first insights into temporal variations of sinking microplastics, which are crucial for understanding the fate of plastic in the oceans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair transportation 3amicroplastics 3aparticle size 3aplankton 3apollutants 3apollution 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3asediment traps 3asummer 3awinter 3aAfrica 0aMicroplastics 0aPolymer types 0aSources 0aParticle flux 0aDeep sea 0aNortheast Atlantic1 aWaniek, J.

Slow-release sources were ureaform, activated sewage sludge, ADM (a coated urea), Urex (a urea-paraffin product), and IBDU (isobutylidene diurea). Response to fertilization was measured by weekly determinations of clipping yield and color rating. Urex performed similarly to ADM, and response following application was quicker and greater than that from ureaform, sewage sludge, and IBDU. IBDU showed good controlled release characteristics, but initial response after fertilization was slow. Residual effects of IBDU gave green color earlier in the spring than other treatments. Nitrogen recovery in the clippings was determined. Recovery ranged from 54% for ADM to 22% for ureaform over the 2-year period. Recovery from sewage sludge was 27%. The highest recoveries for IBDU and Urex treated plots were 46% and 52%, respectively. Recovery from a urea treatment was 52%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa pratensis 3acolor 3agrowing season 3aisobutylidene diurea 3anitrogen 3aresidual effects 3asewage sludge 3aspring 3aurea1 aWaddington, D.

The results showed that the contents of β-cryptoxanthin, all-trans-violaxanthin, 9-cis-violaxanthin and lutein were simultaneously increased along with the total carotenoid accumulation by the red LED light. With the ethylene treatment, the contents of β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin were increased, while the content of lutein was decreased in the flavedo. The suppression of lutein accumulation by ethylene was inhibited when the ethylene treatment was performed under the red LED light. With the combination of ethylene and red LED light treatments, the contents of β-cryptoxanthin and lutein were simultaneously increased. Gene expression results showed that simultaneous increases in the expression of CitPSY, CitPDS, CitZDS, CitCRTISO, CitLCYb1, CitLCYb2, CitLCYe, CitHYb, and CitZEP contributed to the accumulation of β-cryptoxanthin and lutein in the treatment of ethylene combined with red LED light.

Compounds 1–3, (+)-rufesolide A (4), and commercial parthenolide were found to be growth inhibitory toward MOLM-13 and EOL-1 human acute myeloid leukemia cells using PKC412 (midostaurin) as the positive control, with 1–3 being more active than parthenolide. Also, compounds 1–4 exhibited synergistic effects when tested with PKC412, but parthenolide did not show this type of activity. At a concentration lower than 2.0 μM, both 1 and 2 induced approximately 50% of the cells to become apoptotic at a late stage of the cell cycle, but no similar apoptotic effects were observed for 3, 4, or parthenolide. Leukemia cell apoptosis was induced by these compounds through the activation of caspase-3 and the inhibition of NF-κB, as indicated by immunoblotting analysis, and compounds 1 and 2 seem to be promising leads for development as potential antileukemic agents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-radiation 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3aleaves 3amyeloid leukemia 3aneoplasm cells 3asynergism 3atemperature 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aGallucci, Judith C.1 aLi, Xinxin1 aChen, Lichao1 aYu, Jianhua1 aKinghorn, A.

Here we show that TSP application reduced disease development of brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola on jujube and peach fruits. The efficiency of TSP was positively correlated with its concentrations. Analysis of the influence of pH on efficiency of TSP indicated that the inhibitory effect of TSP against M. fructicola was only partially influenced by its alkaline pH. TSP directly inhibited spore germination, germ tube elongation, and mycelial growth of M. fructicola in the culture medium. To further investigate the mechanisms by which TSP inhibited fungal growth, we detected the integrity of the plasma membrane of M. fructicola. Our result show that TSP treatment resulted in the loss of plasma membrane integrity, leading to the release of intracellular contents such as soluble proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.

The fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis can infect its larvae, which leads to mummification after 5–12 months, providing a valuable system with which to study interactions between the insect hosts and pathogenic fungi. However, little sequence information is available for this insect. A time-course analysis of the fat body transcriptome was performed to explore the host immune response to O. sinensis infection. In total, 50,164 unigenes were obtained by assembling the reads from two high-throughput approaches: 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina Hiseq2000. Hierarchical clustering and functional examination revealed four major gene clusters. Clusters 1–3 included transcripts markedly induced by the fungal infection within 72 h. Cluster 4, with a lower number of transcripts, was suppressed during the early phase of infection but returned to normal expression levels sometime before 1 year. Based on sequence similarity to orthologs known to participate in immune defenses, 258 candidate immunity-related transcripts were identified, and their functions were hypothesized. The genes were more primitive than those in other Lepidopteran insects. In addition, lineage-specific family expansion of the clip-domain serine proteases and C-type lectins were apparent and likely caused by selection pressures. Global expression profiles of immunity-related genes indicated that H. xiaojinensis was capable of a rapid response to an O. sinensis challenge; however, the larvae developed tolerance to the fungus after prolonged infection, probably due to immune suppression. Specifically, antimicrobial peptide mRNAs could not be detected after chronic infection, because key components of the Toll pathway (MyD88, Pelle and Cactus) were downregulated. Taken together, this study provides insights into the defense system of H. xiaojinensis, and a basis for understanding the molecular aspects of the interaction between the host and the entomopathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepialus humuli 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aentomopathogens 3afat body 3afungi 3agene expression regulation 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alectins 3amajor genes 3amessenger RNA 3amultigene family 3asequence homology 3aserine proteinases 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 0aHepialus xiaojinensis 0aOphiocordyceps sinensis 0aTranscriptome 0aInsect immunity 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aExpression profiling 0aFat body 0aAMP 0acSP 0aCTL 0aDEG 0aFPKM 0aβGRP 0aIMD 0aPGRP 0aPPO 0aPPAE 0aPAP 0aqPCR 0aRCL 0aRNA-seq 0arpS3 0asemiRT-PCR 0aSPZ 0aSCR 0aTEP1 aYu, Haiying,1 aZhang, Huan1 aZhu, Wei1 aWang, Meng-Long1 aZhang, Ji-Hong1 aZhou, Gui-Ling1 aLi, Xuan1 aQin, Qi-Lian1 aHu, Song-Nian1 aZou, Zhen0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2015 Sept., v. 64 p.1-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009800170300001400268520097500282592002801257650002201285650002001307650001801327650001301345650002501358650000901383650001401392650002101406650002001427650001301447650001301460650001601473653003301489653001301522653001801535653002301553700001601576700001601592700001501608773011101623856008601734852000901820655001201829IND60615738720221117184848.0181127e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061573872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yongsheng10aGreen magnetization roasting technology for refractory iron ore using siderite as a reductant  ap. 40-50.  aIn the present study, a green magnetization roasting process was proposed by using siderite (FeCO3) as the reductant. The influences of the siderite dosage, roasting temperature and roasting time on the magnetization roasting process were investigated. The saturation magnetization of roasted samples was analyzed by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and the phase transformation was investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimal roasting conditions were determined to be a siderite dosage of 40% with a roasting temperature of 700 °C and a roasting time of 10.0 min. The saturation magnetization of the roasted product under optimal conditions was 70.19 A m2 kg−1. The siderite (FeCO3) was transformed to magnetite (Fe3O4) with the intermediate product of wustite (FeO) in the decomposition process. In the meantime, the hematite (Fe2O3) was reduced to magnetite (Fe3O4) by the carbon monoxide released from the decomposition of siderite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon monoxide 3aferrous oxide 3ahematite 3aintermediate product 3airon 3amagnetite 3aphase transition 3areducing agents 3aroasting 3asiderite 3atemperature 0aGreen magnetization roasting 0aSiderite 0aDecomposition 0aPhase conversation1 aZhu, Xinran1 aHan, Yuexin1 aLi, Yanjun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 206 p.40-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009900176300001400275520115100289592002801440650002001468650001601488650001101504650002901515653002401544653003901568653002801607653003101635653002001666700002601686700002301712773011101735856008601846852000901932655001201941IND60615738820221117184839.0181127e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061573882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTziogas, Charalampos10aFostering the transition to sustainable electricity systems: A hierarchical analysis framework  ap. 51-65.  aThe aim of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis framework for fostering the transition of electricity systems towards sustainability and energy security. In this sense, we first provide a critical taxonomy of extant studies, as these are mapped on strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchical decision-making process. Sustainability constituents along with the considered supply or demand viewpoints are also mapped. Following, we recognize and classify the major elaborated performance metrics used to monitor and assess the sustainable performance of electricity systems. We then integrate the recognized decision-making process with the physical systems' perspective to demonstrate the complex and dynamic nature of the electricity systems. Our critical analysis reveals that sustainability and energy security are rapidly evolving research fields; however, the often myopic perspective of the reviewed studies hinders the effective evaluation and analysis of renewable energy systems. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in literature, as well as of future research areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3arenewable energy sources 0aElectricity systems 0aSustainability and energy security 0aDecision-making process 0aKey performance indicators 0aSystem dynamics1 aGeorgiadis, Patroklos1 aPapadopoulos, Agis0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 206 p.51-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001900159245007300178300001600251500000900267520187600276592002802152650001502180650002202195650002202217650002002239650002602259650001302285650001802298650002102316650001502337650002102352650001302373650001802386650002902404650001302433650002102446650000702467650002002474650001802494650001502512650002302527650001802550650002102568651001402589700001902603700001802622700002002640773020702660856009402867852000902961655001202970IND60666470420221118035352.0191028e198804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066647042DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1988.00472425001700020027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComfort, S.

Liquid manure with and without a nitrification inhibitor [nitrapyrin, 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)pyridine, 13 mg a.i. L⁻¹ liquid manure] was injected into an uncropped area in June 1985. Soil samples were taken using a grid placed over the vertical cross-section of the injected bands permitting spatial sampling in the vertical plane. Sampling was done 5, 12, 26, 39, 67, 99, and 350 d after manure application by progressive exposure of the band. Soil water content, pH, NH₄-N, (NO₂ + NO₃)-N, Cl, and water-soluble C were determined. The synagraphic computer program, SYMAP, was used to evaluate spatial changes in inorganic N concentrations in the manure injection zone. Nitrapyrin was not effective in inhibiting nitrification at the rate used. Nitrification occurred at the outer fringes of the band within 5 d; maximum concentrations of 300 to 800 mg NO₃-N kg⁻¹ occurred throughout the injection zone at 26 d. High respiratory activity in the injection zone was indicated by an almost threefold decrease in water-soluble C between day 5 (750 mg C kg⁻¹) and day 12 (270 mg C kg⁻¹). Water content remained higher than the surrounding soil in the injection zone for 99 d. Once NO₃ leaching occurred, NO₃-N/Cl ratios decreased with depth under the injection zone. The abundant supply of NO₃ and readily oxidizable C, combined with the high moisture environment, led to the conclusion that liquid manure injections created an environment conducive for denitrification.

Curative application of the extracts by direct exposure proved to be more effective than a protective application for decay management of B. cinerea and P. expansum on all three cultivars. The efficacy of garlic extracts and clove oil, individually, as well as a combination treatment, did not differ significantly (P<0.05) from each other; however, all treatments significantly (P≤0.05) reduced decay when compared to the control treatments. Direct exposure of fruit that were artificially inoculated with N. alba, to the extracts, did not result in any inhibition compared to the control treatments. Exposure of inoculated fruit to the volatiles of the extracts did not inhibit postharvest decay on any of the apple cultivars, and in some cases, resulted in increased lesion diameters. This study demonstrated that the curative application of garlic extracts has the potential to reduce postharvest decay caused by B. cinerea and P. expansum, when applied directly to the fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aNeofabraea 3aPenicillium expansum 3aapples 3aclove oil 3acultivars 3adirect contact 3agarlic 3ain vivo studies 3apathogens 3apostharvest diseases 0aGarlic extracts 0aClove oil 0aAntifungal activity 0aCurative and protective application 0aPostharvest decay 0aApples1 aLennox, Cheryl L.1 aVries, Filicity A.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2015 Jan., v. 99 p.88-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2014.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011300175300001400288520084700302592002801149650001601177650001801193650001201211650002101223650002101244650001801265650001701283650001201300650002001312650001901332650000701351650001501358650002001373653002001393653002601413653002001439653003301459653002901492700002201521700001901543700002601562700002501588773010901613856008701722852000901809655001201818IND60602599420221119232351.0180711e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060259942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikhailova, Raisa10aEffect of some redox mediators on FAD fluorescence of glucose oxidase from Penicillium adametzii LF F-2044.1  ap. 10-15.  aGlucose oxidase (GOx) of Penicillium adametzii LF F-2044.1 recovered by ultrafiltration, was characterized by spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods.

This study was performed to achieve histomorphometric characterizations of the ALD muscles from male Cobb 500 broilers slaughtered at either 35 d or 42 d and to evaluate the effects of DCM on the enzymatic markers aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and on uric acid and creatinine metabolites. Blood samples (1.5 to 3 mL) and ALD muscle fragments were collected from each carcass, all of which were processed in a commercial inline processing system. For each age, twelve macroscopically normal animals and twelve animals found to exhibit DCM were randomly selected for histomorphometric evaluation and analysis of serologic profiles. Microscopic evaluations demonstrated that the muscle fibers of those with DCM exhibited a strong presence of multifocal regenerative myodegeneration as well as a substitution of muscle tissue with connective tissue (P < 0.001) through fibrosis, thus characterizing the chronicity and hardness of the affected muscle. It is suggested that DCM is a localized muscle lesion because the detected serum levels of CK (P < 0.001), AST (P < 0.001), ALT (P = 0.01), and LDH (P < 0.001) enzymes were strongly associated with the group affected by DCM. Additional studies are needed to gain an understanding of this myopathy because it is an emerging problem in the poultry industry. In addition, it is related to DCM lesions in fast-growing broilers with the greatest slaughter weights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acreatine kinase 3acreatinine 3aetiology 3afibrosis 3ahardness 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amales 3ametabolites 3amuscles 3amuscular diseases 3apoultry industry 3aslaughter 3auric acid 0abroiler 0amorphometry 0amuscular fiber 0amyopathy 0aserum enzymes1 aSiqueira, F M1 aHamerski, A C1 aDriemeier, D1 aValle, S F1 aVieira, S L1 aKindlein, L1 aNascimento, V P0 tPoultry science.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 96, no. 12 p.4217-4223dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex2523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009700164300001800261520133900279592002801618650002101646650001501667650001601682650001301698650001101711650002601722650001901748650001901767650001301786650001501799650002401814650001301838650001301851650001501864650001101879650002501890653002701915653001101942653001301953653001801966653001501984653001601999700001702015700001402032700001502046700001802061700001302079700002002092700001702112700001402129700001402143700001802157700005302175773013302228856008502361852000902446655001202455IND60606408520221120100219.0180725e20180302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060640852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b007702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yan10aComparative Proteomic Analysis of Exosomes and Microvesicles in Human Saliva for Lung Cancer  ap. 1101-1107.  aExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived microparticles present in most body fluids, mainly including microvesicles and exosomes. EV-harbored proteins have emerged as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prediction of different cancers. We successfully isolated microvesicles and exosomes from human saliva, which were further characterized comprehensively. Salivary EV protein profiling in normal subjects and lung cancer patients was systematically compared through utilizing LC–MS/MS-based label-free quantification. 785 and 910 proteins were identified from salivary exosomes and microvesicles, respectively. According to statistical analysis, 150 and 243 proteins were revealed as dysregulated candidates in exosomes and microvesicles for lung cancer. Among them, 25 and 40 proteins originally from distal organ cells were found in the salivary exosomes and microvesicles of lung cancer patients. In particular, 5 out of 25 and 9 out of 40 are lung-related proteins. Six potential candidates were selected for verification by Western blot, and four of them, namely, BPIFA1, CRNN, MUC5B, and IQGAP, were confirmed either in salivary microvesicles or in exosomes. Our data collectively demonstrate that salivary EVs harbor informative proteins that might be used for the detection of lung cancer through a noninvasive way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abiomarkers 3abody fluids 3aexosomes 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3alung neoplasms 3amicroparticles 3apatients 3aprediction 3aprotein composition 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asaliva 3astatistical analysis 0aextracellular vesicles 0asaliva 0aexosomes 0amicrovesicles 0aproteomics 0alung cancer1 aHuo, Chunhui1 aQiao, Zhi1 aShang, Zhi1 aUzzaman, Asad1 aLiu, Sha1 aJiang, Xiaoteng1 aFan, Liu-Yin1 aJi, Liyun1 aGuan, Xin1 aCao, Cheng-Xi1 aXiao, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2831-04360 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 Mar. 02, v. 17, no. 3 p.1101-1107dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b007703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245011200179300001400291500001500305520159100320592002801911650002501939650001101964650002701975650001902002650001602021650003102037650003002068650002002098650001502118650004302133650001202176650004502188650001502233650002002248650001302268650001802281650002802299650002502327650002002352650002002372650001702392653001502409653001502424653001702439653002302456653001102479653001602490653004002506700002502546700002102571700002802592700002102620700002002641700002402661700002202685700002702707773011602734856009002850852000902940655001202949IND60542795220221116191922.0190405e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054279522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2014.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerotti, Valeria E.10aBiochemical characterization of the flavedo of heat-treated Valencia orange during postharvest cold storage  ap. 80-87.  a2019-12-06  aHeat treatment is a powerful and eco-friendly method to prevent Penicillium infection in citrus fruit during the postharvest. Several studies have been dedicated to investigate the general chemical changes that justify the immediate reaction responsible for the induced tolerance; but just how primary metabolism and enzymology are affected by heat treatment and along a prolonged cold storage is still unclear. In this work, the main enzymes of carbon metabolism of Valencia orange flavedo were analyzed during the postharvest period after a heat treatment (HT) of 48h at 37°C. Enzymatic activity measurements indicated that the NADPH producing enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase have lower levels in HT fruit. In parallel, a higher synthesis of sucrose from organic acids was observed in HT epicarp. Sucrose-phosphate synthase would have an important role in sucrose accumulation. The pathway of carbon through glycolysis was affected by cold storage, independently of HT, in a way that it favors the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase over the PPi-dependent homologous enzyme and the use of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEP carboxylase instead of pyruvate kinase. Similarly, phenylpropanoid compounds did not show major changes in response to HT, although some of them showed a marked descent along the cold storage. Proteomic studies revealed alterations in the abundance of ascorbate peroxidase, two germin-like proteins and small HSPs, completing the description of the main metabolic changes in this tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acarbon 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aheat treatment 3aPenicillium 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3afungal diseases of plants 3apyruvate kinase 3aglycolysis 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3asucrose 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aproteomics 3aenzyme activity 3aproteins 3acitrus fruits 3aorganic acids and salts 3aphosphofructokinases 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aCitrus sinensis 3acold storage 0aGlycolysis 0aProteomics 0aCitrus fruit 0aFruit biochemistry 0aOrange 0aPostharvest 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aMoreno, Alejandra S.1 aTrípodi, Karina1 aDel Vecchio, Hernán A.1 aMeier, Guillermo1 aBello, Fernando1 aCocco, Mariángeles1 aVázquez, Daniel,1 aPodestá, Florencio E.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2015 Jan., v. 99 p.80-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2014.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011400171300001400285520065100299592002800950650002800978650000901006650001601015650001201031650001801043650001001061650001201071650001601083653001501099653002001114653002301134700002201157700002201179773012201201856008301323852000901406655001201415IND60543187020221119051939.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054318702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuraishi, Takayuki10aFrom mouth to anus: Functional and structural relevance of enteric neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster gut  ap. 21-26.  aThe intestinal tract is the main organ involved in host nutritional homeostasis.

The secondary muscle, which represents less than 1% of the body wall, has two forms. One is unique in the animal kingdom (alternation of two sarcomere types: “classical cross-striated” s1 and a unique type, s2) and has already been described; it characterizes most of the genera. The other, found only in more or less benthic species, functions by supercontraction. In the primitive genus Archeterokrohnia, it often exhibits “s1/s2 hybrid” sarcomeres, appearing as s2 sarcomeres partly containing s1 ones; moreover, the alternation of s1 and s2 sarcomeres is not regular. New sarcomeres are formed by the splitting of the Z-discs between two consecutive s1 sarcomeres. This is another unique feature of the chaetognath secondary muscle which facilitates understanding the transition from the first to the second form: suppression of s2 sarcomeres and constitution of a supercontraction capability in s1 sarcomeres. The transverse muscle, present in the less evolved genera living near or on the bottom, also has two forms: either classical cross-striated or, in more or less benthic species, supercontracting. Supercontraction would be a derived character. The peculiarities of the primary, secondary and transverse muscles of the truly benthic chaetognaths are different from those of all the planktonic or benthoplanktonic chaetognaths. The variations in the histological and cytological characteristics of the muscles agree with the phylogenetic trends previously proposed for the phylum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aintegument 3amuscles 3aphylogeny 3aplankton 3asarcomeres1 aDuvert, M.0 tMarine biology.g2002 Nov., v. 141, no. 5 p.925-938dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-002-0889-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245022200175520075300397592002801150650001501178650001101193650001001204650002001214650001201234650001501246650002501261650001601286651002201302651001101324653002001335653001001355653002801365653001501393653001201408700002401420700002301444700002401467700002101491700001801512700002101530700002201551700002701573773010501600856008501705852000901790655001201799IND60679171220221119003328.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067917122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2019.1018322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiralongo, Francesco10aAbundance, distribution and ecology of the tufted ghost crab Ocypode cursor (Linnaeus, 1758) (Crustacea: Ocypodidae) from a recently colonized urban sandy beach, and new records from Sicily (central Mediterranean Sea)  aThe tufted ghost crab, Ocypode cursor, was recorded for the first time on the coast of Sicily mainland in 2009, however no ecological studies were conducted so far. In this study, we provide the first ecological data, based on massive data collection of the ghost crab in Sicily. In particular, we studied the spatio-temporal distribution of the species in the recently colonized urban beach of Avola. Our results showed that this species' activity is mainly affected by temperature (crabs were more active during warmer months), while distance from the shoreline affected size distribution (larger crabs were usually found farther away from the shoreline). Crabs feed on a great variety of food items, and are undergoing northward range expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcypodidae 3acoasts 3acrabs 3adata collection 3aecology 3ashorelines 3aspatial distribution 3atemperature 3aMediterranean Sea 3aSicily 0aProtected taxon 0aBeach 0aRange-expanding species 0aIonian Sea 0aBurrows1 aMessina, Giuseppina1 aMarino, Sebastiano1 aBellomo, Sebastiano1 aVanadia, Antonio1 aBorzì, Laura1 aTibullo, Daniele1 aDi Stefano, Agata1 aLombardo, Bianca Maria0 tJournal of sea research.g2020 Jan., v. 156 p.101832-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2019.1018323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01787naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245006500177300001300242500000900255520064300264592002800907650001500935650001500950650001100965650002100976650001500997650001301012650002201025650002301047650001901070651001201089700001801101773020301119856009401322852000901416655001201425IND60666470620221118035319.0191028e197801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066647062DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1978.00472425000700010002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuo, A.

Control rations with equal amounts of corn, wheat, and barley were also fed. The control rations did contain some DON while both sets of rations contained ZEA. Within each grain source, there were 4 treatments: the control ration plus 3 rations each with a different feed additive which were evaluated for the potential to lessen potential mycotoxin effects on bird performance and physiology. The additives were Biomin BioFix (2 lb/ton), Kemin Kallsil (4 lb/ton), and Nutriad UNIKE (3 lb/ton). The mycotoxin rations reduced poult body weight (2.31 vs. 2.08 ± 0.02 kg) and increased (worsened) poult feed conversion (1.47 vs. 1.51 ± 0.01) at 6 wk. Feeding the poults the mycotoxin feed also resulted in organ and physiological changes typical of feeding dietary aflatoxin although a combined effect of AF, DON, and ZEA which cannot be dismissed. The feed additives resulted in improved feed conversion to 6 wk in both grain treatment groups. The observed physiological effect of feeding the additives was to reduce relative gizzard weight for both groups and to lessen the increase in relative kidney weight for the birds fed the mycotoxin feed. In conclusion, the feed additives used in this study did alleviate the effect of dietary mycotoxins to some degree, especially with respect to feed conversion. Further studies of longer duration are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxins 3abarley 3abody weight 3acorn 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3agizzard 3akidneys 3apoults 3aturkey hens 3awheat 3azearalenone 0amycotoxin 0aturkey 0afeed additive 0aperformance1 aGrimes, J L1 aKoci, M D1 aAli, R A1 aStark, C R1 aNighot, P K1 aMiddleton, T F1 aFahrenholz, A C0 tPoultry science.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 96, no. 12 p.4236-4244dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex2143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03978naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245005900163300001600222500002000238500000900258520219500267592002802462596007902490596007902569596005202648596003402700650002202734650001602756650001202772650002502784650002002809650001802829650001602847650001302863650001702876650001602893650001502909650001402924650001302938650001902951650002102970650001202991650001803003650001803021650001003039650001503049651000903064700002003073773021703093856008003310961001303390852000903403655001203412IND60666470720221118035350.0220811e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066647072DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2018.03.01152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaynes, D. B.10aPerformance of Saturated Riparian Buffers in Iowa, USA  ap. 289-296.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aNitrate from artificial drainage pipes (tiles) underlying agricultural fields is a major source of reactive N, especially NO₃, in surface waters. A novel approach for reducing NO₃ loss is to intercept a field tile where it crosses a riparian buffer and divert a fraction of the flow as shallow groundwater within the buffer. This practice is called a saturated riparian buffer (SRB), and although it is promising, little data on the performance of the practice is available. This research investigated the effectiveness of SRBs in removing NO₃ at six sites installed across Iowa, resulting in a total of 17 site‐years. Water flow and NO₃ in the tile outlets, diverted into the buffers, and NO₃ concentration changes within the buffers were monitored throughout the year at each site. Results showed that all the SRBs were effective in removing NO₃ from the tile outlet, with the average annual NO₃ load removal ranging from 13 to 179 kg N for drainage areas ranging from 3.4 to 40.5 ha. This is NO₃ that would have otherwise discharged directly into the adjoining streams. The annual removal effectiveness, which is the total NO₃ removed in the SRB divided by the total NO₃ draining from the field, ranged from 8 to 84%. This corresponds to an average removal rate of 0.040 g N m⁻³ d⁻¹ with a range of 0.004 to 0.164 g N m⁻³ d⁻¹. Assuming a 40‐yr life expectancy for the structure and a 4% discount rate, we computed a mean equal annual cost for SRBs of US$213.83. Given the average annual removal of 73 kg for all site‐years, this cost equates to $2.94 kg⁻¹ N removed, which is very competitive with other field‐edge practices such as denitrification bioreactors and constructed wetlands. Thus, SRBs continue to be a promising practice for NO₃ removal in tile‐drained landscapes. CORE IDEAS: Saturated riparian buffers (SRBs) removed an average of 73 kg N yr⁻¹ of NO₃ from tile water. A buffer with established perennial vegetation is important for optimum NO₃ removal. The percentage of NO₃ removed to NO₃ delivered to a SRB ranged from 8 to 84%. The cost of N removal for this practice is similar to other field‐edge practices.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013‐67019‐21384cAgriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive  a2015‐68007‐23193cAgriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture  cIowa Nutrient Research Center 3aagricultural land 3abioreactors 3abuffers 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrification 3adiscount rate 3adrain pipes 3adrainage 3aedge effects 3agroundwater 3alandscapes 3alongevity 3anitrates 3apollution load 3ariparian buffers 3astreams 3asurface water 3atile drainage 3atiles 3awater flow 3aIowa1 aIsenhart, T.

After filtering markers for quality-filtering, 14,270 SilicoDArTs and 6484 SNPs were retained and used for genetic diversity, population structure and linkage disequilibrium analyses. The highest number of SilicoDArT and SNP markers mapped on genome A and B compared to genome D. In both marker types, polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.1 to 0.5, while > 0.80% of SilicoDArTs and > 0.44% SNPs showed PIC value more than median (0.25%). Un-weighted Neighbor Joining cluster analysis and Bayesian-based model population structure grouped wheat genotypes into three and four clusters, respectively. Principal component analysis and discriminant analysis of principal component results showed highly match with cluster and population structure analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was more extensive in both marker types, while graphical display of LD decay for both marker types showed that LD declined in the region close to 15 kbp, where r²-values corresponded to r² = 0.16. Overall, our genetic diversity analysis showed high level of variation in studied wheat genotypes, even though there was no relationship between wheat grouping and origins. This might be attributed to admixture level that occurred during long-term natural selection of wheat genotypes in different parts of the world. Highly diverse wheat genotypes used in this study may possess unique genes and are useful sources in breeding programs to improve grain yield and quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriticum 3abreeding programs 3acluster analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotyping by sequencing 3agrain yield 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amodels 3anatural selection 3apopulation structure 3aprincipal component analysis 3awheat1 aMehrabi, Rahim1 aNaji, Amir Mohammad1 aṬālibī, Riz̤ā,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9109-76770 t3 Biotech.g2020 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.48-48dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-2014-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03966naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245010100208300001400309520216400323592002802487650005002515650002302565650005002588650002002638650002002658650000802678650001202686650001202698650001402710650001602724650001702740650002402757650002302781650002102804650001402825650001202839650001602851650003102867650001102898651001102909651001002920651001002930653003102940653001502971653000902986653003902995653002703034700001803061700001703079700001503096700001103111700001703122700001703139773010003156856008703256852000903343655001203352IND60556823620221120050139.0170105e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055682362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Haixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5555-598110aVOC characteristics and inhalation health risks in newly renovated residences in Shanghai, China  ap. 73-83.  aExposure to indoor VOCs is expected to link to a variety of negative health outcome. The popularity of decorations and refurbishment in homes in China has given rise to indoor elevated VOC levels, potentially posing health threats to residents.In this study, concentrations of 101 VOC compounds and associated health risks were investigated in newly renovated homes in Shanghai. The potential excess inhalation health risks from home exposure of 17 health-related VOCs were estimated by the Inhalation Unit Risk (IUR) and Reference Concentration (RfC) proposed by US EPA. Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis were used to assess the uncertainty associated with the estimates of health risks.The dominant groups by mass concentration were oxygenated VOCs (o-VOCs), aromatics, alkanes and halogenated VOCs (x-VOCs) .12 VOCs with IARC's confirmed or probable carcinogens ratings were detected with a >60% detection frequency in the total samples. The mean concentrations of BTEX (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, ethylbenzene) were 2.32μg/m3, 200.13μg/m3, 39.56μg/m3, 32.59μg/m3 and 26.33μg/m3 respectively, generally higher than those in older homes reported in previous studies except benzene. The mean concentration of methylene chloride (47.43μg/m3) and 1,2-dichloroethane (33.83μg/m3) were noticeably higher than the levels reported in previous studies in Hong Kong, Japan and Canada. Whereas the mean concentration of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (5.53μg/m3) were similar to the results of Canadian national survey but lower than those in Japan. The concentrations of 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and methylene chloride, ethylbenzene presented a mean cancer risk at 7.39×10−6, 1.95×10−6, 1.62×10−6, 1.04×10−6 respectively, above the US EPA proposed acceptable risk level of 1×10−6. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the VOC exposure concentration have a greater impact than the IUR values on the risk assessment.This study highlights the characteristics of VOCs in recently renovated homes and has implications for the adverse health effects that result from exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons in indoor air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) 3aMonte Carlo method 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aacceptable risk 3aadverse effects 3aair 3aalkanes 3abenzene 3abreathing 3acarcinogens 3aethylbenzene 3aethylene dichloride 3amethylene chloride 3anational surveys 3aneoplasms 3atoluene 3auncertainty 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene 3aCanada 3aChina 3aJapan 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aRenovation 0aBTEX 0aChlorinated hydrocarbons (CL-VOCs) 0aHealth risk assessment1 aJing, Shengao1 aWang, Hongli1 aMa, Yingge1 aLi, Li1 aSong, Weimin1 aKan, Haidong0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 577 p.73-83dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008900156300002000245520120100265592002801466650001701494650001501511650002101526650001401547650000901561650001901570650001101589650001901600650002701619650001601646650002201662700002001684700001201704700001801716700001301734773012501747856007501872852000901947655001201956IND60789359620221119125043.0220820e20220812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078935962DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra03642h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lanjuan10aPreparation and study of the flame retardant properties of C₆₀/PMMA microspheres  ap. 22623-22630.  aIn this paper, highly flame retardant C₆₀/PMMA composites were prepared using an in situ polymerization method by introducing fullerene (C₆₀) into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) to improve its combustion characteristics. The apparent morphologies of PMMA and C₆₀/PMMA microspheres were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the structure was characterized by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The thermal stability and flame retardancy were characterized using a synchronous thermal analyzer, a cone calorimeter and an oxygen index tester. The results show that the maximum initial decomposition temperature of C₆₀/PMMA-2 (prepared using C₆₀ with a concentration of 2 mg mL⁻¹) is 234.89 °C, which is about 59.89 °C higher than that of PMMA, and the thermal stability is the best. The limiting oxygen index of the C₆₀/PMMA-2 composite is 21.8, which is 28.2% higher than that of pure PMMA. In addition, the peak heat release rate (PHRR) of C₆₀/PMMA is reduced by 630.4 kW m⁻² when compared with pure PMMA, which means that the flame retardant property is improved. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties of the PMMA are also improved by adding C₆₀.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimeters 3acombustion 3aflame retardants 3afullerene 3aheat 3amicroparticles 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aJiang, Juncheng1 aNi, Lei1 aChen, Zhiquan1 aLi, Chao0 tRSC advances.g2022 Aug. 12, v. 12, no. 35 p.22623-22630dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra03642h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04170naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002200194245009800216300001600314506007600330520211200406592002802518506003702546650005002583650000802633650001802641650002302659650001202682650001202694650002002706650001602726650001402742650001402756650002102770650001702791650001102808650001302819650001302832650001502845650000902860650001102869650001502880650003702895650000902932650002002941650001502961650002002976650002002996650001003016651001803026653001803044653001603062653002503078653001003103653001503113653002403128700001903152700001603171700002303187700001803210700002203228773010203250856008703352852000903439655001203448IND60556823820221207131243.0170713e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055682382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.0722doi7 aPMC64579922pmcid7 a277839322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElliott, Elise G.10aUnconventional oil and gas development and risk of childhood leukemia: Assessing the evidence  ap. 138-147.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe widespread distribution of unconventional oil and gas (UO&G) wells and other facilities in the United States potentially exposes millions of people to air and water pollutants, including known or suspected carcinogens. Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the disease severity, vulnerable population, and short disease latency. A comprehensive review of carcinogens and leukemogens associated with UO&G development is not available and could inform future exposure monitoring studies and human health assessments. The objective of this analysis was to assess the evidence of carcinogenicity of water contaminants and air pollutants related to UO&G development. We obtained a list of 1177 chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewater from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and constructed a list of 143 UO&G-related air pollutants through a review of scientific papers published through 2015 using PubMed and ProQuest databases. We assessed carcinogenicity and evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma of these chemicals using International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs. The majority of compounds (>80%) were not evaluated by IARC and therefore could not be reviewed. Of the 111 potential water contaminants and 29 potential air pollutants evaluated by IARC (119 unique compounds), 49 water and 20 air pollutants were known, probable, or possible human carcinogens (55 unique compounds). A total of 17 water and 11 air pollutants (20 unique compounds) had evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, diesel exhaust, and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Though information on the carcinogenicity of compounds associated with UO&G development was limited, our assessment identified 20 known or suspected carcinogens that could be measured in future studies to advance exposure and risk assessments of cancer-causing agents. Our findings support the need for investigation into the relationship between UO&G development and risk of cancer in general and childhood leukemia in particular.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aair 3aair pollution 3aat-risk population 3abenzene 3acadmium 3acarcinogenicity 3acarcinogens 3achildhood 3adatabases 3adisease severity 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3alymphoma 3amonitoring 3aoils 3apeople 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater potential 3awells 3aUnited States 0aAir pollution 0aCarcinogens 0aHydraulic fracturing 0aShale 0aWastewater 0aWater contamination1 aTrinh, Pauline1 aMa, Xiaomei1 aLeaderer, Brian P.1 aWard, Mary H.1 aDeziel, Nicole C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 576 p.138-147dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006200170300001400232520105700246592002801303650001601331650001401347650001501361650001301376650002301389650001801412650001201430650001801442653001401460653003201474653001601506653001601522653001401538653002001552653001701572700002201589700001801611700001601629773012301645856008301768852000901851655001201860IND60543187420221119051950.0190410e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054318742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaikhedkar, Nidhi10aCathepsins of lepidopteran insects: Aspects and prospects  ap. 51-59.  aMolecular understanding of lepidopteran physiology has revealed that proteases consist of one of the central regulatory/reacting system for insect growth and survival. Among the various proteases, cathepsins are the most crucial cellular proteases, which play vital roles during insect development. In the present review, we have discussed various aspects of the lepidopteran insect cathepsins, emphasizing their roles in processes like development, growth, metamorphosis, apoptosis and immunity. Cathepsins are categorized into different types on the basis of their sequence diversification, leading to variation in structure and catalytic function. Cathepsins exhibit tissue and stage specific expression pattern which is fine-tuned by a delicate balance of expression, compartmentalization, zymogen activation, inhibition by protein inhibitors and degradation. The indispensability of cathepsins as cellular proteases in the above mentioned processes proposes them as novel targets for designing effective and specific insect controlling strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3aapoptosis 3acathepsins 3aimmunity 3ainsect development 3ainsect growth 3ainsects 3ametamorphosis 0aCathepsin 0aCysteine/aspartate protease 0aLepidoptera 0aDevelopment 0aApoptosis 0aStress response 0aPest control1 aSummanwar, Aarohi1 aJoshi, Rakesh1 aGiri, Ashok0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2015 Sept., v. 64 p.51-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012400166300001800290520180800308592002802116650001402144650002102158650001002179650000902189650001202198650001302210650001102223650001902234650002002253650001602273650001502289650000902304653001302313653002302326653002002349653001602369653002102385653001302406700001802419773011502437856008602552852000902638655001202647IND60615739420221120040726.0181029e20181220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061573942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Feng10aInfluences of process parameters on the apparent diffusion of an acid dye in sodium alginate paste for textile printing  ap. 1139-1147.  aDye diffusion in color paste plays a crucial role in textile printing. This work is to explore different influences of process parameters on the apparent diffusion of an acid dye (C.I. Acid Blue 7) in sodium alginate paste at the first time, with a novel and specially developed method by employing a specially self-designed and built cell. Moreover, the approximately apparent diffusion rate of the acid dye was also determined by the proposed method in convenient and operable experiments at different conditions in the paste. The results reveal that the proposed method was feasible and powerful to experimentally investigate the apparent diffusion of the acid dye and its various parameter influences in the paste. Notable influences from media temperature and the employed additives on the apparent diffusion of the acid dye were observed in the paste. The approximately apparent diffusion rate of the acid dye increased significantly with the temperature from 348.15 K to 371.15 K, as well as for the addition of glycerol from 0.5% to 5.0%. However, notable decrease in the apparent diffusion rate was also encountered with the dosage of sodium alginate thickener from 4.0% to 9.0%, as well as for the application of the additives of carbamide from 2.0% to 7.0% and ammonium sulfate from 1.0% to 3.5% in the paste. It is most important that a power function model was successfully supposed, validated and employed by all the experimental data correlation to characterize and compare the various influences of the employed process parameters on the apparent diffusion of the acid dye in the paste. The achieved results are helpful and potentially benefit for a process design and control in textile printing with efficient application of chemicals and dyes for a cleaner production in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aammonium sulfate 3acolor 3adyes 3afabrics 3aglycerol 3amodels 3aprocess design 3asodium alginate 3atemperature 3athickeners 3aurea 0aAcid dye 0aApparent diffusion 0aSodium alginate 0aColor paste 0aTextile printing 0aAdditive1 aLong, Jia-Jie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Dec. 20, v. 205 p.1139-1147dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03971naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245010500182300001600287520234800303592002802651650002502679650002002704650000802724650001002732650002402742650001302766650002402779650001902803650001302822650001702835650001402852650002302866650001402889650002102903650001302924650001502937650001702952650001002969650002302979650002503002650001603027651001603043653002003059653002403079653001303103653001903116653001203135700002003147700002103167773011803188856009003306852000903396655001203405IND60542795620221116191557.0190405e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054279562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2014.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRupavatharam, Srikanth10aRe-evaluation of harvest timing in ‘Unique’ feijoa using 1-MCP and exogenous ethylene treatments  ap. 152-159.  aIn New Zealand feijoa are harvested by touch-picking and can be stored in 4°C for up to 4 weeks with a subsequent shelf life of 5–7d at 20°C. The origins of the ‘touch picked’ harvest maturity standard may have been established to provide “ready to eat” fruit rather than those suitable for storage. Despite the climacteric physiology of the fruit, previous studies which apply either 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), ethylene or propylene on postharvest touch-picked ‘Unique’ feijoa have been found to have no impact on storage life. Harvesting fruit earlier may have advantages in that fruit may possess more storage life and/or may be more responsive to 1-MCP treatments. The aim of this study is to establish the role of harvest timing on postharvest performance of feijoa and investigate whether 1-MCP or exogenous ethylene applied to earlier harvested fruit modifies ripening and deterioration under storage conditions. The experiment had a full matrix of three harvest times (approximately at two week intervals, with the last maturity being the current commercial standard of touch picked) and three treatments: 1-MCP treatment prior to storage, ethylene treatment during storage and air as a control. Fruit (cv. Unique) were stored at 4°C and 90% RH for 6 weeks with physiology (respiration rate and ethylene production) and quality assessed at two week intervals both after removal and a subsequent 5d at 20°C. Harvest timing significantly influenced fruit maturity. Postharvest 1-MCP application delayed ripening of early harvested fruit while having no impact on touch picked fruit. Respiration rate, softening, loss of flesh colour (°hue) and locule development of fruit were suppressed by 1-MCP, but had no effect on weight loss, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA) and skin colour. Fruit were insensitive to exogenous ethylene treatment suggesting that natural endogenous ethylene may be saturating receptors. Fruit harvested 2 weeks prior to touch picked maturity ripened and appeared visually acceptable after 6 weeks of storage. However, these fruit were low in SSC with high TA suggesting that taste may be altered. There may be potential to provide extended storage life for feijoa through early harvesting although consumer acceptance trials of the likely new taste profiles are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aAcca sellowiana 3aair 3acolor 3aconsumer acceptance 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afruit maturity 3afruiting 3aharvest date 3apropylene 3aready-to-eat foods 3areceptors 3arespiratory rate 3aripening 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3ataste 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 3aNew Zealand 0aAcca sellowiana 0aEthylene inhibition 0aMaturity 0aFruit ripening 0aStorage1 aEast, Andrew R.1 aHeyes, Julian A.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2015 Jan., v. 99 p.152-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2014.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245019700167300001400364520137300378592002801751650002101779650001801800650002301818650002001841650001401861650001601875650001301891650001701904650001101921650001301932650000701945650002501952650001601977653001501993653001302008653002502021653002302046653002102069653003002090700001502120700001602135773010902151856008702260852000902347655001202356IND60602599920221119232331.0180711e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060259992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaker, S.14aThe final acylation step in aromatic dithiolopyrrolone biosyntheses: Identification and characterization of the first bacterium N-benzoyltransferase from Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137  ap. 35-41.  aThe last step in the biosynthesis of dithiolopyrrolone antibiotics was thought to involve the transfer of acyl group from acyl-CoA to pyrrothine/holothin core. In Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B-24137, two acyltransferases, an acetyltransferase and a benzoyltransferase were proposed to catalyze this step. We have previously identified, in Sa. algeriensis genome, two open read frames, actA and actB patiently encoded these enzymes. This study focuses primarily on the characterization of the protein encoded by actA. After cloning and expressing of actA in Escherichia coli BL21, the recombinant protein encoded by actA was purified. Selectivity of ActA for pyrrothine/holothin as substrate and different acyl-CoA as co-substrate was evaluated using two acyls-groups, linear and aromatic. The enzyme was shown to prefer aromatic groups over linear groups as donor group; further neither product nor transfer was observed for linear groups. Therefore ActA has been determined to be a pyrrothine/holothin N-benzoyltransferase which can either pyrrothine (Km of 72μM) or holothin (Km of 129.5μM) as substrates and benzoyl-CoA (Km of 348.65 and 395.28μM) as co-substrates for pyrrothine and holothin, respectively. The optimum pH and temperature has been shown to be 8, 40°C, respectively. ActA is the first enzyme characterized as N-benzoyltransferase in bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharothrix 3aacetyltransferases 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aacylation 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3agenome 3amoieties 3apH 3arecombinant proteins 3atemperature 0aPyrrothine 0aHolothin 0aN-benzoyltransferase 0aBenzoyl-pyrrothine 0aBenzoyl-holothin 0aSaccharothrix algeriensis1 aChacar, S.1 aMathieu, F.0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2015 May, v. 72 p.35-41dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2015.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008300168300001600251500001900267520083100286592002801117650001301145650000901158650001701167650001201184650001601196650001401212651001001226653003001236653003001266700001901296700001601315700002001331700001701351700001901368700002001387700002301407700001401430700001401444773009801458856008401556852000901640655001201649IND60698747120221118195527.0210531e20200604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069874712DNAL7 a10.3897/phytokeys.149.495332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jun-Tong10aOxytropis shennongjiaensis (Fabaceae), a new species from Hubei, Central China  ap. 117-128.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHere we describe Oxytropis shennongjiaensis, a new species of Fabaceae from Central China (Hubei Province). Morphologically, O. shennongjiaensis is closely similar to O. sitaipaiensis, O. melanocalyx and O. kansuensis, but differs in stem characters, with less conspicuous internodes; persistent herbaceous stipules; pale yellow to white corolla; and stipitate legumes, 3–5 mm with a long beak. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and two chloroplast markers (trnL–F and psbA–trnH), also identified O. shennongjiaensis as a new species, which is consistent with our morphological analyses. Considering the morphological data and phylogenetic data presented here, we believe that this evidence satisfies the required diagnostic criteria to identify O. shennongjiaensis as a new species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFabaceae 3abeak 3achloroplasts 3acorolla 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aChina 0aShennongjia National Park 0aOxytropisshennongjiaensis1 aZhang, Dai-Gui1 aLv, Zhen-Yu1 aHuang, Xian-Han1 aLiu, Peng-Ju1 aYang, Jia-Ning1 aYang, Jing-Yuan1 aTojibaev, Komiljon1 aDeng, Tao1 aSun, Hang0 tPhytoKeys.g2020 June 04, v. 149 p.117-128dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2142x1314-20037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.149.495333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04409naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001600188245019400204300001000398500001900408506007600427520227100503592002802774596005402802596005402856596008602910596008602996506003703082650001703119650001503136650001703151650001803168650001003186650001803196650002603214650002303240650002003263650003103283650001003314650003003324650001603354650001703370650003303387650002003420650001003440700001603450700001703466700001603483700005803499700001403557700001803571773012703589856008203716852000903798655001203807IND60681374120221207135610.0201208e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068137412DNAL7 aPMC69613342pmcid7 a319564112pmid7 a10.1186/s40104-019-0410-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yujie10aEarly inoculation with caecal fermentation broth alters small intestine morphology, gene expression of tight junction proteins in the ileum, and the caecal metabolomic profiling of broilers  ap. 8.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The establishment of stable microbiota in early life is beneficial to the individual. Changes in the intestinal environment during early life play a crucial role in modulating the gut microbiota. Therefore, early intervention to change the intestinal environment can be regarded as a new regulation strategy for the growth and health of poultry. However, the effects of intestinal environmental changes on host physiology and metabolism are rarely reported. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of early inoculation with caecal fermentation broth on small intestine morphology, gene expression of tight junction proteins in the ileum, and cecum microbial metabolism of broilers. RESULTS: Our data showed that early inoculation with caecal fermentation broth could improve intestine morphology. The small intestine villus height was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the intervened broilers compared to the control group, especially on day 28. A similar result was observed in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, we found early inoculation significantly increased (P < 0.05) the expression levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO1) on days 14 and 28, claudin-1 (CLDN1) on day 28, whereas the gene expression of claudin-2 (CLDN2) was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) on days 14 and 28. Gas chromatography time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) technology was further implemented to systematically evaluate the microbial metabolite profiles. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) displayed a distinct trend towards separation between the fermentation broth group (F group) and the control group (C group). The differentially expressed metabolites were identified, and they were mainly functionally enriched in beta-alanine metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. In addition, 1,3-diaminopropane was selected as a key biomarker that responded to early inoculation with caecal fermentation broth. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide insight into intestinal metabolomics and confirm that early inoculation with caecal fermentation broth can be used as a potential strategy to improve intestinal health of broilers.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0500501cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2017YFD0500501cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2010DS700124-ZZ1905cState Key Laboratory for Quality and Safety of Agro-products  a2010DS700124-ZZ1905cState Key Laboratory for Quality and Safety of Agro-products0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta-alanine 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acecum 3aculture media 3adiscriminant analysis 3agas chromatography 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aileum 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aprincipal component analysis 3atight junctions 3avilli1 aXia, Wenrui1 aWen, Xueting1 aLyu, Wentao1 aXiao, Yingping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7949-11261 aYang, Hua1 aZou, Xiaoting0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2020 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-019-0410-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013600167300001600303520125200319592002801571650003001599650002701629650002101656650001701677650002201694650002001716650001301736650002001749650001501769650001101784650001201795653001201807653001701819653001801836653002001854653002001874700002501894700001901919700002601938700002101964700002201985700001702007773017202024856008502196852000902281655001202290IND60679171820221119003734.0200427e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067917182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2019.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHokao, Ryuta10aAffinity shift of ATP upon glycerol binding to a glycerol kinase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1  ap. 657-663.  aGlycerol kinase (GK) is a key enzyme of glycerol metabolism. It participates in glycolysis and lipid membrane biosynthesis. A hexamer of GK from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1(Tk-GK) was identified as a substrate-binding form of the enzyme. Here, the X-ray crystal structure analysis and the biochemical analysis was done and the relationships between its unique oligomer structure and substrate binding affinity were investigated. Wild type GK and mutant K271E GK, which disrupts the hexamer formation interface, were crystallized with and without their substrates and analyzed at 2.19–3.05 Å resolution. In the absence of glycerol, Tk-GK was a dimer in solution. In the presence of its glycerol substrate, however, it became a hexamer consisting of three symmetrical dimers about the threefold axis. Through glycerol binding, all Tk-GK molecules in the hexamer were in closed form as a result of domain-motion. The closed form of Tk-GK had tenfold higher ATP affinity than the open form of Tk-GK. The hexamer structure stabilized the closed conformation and enhanced ATP binding affinity when the GK was bound to glycerol. This molecular mechanism is quite simple activity regulation mechanism among known GKs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermococcus kodakarensis 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abinding capacity 3abiosynthesis 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3aglycerol 3aglycerol kinase 3aglycolysis 3alipids 3amutants 0aArchaea 0aATP affinity 0aDomain-motion 0aGlycerol kinase 0aOligomerization1 aMatsumura, Hiroyoshi1 aKatsumi, Ryota1 aAngkawidjaja, Clement1 aTakano, Kazufumi1 aKanaya, Shigenori1 aKoga, Yuichi0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2020 June, v. 129, no. 6 p.657-663dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2019.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014500170300001600315520125100331592002801582650002701610650001601637650001401653650002301667650002301690650002701713650001101740650001501751650002501766650001301791650001501804650001401819650002501833653001501858653001501873653002101888653001001909653001201919700002201931700002001953700001701973700002001990700002002010700002102030700002102051773017102072856008502243852000902328655001202337IND60679172020221119003305.0200804e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067917202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2019.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAketo, Tsuyoshi10aSelection and characterization of microalgae with potential for nutrient removal from municipal wastewater and simultaneous lipid production  ap. 565-572.  aWastewater treatment, along with the simultaneous production of valuable chemical compounds, including lipids by microalgae is a challenging but attractive study. Towards this goal, the candidate microalgae were selected from culture collections or isolated from wastewater in this study. The initial screening test using microalgae revealed that various eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic microalgae showed steady growth in municipal wastewater samples. Among them, Tetraselmis sp. NKG400013 and Parachlorella kessleri NKG021201 from culture collections, and Chloroidium saccharophilum NKH13 from the wastewater sample exhibited high biomass productivity. Furthermore, P. kessleri NKG021201 and C. saccharophilum NKH13 showed high lipid productivity (56 ± 1 mg/L/day for NKG021201, 35 ± 10 mg/L/day for NKH13). During this cultivation, 99% of nitrogen and 82% of phosphorous compounds were removed from the wastewater sample by the strain NKG021201. Analysis of fatty acid compositions of P. kessleri NKG021201 and C. saccharophilum NKH13 revealed that lipids derived from these microalgae were suitable for the application of biodiesel fuels, indicating that these microalgae were promising for wastewater treatment and lipid production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParachlorella kessleri 3aTetraselmis 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3achemical compounds 3afatty acid composition 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3ascreening 3awastewater treatment 0aMicroalgae 0aWastewater 0aNutrient removal 0aLipid 0aBiofuel1 aHoshikawa, Yumiko1 aNojima, Daisuke1 aYabu, Yusuke1 aMaeda, Yoshiaki1 aYoshino, Tomoko1 aTakano, Hiroyuki1 aTanaka, Tsuyoshi0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2020 May, v. 129, no. 5 p.565-572dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2019.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013900169300001800308520118900326592002801515650002101543650001501564650001901579650002301598650001301621650002001634650002001654650001101674650001901685650001801704650001101722650001901733650001401752650001801766650002001784650001301804650001501817650001201832650002701844650002101871653000901892653000801901653001101909653001401920653001801934653002001952653003001972700002002002700002402022700002002046700002002066700002702086700006102113700006502174700006802239773013302307856008502440852000902525655001202534IND60606409120221121162225.0180725e20180219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060640912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b007822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomin, Tamara10aDeletion of Adipose Triglyceride Lipase Links Triacylglycerol Accumulation to a More-Aggressive Phenotype in A549 Lung Carcinoma Cells  ap. 1415-1425.  aAdipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) catalyzes the rate limiting step in triacylglycerol breakdown in adipocytes but is expressed in most tissues. The enzyme was shown to be lost in many human tumors, and its loss may play a role in early stages of cancer development. Here, we report that loss of ATGL supports a more-aggressive cancer phenotype in a model system in which ATGL was deleted in A549 lung cancer cells by CRISPR/Cas9. We observed that loss of ATGL led to triacylglycerol accumulation in lipid droplets and higher levels of cellular phospholipid and bioactive lipid species (lyso- and ether-phospholipids). Label-free quantitative proteomics revealed elevated expression of the pro-oncogene SRC kinase in ATGL depleted cells, which was also found on mRNA level and confirmed on protein level by Western blot. Consistently, higher expression of phosphorylated (active) SRC (Y416 phospho-SRC) was observed in ATGL-KO cells. Cells depleted of ATGL migrated faster, which was dependent on SRC kinase activity. We propose that loss of ATGL may thus increase cancer aggressiveness by activation of pro-oncogenic signaling via SRC kinase and increased levels of bioactive lipids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadipocytes 3acarcinogenesis 3acatalytic activity 3adroplets 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype 3aphospholipids 3aprotein content 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atissues 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols 0aATGL 0aSRC 0acancer 0amigration 0alipid droplet 0atriacylglycerol 0aA549 lung carcinoma cells1 aFritz, Katarina1 aGindlhuber, Juergen1 aWaldherr, Linda1 aPucher, Bettina1 aThallinger, Gerhard G.1 aNomura, Daniel K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1614-83601 aSchittmayer, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3249-655X1 aBirner-Gruenberger, Ruth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3950-03120 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 Feb. 19, v. 17, no. 4 p.1415-1425dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b007823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245005900175300001600234520092600250592002801176650002201204650001301226650001601239650002001255650001101275653002201286653001501308653001001323653003101333653002901364653001001393653000801403653000801411653000901419653000801428653000901436653000801445653000701453653000801460653001001468653000901478653001001487700002301497700002901520700002301549773011301572856008601685852000901771655001201780IND60615739820221120032031.0181127e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061573982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Hesran, Corentin10aOperations scheduling for waste minimization: A review  ap. 211-226.  aThis article proposes a review on waste minimization at the operational level of production planning. After defining the research scope and the concept of waste minimization through scheduling, the state-of-the-art is presented. A classification based on environmental and scheduling criteria is proposed, which details the various types of scheduling problems encountered and groups them into different categories. Results show that despite having developed in the recent years, literature on waste-minimizing scheduling remains scarce and lacks a unified terminology. While research on energy-efficient scheduling has garnered a lot of attention, improving resource efficiency and reducing waste generation is also an important step towards a greener production. Thus, research perspectives for the inclusion of waste reduction concerns in scheduling are proposed based on the analysis of the literature classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3aplanning 3aterminology 3awaste reduction 3awastes 0aLiterature review 0aScheduling 0aWaste 0aMulticriteria optimization 0aManufacturing operations 0a1DCSP 0aB&B 0aCSP 0aICSP 0aILP 0aINLP 0aLCA 0aLP 0aLSP 0aMILFP 0aMILP 0aMINLP1 aLadier, Anne-Laure1 aBotta-Genoulaz, Valerie,1 aLaforest, Valérie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 206 p.211-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01900naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008400172300001400256520058800270592002800858650001200886650004300898650001400941650001000955650001100965650001400976650001600990650001401006650001901020650001601039651001301055653001601068653002401084653002601108653001301134653001501147653001201162700003101174700002801205700002301233773009501256856008201351852000901433655001201442IND60698747520221118200219.0210531e20120824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069874752DNAL7 a10.3897/phytokeys.16.28842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManoko, Mkabwa L.

However, selectivity has proven to be a bottleneck, causing repeated failures. Previously, we reported CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1), acting as a cell cycle negative regulator through interaction with CDK2. In the current report, we identified the CRIF1–CDK2 interaction interface by in silico studies and shortlisted interface inhibitors through virtual screening on CRIF1 using 40 678 drug-like compounds. These compounds were tested by cell proliferation assay, and four of these molecules were found to selectively inhibit the proliferation of osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, but do not affect normal bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC). A binding study reveals significant affinities of the inhibitors on CRIF1. More importantly, treatment of the OS cells with a combination of ionizing radiation (IR) and the best-performing inhibitors remarkably increased IR inhibition potential from 19.9% to 59.6%. This occurred by selectively promoting G2/M arrest and apoptosis related to CDK2 overactivation in OS cells but not in BMSC and was supported by significant CDK2 phosphorylation modifications. Knocking down of CRIF1 by siRNA treatment showed similar effects to the interface inhibitors. Together we substantiate the identification of novel lead molecules, which may provide a new treatment to overcome selectivity issues and enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, opening a conceptually novel strategy of CDK-targeting for different cancer types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3aionizing radiation 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteosarcoma 3aphosphorylation 3ascreening 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics1 aXiang, Yang1 aStephen, Preyesh1 aWu, Chun1 aLi, Tang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6622-94711 aLin, Sheng-Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9149-375X1 aLi, Zhongjun0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 141, no. 4 p.1420-1424dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b102073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245013200205300001600337520181500353592002802168596014402196650001802340650001802358650001502376650001202391650001302403650001802416650002402434650001002458650002302468650002602491650001502517650001402532650001802546650001202564700002302576700002002599700002102619700002202640773010602662856008202768852000902850655001202859IND60605591120221119173904.0220914e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060559112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-017-1134-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVecchi, Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7995-682714aThe Microbial Community of Tardigrades: Environmental Influence and Species Specificity of Microbiome Structure and Composition  ap. 467-481.  aSymbiotic associations of metazoans with bacteria strongly influence animal biology since bacteria are ubiquitous and virtually no animal is completely free from them. Tardigrades are micrometazoans famous for their ability to undergo ametabolic states (cryptobiosis) but very little information is available on potential microbial associations. We characterized the microbiomes of six limnoterrestrial tardigrade species belonging to several phylogenetic lines in tandem with the microbiomes of their respective substrates. The experimental design enabled us to determine the effects of both the environment and the host genetic background on the tardigrade microbiome; we were able to define the microbial community of the same species sampled from different environments, and the communities of different species from the same environment. Our 16S rRNA gene amplicon approach indicated that the tardigrade microbiome is species-specific and well differentiated from the environment. Tardigrade species showed a much lower microbial diversity compared to their substrates, with only one significant exception. Forty-nine common OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were classified into six bacterial phyla, while four common OTUs were unclassified and probably represent novel bacterial taxa. Specifically, the tardigrade microbiome appears dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Some OTUs were shared between different species from geographically distant samples, suggesting the associated bacteria may be widespread. Putative endosymbionts of tardigrades from the order Rickettsiales were identified. Our results indicated that like all other animals, tardigrades have their own microbiota that is different among species, and its assembly is determined by host genotype and environmental influences.  aPublisher supplied data  aPdR 2013 B1/01cPiano Nazionale Ricerche in Antartide (PNRA) - Ministero dell’Istruzione dell’Università e della Ricerca (MIUR), Italy 3aBacteroidetes 3aRickettsiales 3aTardigrada 3aanimals 3abacteria 3aendosymbionts 3aexperimental design 3agenes 3agenetic background 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3azoology1 aNewton, Irene L.G.1 aCesari, Michele1 aRebecchi, Lorena1 aGuidetti, Roberto0 tMicrobial ecology.g2018 Aug., v. 76, no. 2 p.467-481dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1134-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011100160300001400271520136600285592002801651650002101679650001301700650002201713650001301735650001401748653001301762653000901775653001301784653001401797653000901811653000901820700002301829700001301852700001601865700001701881700001701898700002301915773012301938856008302061852000902144655001202153IND60543187920221119050315.0190410e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054318792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Li10aLoqs depends on R2D2 to localize in D2 body-like granules and functions in RNAi pathways in silkworm cells  ap. 78-90.  aThe phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) has been found in various organisms. However, the proteins implicated in RNAi pathway in different species show distinct roles. Knowledge on the underlying mechanism of lepidopteron RNAi is quite lacking such as the roles of Loquacious (Loqs) and R2D2, the dsRNA-binding proteins in silkworm RNAi pathway. Here, we report that Loqs and R2D2 protein depletion affected efficiency of dsRNA-mediated RNAi pathway. Besides, Loqs was found to co-localize with Dicer2 to some specific cytoplasmic foci, which were looked like D2-bodies marked by R2D2 and Dicer2 in Fly cells, thereby calling the foci as D2 body-like granules. Using RNAi methods, Loqs was found to be the key protein in these granules, although R2D2 determined the localization of Loqs in D2 body-like granules. Interestingly, in the R2D2-depeted silkworm cells, the formation of processing bodies, another cytoplasmic foci, was affected. These data indicated R2D2 regulated these two kinds of cytoplasmic foci. Domain deletion analysis demonstrated that dsRBD 1 and 2 were required for Loqs in D2 body-like granules and dsRBD 2 and 3 were required for Loqs to interact with R2D2 and Ago1, respectively. Altogether, our observations provide important information for further study on D2 body-like granules, the newly found cytoplasmic foci in silkworm cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3agranules 3aprotein depletion 3aproteins 3asilkworms 0aSilkworm 0aRNAi 0aP-bodies 0aD2 bodies 0aR2D2 0aLoqs1 aTatsuke, Tsuneyuki1 aXu, Jian1 aLi, Zhiqing1 aMon, Hiroaki1 aLee, Jae Man1 aKusakabe, Takahiro0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2015 Sept., v. 64 p.78-90dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245010700207300001600314520205200330592002802382650001802410650001602428650001202444650002102456650001402477650001102491650001102502650002102513650002002534650001302554650001502567650002102582650001702603650001702620650002502637651001202662653002702674653001902701653002202720653002202742653001502764700001902779773010202798856008702900852000902987655001202996IND60556824420221122031233.0170713e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055682442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7930-893410aImpacts of compact growth and electric vehicles on future air quality and urban exposures may be mixed  ap. 148-158.  a‘Smart’ growth and electric vehicles are potential solutions to the negative impacts of worldwide urbanization on air pollution and health. However, the effects of planning strategies on distinct types of pollutants, and on human exposures, remain understudied. The goal of this work was to investigate the potential impacts of alternative urban designs for the area around Tampa, Florida USA, on emissions, ambient concentrations, and exposures to oxides of nitrogen (NOx), 1,3-butadiene, and benzene. We studied three potential future scenarios: sprawling growth, compact growth, and 100% vehicle fleet electrification with compact growth. We projected emissions in the seven-county region to 2050 based on One Bay regional visioning plan data. We estimated pollutant concentrations in the county that contains Tampa using the CALPUFF dispersion model. We applied residential population projections to forecast acute (highest hour) and chronic (annual average) exposure. The compact scenario was projected to result in lower regional emissions of all pollutants than sprawl, with differences of −18%, −3%, and −14% for NOx, butadiene, and benzene, respectively. Within Hillsborough County, the compact form also had lower emissions, concentrations, and exposures than sprawl for NOx (−16%/−5% for acute/chronic exposures, respectively), but higher exposures for butadiene (+41%/+30%) and benzene (+21%/+9%). The addition of complete vehicle fleet electrification to the compact scenario mitigated these in-county increases for the latter pollutants, lowering predicted exposures to butadiene (−25%/−39%) and benzene (−5%/−19%), but also resulted in higher exposures to NOx (+81%/+30%) due to increased demand on power plants. These results suggest that compact forms may have mixed impacts on exposures and health. ‘Smart’ urban designs should consider multiple pollutants and the diverse mix of pollutant sources. Cleaner power generation will also likely be needed to support aggressive adoption of electric vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abenzene 3achronic exposure 3aemissions 3ahumans 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen oxides 3aplanning 3apollutants 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aurbanization 3avehicles (equipment) 3aFlorida 0aAir pollution exposure 0aCompact growth 0aElectric vehicles 0aUrban air quality 0aUrban form1 aStuart, Amy L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 576 p.148-158dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245011300180300001600293500000900309520083500318592002801153650001501181650002101196650001501217650001701232650001301249650001601262650002301278650002601301650002001327650002001347650002101367650002301388773014701411856009601558852000901654655001201663IND60668528920221120200605.0191125e197905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066852892DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1979.03615995004300030039x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParfitt, R.

Infrared spectra of the wet phosphate-goethite complexes suggested that the binuclear bridging complex was present with all these phosphates over the whole range from low surface coverage to maximum surface coverage. Maximum adsorption was observed when Ca(H₂PO₄)₂ was used with 0.01M CaCl₂ as the supporting electrolyte. The adsorption isotherms with phosphate and fluoride (NaF) reached a maximum value which indicated that there were 460 to 480 µmol of reactive A type OH groups on geothite. There was no evidence for phosphate adsorbed in any other form than the surface bridging complex which is formed very rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalcium chloride 3adesorption 3aelectrolytes 3agoethite 3airon oxides 3airon oxyhydroxides 3amonocalcium phosphate 3aphosphoric acid 3asodium fluoride 3asodium phosphate 3asorption isotherms0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1979 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.623-625dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1979.03615995004300030039x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003200134024002200166024001900188024003500207024001200242040001800254100001900272245013400291506007600425506017300501520137200674592002802046596008302074506003702157650003802194650002802232650002702260650002102287650001402308650001202322650001502334650002002349650001402369650001302383650001002396700002402406700001802430700002402448700001902472773011902491856011402610856007902724956008502803961000902888852000902897655001202906IND60647247920221214225008.0190704e20180714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064724792DNAL7 a3530822aris7 a10113/64724792hdl7 a10.3390/insects90300832doi7 aPMC61654792pmcid7 a300119232pmid7 a10.3390/insects90300832chorus8 ans15715  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddesso, Karla10aInteraction of a Preventative Fungicide Treatment and Root Rot Pathogen on Ambrosia Beetle Attacks during a Simulated Flood Event  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aFlooding can increase tree susceptibility to root rot pathogens as well as attacks by ambrosia beetles attracted to stress-induced ethanol emissions. The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction of a preventative fungicide treatment and root infection with Phytophthora cinnamomi on ambrosia beetle attacks in flood stressed trees. A fungicide (Pageant&reg; Intrinsic&reg;) was evaluated in two flood trials using Eastern redbud and tulip poplar trees with treatments including the fungicide with or without pathogen or no fungicide with or without pathogen. Fungicide treated trees had fewer ambrosia beetle attacks, particularly in trees without P. cinnamomi co-infection. In a follow-up experiment, ethanol content was evaluated in flooded redbuds to determine if the fungicide treatment reduced stress-induced compounds. All flood stressed trees began producing ethanol within 24 h post flooding, regardless of fungicide treatment or P. cinnamomi infection. We conclude that pre-treatments of a fungicide can provide protection from ambrosia beetle attacks during an extreme flood event, but that protection is reduced if a root rot pathogen is also present. Additionally, rejection of fungicide treated trees was not related to the absence of ethanol, as the fungicide-treated plants released ethanol in quantities similar to non-treated trees.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCercis canadensis var. canadensis 3aLiriodendron tulipifera 3aPhytophthora cinnamomi 3aambrosia beetles 3aemissions 3aethanol 3afungicides 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3aroot rot 3atrees1 aBaysal-Gurel, Fulya1 aOliver, Jason1 aRanger, Christopher1 aO’Neal, Paul0 tInsects.g2018 July 14, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64724793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects90300833Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/353082.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245008300172300001800255500001900273500000900292520118000301592002801481650002201509650001901531650001301550650002101563650002501584650002801609650002001637650001201657650001301669650001301682650001001695650001001705700002301715700002101738773012401759856007901883852000901962655001201971IND60663715420221123003723.0191226e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066371542DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2003.15422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuente, Elba B. de la,10aWeed and Insect Communities in Wheat Crops with Different Management Practices  ap. 1542-1549.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aBiotic adjustments to changes in crop management practices are reflected in the presence or absence of weed and insect populations. The pattern of response and the causes that drive them are important to reveal the main factors involved in molding the structure of an agroecosystem and its dynamics. In this study, weed and insect communities were characterized in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops from the Rolling Pampas with different cropping histories. Surveys were performed in fields that were selected randomly from those located on highlands with typical Argiudol soils and cultivated with conventional tillage. Fields, weeds, and insects were classified with cluster analysis, and weed and insect associations were determined using agronomic variables with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The classification of the data resulted in six floristic groups and seven insect groups that characterized different weed and insect communities. Three weed and insect communities associated with the number of years with annual cropping after a pasture that lasted for several years, the duration of wheat crop cycle, and soybean as a preceding crop were identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagroecosystems 3aagronomy 3acluster analysis 3aconventional tillage 3acorrespondence analysis 3acrop management 3ainsects 3apastures 3asoybeans 3aweeds 3awheat1 aSuárez, Susana A.1 aGhersa, Claudio,0 tAgronomy journal.g2003 Nov., v. 95, no. 6 p.1542-1549dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2003.15423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013500166520205000301592002802351650005002379650001502429650001202444650001502456650002002471650001302491650001602504650001602520650001102536650002202547650001702569650001102586650000702597650000902604650001302613650001402626650001402640650002802654650001202682651001002694653001202704653002202716653002302738653001502761653001602776700002402792700002902816773012002845856008202965852000903047655001203056IND60777529720221120105144.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077752972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1007812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanikar, Latu10aGenesis of uranium containing groundwater in the Brahmaputra floodplain of Assam: Hydrogeochemistry and its associated health risk  aGroundwater uranium (U) content and the major hydrogeochemical processes were evaluated for six districts of Assam, lying mostly on the central and northern region of the Brahmaputra floodplain. A total of 504 groundwater samples were collected using the grid sampling technique. Uranium concentrations analysed using LED fluorimeter model LF-2a, ranged from below detection limit (BDL) to 13.5 μgL⁻¹. All the U concentrations were found to be well below the prescribed limits of AERB, WHO and USEPA. The highest groundwater U was recorded in a sample from Nagaon, a central Brahmaputra floodplain district. The SEM-EDX spectra of the sediment samples revealed geogenic presence of U in the floodplain. A comparative assessment between the relationships of U with other groundwater parameters revealed that shallow aquifers provided more feasibility for elemental interactions and hence more mobility of U species. The correlation statistics in shallow aquifers depicted the importance of alkalinity on U release and mobilization. Uranium release during weathering of the geological strata was signified by the relationship of U with EC, TDS and salinity. The role played by pH and ORP in dissolution of U in the floodplain was not strong. The dominant water type in the study was Mg–HCO₃, which was associated with higher U concentration. This revealed the positive role of carbonate dissolution towards U release in the floodplain. Hydrogeochemical investigation further implied for greater silicate weathering and ion exchange compared to that of carbonate weathering and reverse ion exchange processes. The calculated undersaturation of calcite, dolomite and gypsum explained their role as source minerals in the floodplain. Uranium dissolution and mobilization was found to have positive association with carbonate weathering, as depicted by its significant relationship with calcite, dolomite and gypsum. Health risk, both radiological and chemical, relating to U ingestion through drinking water was absent within the floodplain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aalkalinity 3acalcite 3acarbonates 3adetection limit 3adolomite 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3agypsum 3ahydrogeochemistry 3aion exchange 3amodels 3apH 3arisk 3asalinity 3asediments 3asilicates 3asustainable development 3auranium 3aIndia 0aUranium 0aHydrogeochemistry 0aMineral saturation 0aWeathering 0aHealth risk1 aGogoi, Rashmi Rekha1 aŚarma, Kālī Prasāda,0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2022 Aug., v. 18 p.100781-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1007813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014200173300001600315520176800331592002802099650001902127650002702146650002902173650001402202650001902216650001002235650002702245650001502272650003702287650001702324650002602341650001302367650002002380653001602400653002102416653001502437653000902452653002702461653002002488700002102508773009602529856008402625852000902709655001202718IND60563667720221119031117.0170713e20160603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056366772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2016.04.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrison, Shane A.10aCalibration of nylon organic chemical integrative samplers and sentinel samplers for quantitative measurement of pulsed aquatic exposures  ap. 109-117.  aEnvironmental exposures often occur through short, pulsed events; therefore, the ability to accurately measure these toxicologically-relevant concentrations is important. Three different integrative passive sampler configurations were evaluated under different flow and pulsed exposure conditions for the measurement of current-use pesticides (n=19), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (n=10), and personal care products (n=5) spanning a broad range of hydrophobicities (log Kow 1.5–7.6). Two modified POCIS-style samplers were investigated using macroporous nylon mesh membranes (35μm pores) and two different sorbent materials (i.e. Oasis HLB and Dowex Optipore L-493). A recently developed design, the Sentinel Sampler (ABS Materials), utilizing Osorb media enclosed within stainless steel mesh (145μm pores), was also investigated. Relatively high sampling rates (Rs) were achieved for all sampler configurations during the short eight-day exposure (4300–27mL/d). Under flow conditions, median Rs were approximately 5–10 times higher for POCIS-style samplers and 27 times higher for Sentinel Samplers, as compared to static conditions. The ability of samplers to rapidly measure hydrophobic contaminants may be a trade off with increased flow dependence. Analyte accumulation was integrative under pulsed and continuous exposures for POCIS-style samplers with mean difference between treatments of 11% and 33%; however, accumulation into Sentinel Samplers was more variable. Collectively, results show that reducing membrane limitations allows for rapid, integrative accumulation of a broad range of analytes even under pulsed exposures. As such, these sampler designs may be suitable for monitoring environmental substances that have short aquatic half-lives.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahalf life 3ahydrophobicity 3anylon 3apersonal care products 3apesticides 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aporous media 3aquantitative analysis 3asamplers 3astainless steel 0aCalibration 0aPassive sampling 0aPesticides 0aPAHs 0aPersonal care products 0aPulsed exposure1 aBelden, Jason B.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 June 03, v. 1449 p.109-117dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.04.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014100167300001600308520173500324592002802059650001202087650001202099650001202111650001502123650002202138650001902160650001702179650001602196650001502212650001202227651001502239651001202254653003702266653002202303653001402325653002902339700001602368700001602384700001702400700001302417700001802430700001502448773011302463856008402576852000902660655001202669IND60605479820221118232310.0180721e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060547982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jinjuan10aInterference of natural and anthropogenic forcings on variations in continental freshwater discharge from the Red River (Vietnam) to sea  ap. 133-142.  aContinental freshwater discharge is vital to global human development. Intensive studies have been conducted on changes of river discharge around the world (Dai et al., 2009; Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011). However, little work has been carried out on the daily continental freshwater discharge of the Red River in response to influence of the natural and anthropogenic forcings. This paper presents results of change analysis of daily continental freshwater discharge over the period 1956–2009 in the Red River. The wavelet analysis results showed observable periodicities in the continental freshwater discharge series with 4–6 months, 8–12 months, 1.5–2 years, and 4–7 years (48–80 months), respectively. The results from Mann–Kendall test indicated insignificant trends in annual continental freshwater discharge during the study period, but there is clearly decrease in annual suspended particulate matter of the Red River. It is shown that the continental freshwater discharge from the Red River was dominated by precipitation over the catchments. Moreover, changes in the continental freshwater discharge are closely related to SASM (the South Asia Summer Monsoon) and ENSO (EI Niño Southern Oscillation). Variations in daily discharge are lagged behind SASM 13–29 days. It revealed that El Niño and La Niña events are likely to induce extreme low and extreme high continental freshwater discharge from the Red River into the Tokin Gulf, respectively. Meanwhile, continental freshwater discharge from the Red River into the Tonkin Gulf experienced abrupt changes with present characteristics as ‘no flood in the flood season, no drought in the drought season’ due to water regulation induced by dam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3adrought 3afreshwater 3ahuman development 3amonsoon season 3aparticulates 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3awavelet 3aSouth Asia 3aVietnam 0aContinental freshwater discharge 0aExtreme condition 0aRed River 0aAnthropogenic activities1 aDai, Zhijun1 aMei, Xuefei1 aGe, Zhenpeng1 aWei, Wen1 aXie, Hualiang1 aLi, Shushi0 tQuaternary international.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 380-381 p.133-142dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010700171300001200278520143800290592002801728650002301756650002601779650001201805650002201817650002101839650001401860650001001874650001301884650001301897650001101910650003001921650001401951650002301965650001301988650002402001650001502025650001802040650001202058650001502070650002102085650002102106650002702127650001302154650001702167653001402184653000702198653001002205653000802215653001302223653001302236653003702249653002102286653002202307700002202329700002602351700002202377700001802399773011102417856008402528852000902612655001202621IND60541423220221121015208.0190318e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054142322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2014.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyamoto, Kensuke10aHormonal regulation of gummosis and composition of gums from bulbs of hyacinth (Hyacinthus orientalis)  ap. 1-4.  aHyacinth (Hyacinthus orientalis) bulbs infected by Fusarium oxysporum showed the symptoms of gummosis. The purpose of this study was to clarify the hormonal regulation of gummosis and composition of gums from hyacinth bulbs. The application of ethephon (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid), an ethylene-releasing compound, at 2% (w/w, in lanolin) induced gummosis in hyacinth bulbs. Methyl jasmonate (JA-Me) at 1.5% (w/w, in lanolin) induced gummosis as well. Simultaneous application of JA-Me and ethephon further enhanced gummosis. Molecular mass distribution of hyacinth gums analyzed by gel permeation chromatography indicated that the gums were mainly homogenous polysaccharides with an average molecular weight of ca. 30kDa. Analysis of the sugar composition of the gums after hydrolysis revealed that the majority were arabinose (ca. 35%) and galactose (ca. 40%) together with small amounts of fucose, rhamnose and uronic acids (ca. 5%, respectively), suggesting that the gums are pectic arabinogalactans. These results indicate that jasmonates (JAs) interact with ethylene to stimulate sugar metabolism, producing pectic arabinogalactans, and vice versa, leading to gummosis. These findings, together with those from our previous studies in tulips (Tulipa gesneriana) and grape hyacinth (Muscari armeniacum), revealed that sugar metabolism and hormonal regulation relating to gummosis are different among species of bulbous plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aHyacinthus orientalis 3aMuscari 3aTulipa gesneriana 3aarabinogalactans 3aarabinose 3abulbs 3aethephon 3aethylene 3afucose 3afungal diseases of plants 3agalactose 3agel chromatography 3agummosis 3ahormonal regulation 3ahydrolysis 3ajasmonic acid 3alanolin 3ametabolism 3amethyl jasmonate 3amolecular weight 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arhamnose 3auronic acids 0aHPAEC-PAD 0aJA 0aJA-Me 0aJAs 0aEthylene 0aGummosis 0aHyacinth (Hyacinthus orientalis) 0aMethyl jasmonate 0aSugar composition1 aKotake, Toshihisa1 aBoncela, Anna Jarecka1 aSaniewski, Marian1 aUeda, Junichi0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 174 p.1-4dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2014.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014200156300001600298500002000314520167400334592002802008650002002036650001902056650002202075650001502097650002102112650001602133650001102149650002502160650002102185650000702206650001602213650000902229650003002238650001102268650003702279700001302316700001502329700001502344700001602359700001502375700001202390700001802402700001702420700001902437773013802456856007502594852000902669655001202678IND60788463320221118162613.0220814e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078846332DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.202292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Junqing10aEffects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis on microbial diversity and enzyme activities in the rhizosphere soil of Artemisia annua  ap. 703-716.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe explored the influence of symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on rhizosphere‐soil microecology and its relationship with the artemisinin content in Artemisia annua (Artemisia annua L.). Three treatment groups were established: A. annua in symbiosis with Funneliformis mosseae, A. annua in symbiosis with Glomus versiforme, and A. annua without AMF symbiosis as a blank control. The nutrient content, pH, microbial density, activity, diversity, and evenness as well as the urease, acid phosphatase, and sucrase activities of A. annua rhizosphere soil and the relative artemisinin content in A. annua in the absence and presence of AMF symbiosis were measured and analyzed at four stages: T1 (rosette stage, 30 d after transplanting), T2 (growth stage, 70 d after transplanting), T3 (mature stage, 90 d after transplanting), and T4 (harvest stage, 120 d after transplanting). The results showed that AMF symbiosis increased the activities of urease, acid phosphatase, and sucrase in the rhizosphere soil of A. annua; promoted the absorption and utilization of N and P; increased the relative content of artemisinin in the aboveground parts of A. annua; and improved the utilization of various carbon sources by rhizosphere microorganisms to some extent. In addition, AMF also improved the density, quantity. and diversity of microorganisms in the A. annua rhizosphere. Different AMF had different effects on A. annua. The results showed that AMF symbiosis improved the absorption and utilization of soil nutrients by A. annua and increased its relative artemisinin content. These results may provide a theoretical basis for the production of A. annua.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia annua 3aGlomus mosseae 3aGlomus versiforme 3aabsorption 3aacid phosphatase 3aartemisinin 3acarbon 3adevelopmental stages 3anutrient content 3apH 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3aurease 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aMa, Yuan1 aWei, Zhuli1 aWu, Jiemin1 aSun, Chenyu1 aYang, Juan1 aLiu, Lu1 aLiao, Honglin1 aChen, Tingsu1 aHuang, Jinghua0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2021 May, v. 85, no. 3 p.703-716dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.202293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012000160300001600280520127700296592002801573650002401601650001201625650001301637650001601650650001601666650001501682650001501697650001301712650001201725650001001737650001701747700001701764700001701781700001501798700001901813773011801832856007301950852000902023655001202032IND60340825620221121141105.0150809e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034082562DNAL7 a10.1111/gfs.121312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaslgrübler, P.10aInfluence of different storage conditions on quality characteristics of seed material from semi‐natural grassland  ap. 549-556.  aNeither methodology nor guidelines are available for defining quality characteristics and storage conditions of seed material harvested from semi‐natural grassland. Seeds from an Arrhenatherion meadow were harvested via on‐site threshing and seed stripping. After determination of purity, thousand seed weight and pre‐tests in a phytotron, germination‐capacity trials were carried out in a greenhouse. The harvested seed material was stored for up to 3 years under different conditions: (i) room temperature 18–23°C, (ii) cooling chamber (2–5°C with 40–50% humidity) and (iii) freezer (−18°C). There was a significant impact of the tested harvesting methods on seed separation, thousand seed weight and purity, but not on the germination capacity. Different storage conditions and storage length significantly influenced the germination capacity. There were also generally higher germination values for the seed‐stripping material than the on‐site threshing material (ca. 70 and 60%, respectively, in the first year). Germination capacity decreased significantly with time and was <15% after 3 years. We conclude that harvested seed material from semi‐natural grassland should preferably be stored under cool conditions and used within 2 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acooling 3afreezers 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3aguidelines 3aharvesting 3ahumidity 3ameadows 3aseeds 3astorage time1 aKrautzer, B.1 aBlaschka, A.1 aGraiss, W.1 aPötsch, E.

Hydric soils are identified in the field by examining morphological characteristics, including organic matter accumulation and redoximorphic features that form in response to prolonged periods of saturation and anaerobic conditions. The Hydric Soil Technical Standard (HSTS) was developed to provide a quantitative procedure for evaluating the hydric status of a soil based upon direct measurements of saturation, anaerobic conditions, and precipitation normality. In practice, the HSTS is used for (a) identifying hydric soils when a field indicator of hydric soils may not be present (e.g., naturally problematic or disturbed soils); (b) evaluating the current functional hydric status of a soil; (c) developing new field indicators of hydric soils; and (d) proposing changes to existing field indicators of hydric soils. The HSTS procedures have progressed over several decades with new approaches to soil analysis, including novel methods to document anaerobic conditions. The following review describes the development of the hydric soils concept and provides guidance for measuring each HSTS component. Practical approaches for collection and submission of HSTS data to the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils, the group responsible for approving approaches to hydric soil identification in the United States, are also discussed. Expanding the understanding and application of the HSTS promotes technical accuracy, transparency, and efficient decision making in support of hydric soil and wetland resource management.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydric soils 3aorganic matter 3aresource management 3asoil analysis 3awetlands1 aVepraskas, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2298-95721 aVaughan, Karen L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9787-27661 aVasilas, Lenore M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2021 May, v. 85, no. 3 p.469-487dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.202023Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/NRCS  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013800171300001600309520139700325592002801722650001601750650003201766650002401798650000901822650001701831650002401848650002001872653001101892653002301903653004601926653001101972653001201983653002101995700001902016700001902035700002402054700002302078700002202101773011002123856008302233852000902316655001202325IND60535184320221121232451.0190411e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053518432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChartier, Marie A.10aPancreas-specific lipase concentrations and amylase and lipase activities in the peritoneal fluid of dogs with suspected pancreatitis  ap. 385-389.  aDiagnosing acute pancreatitis in the dog can be challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of pancreas-specific lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI), and the activities of amylase and lipase, in the peritoneal fluid from a population of dogs diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based on clinical signs, ultrasonographic findings and serum cPLI concentrations. In a prospective study, cPLI concentrations, and amylase and lipase activities, were measured in the peritoneal fluid of 14 dogs with pancreatitis and 19 dogs with non-pancreatic disease.The sensitivity and specificity of peritoneal fluid cPLI concentration (cut-off value 500 µg/L) were 100.0% (95% confidence interval, CI, 80.7–100.0%) and 94.7% (95% CI 76.7–99.7%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of peritoneal fluid amylase (cut-off value 1050 U/L) and lipase activities (cut-off value 500 U/L) were 71.4% (95% CI 44.5–90.2%) and 84.2% (95% CI 62.8–95.8%) for amylase activity, and 92.9% (95% CI 69.5–99.6%) and 94.7% (95% CI 76.7–99.7%) for lipase activity, respectively. In conclusion, peritoneal fluid cPLI concentration was highly sensitive as a complementary diagnostic tool in a group of dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis. Peritoneal fluid lipase activity was not as sensitive as cPLI concentration, but may also support a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aconfidence interval 3adogs 3apancreatitis 3aprospective studies 3aultrasonography 0aCanine 0aAcute pancreatitis 0aPancreas-specific lipase immunoreactivity 0aLipase 0aAmylase 0aPeritoneal fluid1 aHill, Steve L.1 aSunico, Sarena1 aSuchodolski, Jan S.1 aRobertson, Jane E.1 aSteiner, Joerg M.0 tveterinary journal.g2014 Sept., v. 201, no. 3 p.385-389dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245006000170300001400230506002800244520169000272592002801962506003701990650002802027650002402055650001502079650001002094650001002104650001202114650001302126650002402139650002002163650002102183650001202204650001002216653001902226653001202245653001502257653002402272700001702296700002102313773015102334856008402485852000902569655001202578IND60774485120221207112450.0160624e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077448512DNAL7 a10.15408/kauniyah.v8i2.26922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukandar, Paskal10aKomunitas Burung di Pulau Tidung Kecil Kepulauan Seribu  ap. 66-76.  aResource is Open Access  aTidung Kecil Island had potential as bird’s habitat because the condition of forest better than Tidung Besar.

The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases under stress conditions and causes cell oxidative damage. This study investigated the effect of sodium nitroprusside [a nitric oxide (NO) donor] treatment on drought stress in two turfgrass species, creeping bentgrass and tall fescue. Physiological characteristics such as relative water content (RWC), ion leakage, chlorophyll and proline content, and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) were evaluated after 40 d drought stress and in the recovery stage. Results showed that nitric oxide (NO) treatment, especially 150 μm, could maintain significantly higher RWC and reduce ion leakage under drought stress conditions in both species. Furthermore, both turfgrass species showed higher chlorophyll and proline content after drought stress period when sprayed with NO, while chlorophyll and proline content of control plants declined. Drought stress significantly reduced SOD and APX activity, while NO treatment induced higher SOD and APX activity under drought conditions. After recovery, leaf RWC returned to the control level; however, NO‐sprayed plants showed higher RWC compared to controls. Both turfgrass species exhibited lower chlorophyll content at the recovery stage when exposed to severe drought stress, and NO application increased chlorophyll content compared to controls. No significant differences were found between NO treatment and control plants for proline and SOD activity, but APX activity of NO‐sprayed plants was higher than in the control plants. These results suggest that foliar application of NO may alleviate drought stress in turfgrass by maintaining membrane stability and inducing antioxidant enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar application 3aleaves 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3aproline 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aturf grasses 3awater content 3awater stress1 aMolaahmad Nalousi, A.1 aGhasemnezhad, M.1 aBiglouei, M.

Moreover, despite of its relevancy in crop responsiveness to elevated CO2 conditions, plant level C balance is a topic that, comparatively, has received little attention. In order to test responsiveness of grapevine photosynthetic apparatus to predicted climate change conditions, grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo) fruit-bearing cuttings were exposed to different CO2 (elevated, 700ppm vs. ambient, ca. 400ppm), temperature (ambient vs. elevated, ambient +4°C) and irrigation levels (partial vs. full irrigation). Carbon balance was followed monitoring net photosynthesis (AN, C gain), respiration (RD) and photorespiration (RL) (C losses). Modification of environment 13C isotopic composition (δ13C) under elevated CO2 (from −10.30 to −24.93‰) enabled the further characterization of C partitioning into roots, cuttings, shoots, petioles, leaves, rachides and berries. Irrespective of irrigation level and temperature, exposure to elevated CO2 induced photosynthetic acclimation of plants. C/N imbalance reflected the inability of plants grown at 700ppm CO2 to develop strong C sinks. Partitioning of labeled C to storage organs (main stem and roots) did not avoid accumulation of labeled photoassimilates in leaves, affecting negatively Rubisco carboxylation activity. The study also revealed that, after 20 days of treatment, no oxidative damage to chlorophylls or carotenoids was observed, suggesting a protective role of CO2 either at current or elevated temperatures against the adverse effect of water stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aacclimation 3aadverse effects 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acarboxylation 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3adrought 3agreenhouses 3airrigation rates 3amonitoring 3apetioles 3aphotorespiration 3aprotective effect 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aroots 3ashoots 3asmall fruits 3astorage organs 3atemperature 3awater stress 0aAN 0aChl 0aCi 0aDW 0aE 0aEEA 0aETR 0aFW 0agS 0aHI 0aJmax 0aPAR 0aPI 0aPPFD 0aPSI 0aPSII 0aqP 0aRD 0aRL 0aROS 0aRWC 0aRuBP 0aTamb 0aTGG 0aTOM 0aTW 0aT+4 0aVcmax 0aVPDB 0aWI 0aWSC 0aδ13C 0aΦPSII 0aΦexc. 0aCarbon balance 0aClimate change 0aGrapevine 0aPhotosynthesis1 aAranjuelo, Iker1 aPascual, Inmaculada1 aErice, Gorka1 aSanz-Sáez, Álvaro1 aAguirreolea, Jone1 aSánchez Díaz, Manuel,1 aIrigoyen, Juan José1 aAraus, José Luis,1 aMorales, Fermín0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 174 p.97-109dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2014.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012300167300002000290520101700310592002801327650002201355650003701377650001201414650001401426650002001440650001101460650001101471650001201482650001401494650001701508650001601525700001701541700002901558700002301587700002201610700006401632773017201696856008001868852000901948655001201957IND60648120920221118070954.0190626e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064812092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b011442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakare, Idris A.10aOxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene over VOₓ on Mixed θ-Al₂O₃/Alkaline Earth Metal Oxide Supports  ap. 10785-10792.  aThe oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with solid-phase oxygen of VOₓ-based mixed-oxide catalysts is investigated. The catalysts are prepared by depositing VOₓ species on alkaline-oxide-modified θ-Al₂O₃ supports. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the nature and variations of the crystalline phases. The surface area, acidity, and reduction properties of the catalysts are functions of the innate properties of bare θ-Al₂O₃ and the characteristic properties of each alkaline oxide. The multistage reduction of VOₓ on mixed-oxide supports indicates the reduction of various VOₓ species. The catalysts are evaluated in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator by injecting a known amount of propane at different reaction temperatures. All catalysts show excellent propane conversion and plausible selectivity to olefins. VOₓ on θ-Al₂O₃/CaO minimizes the formation of COₓ species, whereas VOₓ θ-Al₂O₃/BaO displays the highest olefin yields (49%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacidity 3acatalysts 3adehydrogenation 3aolefin 3aoxygen 3apropane 3apropylene 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aAdamu, Sagir1 aQamaruddīn, Muḥammad,1 aAl-Bogami, Saad A.1 aAl-Ghamdi, Sameer1 aHossain, Mohammad M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7780-59100 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 May 29, v. 58, no. 25 p.10785-10792dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b011443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011500164300001600279520074200295592002801037650001601065650001601081650001501097650001401112650001601126653002001142653001701162653001101179653001901190653002101209653000901230700002301239700001901262773013201281856007901413852000901492655001201501IND60761853820221120060330.0220104s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076185382DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2021-05502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotley, Sean R.10aInitial stay times for uncompensable occupational heat stress in young and older men: a preliminary assessment  ap. 110-113.  aDuring uncompensable occupational heat stress, heat-mitigation controls are required to prevent core temperature exceeding recommended limits (≥38 °C).

In order to test the effect of soil SO₄-S concentrations on N response, five stands of Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, with low to moderate quantities of SO₄-S in the mineral soil horizon were treated with N and with N plus S. Sulfate-S concentrations varied among soils from 6.0 to 19.2 mg S kg⁻¹ in the surface soil and from 6.0 to 78.7 mg S kg⁻¹ in the subsoil. Three treatments were applied: control, 224 kg N ha⁻¹ as urea, and 224 kg N ha⁻¹ plus 112 kg S ha⁻¹ as a mixture of urea and (NH₄)₂SO₄. Adjusted gross volume growth responses to N alone averaged −1.63 to 6.26 m³ ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ after 3 to 4 yr; average volume growth gains from application of N with S over application of N alone varied from 0.73 to 4.5 m³ ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ at four locations. At one location, the N-alone effect was greater than that from N with S. Foliar N concentrations in the N-with-S treatments were generally higher than in the N-alone treatments. Little change in foliar-S content occurred in the N-with-S plots. Mean treatment effects were unrelated to foliar N/S, total S, or foliar SO₄-S on the controls, and the relationship between soil SO₄-S and the differential growth response between N and N with S was highly variable. Treatments were reapplied at a rate of 448 kg N ha⁻¹, 224 kg S ha⁻¹, and 9 kg B ha⁻¹. Four-year growth effects were similar to the first period except at one location where N responses appeared greatly improved by B. Periodic annual growth response to N over the entire study period was inversely related to site index and directly related to foliar N content. Prescriptions involving S will require more efficient S sources and a better assessment of S uptake and S reactions in these soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aammonium sulfate 3aconiferous forests 3afertilizer application 3amineral soils 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asite index 3asoil horizons 3asubsoil 3asulfur 3asulfur fertilizers 3aurea1 aChappell, H.

The high levels of hard seed decreased the seedling densities of biserrula in the second year, while were at highest levels in the third year after the plots were cropped to wheat. A further experiment was conducted to study the interaction between spray‐topping and seed set. This study showed subterranean clover seed yields were more tolerant to herbicides than a number of biserrula genotypes. There were significant responses to the herbicides within the biserrula genotypes, and 95GCN59 was less affected. The rhizobium experiment showed a strong host strain/interaction and has emphasized the importance of simultaneous breeding and selection of plant germplasm run in parallel with the selection of elite strains of rhizobia such as WSM1497 to optimize nitrogen fixation.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm 3acultivars 3anitrogen fixation 3aBiserrula pelecinus 3aseedlings 3aherbicides 3awheat 3aagronomic traits 3agenotype 3asummer 3aseed yield 3aseed set 3aWestern Australia 0abreeding1 aFranca, A.1 aNutt, B.

Recent evidence suggests that plastids also can carry out macroautophagy. The double membrane at the surface of plastids apparently invaginates, forming an intraplastidial space. This space contains a portion of cytoplasm that apparently becomes degraded. Here we report, in Tillandsia sp. and Aechmaea sp., the presence of almost square or diamond-shaped crystalloids inside what seems the intraplastidial space of autophagous plastids. The same type of crystalloids were observed in chloroplasts and other plastids, but were not found in the cytoplasm or the vacuole. Peroxisomes contained smaller and more irregularly shaped crystalloids compared to the ones observed in ‘autophagous’ plastids. It is hypothesized that plastids are able to sequester chloroplasts and other plastids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTillandsia 3achloroplasts 3aperoxisomes 3avacuoles 0aApparent autophagous plastid 0aCrystalloids 0aPlastids 0aOvary 0aPeroxisomes1 avan Doorn, Wouter G.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 174 p.36-40dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2014.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017700170300001600347520096400363592002801327650002301355650001301378650001401391650003401405650003301439650002101472650001101493653001601504653002001520653001101540653002101551653000801572700001901580700002101599773007101620856008401691852000901775655001201784IND60087222820221117230957.0161023e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008722282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2012.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzyurt, Nurcan14aThe morphology and histology of the male reproductive system in Dolycoris baccarum Linnaeus 1758 (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae)—Light and scanning electron micoscope studies  ap. 101-106.  aThe male reproductive system of Dolycoris baccarum (Linnaeus 1758) is studied morphologically and histologically using both light and scanning electron microscopes (SEM). The reproductive system of the male D. baccarum consists of a pair of testis, a pair of vas deferens, a pair of seminal vesicles, accessory glands (mesadenia, ectadenia), a bulbus ejaculatorius, a pair of ectodermal sacs, and a ductus ejaculatorius. The number of testicular follicles varies from four to six. The testicular follicles have three different development zones (growth zone, maturation zone, differentiation zone). The testes are connected to the seminal vesicles by the vas deferens. Vas deferens and seminal vesicles, which are fine-long and cylindrical. The seminal vesicle is connected with bulbus ejaculatorius which is balloon-shaped and surrounded with accessory glands. The bulbus ejaculatorius is continuous with ductus ejaculatorius which connected to the aedeagus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDolycoris baccarum 3aaedeagus 3ahistology 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseminal vesicles 3atestes 0aSpermatozoa 0aSpermatogenesis 0aTestes 0aAccessory glands 0aSEM1 aCandan, Selami1 aSuludere, Zekiye0 tMicron.g2013 Jan., v. 44 p.101-106dElsevier Ltdx0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2012.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245004500180300001400225500000900239520108200248592002801330650001301358650001201371650002701383650001201410650001101422650001401433650001101447650002001458650001401478650001501492650001301507650001601520773014601536856009601682852000901778655001201787IND60668529320221120200614.0191125e196501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066852932DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1965.03615995002900010010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawhney, B.

An ionexchange equation was used to predict the sorption of Cs from dilute solutions. Exchange isotherms showed that the sorption of Cs by the resin followed these predictions: Exchange isotherms were straight lines with unit slope. Sorption of Cs by clay minerals, however, did not follow these predictions except when K⁺ was the competing cation. When Ca²⁺ and Al³⁺ were the competing cations, the exchange isotherms for montmorillonite were straight lines with less than unit slope, showing that a larger proportion of Cs was sorbed with decreased Cs concentrations. The exchange isotherms of illite and vermiculite, on the other hand, had at least two distinct slopes suggesting that more than one type of exchange site is involved in the sorption of Cs by these minerals. These conclusions were also supported by estimates of the equilibrium constants calculated from Vanselow's equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acation exchange resins 3acations 3acesium 3aequations 3aillite 3amontmorillonite 3apotassium 3aprediction 3asorption 3avermiculite0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1965 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.25-28dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1965.03615995002900010010x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245009600180300001400276520168700290592002801977650002202005650005302027650002302080650001902103650001002122650002302132650002302155650002002178650002102198650002302219650001102242650002402253650001402277650002302291650001402314650003202328650004102360650001902401650000902420650001902429650002302448650001102471650000902482651001102491653001902502653002702521653000902548653000802557653000802565653000802573700004502581700002902626700003702655700002702692773010702719856008902826852000902915655001202924IND60112058820221121021832.0190410e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011205882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Samuel Julio10aBiological control of bacterial wilt of common bean by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  ap. 65-71.  aBacterial wilt (BW) caused by Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens (Cff) is an emerging, seed-transmitted disease of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in Brazil, and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have the potential to be used in disease management. The present work aimed at determining the potential of selected PGPR on the biological control of BW through seed treatment, growth promotion and induced resistance. Bean seeds cv. ‘Pérola’ were artificially inoculated with Cff, immersed in a PGPR suspension, and sown in 4L pots containing a soil: sand mixture (2:1). Plants were assessed for seedling emergence (SE), speed emergence index (SEI), relative growth index (RGI), root dry weight (RDW), shoot dry weight (SDW), as well as biochemical plant responses in the presence or absence of Cff. The disease control ranged from 42% to 76%, respectively, for Bacillus subtilis UFLA285 and ALB629 compared to the untreated control. PGPR treatments also increased RGI, SDW, and RDW. Upon Cff inoculation, UFLA285 increased phenolics’ content and ALB629 in the lignin accumulation compared to the untreated control. Without the pathogen inoculation, both PGPR promoted an increase in phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity and total phenolics content and UFLA285 in the lignin accumulation. Our findings demonstrated the potential of selected PGPR for disease control, enhancement of the RGI and biomass accumulation. Surprisingly, instead of a priming effect of PGPR, Cff apparently blocks the defense response development although the overall phenotype is disease control, suggesting there is a complementary and/or compensatory mode of action involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCurtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abacterial wilt 3abeans 3abiological control 3abiomass production 3adisease control 3agrowth promotion 3ainduced resistance 3alignin 3amechanism of action 3apathogens 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenotype 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant response 3asand 3aseed treatment 3aseedling emergence 3ashoots 3asoil 3aBrazil 0aSeed treatment 0aResistance suppression 0aPGPR 0aISR 0aPOX 0aPAL1 ade Medeiros, Flavio Henrique Vasconcelos1 ade Souza, Ricardo Magela1 ade Resende, Mário Lúcio Vilela1 aRibeiro, Pedro Martins0 tBiological control.g2013 July, v. 66, no. 1 p.65-71dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245011400176300001600290520093800306592002801244650002301272650001401295650003101309650001501340650002101355653001601376653002001392653001601412653002001428653002801448653001301476773010901489856008901598852000901687655001201696IND60112058920221121021937.0190410e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011205892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSan-Blas, Ernesto10aProgress on entomopathogenic nematology research: A bibliometric study of the last three decades: 1980–2010  ap. 102-124.  aEntomopathogenic nematodes have achieved a place in biological control programmes because of their effectiveness, speed of action, innocuousness to non-insect targets and simplicity of mass production. However many challenges derived due to the lack of knowledge in some critical steps from laboratories to their use in the fields, have to be resolved in order to improve their performance and to reduce the mass production costs. For those reasons, studies on entomopathogenic nematology have increased considerably in the last few decades. Also, there have been important changes in the ways that results are published; many of them relate to major transformations in scientific trends. Using bibliometric tools we characterize variations in number, types of journal, countries of origin, research topics and the number of participating countries, of 1923 papers (from 1980 to 2010) reported in several on-line editorial databases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological control 3adatabases 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3anematology 3aproduction costs 0aSteinernema 0aHeterorhabditis 0aPublication 0aScientiometrics 0aCoauthorship networking 0aDatabase0 tBiological control.g2013 Aug., v. 66, no. 2 p.102-124dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245014100163300001500304520118700319592002801506650001401534650002301548650001101571650000901582650001101591650001401602650001301616650003101629650001801660650001101678650001301689650001201702650001301714650001001727651001601737700001901753700002301772773014001795856008001935852000902015655001202024IND60761854020221123042629.0220104s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076185402DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2019-04482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolub, Rachel12aA management-scale investigation of consistent individual differences in behaviour and trapping bias in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus)  ap. 97-110.  aThe sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is invasive in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Trapping in large rivers could suppress sea lamprey recruitment by removing migrating adults prior to spawning. Currently, the proportion of sea lamprey trapped (efficiency) is too low for control purposes, possibly because trapping is biased toward certain behavioural types. We tested if individual differences in time to enter a novel environment (risk-taking) and proportion of time moving (activity) under standardized laboratory conditions were correlated with time to encounter and enter a trap in the field. 638 sea lamprey were tagged, assessed for risk-taking and activity in sequential trials, and released in the river to be trapped. In the laboratory, individuals differed consistently in risk-taking and activity behaviours, and more active individuals entered a simulated trap sooner than less active individuals. In the field, however, the times to first trap encounter, and capture in a trap, were not correlated with risk-taking or activity. Our study provides a novel demonstration of how patterns from small-scale behavioural studies may not extend to management-scale applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanadians 3aPetromyzon marinus 3aadults 3abias 3afields 3afisheries 3ajournals 3alaboratory experimentation 3arisk behavior 3arivers 3aspawning 3atesting 3atrapping 3atraps 3aGreat Lakes1 aBravener, Gale1 aMcLaughlin, Robert0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2022, v. 79, no. 1 p.97-110dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2019-04483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014100166300001600307506010400323506007600427520165900503592002802162506003702190650002302227650001502250650001502265650001502280650001502295650002302310653003002333653002302363653002502386653002402411700002002435700005702455700006202512773010402574856008502678852000902763655001202772IND60777530520221207115559.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077753052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlye, Karen12aA comparison of a home parenteral nutrition service with the current European (ESPEN) guidelines on chronic intestinal failure in adults  ap. 289-306.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aComprehensive evidenced based guidelines on appropriate and safe provision of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) have been developed by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) in 2016 and 2020. These guidelines provide clinical standards of care against which the current practice of HPN services can be audited. The aim of this study was to audit a single center's current practice against 183 recommendations on supporting patients on HPN. The objective was to measure compliance and identify areas for quality improvement. A retrospective audit of the HPN service received by patients from January 2019–May 2021 was conducted. The ESPEN guidelines were used as a benchmark to measure compliance of healthcare practice. Compliance was evaluated for the 13 subject areas included in the 2016 guideline and the 6 subject areas included in the 2020 guideline. Compliance was calculated as the percentage of criteria fully met for each subject area and an overall compliance rate with each guideline. Overall, compliance with the recommendations from 2016 was 80% and compliance with the recommendations from 2020 was 65%. Within the 2020 guideline there were 24 recommendations where noncompliance was found, 15 of these were due to the absence of a nutrition support team and dedicated intestinal failure unit. This audit and evaluation of current practice has identified areas of good evidence-based healthcare practice providing HPN. However, the absence of funding of a nutrition support team to provide a service to patients on HPN was identified as a major barrier to compliance with ESPEN recommendations in this study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclinical nutrition 3acompliance 3aguidelines 3aintestines 3ametabolism 3aparenteral feeding 0aHome parenteral nutrition 0aIntestinal failure 0aParenteral nutrition 0aClinical guidelines1 aMcKiernan, Mary1 aGriffin, Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1581-29981 aCremona, Alexandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4996-14300 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 Aug., v. 50 p.289-306dElsevier LtdwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002200161245011400183300001400297500000900311520101800320592002801338650001501366650001301381650001201394650001801406650000901424650000901433650000701442650001101449650002001460650001501480700001801495773014601513856009601659852000901755655001201764IND60668529520221122005746.0191125e197301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066852952DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1973.03615995003700010009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLagerwerff, J.

The mean values of the Gapon exchange coefficient describing the distribution of ions between the adsorbed and solution phases in Cecil, Winsum, and Yolo soils were 0.31, 0.11, and 0.24 for Pb-Al systems, and 4.13, 4.97, and 11.1 for Pb-Ca systems. In Na⁺-treated, alkalized soils, Pb precipitated. The solubility of the precipitate increased with decreasing pH and concentration of salt (NaCl). The solubility in solutions used for suspending the soil was less in the presence than in the absence of soil. This may indicate that the Pb-soil complex is less soluble than the precipitate formed in solution, so that when soil is present the composition of the precipitate shifts toward a less soluble form. This would imply a multi-component nature of the precipitate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3aillitic soils 3aions 3alead 3apH 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asolubility1 aBrower, D.

Here, we show that the gaseous phase of Citrus limon var pompia leaf essential oil (hereafter PLEO) exerts specific anti-Listeria activity on ricotta salata cheese stored at 5 °C. The synergic effect of gaseous PLEO treatment and refrigeration was first confirmed in vitro on L. monocytogenes strains treated for 3 h with gaseous PLEO and then stored at 5 °C. Ricotta cheese was then inoculated with L. monocytogenes strains and subjected to hurdle technology with different concentrations of gaseous PLEO. Cell counts revealed gaseous PLEO to exert a bactericidal effect on L. monocytogenes 20600 DSMZ and a bacteriostatic effect on a mix of L. monocytogenes strains. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analyses of L. monocytogenes cells suggested that gaseous PLEO targets the bacterial cell wall and plasma membrane. Chemical analyses of the liquid and vapor phases of PLEO indicated linalyl acetate to be the predominant compound, followed by limonene and the two isomers of citral, whereas EO composition analysis, although generally in line with previous findings, showed the presence of linalyl acetate for the first time. Solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography confirmed the presence of all crude oil components in the headspace of the box.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus limon 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aRicotta cheese 3aacetates 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acell walls 3acitral 3aessential oils 3afood industry 3afood preservation 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aisomers 3aleaves 3alimonene 3aliquids 3apetroleum 3aplasma membrane 3arefrigeration 3asolid phase microextraction 3astorage temperature 3asynergism 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors 0aHurdle technology 0aRicotta salata 0aEO gas 0aRefrigeration temperature1 aPetretto, Giacomo L.1 aMarceddu, Salvatore1 aVenditti, Tullio1 aPintore, Giorgio1 aZara, Giacomo1 aMannazzu, Ilaria1 aBudroni, Marilena1 aZara, Severino0 tFood microbiology.g2020 May, v. 87 p.103386-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2019.1033863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011200207300001400319520170100333592002802034650002302062650002302085650001502108650002302123650001302146650001202159650003102171650001402202650001402216650002002230650001902250650001702269653002802286653001602314700006202330700006302392700002202455700002302477773015802500856008502658852000902743655001202752IND60777530620221117234810.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077753062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeh, D.

We performed this proof-of-concept, feasibility, open-label, pilot randomized, crossover study to assess the efficacy and safety of the use of teduglutide (TED) to treat ECF. Adults (age >18) with low-output (<200 mL/d) ECF were randomized to 2 months of continuing standard-of-care (SOC) followed by crossover to 2 months of SOC + TED or the reverse order. The primary efficacy endpoint was decrease in fistula volume by 20% of baseline 3-day average. Secondary efficacy endpoints were: fistula resolution and health-related quality of life questionnaire scores. Six out of 10 planned subjects were randomized and completed the study, which was terminated early due to slow enrollment during the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall subject compliance with daily TED injections was high (98%). Five of six enrolled subjects met the definition for the primary efficacy endpoint; these clinical responses were not observed during the SOC arm in these subjects. One subject experienced complete fistula closure during TED treatment. Adverse events during treatment were uncommon, minor, and usually resolved despite ongoing treatment. Quality of life survey responses were highly variable and did not correlate with fistula changes. Two months of teduglutide treatment was feasible, well-tolerated, and resulted in observable decreases in ECF drainage in the majority of subjects, including spontaneous closure in one subject. This therapy shows promise, but larger, multicenter confirmatory trials are required. (NCT 02889393).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aclinical nutrition 3acompliance 3across-over studies 3adrainage 3afistula 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3atherapeutics 0aEnterocutaneous fistula 0aTeduglutide1 aVasileiou, Georgia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9702-17531 aAbdul Jawad, Khaled1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9249-71541 aPust, Gerd Daniel1 aByers, Patricia M.0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 Aug., v. 50 p.49-55dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009200164300001400256520093100270592002801201650002901229650001101258650002301269650000901292650000901301650001001310650001001320650001101330650002401341650001401365650001301379650001401392653000801406653000801414653002901422653002101451653001501472700002001487700001401507700001701521700001701538700002001555700001901575700002101594700001401615773008601629856008301715852000901798655001201807IND60557099420221122061103.0180830e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055709942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, En-Ming14aThe genome of serotype VI Streptococcus agalactiae serotype VI and comparative analysis  ap. 59-65.  aStreptococcus agalactiae (GBS) causes serious infections in humans and other species.

GBS-M002 has 73 specific genes and is one of the five strains containing >60 specific genes. Based on COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins) functional classification, 24% of the genes related to defense mechanisms are specific among the strains.

The few studies that have so far investigated compaction effects on soil shrinkage behavior have produced seemingly inconsistent results, reporting an increase, decrease, or no change in shrinkage. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the changes in soil shrinkage under controlled laboratory conditions across a wide range of compression. We analyzed shrinkage curves of repacked aggregated soil recorded at increasing levels of uniaxial compression after conditioning to different initial water potentials. With increasing compression, the shrinkage curves changed from a sigmoidal shape typical for structured soil to the simple shape typical for unstructured soil such as a clay paste, indicating the loss of structural pores. The slopes of the shrinkage curves were less steep in the structural and basic shrinkage domains at moderate compression than in the uncompressed initial state, indicating a strengthening of interaggregate bonds and thus an increase in hydrostructural stability. The highly compressed soil, in contrast, showed distinctly steeper slopes, indicating decreased hydrostructural stability due to the breaking of interaggregate bonds. The compression effects on the shrinkage curves became more pronounced with increasing initial water potential during compression. This strong dependence on the degree of compression and initial water potential may be one reason for the variation of compaction effects on soil shrinkage properties reported in the literature. The results show that soil shrinkage is well suited for the assessment of soil structural stability and compaction effects on structured soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3alaboratory experimentation 3ashrinkage 3asoil structure 3awater potential1 aSchulin, R.1 aBoivin, P.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2013 Nov., v. 77, no. 6 p.1930-1943dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.01.00353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245016500163300001600328520196000344592002802304650001402332650001502346650001102361650001202372650001202384650001202396650002502408650001802433650001302451650001302464650001502477650001202492650001602504650001402520650001602534650001102550650001902561650001702580650001402597650001102611650001602622650001402638650001102652650001202663650001302675650001502688650001502703651001002718653001902728653001602747653002402763653001902787653002202806700001402828700001302842700001402855773011302869856008402982852000903066655001203075IND60605480720221118175330.0180721e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060548072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, J.10aHydrochemical characteristics, controlling factors and solute sources of groundwater within the Tarim River Basin in the extreme arid region, NW Tibetan Plateau  ap. 237-246.  aIn the extreme arid region of the Tarim River Basin (TRB), groundwater is the most valuable resource for people's lives and regional ecology. Major ion concentrations of groundwater were analyzed to decipher hydrochemistry, temporal and spatial variations, solute sources, and controlling factors of the groundwater within the TRB. Groundwaters in this area were neutral to alkaline in nature and most of them were hard-brackish waters, dominated by Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, and SO4 ions. The total dissolved solid (TDS) varied over two orders of magnitude with a mean value of 2044 mg/L in wet season and 3091 mg/L in dry season, about 1–2 times higher than those in river water in this area. Hydrochemical types and chemical compositions of groundwaters showed zonal distribution. Mineral dissolution and evaporation were the main processes responsible for high solutes in groundwater. Ion exchange between Na on clay minerals and Ca (Mg) in groundwater increased Na⁺ concentrations. Groundwater was oversaturated with respect to dolomite, calcite and aragonite, and under-saturated with respect to gypsum and halite. A forward model of mass budget calculation showed that evaporite dissolution, carbonate weathering, silicate weathering, and atmospheric input contributed 58 ± 14%, 25 ± 12%, 13 ± 2%, and 4 ± 2% of the total dissolved cations on average in wet season, and 68 ± 13%, 20 ± 12%, 10 ± 2%, and 2 ± 1% in dry season for the whole basin, respectively. Spatial variations of rock weathering were significant, with higher evaporite dissolution in the southern basin, and higher carbonate weathering in the northern basin. Although anthropogenic inputs were minor, the majority of samples were not suitable for drinking with reference to TDS, F⁻ and/or SO42−. These results can enhance the understanding of hydrochemical characteristics in desert environments and provide information for the material sources of Lop Nor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaragonite 3aarid zones 3abasins 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acations 3achemical composition 3aclay minerals 3adolomite 3adrinking 3adry season 3aecology 3aevaporation 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3agypsum 3ahydrochemistry 3aion exchange 3amagnesium 3amodels 3ariver water 3asilicates 3asodium 3asolutes 3asulfates 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aChina 0aHydrochemistry 0aGroundwater 0aControlling factors 0aSolute sources 0aTarim River Basin1 aJin, Z.D.1 aWang, J.1 aZhang, F.0 tQuaternary international.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 380-381 p.237-246dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245010600204520183800310592002802148650002202176650001502198650001702213650001402230650001802244650001202262650001402274650001702288650000902305650001302314653002902327653002702356653002802383653002202411653001902433653000702452653000702459653001002466653001002476653000802486700001802494700001702512700001702529700001902546700005602565773011002621856008502731852000902816655001202825IND60774486320221118204006.0220809e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077448632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1192172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7908-891110aIngestion and egestion of polystyrene microplastic fragments by the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas  aMarine microplastics (MPs) pose a risk to human health through accumulation in maricultural organisms, particularly bivalves. Various studies have reported the presence of MP particles in Pacific oysters (Crasostrea gigas). In this study, we investigated the size-specific ingestion and egestion of polystyrene (PS) MPs by Pacific oysters. The cultivation density of C. gigas was maintained at 1 L of filtered seawater per oyster (n = 5) during the MP ingestion and egestion experiments. On exposure to 300 n/L of PS MP fragments for 7 d, 60.4% of the PS was ingested within 6 h (7.25 × 10² ± 1.36 × 10² n/indv.), and the ingestion was saturated at 12 h (1.2 × 10³ ± 2.2 × 10² n/indv.) in C. gigas. The maximum MP ingestion capacity (Igₘₐₓ) of a single Pacific oyster was 73.0 ± 16.3 n/g wet weight. Further, 62.9% of the PS MP particles were egested for 7 d from the saturated single C. gigas. Ingestion and egestion varied according to the PS MP size. In the case of <50 μm PS MP, ingestion rate was low but MP amount and net-ingestion efficiency was significantly higher than other PS MP sizes. In addition, egestion, egestion rate, and net-egestion efficiency for <50 μm PS MPs were significantly higher than other PS MP sizes. Therefore, smaller MPs (<50 μm) normally exhibit the highest ingestion and egestion rates; therefore, the 50–300 μm size fraction exhibited the highest residual possibility (particles >1000 μm were excluded). Additionally, considering the net-egestion efficiency, the most economical and efficient depuration period was 24 h. This study clarifies the size-specific MP accumulation in oysters, and the egestion results suggest that the potential risk of MPs to human health through the intake of maricultural products could be reduced by depuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3adepuration 3ahuman health 3aingestion 3amicroplastics 3aoysters 3apollution 3apolystyrenes 3arisk 3aseawater 0aPolystyrene microplastic 0aIngestion and egestion 0aMicroplastic depuration 0aCrassostrea gigas 0aPacific oyster 0aMP 0aPS 0aFT-IR 0aKHIDI 0aPOP1 aIm, Dong-Hoon1 aPark, Yun-Ho1 aLee, Ju-Wook1 aYoon, Sung-Jin1 aHwang, Un-Ki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4560-45080 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 307 p.119217-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1192173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245017300205300001400378520163700392592002802029650002502057650001602082650001802098650002002116650002302136650001102159650001502170650002202185650003002207650002502237650002002262653000902282653000902291653005202300653004802352653004802400653001602448700002802464700001802492700002102510700001602531700001902547700002502566700002002591773009402611856008402705852000902789655001202798IND60563668520221119030642.0170713e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056366852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2016.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Dawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8553-882410aGas chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrometry for the analysis of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in human serum  ap. 88-98.  aA method using a novel atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source for coupling gas chromatography (GC/APCI) to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for the determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) regulated by the Stockholm Convention is presented. One microliter injection of a six-point calibration curve of native PCBs and OCPs, ranging from 0.04 to 300pg/μL, was performed. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the relative response factors (RRFs) was less than 15% with a coefficient of determination (r2)>0.995. Meanwhile, two calibration solutions (CS), CS 2 (0.4pg/μL) and CS 3 (4pg/μL) were analyzed to study the repeatability calculated for both area and RRFs. The RSD for RRF ranged from 3.1 to 16% and 3.6 to 5.5% for CS 2 and CS 3, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) determined by peak-to-peak signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3 were compared between the GC/APCI/MS/MS and a GC coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS) system. GC/APCI/MS/MS resulted in lower LOD for most of the compounds, except for PCB#74, cis-chlordane and trans-chlordane. GC/APCI/MS/MS and GC/HRMS were also compared by performing analysis on 75 human serum samples together with eight QA/QC serum samples. The comparison between GC/APCI/MS/MS system and GC/HRMS system for 16 of the targeted compounds was carried out. No statistically significant difference was discovered. Due to increased sensitivity and user friendly operation under atmospheric pressure, GC/APCI/MS/MS is a powerful alternative technique that can easily meet the specification of GC/HRMS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3ablood serum 3acis-chlordane 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3ahumans 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3astatistical analysis 3atrans-chlordane 0aPCBs 0aOCPs 0aAtmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) 0aTriple quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS/MS) 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS) 0aHuman serum1 aJogsten, Ingrid Ericson1 aDunstan, Jody1 aHagberg, Jessika1 aWang, Thanh1 aRuzzin, Jerome1 aRabasa-Lhoret, Rémi1 avan Bavel, Bert0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 July 01, v. 1453 p.88-98dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009700160300001800257520154300275592002801818650001401846650001901860650001901879650001801898650001701916650001901933650002501952650001001977650001501987650004202002650001102044650002602055650001902081650001802100650001902118650001802137650002502155650002502180700001602205773011502221856008102336852000902417655001202426IND60129912320221120173322.0150503e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012991232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6536-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Feng10a16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing data mining of microbial diversity and interactions  ap. 4119-4129.  aThe ubiquitous occurrence of microorganisms gives rise to continuous public concerns regarding their pathogenicity and threats to human environment, as well as potential engineering benefits in biotechnology. The development and wide application of environmental biotechnology, for example in bioenergy production, wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and drinking water disinfection, have been bringing us with both environmental and economic benefits. Strikingly, extensive applications of microscopic and molecular techniques since 1990s have allowed engineers to peep into the microbiology in “black box” of engineered microbial communities in biotechnological processes, providing guidelines for process design and optimization. Recently, revolutionary advances in DNA sequencing technologies and rapidly decreasing costs are altering conventional ways of microbiology and ecology research, as it launches an era of next-generation sequencing (NGS). The principal research burdens are now transforming from traditional labor-intensive wet-lab experiments to dealing with analysis of huge and informative NGS data, which is computationally expensive and bioinformatically challenging. This study discusses state-of-the-art bioinformatics and statistical analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data from prevalent NGS platforms to promote its applications in exploring microbial diversity of functional and pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their interactions in biotechnological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abioinformatics 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3afunctional diversity 3agenes 3aguidelines 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3apathogenicity 3aprocess design 3aribosomal RNA 3astatistical analysis 3awastewater treatment1 aZhang, Tong0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 99, no. 10 p.4119-4129dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6536-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010800171300001600279520175300295592002802048650001302076650001302089650001502102650000902117650001202126650001902138650002202157650001402179650002402193650001402217650001502231650001702246650001902263650001302282650001602295650002302311650004402334653003802378653003502416653003902451653000902490653001402499653001902513700001802532700006002550700001702610700002002627773009602647856008402743852000902827655001202836IND60563668620221119030617.0170713e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056366862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2016.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAznar, Margarita10aProgress in mass spectrometry for the analysis of set-off phenomena in plastic food packaging materials  ap. 124-133.  aIn most cases, food packaging materials contain inks whose components can migrate to food by diffusion through the material as well as by set-off phenomena. In this work, different mass spectrometry approaches had been used in order to identify and confirm the presence of ink components in ethanol (95%) and Tenax® as food simulants. Three different sets of materials, manufactured with different printing technologies and with different structures, were analyzed. Sample analysis by ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS), using a quadrupole-time of flight (Q-TOF) as a mass analyser proved to be an excellent tool for identification purposes while ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) shown to be very useful for the confirmation of the candidates proposed. The results showed the presence of different non-volatile ink components in migration such as colorants (Solvent Red 49), plasticizers (dimethyl sebacate, tributyl o-acetyl citrate) or surfactants (SchercodineM, triethylene glycol caprilate). An oxidation product of an ink additive (triphenyl phosphine oxide) was also detected. In addition, a surface analysis technique, desorption electrospray mass spectrometry (DESI-MS), was used for analyzing the distribution of some ink components (tributyl o-acetyl citrate Schercodine L, phthalates) in the material. The detection of some of these compounds in the back-printed side confirmed the transference of this compound from the non-food to the food contact side. The results also showed that concentration of ink migrants decreased when an aluminum or polypropylene layer covered the ink. When aluminum was used, concentration of most of ink migrants decreased, and for 5 out of the 9 even disappeared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acitrates 3adesorption 3adyes 3aethanol 3afood packaging 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3apackaging materials 3aphosphine 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apolypropylenes 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3atriethylene glycol 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aHigh resolution-mass spectrometry 0aIon mobility-mass spectrometry 0aDesorption electrospray ionization 0aInks 0aMigration 0aFood packaging1 aAlfaro, Pilar1 aNerín, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2685-57391 aJones, Emrys1 aRiches, Eleanor0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 July 01, v. 1453 p.124-133dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245003600171300001400207520115300221592002801374650002001402650001101422650001301433650001501446650001701461650001601478650002401494650002301518650002101541650001301562650001801575650002501593650001801618650001301636650002901649650000901678653002001687653000901707653001801716653001201734653001401746700001901760700002301779700002301802773010701825856008301932852000902015655001202024IND60535185220221121232452.0190411e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053518522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoelzle, Ludwig E.10aPathobiology of Mycoplasma suis  ap. 20-25.  aMycoplasma suis is an uncultivable bacterium lacking a cell wall that attaches to and may invade the red blood cells of pigs. M. suis infections occur worldwide and cause the pig industry serious economic losses due to the disease known as infectious anaemia of pigs or, historically, porcine eperythrozoonosis. Infectious anaemia of pigs is characterised predominantly by acute haemolytic or chronic anaemia, along with non-specific manifestations, such as growth retardation in feeder pigs and poor reproductive performance in sows. The fastidious nature of M. suis, as well as the lack of an in vitro cultivation system, has hampered the understanding of the biology and pathogenicity of this organism. Pathogenetic mechanisms of M. suis include direct destruction of red blood cells by adhesion, invasion, nutrient scavenging, immune-mediated lysis and eryptosis, as well as endothelial targeting. Recently published genome sequences, in combination with proteome analyses, have generated new insights into the pathogenicity of M. suis. The present review combines these data with the knowledge provided by experimental M. suis infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma suis 3aanemia 3abacteria 3acell walls 3aerythrocytes 3afeeder pigs 3afinancial economics 3agrowth retardation 3ain vitro culture 3aindustry 3amycoplasmosis 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenicity 3aproteome 3areproductive performance 3asows 0aMycoplasma suis 0aPigs 0aPathogenicity 0aAnaemia 0aEryptosis1 aZeder, Michael1 aFelder, Kathrin M.1 aHoelzle, Katharina0 tveterinary journal.g2014 Oct., v. 202, no. 1 p.20-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245010300156300001800259500002000277520228100297592002802578650001602606650001602622650001702638650001102655650001102666650001102677650001202688650001502700650001102715650001702726650001002743650001402753650001402767650001602781650001402797650002202811650002002833650001402853650001202867650001102879650001102890650001402901651001102915773009702926856007103023852000903094655001203103IND60569985320221120062614.0170626e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056998532DNAL7 a10.1890/02-06712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesta, J.

I employed that framework to describe phenotypic life history trade‐offs in a large herbivore, moose (Alces alces). The relative importance of top‐down and bottom‐up ecological constraints to female moose in south‐central Alaska was appraised at the population level by analyzing population size, growth, and winter habitat of moose, and the size and impact of their principal predator populations (wolves [Canis lupus] and brown bears [Ursus arctos]). At the individual level, longitudinal mortality and reproductive patterns of radio‐collared individuals were studied to estimate vital rates and life history trade‐offs that could be attributed to nutrition and predation, respectively. The population was essentially stable through the 1980s and early 1990s, and began declining in the period of this study (1994–2000). Nutritional constraints on productivity were evident in low twinning rates (9–24%) and delayed age of first reproduction (3.4 yr) relative to other moose populations. However, the decline of the population was due principally to high rates of summer mortality of calves, resulting in low recruitment in the fall (0.11–0.22 offspring/female) and increasing adult mortality. Bear and wolf densities were high and moderate, respectively, while human harvest of moose was limited to males. Modeled population growth indicated a very limited capacity for population recovery through increased reproduction when compared to the effects of reducing predation. Constraints on population growth were mirrored in life history trade‐ offs. Trade‐offs that were attributed to bottom‐up effects included reduced rates of both parturition and twinning as a consequence of maternal investment in the prior year. Important trade‐offs also were detected between top‐down factors and reproductive effort through significantly increased predation on adult females with calves and increased survival of yearlings when adults skipped or abandoned reproductive attempts and extended the duration of maternal care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aCanis lupus 3aUrsus arctos 3aadults 3aautumn 3acalves 3afemales 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3alife history 3amales 3amortality 3anutrition 3aparturition 3aphenotype 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3apredation 3aprogeny 3asummer 3awolves 3ayearlings 3aAlaska0 tEcology.g2004 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.1439-1452dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-06713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01768naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245004300207300001800250506007600268520067700344592002801021506003701049650002401086650001001110650001501120650002501135650001601160650001201176650001501188773012701203856007901330852000901409655001201418IND60300736720221207102941.0150703e20120831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030073672DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12275062doi7 aPMC37625872pmcid7 a229367662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushner, Jake A.10aEsophageal Stem Cells, Where Art Thou?  ap. 1051-1052.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe stem cell biology of the esophageal epithelium is an unresolved area in biomedical research.

Mussels were exposed for either 96h (acute: 0, 2000, 4000μgL−1 Cd) or for 28d (subchronic: 0, 200, 2000μgL−1 Cd), and the digestive gland, gill and haemolymph were examined for impacts. Biochemical responses measured included those associated with metal detoxification (metallothionein-like protein; MTLP), oxidative stress (catalase, lipid peroxidation), cellular homeostasis (alkaline phosphatase, Na+, K+-ATPase; NKA), and energy utilisation (glycogen, haemolymph protein). Following acute exposure, digestive gland glycogen and gill NKA activity were significantly altered by Cd exposure relative to levels in mussels exposed to Cd-free seawater. Subchronic Cd exposure resulted in a significant increase in MTLP levels in both the gill and the digestive gland. This increase was correlated strongly with the levels of Cd accumulation measured in these tissues (R=0.957 for gill, 0.964 for digestive gland). Catalase activity followed a similar pattern, although the correlation with tissue Cd accumulation was not as strong (R=0.907 for gill, 0.708 for digestive gland) as that for MTLP. Lipid peroxidation increased in the digestive gland at Days 7 and 14 at both subchronic Cd levels tested, but this effect had largely dissipated by Days 21 and 28 (with the exception of the 2000μgL−1 group at Day 28). Alkaline phosphatase activity decreased significantly with Cd exposure in both tissues. This effect was observed at both tested concentrations in the gill, but only at the highest concentration for digestive gland. A decrease in digestive gland glycogen levels was observed in Cd-exposed mussels (Days 14 and 21 at 2000μgL−1), while haemolymph protein levels increased as a result of subchronic Cd exposure. These findings indicated that biochemical responses in Cd-exposed mussels were tissue-specific, dose- and time-dependent, with duration of exposure being the predominant effect. This study shows that biochemical changes in Cd-exposed green-lipped mussels can be linked to tissue metal accumulation and are consistent with previously reported physiological effects. It also suggests that green-lipped mussels are amenable to a multiple biomarker approach and may be of use as a bioindicator species for monitoring coastal metal pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerna canaliculus 3aacute exposure 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3acatalase 3aenergy 3aglycogen 3ahemolymph 3ahomeostasis 3aindicator species 3alipid peroxidation 3amussels 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aseawater 3atoxicity 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCadmiumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aGillsxdrug effects 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMetallothioneinxmetabolism 2aPernaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aPerna canaliculus 0aCadmium 0aMetallothionein-like protein 0aOxidative stress 0aEnzyme biomarkers 0aGlycogen1 aMarsden, Islay D.1 aGaw, Sally1 aGlover, Chris N.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 140-141 p.303-313dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009100163300002000254520145400274592002801728650001501756650002301771650001101794650001101805650001101816650000901827650001201836650000901848650001401857650002201871650001201893650001501905650001101920650001401931650001201945650001401957650001101971650001301982650001301995650001302008650000902021650001402030700001602044700001602060700005602076700005602132773017302188856008002361852000902441655001202450IND60648121920221118070918.0190626e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064812192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b013822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Qingli10aFirst-Principle Study on Heterofullerenes: Effective and Multifunctional in Hg Removal  ap. 11101-11110.  aMercury control is very important with regard to the clean use of fossil fuels. Although both carbonaceous materials and metals can effectively remove Hg⁰, they still face great challenges. Single-atom loaded materials provide new ways for Hg species removal. Metal-substituted C60 has been predicted to have high chemical reactivity. Accordingly, the adsorption mechanisms of Hg species on 19 types of heterofullerenes (C59M, M = Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd Cu, Au, W, Ir, and Ag) were studied by using DFT method. Most of the C59M can strongly adsorb Hg⁰, and C59Cu is the best one, with its adsorption energy being −0.67 eV. C59M′ (M′ = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mn) with strong interaction with Hg⁰ were chosen for further studying on their adsorption of HgCl and HgCl₂. Both HgCl and HgCl₂ prefer dissociative adsorption. Moreover, Hg⁰ adsorption on C59M′Cl and C59M′Cl₂ were checked. The results showed that Hg⁰ physically adsorbs on both C59M′Cl and C59M′Cl₂. Importantly, oxidative adsorption of Hg⁰ were also calculated on C59M′Cl₂. C59CoCl₂ shows excellent removal ability for Hg⁰ via oxidative adsorption due to the lowest activation barrier (0.89 eV), then C59CuCl₂ has the next-lowest barrier (1.00 eV). This study is of great significance for understanding the adsorption mechanisms and expands the theoretical system of carbon-based materials for Hg species removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical reactions 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenergy 3agold 3airidium 3airon 3amanganese 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3apalladium 3arhodium 3aruthenium 3asilver 3atitanium 3atungsten 3avanadium 3azinc 3azirconium1 aJi, Wenchao1 aGuo, Weimin1 aShen, Zhemin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8043-52281 aFan, Maohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1334-72920 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 June 04, v. 58, no. 25 p.11101-11110dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b013823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245017800163520155600341592002801897650001301925650001201938650005301950650002202003650001402025650001502039650003102054653002002085653002302105653001002128653002302138653001902161700005502180700001302235700001902248700001402267700005402281700002002335700001502355700001602370700001602386700001602402700005702418700001102475773011002486856008502596852000902681655001202690IND60774486620221118203959.0220509e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077448662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1192842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiao10aComprehensive chemical characterization of gaseous I/SVOC emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles using two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry  aIntermediate-volatility and semi-volatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs) are key precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). However, the comprehensive characterization of I/SVOCs has long been an analytical challenge. Here, we develop a novel method of speciating and quantifying I/SVOCs using two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-ToF-MS) by constructing class-screening programs based on their characteristic fragments and mass spectrum patterns. Using this new approach, we then present a comprehensive analysis of gaseous I/SVOC emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs). Over three-thousand compounds are identified and classified into twenty-one categories. The dominant compound groups of I/SVCOs emitted by HDDVs are alkanes (including normal and branched alkanes, 37–66%), benzylic alcohols (7–20%), alkenes (3–11%), cycloalkanes (3–9%), and benzylic ketones (1–4%). Oxygenated I/SVOCs (O–I/SVOCs, e.g., benzylic alcohols and ketones) are first quantified and account for >20% of the total I/SVOC mass. Advanced aftertreatment devices largely reduce the total I/SVOC emissions but increase the proportion of O–I/SVOCs. With the speciation data, we successfully map the I/SVOCs into the two-dimensional volatility basis set space, which facilitates a better estimation of SOA. As aging time goes by, approximate 45% difference between the two scenarios after seven-day aging is observed, which confirms the significant impact of speciated I/SVOC emission data on SOA prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalkenes 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apollution 3aprediction 3avolatile organic compounds 0aGC × GC-ToF-MS 0aI/SVOCs speciation 0aHDDVs 0aOxygenated-I/SVOCs 0aSOA estimation1 aZheng, Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9380-75611 aYou, Yan1 aZhang, Shaojun1 aZhao, Bin1 aWang, Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8532-57731 aHuang, Guanghan1 aChen, Ting1 aCao, Yihuan1 aHe, Liqiang1 aChang, Xing1 aWang, Shuxiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9727-19631 aWu, Ye0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 July 15, v. 305 p.119284-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1192843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010700154300001600261500002000277520163200297592002801929650001501957650000901972650001801981650001501999650001502014650002502029650001902054650001802073650001602091700005502107700006002162700001902222700001302241700005602254773013802310856007502448852000902523655001202532IND60788464420221118162640.0220814e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078846442DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.202362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xue10aEffects of increasing water activity on the relationship between water vapor sorption and clay content  ap. 520-525.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe dependence of the relationship between hygroscopic water content (θₕ) and clay content on water activity is not well understood. Here, we determined the correlation coefficients between θₕ (or the slope of soil water vapor adsorption isotherms, Sᵥₐᵢ) and clay content at nine water activity levels (i.e., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) and investigated the evolution of correlation coefficients with increasing water activity for 65 soils with mixed and illitic clay mineralogy. The correlation coefficient between θₕ₀.₁ (water content at a water activity of 0.1) and clay content was the lowest (.82) due to the differences in soil‐specific hydration processes. At the water activity range from 0.1 to 0.6, the Sᵥₐᵢ showed stronger correlations (r = .91–.93) with clay content than θₕ₀.₁ because the multilayer sorption controlled by van der Waals force is related to clay content. When water activity increased from 0.1 to 0.6, the observed strong correlation between Sᵥₐᵢ and clay content resulted in an increase of correlation coefficient between θₕ and clay content from .82 to .96. Compared with the correlation (r = .96) between θₕ and clay content at the beginning of condensation process, a weaker correlation (r = .87–.92) between Sᵥₐᵢ and clay content was observed during condensation process, which led to a slight strengthening of the correlation between θₕ and clay content at high water activities (>0.6). This was explained by the different clay particle properties and water activity thresholds for initiation of condensation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3amineralogy 3asoil water 3avan der Waals forces 3awater activity 3awater content 3awater vapor1 aChen, Chong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2333-58611 aArthur, Emmanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0788-07121 aTuller, Markus1 aZhou, Hu1 aRen, Tusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6277-07940 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2021 May, v. 85, no. 3 p.520-525dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.202363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245010500160300001800265500002000283520177500303592002802078650001102106650001102117650001602128650003302144650001102177650002402188650001302212650001702225650001502242650001402257650001002271650001202281650001402293650001402307650001602321700002402337700002002361773009702381856007102478852000902549655001202558IND60569985420221120062622.0170626e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056998542DNAL7 a10.1890/03-01702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTieleman, B. Irene10aEnergy and water budgets of larks in a life history perspective: parental effort varies with aridity  ap. 1399-1410.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe compared physiological, demographic, and ecological variables of larks to gain insights into life history variation along an aridity gradient, incorporating phylogenetic relationships in analyses when appropriate. Quantifying field metabolic rate (FMR) and water influx rate (WIR) of parents feeding nestlings as measures of parental effort, we found that parental FMR and WIR of larks decreased with increasing aridity. Water and energy requirements of 6–8 d old nestlings were reduced in desert species. Nestling growth rate, clutch size, and number of clutches decreased with increasing aridity, and nest predation rates increased with increasing aridity. We combined FMR and WIR of parents and chicks, energy and water accumulated during growth, and brood size to establish energy and water budgets of parent–brood units. Parent–offspring energy budgets equaled 261 kJ/d for Hoopoe Lark, 164 kJ/d for Dunn's Lark, 388 kJ/d for Skylark, and 347 kJ/d for Woodlark, a 27% reduction in the desert species when taking into account mass differences. Family unit WIRs were 46.6 g/d for Hoopoe Lark, 37.3 g/d for Dunn's Lark, 101.6 g/d for Skylark, and 83.2 g/d for Woodlark. Parent–brood units of arid‐zone species used 28–51% less water per gram mass than species from mesic areas. These results support the hypothesis that decreasing food and water availability favor lower energy and water requirements of parents and young, reduced growth rates, and smaller clutch sizes with increasing aridity. The decrease in parental effort with increasing aridity might reflect a lower fitness value of a single brood for arid‐zone species than for larks from mesic habitats, suggesting that the probability of adult survival is higher in arid than in mesic areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achicks 3aclutch size 3adry environmental conditions 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3ahabitats 3alife history 3ametabolism 3anestlings 3anests 3aparents 3aphylogeny 3apredation 3aprobability1 aWilliams, Joseph B.1 aVisser, G.

In New Zealand, the solitary endoparasitoid Cotesia urabae Austin and Allen (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was first released in January 2011 as a biological control agent for the gum leaf skeletoniser, Uraba lugens Walker (Lepidoptera: Nolidae). The objective of this study was to utilize an experimental approach to quantify the dispersal behavior of one generation of C. urabae. In our experiment, which used sentinel larvae as target hosts, parasitoids dispersed up to 20m away from the release point but parasitism was highest within 5m of the release site. A high level of parasitism was observed at the release tree (87.6%) which suggests that most of the females released may have stayed there. According to the dispersal model developed from the data collected, Cotesia would be able to disperse up to 53m in one release event. In addition, significant differences were found between the different directions tested for dispersal, showing a clear downwind effect on dispersal suggesting that wind has a direct effect on the dispersal behavior of C. urabae in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCotesia 3aNolidae 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3adispersal behavior 3aendoparasitoids 3afemales 3ahosts 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amodels 3aparasitic wasps 3aparasitism 3atree release 3awind 3aNew Zealand 0aEndoparasitoid 0aBraconid wasps 0aMicrogastrinae 0aParasitism 0aParasitoid dispersal1 aBerndt, L.A.1 aHolwell, G.I.0 tBiological control.g2013 Sept., v. 66, no. 3 p.166-172dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245008100205300001600286506007600302520118700378592002801565506003701593650002201630650001101652650001601663650001401679650001101693650002301704650001901727650001201746650001901758650001201777653001901789653003001808653002001838653002701858653002201885700001501907700001801922700002601940700006701966700002602033700001402059773010902073856008302182852000902265655001202274IND60535185520221207075239.0190411e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053518552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.07.0262doi7 aPMC71286722pmcid7 a254394402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosseri, S.10aEquine sarcoid: In situ demonstration of matrix metalloproteinase expression  ap. 279-285.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSarcoids are the most prevalent equine skin tumours and remain a therapeutic challenge due to their differing clinical morphology, local aggressive behaviour, and high recurrence following surgical treatment. In vitro, sarcoid derived fibroblasts are invasive and express matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1, -2 and -9. It was hypothesised that the MMPs produced by neoplastic cells play a role in both their local invasiveness and interaction with the overlying epidermis (picket fence formation). The objective of this morphological study was to investigate the local behaviour and in situ MMP expression pattern in sarcoids of different clinical types. A total of 43 surgically excised sarcoids were examined by histology, immunohistology for the expression of MMP-1, -2 and -9, and transmission electron microscopy.Regardless of the clinical type, sarcoids showed local invasion of the dermis and damage to the basement membrane in areas of interaction with the epidermis. This was associated with MMP-1 expression in both neoplastic cells and epidermis. The results suggest a link between MMP-1 expression and the local aggressiveness of sarcoids regardless of the clinical type.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasement membrane 3adermis 3afibroblasts 3ahistology 3ahorses 3ametalloproteinases 3aneoplasm cells 3asarcoid 3askin neoplasms 3asurgery 0aEquine sarcoid 0aMatrix metalloproteinases 0aDermal invasion 0aPicket fence formation 0aBasement membrane1 aHetzel, U.1 aHahn, Shelley1 aMichaloupoulou, Eleni1 aSallabank, Hannah Clare1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3890-90871 aKnottenbelt, Derek C.1 aKipar, A.0 tveterinary journal.g2014 Nov., v. 202, no. 2 p.279-285dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009200168300001600260500000900276520180300285592002802088650002402116650002202140650002102162650001902183650002702202650000902229650002402238650001102262650002102273650003402294650001702328650002002345650001202365700001602377773013602393856007902529852000902608655001202617IND60668530320221120023614.0191228e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066853032DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2002.89702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakindiki, I.

The objective was to study the effects of soil mineralogy and texture on crust micromorphology, infiltration, and erosion. Five soils with differing properties were subjected to 80 mm of simulated rainfall. The aggregate stability of these soils was determined by the fast wetting method. The mean-weight diameters of the particles after the fast wetting were 2.8 mm in the clayey kaolinitic soil, 0.25 and 0.31 mm in the clayey and sandy loam montmorillonitic soils, respectively, and 0.84 and 0.87 mm in the clayey nonphyllosilicate soils. The final IR was 20.5 mm h⁻¹ in the clayey kaolinitic soil and ≤9.3 mm h⁻¹ in the remaining soils. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations indicated that the kaolinitic soil had a thin crust (∼0.1 mm) containing large particles (∼0.1 mm), whereas the montmorillonitic soils had thicker crusts (>0.2 mm) comprising either small (∼0.02 mm) particles with a very developed washed-in zone underneath or large (∼0.2 mm) ones with fine material between them. The crust layer in the nonphyllosilicate soils was ∼0.2 mm thick and composed of fine particles ∼0.01 mm. The high aggregate stability and the low dispersivity of the kaolinitic soil, which minimized soil detachment, and its low runoff, which minimized its transport capacity, limited the soil loss to 0.33 kg m⁻², whereas the low aggregate stability and high runoff of the montmorillonitic soils contributed to their soil losses of 1.24 and 1.14 kg m⁻² The intermediate aggregate stability and the high runoff of the nonphyllosilicate soils accounted for their intermediate soil losses of 0.75 and 0.8 kg m⁻  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3ainfiltration rate 3akaolinitic soils 3amicrostructure 3amontmorillonitic soils 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asandy loam soils 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asoil erosion 3asoil mineralogy 3atexture1 aBen-Hur, M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 May, v. 66, no. 3 p.897-905dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2002.89703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245009500156300001800251500002000269520192900289592002802218650001602246650001602262650001702278650001102295650001202306650001502318650001702333650001102350650001402361650002202375650001402397650001202411650001702423650001102440650001602451650001102467650001102478650001402489651001102503773009702514856007102611852000902682655001202691IND60569985620221120062610.0170626e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056998562DNAL7 a10.1890/02-06722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesta, J.

The potential interaction of these life history trade‐offs was studied under varying degrees of predation and nutritional limitation using models based on data from radio‐collared moose in south‐central Alaska. The interaction was mildly antiregulatory, assuming that bottom‐up trade‐offs are density dependent. That is, as nutritional constraints increased, a female that skipped reproduction after successfully rearing a calf enhanced the survival of herself and her yearling enough in the second year to overcompensate for the loss of productivity. In a declining population, the reverse could occur, accentuating the decline. A more general, stage projection matrix was used to model a broader range of predation rates in summer and winter, in order to contrast the potential importance of bears (Ursus arctos and U. americanus) and wolves (Canis lupus) in such an interaction. The greatest effect of life history interactions on population growth occurred with moderate predation in summer and heavy predation in winter. Relative to direct ecological effects on survival and reproduction, the influence of such an interaction was relatively weak. However, subtle effects on the stability of predator– prey interactions, particularly those involving bear predation, cannot be excluded because of the antiregulatory nature of the interaction and uncertainties about class‐specific vulnerability to predation in other settings. These findings underscore the relevance of understanding the alternative life history choices that arise from interactions in both directions on the food chain, particularly given that the top‐down trade‐offs are usually poorly known.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aCanis lupus 3aUrsus arctos 3acalves 3afemales 3afood chain 3alife history 3amodels 3aphenotype 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3arearing 3areproduction 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awinter 3awolves 3ayearlings 3aAlaska0 tEcology.g2004 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.1453-1459dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-06723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012800168300001400296500001500310520137200325592002801697650002601725650002601751650002501777650001101802650001101813650003201824650002401856650001201880650002201892650003601914650001501950650003601965650001502001653002402016653001602040653002102056653002302077653002102100653000702121653001002128653002702138653002002165653000802185700001502193700001702208700006402225700005502289700001602344700001902360700002302379700002302402700001902425700002002444700001602464700002202480700002002502700001502522700002402537700001902561700002802580773008602608856008302694852000902777655001202786IND60557100020221122232916.0180830e20170120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055710002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.10.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChahal, Sabreen10aStructural characterization of the α-mating factor prepro-peptide for secretion of recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris  ap. 50-62.  a2019-12-06  aThe methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris has been used extensively for expressing recombinant proteins because it combines the ease of genetic manipulation, the ability to provide complex posttranslational modifications and the capacity for efficient protein secretion. The most successful and commonly used secretion signal leader in Pichia pastoris has been the alpha mating factor (MATα) prepro secretion signal. However, limitations exist as some proteins cannot be secreted efficiently, leading to strategies to enhance secretion efficiency by modifying the secretion signal leader. Based on a Jpred secondary structure prediction and knob-socket modeling of tertiary structure, numerous deletions and duplications of the MATα prepro leader were engineered to evaluate the correlation between predicted secondary structure and the secretion level of the reporters horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Candida antarctica lipase B. In addition, circular dichroism analyses were completed for the wild type and several mutant pro-peptides to evaluate actual differences in secondary structure. The results lead to a new model of MATα pro-peptide signal leader, which suggests that the N and C-termini of MATα pro-peptide need to be presented in a specific orientation for proper interaction with the cellular secretion machinery and for efficient protein secretion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3arecombinant proteins 3ayeasts 3amodels 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3agenetic engineering 3amutants 3aprotein secretion 3apost-translational modification 3aperoxidase 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aprediction 0aAlpha mating factor 0aKnob socket 0aSecretion leader 0aCircular dichroism 0aProtein modeling 0aCD 0aMATα 0aRecombinant expression 0aPichia pastoris 0aHRP1 aWei, Peter1 aMoua, Pachai1 aPark, Sung Pil James1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8125-63471 aKwon, Janet1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2564-88181 aPatel, Arth1 aVu, Anthony T.1 aCatolico, Jason A.1 aTsai, Yu Fang Tina1 aShaheen, Nadia1 aChu, Tiffany T.1 aTam, Vivian1 aKhan, Zill-E-Huma1 aJoo, Hyun Henry1 aXue, Liang1 aLin-Cereghino, Joan1 aTsai, Jerry W.1 aLin-Cereghino, Geoff P.0 tGene.g2017 Jan. 20, v. 598 p.50-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04346naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245008700177300001600264520234700280592002802627650001102655650002602666650002702692650001802719650002702737650002602764650001302790650002302803650002802826650003102854650001802885650002602903650001302929650002602942650002102968650001502989650001303004650000903017650001403026650002303040650001403063650002403077650001003101650004303111650001203154650001303166650001003179651001203189653003603201653003003237653002403267653001803291653002203309653002903331700001503360700001903375700001703394700002403411700001703435773011003452856008903562852000903651655001203660IND60112060020221121093047.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011206002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos-Herrera, R.10aNew citriculture system suppresses native and augmented entomopathogenic nematodes  ap. 183-194.  aSince its first detection in 2005, the bacterial disease huanglongbing (HLB or citrus greening) has emerged as a critical threat to the citrus industry in Florida. An “Advanced Production System” (APS) could mitigate the impact of HLB by bringing citrus trees into production more quickly and economically than conventional citriculture methods. However, unlike conventional practices, APS fertigates plants daily, thereby changing the soil properties in ways that might impact soil biota. We tested the hypothesis that changes to soil properties caused by APS would affect the abundance of native entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) and/or the survival of augmented EPNs. The densities of organisms at different trophic levels were measured by real-time qPCR in three experiments conducted in an ongoing field experiment. Target organisms included 6 entompathogenic nematodes, 5 nematophagous fungi (NF) and a phoretic bacterium, Paenibacillus sp. Soil properties, free-living nematodes and citrus fibrous roots were also measured. Compared to soil under conventional citriculture (CC), APS increased soil pH and Mg content, while reducing the electrical conductivity, and content of K, Mn and Fe. The naturally occurring EPN Steinernema diaprepesi was 5times less abundant in APS plots where these nematodes were more heavily encumbered by the phoretic bacterium Paenibacillus sp., which limits the foraging success of EPNs. In general, when EPNs were augmented in either treatment, fewer Steinernema riobrave than Heterorhabditis indica were recovered and recovery of both species declined rapidly over time. As seen with native S. diaprepesi, fewer augmented S. riobrave were recovered from APS plots in two of the three experiments, whereas the management system did not affect the recovery of H. indica. More of some endoparasitic and trapping NF were recovered from soil augmented with S. riobrave than with H. indica. However, variation in the responses of NF to the management systems suggests that these NF species were not primarily responsible for the steinernematid responses to APS. Although APS has the potential to reduce EPN populations and exacerbate herbivory by subterranean pests such as the root weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus, additional study of the physical causes of this effect may reveal ways to avoid the problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aDiaprepes abbreviatus 3aHeterorhabditis indica 3aPaenibacillus 3aSteinernema diaprepesi 3aSteinernema riobravis 3abacteria 3abiological control 3aelectrical conductivity 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3afibrous roots 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3afree-living nematodes 3agreening disease 3aherbivores 3aindustry 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanagement systems 3amanganese 3anematophagous fungi 3apests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil pH 3atrapping 3atrees 3aFlorida 0aAugmentation biological control 0aEntomopathogenic nematode 0aNematophagous fungi 0aSoil food web 0aIrrigation system 0aPost-application biology1 aPathak, E.1 aEl-Borai, F.E.1 aSchumann, A.1 aAbd-Elgawad, M.M.M.1 aDuncan, L.W.0 tBiological control.g2013 Sept., v. 66, no. 3 p.183-194dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009000173520118200263592002801445650001201473650002801485650001801513650002501531650002501556650001201581650001901593650001001612650001801622650001801640650000901658650002601667650001701693650001201710651001001722700002701732700001801759773010201777856008701879852000901966655001201975IND60677537920221119131936.0200523e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067753792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.1065632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Adrian A.14aThe role of social influence in crop residue management: Evidence from Northern India  aPostharvest crop residue burning, which is associated with negative environmental and health outcomes, has become a major public policy concern in developing countries. We use original survey data from 1230 rice farmers in Northern India to analyze the factors influencing crop residue management practices. Results indicate that herd behavior is a significant determinant of residue burning, wherein a farmer is socially influenced to choose burning as the residue management technique because he believes all other farmers commonly practice it. We find that farmers who perceive residue burning as diminishing soil quality are far less likely to do so; however, their awareness of its adverse environmental effects does not lower the choice to burn. We infer that farmers account for private costs and benefits of burning but ignore its external social costs. We also control for socio-economic factors and find that farmer’s wealth increases the likelihood of residue burning. Identifying the behavioral factors behind residue burning, which capture underlying aspects of social influence and herd behavior is useful for policy aimed at reducing this public health hazard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acrop residue management 3acrop residues 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental impact 3afarmers 3ahealth hazards 3aherds 3apublic health 3apublic policy 3arice 3asocioeconomic factors 3asoil quality 3asurveys 3aIndia1 aViriyavipart, Ajalavat1 aTasneem, Dina0 tEcological economics.g2020 Mar., v. 169 p.106563-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.1065633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01553naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245008100181300001600262500001900278500000900297520054900306592002800855650002100883650001300904650001800917650001300935650002300948650001000971700001800981773012200999856009701121852000901218655001201227IND60663717020221123031926.0191122e195806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066371702DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1958.00021962005000060012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackobs, J.

The M-ITP operation relies on pressure-assisted pushing of a preconcentrated sample plug after the first ITP process back to the injection end of the capillary, followed by a large volume hydrodynamic injection prior to application of the second ITP step. This operational cycle was repeated as many times as desired with very good repeatability of the peak areas and peak heights at each ITP round (RSD less than 8%). Using imidazole and benzoate as models for cationic and anionic analytes, important insights into the mechanism of this electrokinetic preconcentration process with and without the presence of the electro-osmotic flow (EOF) at acidic and basic conditions were provided. Stacking of the benzoate ion, selected as one model analyte, in the presence of EOF and from a sample plug representing up to 300% of the total capillary length was successfully demonstrated. M-ITP was then demonstrated through the enrichment of the Aβ 1-40 amyloid peptide, considered as one of the biomarkers for biochemical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Quantification of Aβ 1-40 down to 50nM with UV detection was made possible with 6 M-ITP cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3abiomarkers 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3aelectroosmosis 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 0aMultiple-isotachophoresis (M-ITP) 0aElectrokinetic preconcentration 0aCapillary electrophoresis (CE) 0aAmyloid peptides1 aOukacine, Farid1 aTaverna, Myriam0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 July 01, v. 1453 p.116-123dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.05.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01349naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245006300177300001600240500000900256520047000265592002800735650002700763650001500790650002500805773014800830856009600978852000901074655001201083IND60668530520221120041025.0191125e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066853052DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1978.03615995004200040002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatu, Vedat10aSteady Infiltration from Single and Periodic Strip Sources  ap. 544-549.  aepub  aThe matric flux potential and horizontal and vertical flux distributions were obtained using Fourier analysis techniques for single and periodic strip sources located on the soil surface.

The yeast homologue, Mod5, has similar tRNA-modifying functions in the cytoplasm and is required for the transcriptional silencing activity of RNA polymerase II promoters near tRNA genes in the nucleus, a phenomenon termed tRNA gene mediated (tgm) silencing. Furthermore, Mod5 can fold into amyloid fibers in vitro and in vivo, which confers resistance to certain fungicides in yeast. Since TRIT1 complements both tRNA modifying and tgm-silencing activities in yeast where the Mod5 gene has been deleted, it seemed possible that TRIT1 might also have amyloid-forming capabilities. Here we show that TRIT1, like Mod5, directly binds to tRNAs that are both substrate and non-substrates for modification with similar affinity, and to an unstructured, non-tRNA. Binding appears to involve distinct protein-RNA multimers which decrease in electrophoretic mobility as the protein to RNA ratio increases. Furthermore, we characterize TRIT1 as a novel human amyloid fiber forming protein. We discuss these data in light of TRIT1's functional roles and possible implications for disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aamyloid 3acytoplasm 3aelectrophoresis 3afungicides 3agenes 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer RNA 3ayeasts 0atRNA 0aTRIT1 0aDMAPP 0atgm silencing 0aIPTase 0aThT 0aCR 0apol II 0apol III 0ai6A37 0aTRIT1 0aMod5 0aRNA binding 0atRNA modification 0aIsopentenyl transferase 0aAmyloid fibers 0aPrion 0atRNA gene mediated silencing1 aRead, D.F.1 aEngelke, D.R.1 aSmaldino, P.J.0 tGene.g2017 May 15, v. 612 p.19-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.10.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245017200171300001600343500001500359520189100374592002802265650001602293650001402309650001902323650001702342650001102359650003002370650001002400650001202410650001102422650001002433650001402443650001202457650001102469650001602480650000902496650001402505650001002519650002302529650002102552650001102573650001402584651001302598651001002611653001402621653002702635653002302662653002502685653001402710653001602724700001602740700002102756700001402777773011002791856008902901961001202990852000903002655001203011IND60112060120221121093129.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011206012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, L.C.10aField-cage evaluation of the survival, feeding and reproduction of Laricobius osakensis (Coleoptera: Derodontidae), a predator of Adelges tsugae (Hemiptera: Adelgidae)  ap. 195-203.  a2019-12-04  aThe hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand, is a serious, non-native pest of hemlock in eastern North America. Laricobius osakensis Montgomery and Shiyake was identified as a key predator in Japan, where A. tsugae is native. Performance of adult and immature stages of L. osakensis was evaluated in sleeve cages on adelgid infested Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carrière in plant hardiness zones 5b and 6b in the mountains of southwestern Virginia, USA. Adults fed on the adelgid and laid eggs during all biweekly sample periods from December 2010 to May 2011, including winter when the temperature averaged below 0°C. In cages with one adult pair (one male and one female), predation of A. tsugae/predator was 0.3–0.9/day during December and January, increased to 2.5/day in February, and then declined to 0.15/day in early May. The oviposition rate lagged the changes in feeding by 2–4weeks, increasing from 0.02eggs/day, from December to mid-January, to a peak of 1.5eggs/day in early April, then declining to 0.4eggs/day in late April. Mortality was 20% in cages left undisturbed for two months during the winter; even though temperatures were as low as −18°C (cages examined biweekly had higher mortality, likely due to disturbance). In cages left undisturbed for two months during winter or early spring, 34 and 37 progeny were recovered, respectively. During each bimonthly period, a pair of adults and their progeny consumed 2.5 and 2.4 adult adelgids or ovisacs per day, respectively. Twenty-eight days after eggs were placed in the cages (on 11 March or 27 April 2012), 48% and 95% of the recovered larvae had reached maturity and each larva had destroyed 43 and 39 ovisacs, respectively. This research indicates that L. osakensis may have the potential to be an effective biological control agent of A. tsugae in most of the area where it is a pest in the eastern US.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoviposition 3amountains 3aAdelges tsugae 3aDerodontidae 3aadults 3abiological control agents 3amales 3afemales 3awinter 3apests 3apredation 3aprogeny 3alarvae 3atemperature 3aeggs 3amortality 3acages 3abiological control 3aTsuga canadensis 3aspring 3aimmatures 3aVirginia 3aJapan 0aPredation 0aHemlock woolly adelgid 0aBiological control 0aLaricobius osakensis 0aHemiptera 0aField cages1 aSalom, S.M.1 aMontgomery, M.E.1 aKok, L.T.0 tBiological control.g2013 Sept., v. 66, no. 3 p.195-203dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245009700134300001600231520117200247650002001419650001701439650003201456650002601488650001101514650001601525650001601541650001801557650002701575650001101602650001301613650002301626653002201649653002701671653004001698653001501738653001801753700001301771700001801784773007001802852000901872930003301881945001301914946001101927655001201938IND2205541720221120140328.0000630e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220554172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatta del Bosco, S.10aMicrosporogenesis in a Citrus interspecific tetraploid somatic hybrid and its fusion parents  ap. 373-377.  aMicrosporogenesis was analysed in a tetraploid somatic hybrid (SH) (2n = 4x = 36) of Citrus and its diploid fusion parents (2n = 2x = 18), Valencia sweet orange (C. sinensis L. Osbeck) and Femminello lemon (C. limon L. Burm. f.). Intergenomic pairing between lemon and orange occurred in the somatic hybrid which showed multivalent chromosome associations in diakinesis, although one quadrivalent was definitely because of a reciprocal translocation present in Valencia. The behaviour of univalents was variable in the somatic hybrid and its parents. In the somatic hybrid and Valencia, the univalents preferentially formed micronuclei and polyads whereas, in Femminello, they were generally enclosed in a nucleus although distributed randomly. The somatic hybrid showed a rate of pollen stainability of 64% and germinability of 41%. The chromosomally unbalanced pollen from the tetraploid SH was presumed viable and able to fertilize because different nuclear DNA contents were found in the back-cross progeny. Moreover, meiotic nuclear restitution mechanisms, which could be mainly dependent on the abnormal orientation of the spindles in meiosis II, are described. 3aCitrus sinensis 3aCitrus limon 3ainterspecific hybridization 3asomatic hybridization 3apollen 3atetraploidy 3achromosomes 3agametogenesis 3achromosome segregation 3agenome 3agenomics 3achromosome pairing 0aunreduced gametes 0achromosome disposition 0amultivalent chromosome associations 0aunivalents 0aquadrivalents1 aTusa, N.1 aConicella, C.0 tHeredity.g1999 Oct., v. 83, no. pt. 4 p.373-377x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03743naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245011800163300001600281520260500297650001602902650002102918650002402939650002102963651001502984700001702999700001603016700001703032700001803049773012803067852000903195856007303204930003303277945002503310946001103335990002303346655001203369IND4377137320221120130126.0060110e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437713732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRenquist, B.J.10aEffects of supplementation and stocking rate on body condition and production parameters of multiparous beef cows  ap. 403-411.  aFall-calving multiparous Angus x Hereford cows 3 to 10 years of age were stratified by age in a three by two factorial treatment arrangement to evaluate the efficacy of modifying stocking rate and supplementation strategy to manage cow body condition and production parameters over a 5-year study. Efficacy was evaluated quarterly in association with calving, breeding, weaning, and mid way between weaning and calving (i.e. in August). Three protein supplementation strategies (none, standard, strategic) were imposed across both a moderate (0.3 cows per ha) and a high (0.4 cows per ha) stocking rate. In the strategically supplemented group, protein supplement was provided to cows with a body condition score < 5.5 at the quarterly evaluations. There was an effect of supplementation on pregnancy rate, which in combination with previously established culling practices resulted in different age profiles amongst supplementation strategies in years 2 to 5 (P<0.01). Two statistical analyses were therefore conducted to dissociate the confounding effects of supplementation strategy and age. One model included the effect of stocking rate, supplementation strategy, production year, and all interactions; the second included the addition of age and its interactive effects. Stocking rate and supplementation strategy affected pregnancy rate in each of the models (P = 0.003 and P = 0.10, respectively). Standard, non-supplemented and strategically supplemented animals had estimated pregnancy rates of 0.83, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively (P = 0.10). The effects of nutrition on both calving interval and birth weight were independent of the model employed. Animals that were not supplemented had extended calving intervals (P = 0.06), but there was no effect of stocking rate (P>0.10). Birth weight was not affected by supplementation strategy or stocking rate (P>0.10). The lower 205-day weights of calves on a heavy compared with moderate stocking rate was independent of age (P = 0.02). However, the increased 205-day weight of calves born to strategically supplemented cows compared with those born to unsupplemented cows was only evident when data were not corrected for differences in age among groups (P = 0.03). Likewise, analyses of cow condition parameters using models without and with age resulted in different interpretations. These results suggest that strategic and standard supplementation result in similar animal performance and that the improvement in herd productivity associated with altering stocking rate and supplementation may partially be due to altered herd age dynamics. 3acow feeding 3afeed supplements 3acow-calf operations 3afemale fertility 3aCalifornia1 aOltjen, J.W.1 aSainz, R.D.1 aConnor, J.M.1 aCalvert, C.C.0 tAnimal science : an international journal of fundamental and applied research.g2005 Dec., v. 81 p.403-411x1357-72987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://bsas.org.uk/Publications/Animal_Science/3electronic resource  a20060810b20060906c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/01/20  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02297naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245006000166300001600226520118900242650001001431650002201441650001901463650000901482650001101491650001201502700001601514700001801530700002001548700001801568700001101586773012801597852000901725856007301734930003301807945002501840946001101865990002301876655001201899IND4377136820221120115302.0060110e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437713682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Stereo images were captured of 32 pigs, divided into high-lysine and low-lysine diet groups, and 3-D models were built from the images. Each pig was imaged once per week for 14 weeks. After slaughter, 10 of the pigs were dissected for muscle and fat measurements. A sequence of algorithms was applied to the 3-D models : differential geometry to reveal surface curvature features and detect the spine; manual landmark placement; fitting a curve to the spine; determining the vertical axis of the body; placing a slice plane across the abdomen close to the P2 position; extracting a cross section; and fitting a shape model to the cross section. Differential geometry revealed many qualitative features of the musculature. The spine was a line of minimum curvature along the back. The high-lysine pigs had higher height-to-width ratios and flatter backs than the low-lysine pigs.

Four dogs (German shepherd), four blue foxes and four mink were offered each of the experimental diets to determine apparent total tract digestibility. Average digestibility of crude protein (CP) in blue foxes and mink was similar, and lower than the corresponding value in dogs (0.834 and 0.831 v. 0.864) (P<0.001). CP digestibility in blue foxes showed significant correlations with dogs and mink (P<0.05), while no significant correlation was observed between dogs and mink. Average digestibility of most amino acids was significantly lower in blue foxes than in dogs (P<0.001), whereas mink digested most essential amino acids at the same level as did dogs. Most non-essential amino acids were digested at a significantly lower rate in the mink than in the dog and the blue fox (P<0.001). There were significant correlations in the digestibility of most amino acids between dogs and blue foxes, and between blue foxes and mink (P<0.05). Correlations were significant between dogs and mink for the digestibility of most essential amino acids (P<0.05) but not significant (P>0.05) for several non-essential amino acids. Average digestibility of crude fat was high and similar among the species studied : 0.968, 0. 967 and 0.959 in dogs, blue foxes and mink, respectively. Average digestibility of starch ranged from 0.971 in mink to 0.998 in dogs; significantly higher in dogs than in blue foxes and mink, and significantly higher in blue foxes than in mink (P<0.001). It was concluded that digestibility determined with mink, blue foxes or dogs may be used to predict digestibilities in the other investigated species. However, both the characteristics of the protein sources as well as the individual amino acid studied will influence the difference in digestibility among the species. 3adigestible protein 3ainterspecific variation 3aprotein sources 0aspecies differences1 aSkrede, A.1 aAhlstrom, O.1 aHove, K.0 tAnimal science : an international journal of fundamental and applied research.g2005 Aug., v. 81 p.141-148x1357-72987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://bsas.org.uk/Publications/Animal_Science/3electronic resource  a20060810b20060906c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/08  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02216naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245018400198300001800382500002400400506007600424520091500500506003701415650002301452650001701475650001601492650002501508650001501533650001401548650001401562700002001576700002101596773013601617852000901753856008001762655001201842IND4434902920221207114622.0100402e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443490292DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02735-092doi7 aPMC28491962pmcid7 a201730602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yongchao10aIncreased Crystalline Cellulose Activity via Combinations of Amino Acid Changes in the Family 9 Catalytic Domain and Family 3c Cellulose Binding Module of Thermobifida fusca Cel9A  ap. 2582-2588.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmino acid modifications of the Thermobifida fusca Cel9A-68 catalytic domain or carbohydrate binding module 3c (CBM3c) were combined to create enzymes with changed amino acids in both domains. Bacterial crystalline cellulose (BC) and swollen cellulose (SWC) assays of the expressed and purified enzymes showed that three combinations resulted in 150% and 200% increased activity, respectively, and also increased synergistic activity with other cellulases. Several other combinations resulted in drastically lowered activity, giving insight into the need for a balance between the binding in the catalytic cleft on either side of the cleavage site, as well as coordination between binding affinity for the catalytic domain and CBM3c. The same combinations of amino acid variants in the whole enzyme, Cel9A-90, did not increase BC or SWC activity but did have higher filter paper (FP) activity at 12% digestion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aThermobifida fusca 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrate binding 3acellulases 3acellulose 3adigestion1 aIrwin, Diana C.1 aWilson, David B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 76, no. 8 p.2582-2588dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02735-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02616naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245015500163300001400318500002400332500001500356520131300371650001201684650001501696650001001711650002401721650002201745650002601767650001101793650001201804650001401816650001801830650002301848650001501871650001501886650002001901651001201921653001601933700001801949700002101967700002101988773009202009852000902101856004802110655001202158IND4424878720221120045832.0090821e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442487872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-009-9894-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahib, Nargis10aExperimental study of the effect of hydrology and mechanical soil disturbance on plant communities in Mediterranean temporary pools in Western Morocco  ap. 77-86.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhysical soil disturbance and the hydrology of temporary pools affect the biomass, species composition and richness of plant communities. Disturbance liberates sites for the random recruitment of new individuals. The addition of seeds modifies the structure of the communities. In order to verify these hypotheses concerning the vegetation of temporary pools, an experiment was carried out using 72 soil samples collected from a pool in Western Morocco and placed in containers. Three types of laboratory treatments were applied, each combined with control treatments: soil disturbance (control/disturbed), hydrology (flooded, saturated and dry) and seed addition (sowing/no sowing). The total biomass, the annual and perennial species richness were calculated for each sample to test the effects of disturbance, hydrology and seed addition on the biomass and species richness of the various plant communities. The results show that disturbance reduces the total biomass, especially of perennials, but without significantly increasing the richness of annuals. Seed addition does not affect the total biomass and reduces total richness only in saturated soil, where biomass production is high. The most extreme stress conditions (drought and flooding) limit the abundance of species and therefore competition. 3aannuals 3aperennials 3aseeds 3acommunity structure 3aplant communities 3abotanical composition 3asowing 3adrought 3ahydrology 3asoil sampling 3abiomass production 3acontainers 3avegetation 3adisturbed soils 3aMorocco 0arecruitment1 aRhazi, Laïla1 aRhazi, Mouhssine1 aGrillas, Patrick0 tHydrobiologia.g2009 Nov., v. 634, no. 1 p.77-86dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9894-6 7aarticle02628naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002000168245007900188300001600267500002400283500001500307520122900322650002001551650002301571650001701594650002501611650001501636650002001651650001701671650001801688650001601706650002301722650001201745651001201757653005001769653001701819700002101836700002101857773010001878852000901978856009001987930003302077945002502110946001102135655001202146IND4426414420221123041602.0090924e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442641442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2009.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE550 0aX1001 aAgarwal, Sheela10aMeasuring the determinants of relative economic performance of rural areas  ap. 309-321.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper examines the determinants of economic performance of 149 English rural Local Authority Districts (LADs). A Three Stage Least Square (3SLS) estimation procedure was employed to jointly determine the influence of a wide range of indicators representing economic, human, cultural and environmental capital, as well as less tangible or 'soft' factors on three distinct components of economic performance: productivity, employment and labor market participation. The results reveal that a range of facets of economic and human capital, including the three key drivers of productivity (skills, investment and enterprise), spatial factors (peripherality and accessibility), and other key factors (economic structure, government infrastructure, road infrastructure, and occupational health), are significant determinants of economic performance in rural areas. This study is of value since it proposes a method for modelling the determinants of economic performance which is transferable to other environments in the UK and beyond. In addition, it proposes a set of benchmarks of economic performance using readily available data, and highlights some implications for rural policy and several avenues for future research. 3aeconomic trends 3aeconomic structure 3arural policy 3aeconomic forecasting 3aemployment 3ajob performance 3alabor market 3aleast squares 3arural areas 3aeconometric models 3acapital 3aEngland 0aThree Stage Least Square estimation procedure 0aproductivity1 aRahman, Sanzidur1 aErrington, A.

The vast distances between towns and cities in the American West can be a detriment to business, yet they also serve to attract technology and knowledge-based workers seeking to live in a picturesque setting. In spite of the increasing importance of amenities to migration and business location, also needed is access to markets, particularly via commercial air service. We test a new county classification system for the western United States to reflect differing degrees of access to population centers and account for the increasing importance of airports. Past classifications are based on population size and cross-county commuting. We examine the validity of this new classification and test for differences in economic performance among the three county types. Our findings show that there are three distinct Wests that can be classified using economic performance measures and socioeconomic characteristics. The results show that “metro” and “isolated” counties are clearly distinct, but “connected” counties, those that are rural in nature but have ready access to metropolitan areas via air travel, can be difficult to distinguish from “metro” and “isolated” counties. Much of the variation is explained by travel distance to airports. The findings illustrate the importance of airports in rural development, and the limitations facing those communities that are isolated from markets and population centers. The results apply to other parts of the world with similar characteristics that include large expanses of open space, natural amenities that attract migrants and stimulate new business, and different degrees of access to large population centers via road or air travel, and therefore different rates of economic growth. 3arural areas 3aairports 3aspatial distribution 3aeconomic impact 3apopulation characteristics 3aWestern United States1 aGude, Patricia H.1 aGude, Justin A.1 aVan den Noort, Jeff0 tJournal of rural studies.g2009 July, v. 25, no. 3 p.343-353dElsevier Sciencex0743-01677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/.1016/j.jrurstud.2009.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/10/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02792naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001900171245006700190300001600257500002400273520136800297650001801665650001101683650002301694650002601717650001901743650001201762650002601774650001001800650001401810650001601824650002301840653002201863653001901885653002701904653003201931653002201963653002401985700002102009773009702030852000902127856009302136930003302229945002502262946001102287655001202298IND4426414920221123041708.0090924e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442641492DNAL7 a.1016/j.biosystemseng.2009.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aX3301 aUshada, Mirwan10aDesign of customisable greening material using swarm modelling  ap. 169-183.  aIncludes references  aA greening material has different attributes for bio-physical, market and commercial functions. In designing a material, a plant factory has to select from a large set of initial design attributes. This paper presents swarm modelling (SM) to select the desired design attributes of customisable greening material. SM was developed by hybridising desirability model and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Design attributes were selected by predicting its consumer importance in a desirability model. Subsequently, PSO was used to optimise the model based on mentality constraints. SM was demonstrated on a case study of Sunagoke moss greening material (Rhacomitrium japonicum). The materials were classified into wet and semi-dry moss. The importance of a set of 24 attributes was predicted based on 15 mentality constraints. Constraints here included consumer prior knowledge, familiarity, agreement to material function and interest. Some of the bio-physical attributes were not selected due to the limited mentality. Four attributes were found to be the desired selections for optimal design of wet moss. For the semi-dry moss, there were 14. These attributes were validated successfully using a different consumer segment with minimum error. The desired attributes for the optimal design can be selected using consumer importance and its mentality constraints. 3awater content 3adesign 3aconsumer attitudes 3amosses and liverworts 3aquestionnaires 3atexture 3afunctional properties 3acolor 3aBryopsida 3agreen roofs 3aurban horticulture 0agreening material 0aswarm modeling 0aRhacomitrium japonicum 0aparticle swarm optimization 0aurban heat island 0agreening technology1 aMurase, Haruhiko0 tBiosystems engineering.g2009 Oct., v. 104, no. 2 p.169-183dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/.1016/j.biosystemseng.2009.06.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03990naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002400182245013400206300001600340500002400356500001500380520172600395650001802121650002702139650000902166650002202175650002002197650001602217650001202233650001702245650001502262650002602277650002202303650002802325650001202353650002102365650004502386650001602431650003902447650000902486650001102495650001902506650004302525650000902568650004702577650005302624650002802677650002802705650001502733650002802748653002802776653001802804653002402822700001802846700001902864700002002883700002002903700001702923700002502940773011602965852000903081856008503090930003303175945002503208946001103233655001203244IND4426410820221123000629.0090924e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442641082DNAL7 a192679482pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145092889822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aVerbrugghe, Adronie10aOligofructose and inulin modulate glucose and amino acid metabolism through propionate production in normal-weight and obese cats  ap. 694-702.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of dietary oligofructose and inulin supplementation on glucose metabolism in obese and non-obese cats was assessed. Two diets were tested in a crossover design; a control diet high in protein (46 % on DM basis), moderate in fat (15 %), low in carbohydrates (27 %), but no soluble fibres added; and a prebiotic diet, with 2·5 % of a mixture of oligofructose and inulin added to the control diet. Eight non-obese and eight obese cats were allotted to each of two diets in random order at intervals of 4 weeks. At the end of each testing period, intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed. Area under the glucose curve (AUC(gluc)) was increased (P = 0·022) and the second insulin peak was delayed (P = 0·009) in obese compared to non-obese cats. Diets did not affect fasting plasma glucose concentrations, blood glucose response at each glucose time-point after glucose administration, AUC(gluc), fasting serum insulin concentrations, area under the insulin curve, and height and appearance time of insulin response. Yet, analysis of acylcarnitines revealed higher propionylcarnitine concentrations (P = 0·03) when fed the prebiotic diet, suggesting colonic fermentation and propionate absorption. Prebiotic supplementation reduced methylmalonylcarnitine (P = 0·072) and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (P = 0·025), both indicating reduced gluconeogenesis from amino acids. This trial evidenced impaired glucose tolerance and altered insulin response to glucose administration in obese compared to non-obese cats, regardless of dietary intervention; yet modulation of glucose metabolism by enhancing gluconeogenesis from propionate and inhibition of amino acid catabolism can be suggested. 3adietary fiber 3aaspartate transaminase 3acats 3ahigh protein diet 3agluconeogenesis 3apropionates 3aobesity 3acat diseases 3aprebiotics 3aamino acid metabolism 3aglucose tolerance 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aBody Weight 2aCat Diseasesxprevention & control 2aCats 2aFemale 2aInsulinxblood 2aInulinxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aObesityxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aOligosaccharidesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aOrchiectomyxveterinary 2aOvariectomyxveterinary 2aPrebiotics 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0aoligofructose 0adietary supplements1 aHesta, Myriam1 aGommeren, Kris1 aDaminet, Sylvie1 aWuyts, Birgitte1 aBuyse, Johan1 aJanssens, Geert P.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2009 Sept., v. 102, no. 5 p.694-702dCambridge University Pressx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145092889823Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02131naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245005500144300001600199520080900215650001901024650002901043650005101072650005001123650005001173650005401223650002601277650002301303650001101326650002601337650005301363650001701416650003301433650005601466650002701522700001901549773010001568852000901668939003301677946001101710655001201721IND9300558720221122231209.0930128e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930055872DNAL7 a14572922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoleyar, V.10aAntibacterial activity of essential oil components  ap. 337-342.  aAntibacterial activity of fifteen essential oil components towards food borne Staphylococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. was studied by an agar plate technique. Cinnamic aldehyde was the most active compound followed by citral, geraniol, eugenol and menthol. At 500 microgram/ml, cinnamic aldehyde completely inhibited the bacterial growth for more than 30 days at 30 degrees C that was comparable to 200 microgram/ml of butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA). At lower temperatures, 25 and 20 degrees C, antibacterial activity of the five essential oil components increased. Addition of sodium chloride at 4% level (w/v) in the medium had no effect on the inhibitory activity of cinnamic aldehyde.

Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed that a radioactive protein with a relative molecular weight of 137,000 to 145,000 was present in both age groups. A strongly radioactive protein with an apparent Mr of 90,000 was, present in the 1-day-old animals but not in those that were 4 weeks old. The major radioactive protein present in the older pigs had an Mr of 64,000 to 67,000, but this protein was missing or very weakly radioactive in the younger pigs. There was no significant difference between the groups in receptor affinity for STa, although the receptor density in the older animals was marginally significantly greater. STa-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity in membranes from 1-day-old pigs was only one-sixth that in 4-week-old pigs, although the basal and Lubrol PX-stimulated activities were similar. 3apiglets 3ajejunum 3aintestinal mucosa 3aEscherichia coli 3aenterotoxins 3areceptors 3abinding proteins 3aguanylate cyclase 3aenzyme activity 2aAffinity Labelsxmetabolism 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnterotoxinsxmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aGuanylate Cyclasexanalysis 2aIntestinesxchemistry 2aMembrane Proteinsxanalysis 2aMolecular Weight 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxpharmacology 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexanalysis 2aReceptors, Guanylate Cyclase-Coupled 2aReceptors, Peptide 2aSwine 0aage differences 0abrush border membranes1 aParker, C.D.1 aWhite, A.A.0 tInfection and immunity.g1991 Dec., v. 59, no. 12 p.4318-4323x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01888naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245012000165300001800285500001500303520051100318650002800829650001600857650001300873650002300886650001400909650002200923650001200945650003000957650000900987650002400996650001601020650001301036650004101049650007301090650001401163653001601177653005501193653001401248700001801262773008301280852000901363939003301372946001301405655001201418IND9300560520221122231054.0930128e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930056052DNAL7 a16577892pmid7 aPMC2591062pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaifuku, R.10aTn1725 transposon mutagenesis of 9-18 delta 7, an EcoRI deletion derivative of Salmonella dublin lane plasmid pSDL2  ap. 4720-4723.  a2019-12-04  aA 37.5-kb derivative of the Salmonella dublin virulence plasmid pSDL2 was subjected to mutagenesis with the transposon Tn1725.

CD4+ T. parva-antigen-specific immune T cells have been shown to produce cytokines in response to stimulation with parasitized cells, and T. parva infected lymphocytes produce and consume T-cell growth factors and interleukin-2 (IL-2). To ascertain the role of T. cell cytokines on T. parva infections, we evaluated recombinant gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma), rIL-2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF-alpha) for their effects on establishment, proliferation, and survival of parasitized cells. The results indicate that neither rIFN-gamma nor rTNF-alpha had an enhancing or inhibitory effect on the growth of established T. parva-infected T-cell clones, whereas bovine rIL-2 increased the proliferation of infected B-cell and alpha beta T-cell clones but not that of gamma delta T-cell clones. To evaluate the effects of the cytokines on establishment of parasitized cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in their presence immediately following infection with T. parva sporozoites. Neither rIFN-gamma nor rIL-2 altered the proportion of cells initially developing schizonts, but both enhanced establishment of infected cell lines by about twofold. In contrast, rTNF-alpha resulted in about a 33% decrease in the proportion of schizont-infected cells. Inhibitory effects on establishment of parasitized cell lines by rTNF-alpha were no longer apparent by 12 days following infection. Tests conducted during this study indicated that T. parva-infected lymphocytes also spontaneously produce IFN that it neutralized by acidic pH treatment. In conclusion, we speculate that none of these T-cell cytokines are likely to have a profound inhibitory effect in vivo on T. parva infections. instead, IFN-gamma and IL-2 may facilitate the establishment of infection by T. parva. 3aschizonts 3acell growth 3aT-lymphocytes 3acattle 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterferons 3aTheileria parva 3acell lines 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amortality 3ainfection 3aB-lymphocytes 0acytokines 0aimmunologic factors1 aBaldwin, C.L.0 tInfection and immunity.g1991 Dec., v. 59, no. 12 p.4540-4546x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02173naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006700130300001300197520123500210650001501445650002501460650001301485650002701498650001601525650001901541650001501560650001501575650002301590650002001613650001601633653001501649700001501664773007901679852000901758939003301767946001101800655001201811IND9300557120221122215109.0930128e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930055712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmetten, K.R.J.10aMeasuring the hydraulic properties of a stable aggregated soil  ap. 1-13.  aReliable modelling of soil-water flow requires accurate and convenient measurement of the appropriate soil hydraulic properties, which can be particularly problematic in structured soils with a distinct macropore-matrix dichotomy in the flow regime. In this paper the hydraulic properties of an aggregated soil at water supply potentials, near saturation are obtained using the disc permeameter. The sorptivity, S, the hydraulic conductivity, and the wetting soil-water characteristic, are measured directly. The soil-water diffusivity, is derived from measurements of hydraulic conductivity and wetting soil-water characteristic and is also shown to be well described by deconvoluting the sorptivity using the Parlange approximation. This description of soil-water diffusivity conveniently supplements estimates obtained over a wider range of water contents using the absorption method of Bruce and Klute, with water content profiles obtained by gamma scanning. Finally, the measured hydraulic conductivity function is accurately described by introduction of a method for scaling wetting soil-water characteristic over the inter- and intra-aggregate flow regions and matching to the measured hydraulic conductivity at two points. 3aloam soils 3asoil water potential 3asorption 3ahydraulic conductivity 3adiffusivity 3amacropore flow 3amacropores 3amicropores 3asoil water content 3asoil aggregates 3awettability 0asaturation1 aKirkby, C.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1990 Sept., v. 117, no. 1/4 p.1-13x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01644naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008800129300001600217520089800233650002501131650002401156650001201180650001501192650001901207700002001226773006701246852000901313939003301322946001101355655001201366IND9300557920221122183242.0930128s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930055792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHierro, M.T.G.10aSupercritical fluid extraction of vegetable and animal fats with CO2--a mini review  ap. 189-192.  aThe application of supercritical fluid extraction techniques in vegetable and animal fats is reviewed. Most of the published work has dealt with applications of supercritical CO2 to extract vegetable oils. In general, the efficiency of the extraction increases with pressure as well as with temperature. provided the pressure is higher than 345 bar. The use of entrainers to enhance the extraction of lipids was also taken into account. Since the glycerides containing polyunsaturated fatty acids have important pharmacological applications, some procedures have been developed for extraction of these compounds from animal fats. Considerable work has been carried out on the extraction of cholesterol from fat. Fractionation of milk fat yields fractions with short- and medium-chain fatty acids enriched in cholesterol and fractions with medium- and long-chain fatty acids low in cholesterol. 3aanimal fats and oils 3aplant fats and oils 3aliquids 3aextraction 3acarbon dioxide1 aSanta-Maria, G.0 tFood chemistry.g1992, v. 45, no. 3 p.189-192x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03181naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245021700192300001600409520127800425650002201703650002301725650001601748650001301764650001101777650002201788650001501810650002601825650002501851650001201876650001101888650001701899650002301916650000801939650001201947650002601959650001501985650003602000650006202036650003302098650005102131650001302182650002102195650003802216653002302254653001902277653001902296700001502315773012702330852000902457856009302466930003302559946001102592655001202603IND4390936220221121212849.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439093622DNAL7 a174515182pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02102.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunasekera, T.S.10aEcological impact of solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B: 320-290 nm) radiation on Corynebacterium aquaticum and Xanthomonas sp. colonization on tea phyllosphere in relation to blister blight disease incidence in the field  ap. 513-519.  aTo assess the effects of solar UV-B radiation on phyllosphere bacteria of tea leaves in relation to blister blight disease in the field. The effects of UV-B radiation on the phyllosphere microbiology of tea (Camellia sinensis) were studied in contrasting wet and dry seasons at a tropical site. Wavelength-selective filters were used to separate the effects of UV-B from those of other factors. Bacterial populations were quantified in relation to the incidence of blister blight disease. Attenuation of UV-B increased the survival of Xanthomonas sp. when populations were not water limited, and increased the incidence of blister blight, but had no effect on Corynebacterium aquaticum. The effects of solar UV-B on phyllosphere bacteria were substantial but depended on both species and interactions with other environmental variables. Xanthomonas sp. was more sensitive to UV-B than C. aquaticum, but this did not result in differences in population density under high radiation conditions (dry season), but only in the wet season when other factors were not limiting. The role of UV-B on leaf surface microbiology in the tropics is marked but depends on other conditions, and the contrasting UV-B responses of different organisms can be masked by other limiting factors. 3aCamellia sinensis 3aLeifsonia aquatica 3aXanthomonas 3abacteria 3ablight 3adisease incidence 3adry season 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3afilters 3aleaves 3aphyllosphere 3apopulation density 3atea 3atropics 3aultraviolet radiation 3awet season 2aCamellia sinensisxmicrobiology 2aCorynebacteriumxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiologyxradiation effects. 2aSunlight 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aXanthomonasxgrowth & development 0aExobasidium vexans 0aUV-B radiation 0aXanthomonas sp1 aPaul, N.D.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.513-519dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02102.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03189naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245013500186300001600321520127400337650002401611650001201635650001101647650001201658650002301670650001001693650001701703650001301720650001601733650002501749650002301774650001801797650002001815650003301835650002901868650001101897650002501908650003001933650001701963650004101980650006902021650002302090650003502113650002902148650003502177650002302212653002002235653002202255700002202277700001502299773012802314852000902442856009202451930003302543946001102576655001202587IND4392455320221121212922.0070617e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439245532DNAL7 a175762172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02137.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohn, R.P.10aPolyurethane foam as an inert carrier for the production of L(+)-lactic acid by Lactobacillus casei under solid-state fermentation  ap. 582-587.  aProduction of l-lactic acid in solid-state fermentation (SSF) using polyurethane foam (PUF) as inert support moistened with cassava bagasse starch hydrolysate. PUF impregnated with cassava bagasse starch hydrolysate as major carbon source was used for the production of l-lactic acid using Lactobacillus casei in solid-state condition. The key parameters such as reducing sugar, inoculum size and nutrient mixture were optimized by statistical approach using response surface methodology. More than 95% conversion of sugars to lactic acid from 4 g reducing sugar per gram dry support was attained after 72 h when the inert substrate was moistened with 6·5 ml of nutrient solution and inoculated with 1·5 x 10⁹ CFU of L. casei. While considering the lactate yield based on the solid support used, a very high yield of 3·88 g lactic acid per gram PUF was achieved. PUF acted as an excellent inert support for L. casei and provided a platform for the utilization of starchy waste hydrolysate in a lower reactor volume. This is a cost effective cultivation of lactic acid bacteria for producing lactic acid from agro based waste products such as cassava bagasse. This is the first report on the exploitation of PUF as an inert support for lactate production under SSF. 3aLactobacillus casei 3abagasse 3acarbon 3acassava 3acost effectiveness 3afoams 3ahydrolysates 3ainoculum 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3anutrient solutions 3apolyurethanes 3areducing sugars 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolid state fermentation 3astarch 3astatistical analysis 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aFermentation 2aLactic Acidxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aLacticaseibacillus caseixchemistryxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aManihotxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPolyurethanesxchemistry 2aStarchxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSurface Properties 0acassava bagasse 0apolyurethane foam1 aNampoothiri, K.M.1 aPandey, A.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.582-587dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02137.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070617b20070702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02488naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245013800169300001600307520117700323650002601500650002301526650002101549650002401570650001001594650001301604650002501617653001901642653001801661653001901679653001501698700001801713700001501731700001701746700001701763700001301780773012801793852000901921856009201930930003302022946001102055655001202066IND4393357520221121212926.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439335752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02160.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanamasa, S.10aDevelopment of an efficient production method for β-mannosidase by the creation of an overexpression system in Aspergillus aculeatus  ap. 142-147.  aTo develop an overexpression system in Aspergillus aculeatus in order to establish an efficient overproduction method of β-mannosidase (MANB). An overexpression plasmid for the manB gene, encoding A. aculeatus MANB, was constructed and introduced into A. aculeatus cells. The gene was overexpressed under an improved promoter containing 12 copies of Region III cis-elements of Aspergillus oryzae in the transformant, and it secreted 2·56 mg MANB ml⁻¹ in liquid culture, which obtained a 9·4-fold higher productivity than that achieved in an overexpression system in A. oryzae. Most of the secreted protein in the cultured medium of the transformed A. aculeatus was the overproduced enzyme. Aspergillus aculeatus with the introduced overexpression plasmid produced 2·56 mg MANB ml⁻¹ in cultured medium. The improved promoter with A. oryzae Region III functioned in A. aculeatus; thus the strain is an expectant host for recombinant protein productions. The overexpression system with the improved promoter in A. aculeatus brought the highest productivity of MANB reported to date. The expression system would be a strong bioindustrial tool for protein production. 3aAspergillus aculeatus 3aAspergillus oryzae 3abeta-mannosidase 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aplasmids 3arecombinant proteins 0aβ-mannosidase 0ahemicellulase 0aoverexpression 0aRegion III1 aKawaguchi, T.1 aTakada, G.1 aKajiwara, S.1 aSumitani, J.1 aM.

A thermophilic bacterium, strain TSH1, was isolated from a contaminated soil. The macroscopic and microscopic features fit well with the description of Nocardia species. The results of 16S rRNA gene analysis showed 100% match to the type strain of N. otitidiscaviarum DSM 43242T. Strain TSH1 showed the same mycolic acid pattern as the type strain of N. otitidiscaviarum but its fatty acid profile did not permit identification to the species level. The carbon utilization profile of strain TSH1 was different from N. otitidiscaviarum. The results of hydrophobicity measurements showed that PAHs-grown cells were significantly more hydrophobic than LB-grown cells. Furthermore, biosurfactant production was detected during bacterial growth on different culture media. Strain TSH1 is capable of growing on a range of PAHs. When grown in PAHs-supplemented media, strain TSH1 showed a high affinity for the organic phase, suggesting that it can develop a hydrophobic surface. High cell surface hydrophobicity and capability of strain TSH1 to degrade different PAHs at 50°C may make it an ideal candidate to treat PAH-contaminated desert soils. 3aNocardia 3abiosurfactants 3acarbon 3aculture media 3adesert soils 3afatty acid composition 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrobial growth 3apolluted soils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aribosomal RNA 3aspecies identification 3athermophilic bacteria 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBase Composition 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnvironmental Pollution 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aGenes, rRNA 2aNocardiaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSurface-Active Agentsxmetabolism 0abiosurfactant 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation 0asurface hydrophobicity 0athermophile1 aVossoughi, M.1 aArdestani, S.K.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.622-628dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02241.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02645naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245011900187300001600306520115000322650002701472650001901499650001501518650001901533650003901552650001201591650001401603650001401617650002401631650003401655650001401689650004401703650007201747653002201819653002101841700001501862700001901877700001801896773012801914852000902042856009202051930003302143946001102176655001202187IND4398221620221122051717.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439822162DNAL7 a179082232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02242.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Flynn, G.10aSalmonella enterica phage-resistant mutant colonies display an unusual phenotype in the presence of phage Felix 01  ap. 581-585.  aTo investigate irregular colony morphology formation in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DPC6046 in the presence of a lytic phage, Felix 01. Phage-resistant derivatives of the parent strain DPC6046 were isolated which exhibited an irregular colony morphology. These were subjected to viability studies by using confocal scanning laser microscopy and live/dead BacLight stain to evaluate the cell viability within the colony. The phenomenon was also observed with other S. enterica serotypes tested which were normally sensitive to phage Felix. In the case of strain DPC6046, dead cells were clearly evident at the irregular edges of the phage-resistant colonies in locations where the cell density was lower. This colony morphology was not apparent with two other Salmonella phages tested. These findings support the hypothesis that the unusual morphology is due to reversion to phage sensitivity and consequent cell death within the colony as it forms. The irregular colony morphology observed is peculiar to phage Felix. The confocal scanning laser microscopy methodology allowed the basis for the irregular morphology to be elucidated. 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3abacteriophages 3acell death 3acell viability 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aserotypes 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMicroscopy, Confocalxmethods 2aPhenotype 2aSalmonella Phagesxgrowth & development 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxvirology. 0acolony morphology 0aphage resistance1 aCoffey, A.1 aFitzgerald, G.1 aPaul Ross, R.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.581-585dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02242.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03093naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245013400188300001600322520129700338650001401635650001101649650001101660650001601671650002201687650003901709650003401748650001201782650003701794650006201831650003001893650002301923650002701946650001101973650006101984650005002045650003602095653002702131653003002158653001202188700001602200700001602216700001602232700001502248700001502263773012802278852000902406856009202415930003302507946001102540655001202551IND4399285420221122051552.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439928542DNAL7 a179448582pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02269.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVezzulli, L.12aA general role for surface membrane proteins in attachment to chitin particles and copepods of environmental and clinical vibrios  ap. 119-125.  aTo investigate the role of surface membrane proteins (MP) to promote attachment to chitin particles and copepods of different environmental and clinical vibrios. The role of surface MP to promote attachment to chitin particles and the copepod Tigriopus fulvus was investigated in several environmental and clinical Vibrio strains by inhibition test methods. Attachment to both substrates was significantly inhibited by homologous MP treatment in all strains and percentages of inhibition were comparable with the ones observed with N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc). Sarkosyl-insoluble MP extracted from tested strains were added to chitin particles either in the presence or in the absence of GlcNAc and the fraction bound to chitin in both conditions was visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Chitin-binding proteins (CBP) defined as Sarkosyl-insoluble MP that bound chitin in the absence of GlcNAc but did not in the presence of the sugar were isolated in all strains. CBP are common in both environmental and clinical Vibrio strains and they have an important general role in mediating cell interactions with chitin-containing surfaces. The role of CBP should be taken into account when investigating environmental persistence of aquatic vibrios. 3aTigriopus 3aVibrio 3achitin 3aglucosamine 3amembrane proteins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2aAcetylglucosaminexphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesionxdrug effects 2aBacterial Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCarbohydratesxphysiology 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aCopepodaxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aMembrane Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aVibrioxchemistryxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aVibrio Infectionsxmicrobiology 0achitin-binding protein 0aenvironmental persistence 0avibrios1 aPezzati, E.1 aRepetto, B.1 aStauder, M.1 aGiusto, G.1 aPruzzo, C.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2008 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.119-125dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02269.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03464naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245010900187300001600296520145900312650003001771650001601801650001301817650001201830650001901842650001901861650002901880650001601909650001501925650001301940650003101953650001101984650001601995650001402011650001602025650001502041650001402056650001402070650001102084650004902095650001202144650002802156650005502184650004702239650002102286650002702307650002702334650002302361650005002384653001802434653002102452700002202473700002402495700002202519773012802541852000902669856009202678930003302770946001102803655001202814IND4398225220221122051600.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439822522DNAL7 a179448372pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02256.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThavasi, R.10aBiosurfactant production by Corynebacterium kutscheri from waste motor lubricant oil and peanut oil cake  ap. 686-691.  aProduction and characterization of biosurfactant from renewable sources. Biosurfactant production was carried out in 3-l fermentor using waste motor lubricant oil and peanut oil cake. Maximum biomass (9·8 mg ml⁻l) and biosurfactant production (6·4 mg ml⁻l) occurred with peanut oil cake at 120 and 132 h, respectively. Chemical characterization of the biosurfactant revealed that it is a glycolipopeptide with chemical composition of carbohydrate (40%), lipid (27%) and protein (29%). The biosurfactant is able to emulsify waste motor lubricant oil, crude oil, peanut oil, kerosene, diesel, xylene, naphthalene and anthracene; the emulsification activity was comparatively higher than the activity found with Triton X-100. This study indicates the possibility of biosurfactant production using renewable, relatively inexpensive and easily available resources like waste motor lubricant oil and peanut oil cake. Emulsification activity found with the biosurfactant against different hydrocarbons showed the possibility of the application of biosurfactants against diverse hydrocarbon pollution. The data obtained from the study could be useful for large-scale biosurfactant production using economically cheaper substrates. Information obtained in emulsification activity and laboratory-scale experiment on bioremediation inferred that bioremediation of hydrocarbon-polluted sites may be treated with biosurfactants or the bacteria that produces it. 3aCorynebacterium kutscheri 3aanthracenes 3abacteria 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3acarbohydrate composition 3aemulsifying 3afermenters 3akerosene 3alaboratory experimentation 3alipids 3anaphthalene 3aoctoxynol 3apeanut cake 3apeanut oil 3apetroleum 3apollution 3axylene 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aBiomass 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aCorynebacteriumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEmulsifying Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aLubricantsxmetabolism 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0abiosurfactant 0aglycolipopeptide1 aJayalakṣmi, Es.1 aBalasubramanian, T.1 aBanat, Ibrahim M.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.686-691dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02256.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03545naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167072001700184072001700201100001900218245012500237300001600362500001500378520144300393650001401836650002301850650002601873650001201899650001501911650002301926650001901949650003101968650002501999650002202024650002302046650002302069650002502092650002702117650003802144650003302182650003702215650005002252650002702302650003302329650002202362650001102384650001702395651001102412653002302423653002302446653001602469700001602485700001802501700001802519700001802537700001902555700002002574773008702594852000902681856008802690930003302778945002502811946001102836655001202847IND4364082320221122051628.0040824e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436408232DNAL7 a153708402pmid7 a10.1080/026520304100016987152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The peach samples (n = 150) were collected preharvest (June-August 2001) from both conventional (n = 55) and ICM (n = 95) cultivations from the Pella and Imathia districts of Macedonia, Northern Greece. The residue levels of selected insecticides, fungicides and acaricides in peach samples were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry following solid-phase extraction. The concentrations of all detected pesticides were lower than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) in all peach samples grown with the ICM system (p<0.001). However, chlorpyrifos residues at levels higher than the MRLs were detected in four peach samples (i.e. 7% of the total samples) grown by the conventional system. Comparing the results for both cultivation methods with the reported average percentage (3.6%) of fruit samples with pesticide residues above the MRLs (European Union report for Greece in 2001), it was concluded that the initial implementation of the ICM in Greece was successful. The present study indicates that ICM cultivation has a higher efficiency in terms of product safety and quality. Furthermore, the results suggest that the application of conventional cultivation requires continuous monitoring of various crop protection product levels. 3araw fruit 3aacaricide residues 3aquantitative analysis 3apeaches 3amonitoring 3afood contamination 3aPrunus persica 3aintegrated pest management 3ainsecticide residues 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3afungicide residues 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aChlorpyrifosxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFungicides, Industrialxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aInsecticidesxanalysis 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aPrunusxchemistry 2aSafety 2aTime Factors 0aGreece 0apesticide residues 0aanalytical methods 0afood safety1 aDanis, T.G.1 aStratis, I.A.1 aNikitovic, D.1 aDialyna, I.A.1 aAlegakis, A.K.1 aTsatsakis, A.M.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 July, v. 21, no. 7 p.670-677x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304100016987153Available from publisher's Web site  a20050216b20050301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02484naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167100001700184245013500201300001600336520083300352650001601185650002301201650001701224650001701241650002801258650001801286650001601304650001501320650001301335650001201348650001301360650001501373650001201388650001801400650002701418650005201445650002401497650001501521650005001536650003301586650001301619650001301632653001701645700001501662773008701677852000901764856008801773930003301861945002501894946001101919655001201930IND4364596920221122051550.0040921e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436459692DNAL7 a153708292pmid7 a10.1080/026520304123312823942doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The extraction mixtures used were chloroform-water (100 + 10), acetonitrile-water (60 + 40), acetone-water (85 + 15) and methanol-water (80 + 20). The analytical values determined from the extraction mixtures after correction for recovery were 211, 204, 163 and 120 microgram kg-1, respectively. The small amounts of aflatoxin B2 in the reference material followed the same pattern. The selection of extraction solvent mixture is very important for achieving the true value and that correction for recovery does not always fully compensate for getting the correct analytical value. 3apeanut meal 3afood contamination 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin B2 3amicrobial contamination 3afood analysis 3amethodology 3aextraction 3asolvents 3aacetone 3amethanol 3achloroform 2aAcetone 2aAcetonitriles 2aAflatoxin B1xanalysis 2aAflatoxinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aArachisxchemistry. 2aChloroform 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aMethanol 2aSolvents 0aacetonitrile1 aNyberg, M.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.781-785x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304123312823943Available from publisher's Web site  a20050217b20050301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02879naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167100003500184245007300219300001600292520107400308650002401382650002101406650001201427650002501439650002301464650001701487650001201504650001201516650001201528650002101540650002601561650003501587650001201622650002201634650003201656650004001688650003101728650001001759650002401769650004401793650005701837650003301894650001101927650004001938650002501978650002302003651001002026773008702036852000902123856008802132930003302220945002502253946001102278655001202289IND4364596320221122051629.0040921e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436459632DNAL7 a153708262pmid7 a10.1080/026520304100017138612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The mercury (Hg) content of the supplements was measured using an Hg analyser. Recoveries ranged from 92 to 98% for Hg, Cd and As analyses. Fifty-five brands of Ca supplements were classified into seven categories based on the major composite: bone, milk, oyster/clam shell, egg shell, algae, shark cartilage and chelated. The means of Hg, Cd and As in Ca supplements were 0.01, 0.02, and 0.48 mg kg-1, respectively. Ca supplements made of shark cartilage had the highest means of Hg (0.06 mg kg-1) and Cd (0.13 mg kg-1). The mean daily intakes of Hg and Cd from the supplement were estimated as about 0.1-0.2 microgram, with both contributing less than 0.4% of provisional tolerable daily intakes set by the Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization Joint Food Additive and Contaminants Committee. 3adietary supplements 3adietary minerals 3acalcium 3achemical composition 3afood contamination 3aheavy metals 3amercury 3acadmium 3aarsenic 3atoxic substances 3aquantitative analysis 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 2aAnimals 2aArsenicxanalysis 2aArsenic Poisoningxetiology 2aCadmiumxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aCalcium, Dietaryxanalysis 2aChild 2aDietary Supplements 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effects 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMercuryxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aOstreidaexchemistry 2aSharksxmetabolism 0aKorea0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.763-767x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304100017138613Available from publisher's Web site  a20050217b20050301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02716naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245008000147300001800227520171700245650002501962650001201987650001401999650001002013650002402023650001702047650001102064650002202075653002302097653001502120653001502135653001602150700001702166700001602183773007602199852000902275939003302284946001302317655001202330IND9100599320221122042653.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059932DNAL7 a166678542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPickett, F.B.14aThe aux1 mutation of Arabidopsis confers both auxin and ethylene resistance  ap. 1462-1466.  aMutagenized populations of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were screened for plants capable of root growth on inhibitory concentrations of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. Four of the mutant lines recovered from this screen display a defect in root gravitropism as well as hormone resistance. The aerial portions of these plants are similar to wild-type in appearance. Genetic analysis of these four mutants demonstrated that hormone resistance segregated as a recessive trait and that all four mutations were alleles of the auxin-resistant mutation aux1 [Maher HP, Martindale SJB (1980) Biochem Genet 18: 1041-1053]. These new mutants have been designated aux1-7, 1-12 1-15, and 1-19. The sensitivity of wild-type and aux1-7 roots to indole-3-acetic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and ethylene was determined. The results of these assays show that aux1-7 plants require a 12-fold (indole-3-acetic acid) or 18-fold (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) higher concentration of auxin than wild-type for a 50% inhibition of root growth. In addition, ethylene inhibition of root growth in aux1-7 plants is approximately 30% that of wild-type at saturating ethylene concentrations. These results indicate that aux1 plants are resistant to both auxin and ethylene. We have also determined the effect of ethylene treatment on chlorophyll loss and peroxidase activity in the leaves of aux1 and wild-type plants. No difference between mutant and wild-type plants was observed in these experiments, indicating that hormone resistance in aux1 plants may be limited to root growth. Our studies suggest that the AUX1 gene may have a specific function in the hormonal regulation of gravitropism. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3aseedlings 3aroots 3aethylene production 3agravitropism 3aauxins 3agenetic variation 0agenetic regulation 0aresistance 0ainhibition 0agrowth rate1 aWilson, A.K.1 aEstelle, M.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1462-1466x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02105naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245012400143300001800267500001500285520113100300650001701431650001201448650002201460650001601482650002301498650001101521650001801532653001501550653001501565700001501580700001701595773007601612852000901688939003301697946001301730655001201743IND9100600020221122042554.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910060002DNAL7 a166678612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, K.10aD-glucosone and L-sorbosone, putative intermediates of L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis in detached bean and spinach leaves  ap. 1496-1500.  a2019-12-04  aD-[6-14C]Glucosone that had been prepared enzymically from D-[6-14C]glucose was used to compare relative efficiencies of these two sugars for L-ascorbic acid (AA) biosynthesis in detached bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., cv California small white) apices and 4-week-old spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., cv Giant Noble) leaves. At tracer concentration, 14C from glucosone was utilized by spinach leaves for AA biosynthesis much more effectively than glucose. Carbon-14 from [6-14C]glucose underwent considerable redistribution during AA formation, whereas 14C from [6-14C]glucosone remained almost totally in carbon 6 of AA. In other experiments with spinach leaves, L-[U-14C]sorbosone was found to be equivalent to [6-14C]glucose as a source of 14C for AA. In the presence of 0.1% D-glucosone, conversion of [6-14C] glucose into labeled AA was greatly repressed. In a comparable experiment with L-sorbosone replacing D-glucosone, the effect was much less. The experiments described here give substance to the proposal that D-glucosone and L-sorbosone are putative intermediates in the conversion of D-glucose to AA in higher plants. 3abiosynthesis 3aglucose 3aSpinacia oleracea 3ametabolites 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aleaves 3aascorbic acid 0ametabolism 0aprecursors1 aNick, J.A.1 aLoewus, F.A.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1496-1500x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03348naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002400167245013300191300001600324500002400340520171700364650001602081650001302097650001102110650001302121650001802134650001602152650002502168650002502193650004702218650001202265650001602277650003602293650002102329650000902350650004602359650001102405650001802416650001102434650001702445650000902462650002402471650001602495651001102511651001102522700002502533700002602558700002302584773009002607852000902697856008802706655001202794IND4371022420221122031920.0050606s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437102242DNAL7 a153271202pmid7 a10.1080/000716604100017308332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegura-Correa, J.C.10aProductive performance of Creole chickens and their crosses raised under semi-intensive management conditions in Yucatan, Mexico  ap. 342-345.  aIncludes references  a1. The productive performance of 4 chicken breed groups managed under semi-intensive conditions in Yucatan, Mexico was evaluated. Thirty-six mixed chickens, one week of age of each of the 4 breed groups (Creole, F1 Hubbard x Creole, 7/8 Hubbard x 1/8 Creole and Hubbard) were used. 2. During 1 to 3 weeks of age all birds were fed on a diet containing 210 g/kg crude protein (CP) and 12.95 MJ/kg metabolisable energy (ME). From weeks 4 to 7, they were given a diet with 190 g/kg CP and 12.55 MJ/kg ME. Food consumption and live body weight were recorded weekly. Statistical analysis of the data was performed according to complete randomised design and means comparison using Tukey test was carried out when necessary. 3. Creole chicks had the lightest weights at all ages as compared to their crosses and the Hubbard birds. At 7 weeks of age, Creole chicks were 2.11, 2.44 and 2.90 times lighter than their contemporary F1, 7/8 Hubbard x 1/8 Creole and Hubbard birds, respectively. Hubbard birds were heavier than F1 and 7/8 commercial x 1/8 Creole birds, and the latter group heavier than the F1 birds. Similarly, Creole chicks had the lowest growth rate compared to the other genetic groups. Heterosis for body weight up to 7 weeks of age was 8.2%. 4. Feed consumption was also lower for the Creole chicks at all ages. Food:gain ratio, however, was higher for the Creole chicks at all ages. Food:gain ratios from weeks 2 to 7 were 2.18, 2.65, 3.04 and 4.36 for the Hubbard, 7/8 Hubbard x 1/8 Creole, F1 and Creole birds, respectively. Heterosis for food:gain ratio from 2 to 7 weeks of age was -7.0%. 5.

Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that domestication and artificial selection have influenced the posthatch growth and functioning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of ducks. The mass and length of the GI tract organs, the growth of intestinal villi, the intestinal surface area and the activities of brush border digestive enzymes were measured in a commercial strain of Pekin duck and its wild ancestor, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), at regular intervals between hatch and 16 weeks of age. 2. The growth of the digestive organs, with respect to body mass, was described using allometry. Allometric mass exponents were then used to calculate body 'mass-corrected', or 'relative' organ masses, relative surface areas and relative enzyme activities. There were appreciable differences between data presented on a mass-specific (g/kg) and a mass-corrected (g/kg(b)) basis, which highlighted the importance of correcting for the complete effects of body mass when comparing the growth and function of the digestive system between strains. 3. While the process of domestication has induced major changes in the absolute characteristics of the GI tract, it has failed to have the same effect on the relative characteristics. During the first 2 weeks posthatch, the relative masses of the majority of digestive organs, and the GI tract as a whole, were the same in both strains. During weeks 3 to 5, domesticated ducks maintained higher absolute growth rates of the body and the GI tract, with the support of relatively smaller digestive organs. The relative masses of the small intestine and the GI tract as a whole were 45 and 66% higher respectively in mallards than in Pekin ducks during this period. 4. Domesticated ducks had elevated digestive enzyme activity and a greater absorptive surface area than mallards throughout development, both in absolute and relative terms. This appears to compensate for the failure of the relative masses of digestive organs in domesticated ducks to accompany the increased body mass and growth rate. 5. At 5 weeks posthatch, the absolute mass of the small intestine in domesticated ducks declined by 38%. There is no obvious explanation for this decline because the masses of other digestive organs, daily feed intake and body mass continued to rise. 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aPekin 3aallometry 3aartificial selection 3adigestive enzymes 3adomestication 3aducks 3aenzyme activity 3afeed intake 3amicrovilli 3asmall intestine 3asurface area 3avilli 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxgrowth & development 2aAnimals, Wildxgrowth & development 2aBiometry 2aBody Weight 2aDigestive Systemxgrowth & development 2aDigestive System Physiological Phenomena 2aDucksxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aIntestine, Smallxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aMicrovillixultrastructure 2aOrgan Size 2aSelection, Genetic1 aButler, P.J.1 aKenyon, B.P.0 tBritish poultry science.g2004 June, v. 45, no. 3 p.331-341dLongmanx0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716604100017308243Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02868naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001200129245010800141300001800249520177900267650001502046650002102061650001202082650001302094650002102107650001602128650001902144650001002163650001502173650002502188650002102213650002002234650002102254653002102275700001302296700001802309773007602327852000902403939003302412946001302445655001202458IND9100595620221122031855.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059562DNAL7 a166678172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Y.10aLysophosphatidate acyltransferase in the microsomes from maturing seeds of meadowfoam (Limnanthes alba)  ap. 1199-1206.  aLysophosphatidate (LPA) acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.51) in the microsomes from the maturing seeds of meadowfoam (Limnanthes alba), nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus), palm (Syagrus cocoides), castor bean (Ricinus communis), soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays), and rapeseed (Brassica napus) were tested for their specificities toward 1-oleoyl-LPA or 1-erucoyl-LPA, and oleoyl coenzyme A (CoA) or erucoyl CoA. All the enzymes could use either of the two acyl acceptors and oleoyl CoA, but only the meadowfoam enzyme could use erucoyl CoA as the acyl donor to produce dierucoyl phosphatidic acid (PA). The meadowfoam enzyme was studied further. It had an optimal activity at pH 7 to 8, and its activity was inhibited by 1 millimolar MnCl2, ZnCl2, or p-chloromercuribenzoate. In a test of substrate specificity using increasing concentrations of either 1-oleoyl-LPA or 1-erucoyl-LPA, and either oleoyl CoA or erucoyl CoA, the enzyme activity in producing PA was highest for dioleoyl-PA, followed successively by 1-oleoyl-2-erucoyl-PA, dierucoyl-PA, and 1-erucoyl-2-oleoyl-PA. In a test of substrate selectivity using a fixed combined concentration, but varying proportions, of 1-oleoyl-LPA and 1-erucoyl-LPA, and of oleoyl CoA and erucoyl CoA, the enzyme showed a pattern of acyl preference similar to that observed in the test of substrate specificity, but the preference toward oleoyl moiety in the substrates was slightly stronger. The meadowfoam microsomes could convert [14C]glycerol-3-phosphate phosphate to diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols in the presence of erucoyl CoA. The meadowfoam LPA acyltransferase is unique in its ability to produce dierucoyl-PA, and should be a prime candidate for use in the production of trierucin oils in rapeseed via genetic engineering. 3aLimnanthes 3aTropaeolum majus 3aSyagrus 3aZea mays 3aRicinus communis 3aGlycine max 3aBrassica napus 3aseeds 3amicrosomes 3achemical composition 3aacyltransferases 3aenzyme activity 3aseed development 0asyagrus cocoides1 aOo, K.C.1 aHuang, A.H.C.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1199-1206x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02441naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245013200150300001800282520159900300650002601899650002101925650001301946650002601959650001301985650002201998773007602020852000902096939003302105946001302138655001202151IND9100594120221122031856.0910204e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059412DNAL7 a166678022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilhorst, H.W.M.10aDose-response analysis of factors involved in germination and secondary dormancy of seeds of Sisymbrium officinale. II. Nitrate  ap. 1096-1102.  aThe role of nitrate as a promoter of germination of Sisymbrium officinale seeds was examined in optimal light conditions. It was shown that the requirement for nitrate was absolute. This was true for all seed lots used. The probit of germination in water was log-linearly related to the level of endogenous nitrate. Preincubation at 15 degrees C resulted in an immediate decrease in germination, whereas in 25 millimolar KNO3 the decrease was delayed. The decline of germination in water was strongly correlated with the rate at which nitrate leached from the seeds. The germination response to a range of KNO3 concentrations was followed during preincubation at 24-hour intervals. During the entire 264-hour preincubation period increasingly higher nitrate concentrations were required to maintain a response. This resulted in a right-hand shift of the dose-response curve parallel to the X axis. After 120 hours the high maximum germination level started to decline. The dose-response curves could be simulated by an equation from the receptor-occupancy theory. It is proposed that induction of secondary dormancy is a result of a decrease of the number of nitrate receptors. After 24 and 48 hours of preincubation, the nitrate-response curves were biphasic. The biphasic character could be related to the level of endogenous nitrate and to a differential requirement for nitrate of two fractions of the seed population. Similarities with the behavior of fluence-response curves after prolonged dark incubation led to the hypothesis that phytochrome and nitrate share the same site of action. 3aSisymbrium officinale 3aseed germination 3adormancy 3anutrient requirements 3anitrates 3asimulation models0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1096-1102x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02019naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245014100147300001800288520111500306650001601421650001401437650001401451650001201465650001501477650001901492650001801511653001501529700001801544773007601562852000901638939003301647946001301680655001201693IND9100596820221122031912.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059682DNAL7 a166678292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalatti, P.A.10aNodulation of soybean by a transposon-mutant of Rhizobium fredii USDA257 is subject to competitive nodulation blocking by other rhizobia  ap. 1276-1281.  aRhizobium fredii USDA257 fails to nodulate the improved soybean [Glycine max (L.)Merr.] cultivar McCall in plastic growth pouches. Mutant 257DH4, which was derived from USDA257 by transposon mutagenesis, forms nitrogen fixing nodules under these conditions. If USDA257 is present in inocula containing the mutant, most infections are arrested prior to organization of the nodule meristem, and nodule number is reduced by 95%. The improved cultivars Essex, Harosoy, Hodgson 78, and Vicoja, as well as a supernodulating mutant of Williams, respond like McCall to inoculation with such mixtures of bacteria. Nodulation blocking on McCall can be elicited by rhizobia other than USDA257, provided that they meet two criteria: Blocking strains must themselves be able to induce cortical cells of McCall to divide, and such divisions must proceed to the stage of nodule meristem formation. Nodulation by the mutant remains sensitive to a challenge inoculation with USDA257 for only the first 6 to 12 hours after inoculation. Nodulation blocking involving mutant 257DH4 thus appears to be a rapid, generalized process. 3aGlycine max 3acultivars 3aRhizobium 3amutants 3anodulation 3aroot meristems 3acell division 0ainhibition1 aPueppke, S.G.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1276-1281x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02353naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011100146300001800257520143000275650001801705650001001723650000901733650002601742650002601768650001301794650002301807650002001830700001601850700001801866773007601884852000901960939003301969946001302002655001202015IND9100597920221122031749.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059792DNAL7 a166678402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrusak, M.A.10aDoes iron deficiency in Pisum sativum enhance the activity of the root plasmalemma iron transport protein?  ap. 1353-1357.  aRoots of Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient pea (Pisum sativum L.) were studied to determine the effect of Fe-deficiency on the activity of the root-cell plasmalemma Fe2+ transport protein. Rates of Fe(III) reduction and short-term Fe2+ influx were sequentially determined in excised primary lateral roots using Fe(III)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Fe[III]-EDTA). Since the extracellular Fe2+ for membrane transport was generated by root Fe(III) reduction, rates of Fe2+ influx for each root system were normalized on the basis of Fe(III) reducing activity. Ratios of Fe2+ influx to Fe(III) reduction (micromole Fe2+ absorbed/micromole FE[III] reduced) revealed no enhanced Fe2+ transport capacity in roots of Fe-deficient peas (from the parental genotype, Sparkle) or the functional Fe-deficiency pea mutant, E107 (derived from Sparkle), relative to roots of Fe-sufficient Sparkle plants. Data from studies using 30 to 100 micromolar Fe(III)-EDTA indicated a linear relationship between Fe2+ influx and Fe(III) reduction (Fe2+ generation), while Fe2+ influx saturated at higher concentrations of Fe(III)-EDTA. Estimations based on current data suggest the Fe2+ transport protein may saturate in the range of 10(-4.8) to 10(-4) molar Fe2+. These results imply that for peas, the physiological rate limitation to Fe acquisition in most well-aerated soils would be the root system's ability to reduce soluble Fe(III)-compounds. 3aPisum sativum 3aroots 3airon 3anutrient requirements 3anutrient deficiencies 3aproteins 3anutrient transport 3aplasma membrane1 aWelch, R.M.1 aKochian, L.V.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1353-1357x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02350naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008300145300001800228500001500246520139300261650002501654650001601679650001201695650001201707650002501719650001901744650000901763653001501772653001601787653001101803700001701814700001401831773007601845852000901921939003301930946001301963655001201976IND9100596120221122031836.0910205e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059612DNAL7 a166678222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItzhaki, H.10aAge-related changes in petal membranes from attached and detached rose flowers  ap. 1233-1236.  a2019-12-04  aChanges in petal membrane properties during aging were studied in cut and in attached rose flowers (Rosa hybrida L., cv Mercedes). Both cut and attached flowers exhibited a growth phase characterized by an increase in fresh weight and an accumulation of membrane components. The growth phase, which was more pronounced in the attached than in the cut flowers, was followed by a senescence phase, characterized by a decrease in fresh weight and a decline in membrane components. In cut flowers, both the growth and the senescence phases were accompanied by a decrease in membrane fluidity and in the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, but the ratio of sterol to phospholipid increased. In attached flowers, while both the membrane fluidity and the sterol-to-phospholipid ratio remained unchanged during the growth phase, the senescence phase was accompanied (as in cut flowers) by a decrease in membrane fluidity and an increase in the sterol-to-phospholipid ratio. Unlike in cut flowers, however, the age-related changes in the ratio of unsaturation of fatty acids were not correlated with those of fluidity. Changes in the saturation of phospholipid acyl chains are commonly thought to influence membrane fluidity. Our observations question this view and suggest instead that the ratio of sterol to phospholipid may play the major role in maintaining membrane lipid fluidity. 3achemical composition 3afatty acids 3ahybrids 3acorolla 3adevelopmental stages 3acell membranes 3aRosa 0asenescence 0agrowth rate 0alipids1 aBorochov, A.1 aMayak, S.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1233-1236x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03045naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245008500186300001600271520144300287650002101730650002601751650002701777650003101804650001601835650002601851650001201877650001801889650003701907650004001944650004101984650005002025650003202075650003502107650004002142650004102182650004502223653001502268700001902283773012802302852000902430856009202439930003302531946001102564655001202575IND4398224020221122004705.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439822402DNAL7 a179448432pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02249.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouari, A.10aEffect of chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride on bacterial biofilm formation  ap. 652-656.  aTo study the effect of antiseptics on bacterial biofilm formation.

For Escherichia coli G1473 in the presence of chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride, for Klebsiella pneumoniae CF504 in the presence of chlorhexidine and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of antiseptics. For PAO1 in the presence of chlorhexidine and CF504 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, planktonic growth was significantly inhibited by a fourfold lower antiseptic concentration than biofilm development. For Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP53124 in the presence of antiseptics at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), a total inhibition of biofilm formation was observed. For Staph. epidermidis exposed to chlorhexidine at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC, or to benzalkonium chloride at 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 MIC, biofilm formation was increased from 11·4% to 22·5% without any significant effect onto planktonic growth. Chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride inhibited biofilm formation of different bacterial species but were able to induce biofilm development for the Staph. epidermidis CIP53124 strain at sub-MICs. Sublethal exposure to cationic antiseptics may contribute to the persistence of staphylococci through biofilm induction. 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantiseptics 3abenzalkonium chloride 3abiofilm 3achlorhexidine 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBenzalkonium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aBiofilmsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aChlorhexidinexpharmacology 2aEscherichia colixdrug effects 2aKlebsiella pneumoniaexdrug effects 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxdrug effects 2aStaphylococcus epidermidisxdrug effects 0aantiseptic1 aDi Martino, P.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.652-656dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02249.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01998naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010800147300001600255500001500271520074000286650002301026650002601049650001001075650001801085650000901103650002201112650002401134650002001158650001501178650001801193651001501211653001701226653001801243653002101261653001601282653002301298653002301321653002501344700001501369700001501384773007401399852000901473939003301482946001301515655001201528IND9100591820221122004821.0910204e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059182DNAL7 a166678732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbert, S.K.10aPhotoacoustic measurements in vivo of energy storage by cyclic electron flow in algae and higher plants  ap. 926-934.  a2019-12-04  aEnergy storage by cyclic electron flow through photosystem I (PSI) was measured in vivo using the photoacoustic technique.

Using trichome-bearing epidermal peels prepared from midveins of N. tabacum cv T.I. 1068 leaves, we found that chlorsulfuron reduced and modified radiolabeling of sucrose ester acyl acids derived from branched-chain amino acid metabolism. The herbicide did not effect formation and exudation of diterpenes which are products of isoprenoid metabolism. Treatment with 1.0 micromolar chlorsulfuron affected 8.5- and 6.3-fold reductions in radiolabeling of methylvaleryl and methylbutyryl groups of sucrose esters, respectively, and concomitant increases of 9- and 9.8-fold in radiolabeling of straight chain valeryl and butyryl groups, respectively. These results and others indicate that inhibition of acetolactate synthase causes an accumulation of 2-oxo-butyric acid that is utilized by enzymes common to Leu biosynthesis to form 2-oxo-valeric acid. Coenzyme A (CoA) activation of this keto acid gives rise to butyryl CoA, which is utilized to form butyryl containing sucrose esters. Alternatively, reutilization of 2-oxo-valeric acid by the same enzymes followed by CoA activation leads to valeryl containing sucrose esters. We propose that in trichome secretory cells synthase, isomerase and dehydrogenase enzymes which catalyze Leu synthesis/degredation in most tissues, convert iso-branched, anteiso-branched and straight-chain keto acids in the formation of sucrose ester acyl groups. 3abiosynthesis 3aradiolabeling 3asucrose 3atrichomes 3achlorsulfuron 3abiochemical pathways 3aamino acids 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aesters 0ametabolism 0aregulation1 aWagner, G.J.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.906-912x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02704naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245013100187300001600318520110000334650002901434650002501463650002701488650002701515650001301542650001201555650001501567650001401582650001301596650002101609650001501630650001601645650002001661650001201681650001301693650003801706650001301744650002601757650002901783653001801812653001501830700001701845700001601862700002301878773012801901852000902029856009202038930003302130946001102163655001202174IND4395529220221122004716.0070930e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439552922DNAL7 a178973772pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02213.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParry, J.D.14aThe use of ultrasonic imaging to evaluate the effect of protozoan grazing and movement on the topography of bacterial biofilms  ap. 364-370.  aThis study evaluated the effect of protozoan movement and grazing on the topography of a dual-bacterial biofilm using both conventional light microscopy and a new ultrasonic technique. Coupons of dialysis membrane were incubated in Chalkley's medium for 3 days at 23°C in the presence of bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella aerogenes) alone, or in co-culture with the flagellate Bodo designis, the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis or the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii. Amoebic presence resulted in a confluent biofilm similar to the bacteria-only biofilm while the flagellate and ciliate created more diverse biofilm topographies comprising bacterial microcolonies and cavities. The four distinct biofilm topographies were successfully discerned with ultrasonic imaging and the method yielded information similar to that obtained with conventional light microscopy. Ultrasonic imaging provides a potential way forward in the development of a portable, nondestructive technique for profiling the topography of biofilms in situ, which might aid in the future management of biofouling. 3aAcanthamoeba castellanii 3aKlebsiella aerogenes 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aTetrahymena pyriformis 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiofouling 3acoculture 3adialysis 3alight microscopy 3atopography 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 2aAnimals 2aBacteria 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aBiofilms 2aEukaryotaxphysiology 2aUltrasonographyxmethods 0amicrocolonies 0aultrasonic1 aHolmes, A.K.1 aUnwin, M.E.1 aLaybourn-Parry, J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Oct., v. 45, no. 4 p.364-370dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2007.02213.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01611naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245012700144300001800271520079300289650001301082650001601095650002601111650001501137650002301152650001501175773007601190852000901266939003301275946001301308655001201321IND9100592820221122004818.0910204e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059282DNAL7 a166677892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZocchi, G.10aComparison of the effect of indoleacetic acid and fusicoccin on the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol in maize coleoptiles  ap. 1009-1011.  aThe effect of indoleacetic acid (IAA) and fusicoccin (FC) on the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol in maize (Zea mays L.) coleoptiles has been studied. Coleoptiles were able to incorporate [3H] myo-inositol into the phospholipid fraction almost linearly for 8 hours. Thin layer chromatography analysis of total phospholipids showed that [3H]myo-inositol was incorporated only into phosphatidylinositol. Prelabeled coleoptiles treated with IAA showed a loss of the radioactivity incorporated in the phospholipid fraction, whose level decreased by 34% after 1 hour. Treatment with FC, on the contrary, did not modify the content of labelled phosphatidylinositol with respect to the control. The different effects of IAA and FC and a possible mechanism of IAA action on growth are discussed. 3aZea mays 3acoleoptiles 3aphosphatidylinositols 3ametabolism 3aindole acetic acid 3afusicoccin0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.1009-1011x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02869naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245019400172300001600366520122600382650003701608650002601645650002301671650003501694650001301729650002201742650002301764650000901787650002201796650001401818650002701832650002801859650004101887650001701928650002401945650001901969650001301988650000902001650001502010653002402025700002002049700001802069700001902087773012802106852000902234856007602243930003302319946001102352655001202363IND4388095820221121225751.0070221e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438809582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02079.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravanan, V.S.10aSolubilization of insoluble zinc compounds by Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and the detrimental action of zinc ion (Zn²⁺) and zinc chelates on root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita  ap. 235-241.  aTo examine the zinc (Zn) solubilization potential and nematicidal properties of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, Differential Pulse Polarography and Gas Chromatography Coupled Mass Spectrometry were used to estimate the total Zn and Zn²⁺ ions and identify the organic acids present in the culture supernatants. The effect of culture filtrate of Zn-amended G. diazotrophicus PAl5 on Meloidogyne incognita in tomato was examined under gnotobiotic conditions. Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAl5 effectively solubilized the Zn compounds tested and 5-ketogluconic acid was identified as the major organic acid aiding the solubilization of zinc oxide. The presence of Zn compounds in the culture filtrates of G. diazotrophicus enhanced the mortality and reduced the root penetration of M. incognita under in vitro conditions. 5-ketogluconic acid produced by G. diazotrophicus mediated the solubilization process and the available Zn²⁺ ions enhanced the nematicidal activity of G. diazotrophicus against M. incognita. Zn solubilization and enhanced nematicidal activity of Zn-amended G. diazotrophicus provides the possibility of exploiting it as a plant growth promoting bacteria. 3aGluconacetobacter diazotrophicus 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aaseptic conditions 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achelates 3aculture filtrates 3agas chromatography 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amortality 3anematicidal properties 3aorganic acids and salts 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3apolarography 3aroot-knot nematodes 3asolubilization 3atomatoes 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0a5-ketogluconic acid1 aKalaiarasan, P.1 aMadhaiyan, M.1 aThangaraju, M.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.235-241dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02079.x3electronic resource  a20070221b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02395naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245009500188300001600283520111400299650002501413650002201438650002901460650003701489650003601526650002301562650002901585650003201614650002601646653002001672653001301692653001801705700001701723773012801740852000901868856007601877930003301953946001101986655001201997IND4387080220221121225800.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438708022DNAL7 a172572492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02062.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRukayadi, Y.10aIn vitro anti-Malassezia activity of xanthorrhizol isolated from Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb  ap. 126-130.  aThis study aimed at investigating the anti-Malassezia activity of xanthorrhizol (XTZ) isolated from Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb. against Malassezia furfur ATCC 14521 and Malassezia pachydermatis ATCC 14522. The in vitro susceptibility tests for XTZ were carried out in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), using broth microdilution method with endpoint after 48 h. Time-kill curves were determined at concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 μg ml⁻¹. The MIC values of XTZ against M. furfur and M. pachydermatis were 1·25 and 0·25 μg ml⁻¹, respectively. The MFC of XTZ was 5 μg ml⁻¹ for M. furfur and 2·5 μg ml⁻¹ for M. pachydermatis. Time-kill curves demonstrated that treatment with 25 μg ml⁻¹ of XTZ for 5 h was able to kill 100% of M. furfur, while 20 μg ml⁻¹ of XTZ for 15 min killed M. pachydermatis completely. XTZ shows potential as an anti-Malassezia agent for inhibiting the growth of M. furfur ATCC 14521 and M. pachydermatis ATCC 14522 in vitro. XTZ may be a useful alternative for treating Malassezia-associated diseases. 3aCurcuma zanthorrhiza 3aMalassezia furfur 3aMalassezia pachydermatis 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCurcumaxchemistry 2aMalasseziaxdrug effects 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPhenolsxpharmacology 0aanti-Malassezia 0ain vitro 0axanthorrhizol1 aHwang, J.-K.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Feb., v. 44, no. 2 p.126-130dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02062.x3electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02811naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245006300188300001600251520124200267650001801509650001501527650001901542650001401561650002501575650000701600650001401607650001801621650002201639650001401661650002401675650003101699650001401730650001301744650003401757650006701791650001401858653003301872653002701905653001301932653002801945700001801973700001601991700001702007773012802024852000902152856007602161930003302237946001102270655001202281IND4387082520221121212902.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438708252DNAL7 a172572562pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02061.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrígido, C.10aModerately acidophilic mesorhizobia isolated from chickpea  ap. 168-174.  aOur aim was to evaluate the effect of acid and alkaline pH on chickpea rhizobia, and on chickpea-rhizobia symbiosis. Forty-seven rhizobia isolates obtained from 12 Portuguese soils were grown at pH 5, 7 and 9. Among these, 26 grew more at pH 5 than at 7, suggesting the existence of acidophiles. All isolates were identified as mesorhizobia by 16S rDNA partial sequence analysis. Molecular phylogeny of isolates based on partial 16S rDNA sequences suggests that pH tolerance might be species related. Further studies were conducted with six isolates, which were able to grow at acid pH. Isolates PT-35 and 64b grow optimally at pH 6-5-7, with a minimal pH range from 5 to 3, and may thus be considered as moderately acidophilic. Both isolates belong to a previously identified putative new Mesorhizobium species, based on 16S rDNA sequence. Two moderately acidophilic mesorhizobia isolated from chickpea were identified (PT-35 and 64b). A positive correlation was found between the symbiotic effectiveness at low pH and the acid tolerance of rhizobia isolates. This is the first report on moderately acidophilic mesorhizobia, and is an important contribution for the development of highly effective inoculants for chickpea in acid soils. 3aMesorhizobium 3aacid soils 3aacid tolerance 3achickpeas 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asymbiosis 2aCicerxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPhylogeny 2aPlasmids 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRhizobiumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSymbiosis 0achickpea (Cicer arietinum L. 0amoderately acidophilic 0arhizobia 0asymbiotic effectiveness1 aAlexandre, A.1 aLaranjo, M.1 aOliveira, S.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2007 Feb., v. 44, no. 2 p.168-174dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02061.x3electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02390naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245010300146300001600249500001500265520152100280650001501801650001701816650001201833650001801845650002301863653001501886653001501901700001901916773007401935852000902009939003302018946001302051655001202064IND9100590920221121212904.0910204e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910059092DNAL7 a166678652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunlap, J.R.10aAbscisic acid alters the metabolism of indole-3-acetic acid in senescing flowers of Cucumis melo L  ap. 870-874.  a2019-12-04  aExperiments were conducted to investigate indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism associated with postanthesis senescence of ovaries from nonpollinated muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) flowers. Flowers attached to the vine were allowed to senesce for 4 days after anthesis or were harvested at full anthesis and aged for the same time interval with or without access to water. The IAA ester, amide-linked forms of IAA, free ABA, and ABA esters increased in senescent ovaries from flowers left attached to the vine. Detaching flowers from the vine resulted in an accumulation of free and amide-linked IAA in the senescing ovary but suppressed accumulation of ester IAA. Free ABA failed to increase in ovaries detached from the vine. Subjecting detached flowers to water stress had no effect on the endogenous level of free ABA but resulted in the accumulation of ABA ester and suppression of any increase in free IAA. However, detached flowers treated with 0.1 millimolar ABA accumulated 75% less free IAA and initiated the synthesis of ester IAA. Detached flowers treated with ABA also accumulated high levels of ester ABA. These results suggest that the metabolism of free IAA in muskmelon ovary tissue is regulated in situ and not the consequence of external synthesis and importation. ABA appears to be transported into the senescing ovary from an external source and alters the IAA metabolism in such a manner as to suppress the level of free IAA while stimulating accumulation of the ester IAA. 3ametabolism 3aCucumis melo 3aflowers 3aabscisic acid 3aindole acetic acid 0asenescence 0aregulation1 aRobacker, K.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Nov., v. 94, no. 3 p.870-874x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02011naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015400125300001800279520096500297650002001262650002901282650002001311650001901331650001601350650002601366650001301392650001201405650001701417650002501434650001201459653001501471700001801486773009201504852000901596939003301605946001101638655001201649IND9100568820221121212838.0910131e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910056882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaurie, S.14aThe effects of compatible solutes on the heat stability of glutamine synthetase from chickpeas grown under different nitrogen and temperature regimes  ap. 1415-1422.  aThe activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) extracted from chickpeas grown under different nitrogen and temperature regimes was examined. Cytosolic GS (GS1) was much less temperature sensitive than chloroplastic GS (GS2). There was no change in the ratio of the two isoforms from plants with different growth temperatures. Specific activity of GS appeared to be independent of growth temperature and was little affected by nitrogen supply. In vitro studies were performed on the heat stability of GS2 in the presence of glycine betaine, proline, and myoinositol. The latter was most effective in preventing loss of enzyme activity at high temperatures. Glycine betaine was also effective as a heat protectant but enzyme activity in the presence of proline was lower than the control at temperatures above 30 degrees C. The importance of myo-inositol protection of metabolism is discussed in relation to the accumulation in chickpeas of another cyclitol, pinitol. 3aCicer arietinum 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aenzyme activity 3aheat stability 3aheat stress 3anutrient availability 3anitrates 3aproline 3amyo-inositol 3aglycine (amino acid) 3abetaine 0aregulation1 aStewart, G.R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 Nov., v. 41, no. 232 p.1415-1422x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02526naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245006900170300001400239520121500253650002401468650001101492650002401503650001101527650001401538650002701552653001501579653001101594653001101605653003301616653001201649653001001661653001401671653000901685700003101694700001801725700002301743700002401766773014501790852000901935856009201944930003302036946001102069655001202080IND4399326920221121025453.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439932692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01390.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPersson, Elna10aHeterocyclic amine formation during frying of frozen beefburgers  ap. 62-68.  aThe formation of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) was studied during frying of beefburgers with different fat contents (6.7%, 16.1% and 39%). Beefburgers were fried from the frozen state for 60, 90, 120 s, and until the centre temperature had reached 72 °C (approximately 150 s) in a double-sided pan fryer. The beefburgers were analysed for HCAs with solid-phase extraction and LC/MS detection, and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (Harman) and 9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (Norharman) were detected in all samples. The concentrations of HCAs ranged between 0 and 2.3 ng g⁻¹. The HCAs concentrations were fitted to a first-order reaction model. The amounts of HCAs in beefburgers fried from the frozen state were in the same range as in beefburgers that have reached room temperature before frying. Furthermore, it was found that the formation of HCAs is not only concentration-controlled but also mass transport-controlled and that kinetic models stated in earlier studies fit relatively well our analysed values on HCAs in fried beefburgers. 3aambient temperature 3afrying 3aheterocyclic amines 3amodels 3apyridines 3asolid phase extraction 0aBeefburger 0afrozen 0aHarman 0aheterocyclic amine formation 0akinetic 0aMeIQx 0aNorharman 0aPhIP1 aOroszvári, Bea Kovácsné1 aTornberg, Eva1 aSjöholm, Ingegerd1 aSkog, K.q(Kerstin)0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2008 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.62-68dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01390.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03386naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007100173300001400244500001500258520175800273650001402031650001602045650002302061650002302084650002202107650002302129650003102152650001302183650001402196650001402210650000902224650001102233650001002244650003202254650001202286650002002298650002002318650001302338651001202351653008302363653002302446653002602469653001702495700002202512700002002534773014502554852000902699856009202708930003302800946001102833655001202844IND4399327920221121025347.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439932792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01393.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchouri, Allaoua10aSoybean variety and storage effects on soymilk flavour and quality  ap. 82-90.  a2019-12-05  aSoymilk prepared from five soybean cultivars, grown in Ontario, were analysed for protein, oil, mineral composition, viscosity, colour, lipoxygenase (LOX) activities and flavour profile. Among the five soybean cultivars, the Vinton 81 variety contained the highest protein and the lowest fat. The yield of soymilk from all five cultivars was similar. Major differences were observed in viscosity and in the composition of both the soymilk and the okara. Higher protein and fat extractability was found in soymilk made from S08-80 and Vinton 81 varieties. Their okara protein contents were also among the highest. Minimum extractability was observed with S03W4 cultivar. Soymilk made from S 03W4 and Vinton 81 cultivars had the whitest colour (lowest ΔE values). Viscosity values were the highest for S08-80, FG1 and S20-20 varieties. Headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography was used to analyse volatile compounds in soymilk. A total of fourteen volatiles were identified, among which aldehydes and their corresponding alcohols were the major compounds. Similar volatile compounds were identified in all the samples analysed but at different concentrations. The highest LOX activity was observed in the Vinton 81 and S20-20 soybean cultivars, which had the highest total volatile and hexanal contents. A positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.82) between enzymatic activity and the total volatiles was observed. Vinton 81 cultivar was subjected to storage (at 18 °C and 50% relative humidity) for a period of 10 months. Soymilk was prepared at different times during storage. The results showed that the soymilk colour, LOX and total volatiles were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by the storage of the soybeans over time. 3acultivars 3acorrelation 3avolatile compounds 3agas chromatography 3arelative humidity 3aheadspace analysis 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3asoybeans 3aviscosity 3aaldehydes 3aoils 3aflavor 3acolor 3asolid phase microextraction 3asoymilk 3aenzyme activity 3amineral content 3aalcohols 3aOntario 0asolid-phase microextraction-gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer identification 0asoybeans cultivars 0aLipoxygenase activity 0alipoxygenase1 aBoye, Joyce Irene1 aZamani, Youness0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2008 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.82-90dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01393.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02283naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245012400174300001600298520091700314650002301231650002501254650001201279650001101291650001301302650001101315650001501326650001001341650001501351650002001366650001301386650001001399650000701409650001101416650001301427650002001440650001001460650001901470700001801489700003101507773014601538852000901684856007601693930003301769946001101802655001201813IND4390483020221121025609.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439048302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2006.01271.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrados, Francisco10aEffect of a powdered vegetable coagulant from cardoon Cynara cardunculus in the accelerated ripening of Manchego cheese  ap. 556-561.  aA powdered vegetable coagulant (PVC) obtained from the cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) was compared with calf rennet in batches of Manchego cheese, by determining different chemical, biochemical and sensory characteristics, which were monitored over a 6-month ripening period. For most chemical parameters (moisture, fat, protein, acidity, NaCl and pH) and water activity studied, no differences were observed between the two types of coagulants. However, higher casein hydrolysis was observed after 2 days of ripening in cheeses produced with vegetable coagulant compared with those made with rennet. Soluble nitrogen was significantly higher (P < 0.05) and the other nitrogen fractions were only slightly higher (P > 0.05) in cheeses with PVC.

Cylindrical samples of diameters (19.05 and 25.4 mm) and heights (5, 10, 15 and 20 mm) were tested under non-lubricated, lubricated and increased friction conditions. The deformation rate effect was also examined by performing compression tests at 50, 100, 200 and 400 mm min⁻¹. In the present study, parameters derived from compression to failure were failure strain (ε), engineering stress (F/A₀), true stress (F/Af), apparent elastic modulus (E) and energy at failure (Uv). As compared with non-lubricated friction condition, lubrication increased significantly the average ε value and decreased significantly the average F/Af value, but appears to have lower significant effect on the average F/A₀, E and Uv values. Failure strain, engineering stress and energy at failure increased with deformation rate, whereas true stress and apparent elastic modulus decreased. Failure strain increased with sample diameter and decreased significantly with sample height, whereas the rest of the failure parameters decreased when both sample dimensions increased. As compared with non-lubricated friction condition, lubrication results in a higher influence of deformation rate on the averageε, F/A₀ and Uv values, a similar influence of sample diameter on the average F/Af and E values, but a lower influence of sample height on all the failure parameters. In turn, increased friction results in a higher influence of deformation rate and mainly the sample height on the averageε, F/A₀ and Uv values, but a lower influence of sample diameter on all the failure parameters. Principal components analyses showed that principal component 1 is determined by ε, F/A₀ and Uv, and is strongly influenced by sample height, whereas component 2 is dominated by E, and is mainly influenced by sample diameter. 3adeformation 3aenergy 3aengineering 3afriction 3amodulus of elasticity 3apotatoes 3aprincipal component analysis 0aDeformation rate 0alubrication 0apotato tissue 0aprincipal components analysis 0asample dimensions 0auniaxial compression1 aAlvarez, M.

We report here seven new isoforms, which were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA. Amplifications were performed with degenerate primers corresponding to two short conserved sequence motifs ("CSDK" and GDGV") found in most P-type ATPases. A comparison was made of three CSDK-side primers, which were used either as totally degenerate mixtures or rendered less degenerate by substitution with deoxyinosine or fluorodeoxyuridine. Amplified genomic fragments were cloned, partially sequenced and shown to correspond to Arabidopsis genes by Southern blot analysis with gene-specific probes. One newly identified isoform. AHA10, was isolated as a cosmid clone and sequenced. The 5' and 3' ends of the gene were determined by comparison with the AHA10 cDNA sequence. AHA1O is the most divergent isoform characterized in the Arabidopsis family. AHA1O appears to be expressed primarily in developing seeds, as indicated by Northern blot analysis of AHA 10 mRNA and by the analysis of transgenic plants expressing a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene fused to an AHA10 promoter. Our results indicate that one function of this unusually large H+ -ATPase gene family is to allow for expression of different isoforms in different cell types. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3aH-transporting ATPase 3astructural genes 3aenzyme polymorphism 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aplasma membrane 3amultigene family 3aintrons 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aseed development 0apyrophosphatases 0aaha10 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aManney, L.1 aSussman, M.R.0 tMGG.g1994 Sept. 28, v. 244, no. 6 p.572-587x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03114naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100004200144245011200186300001800298520167400316650001501990650001302005650001902018650002102037650001302058650000902071650001602080650001302096650002402109650001502133650001802148650002302166650002002189650002402209650001702233650001702250651000902267653001702276653001402293653003002307653001802337653001702355700001902372700001802391773009502409852000902504930003302513945002502546946001302571655001202584IND4374331720221120223417.0050915e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437433172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The objective of this study was to characterize macroporosity of soils under a perennial grass hedge system for 12 yr using x-ray computed tomography (CT) and to compare CT-macroporosity results with macroporosity estimated from water retention data. Three positions were sampled: grass hedge position, deposition zone position 0.5 m upslope from grass hedges, and row crop position 7 m upslope from the hedges. Intact core samples (76 mm x 76 mm) were collected from two depths, 0 to 100 and 100 to 200 mm, with five replicates per position per depth. Number of pores (macro- and meso-), averaged across depths, in the grass hedge were nearly 2.5 times greater than those in the row crop and five times greater than in the deposition positions; however their circularity was 8.8% lower than in the row crop and 2.6% lower than in the deposition positions. The CT-measured macroporosity was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for the grass hedge position (0.056 m3 m(-3)) as compared with the row crop (0.014 m3 m(-3)) and deposition positions (0.006 m3 m(-3)). The fractal dimension (D) was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for the grass hedge position (D = 1.56) than in the row crop (D = 1.31) and the deposition (D = 1.12) positions. The values of all measured pore characteristics decreased with depth. Computed tomography-measured macroporosity data were comparable with macroporosity estimated from water retention data. These findings suggest that grass hedge systems have created more pores and a greater volume of macroporosity. 3amacropores 3aporosity 3aalley cropping 3aPanicum virgatum 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3acontinuous cropping 3ano-tillage 3acrop rotation 3aagricultural soils 3asilt loam soils 3acomputed tomography 3asoil density 3abulk density 3aIowa 0agrass hedges 0arow crops 0aX-ray computed tomography 0amacroporosity 0amesoporosity1 aAnderson, S.H.1 aGantzer, C.J.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 , v. 69, no. 5 p.1609-1616x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20051220b20060102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/10/05  aOther US 7aarticle03239naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245007700147300001800224520198200242650002902224650001202253650001502265650002102280650003002301650002402331650004002355650003702395650003602432650001302468650004302481650005402524650002802578653003602606700001902642700001802661773009502679852000902774939003302783946001302816655001202829IND9102802220221120211703.0910710e19910325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910280222DNAL7 a20050962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerostek, M.F.10aStructure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae alg3,sec18 mutant oligosaccharides  ap. 5547-5551.  aAsparagine-linked oligosaccharides are synthesized by transfer of GLc3Man9,GLcNAc2 from dolichol pyrophosphate to nascent polypeptides. Assembly of the precursor proceeds by highly ordered sequential addition of mannose and glucose to form Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Yeast mutants in asparagine-linked glycosylation (alg), generated by an 3H-Man suicide technique, were assigned to eight complementation groups which define steps in oligosaccharide-lipid synthesis (Huffaker, T.C., and Robbins, P.W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3203-3210). Alg3 invertase oligosaccharides are resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and the lipid-oligosaccharide pool yields Man5Glc-NAc2, suggesting its structure may be that from mammalian cells lacking Man-p-dolichol (Chapman, A., et al. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4441-4446). To test this supposition, the endoplasmic reticulum form of invertase derepressed in alg3,secl8 yeast at 37 degrees C was isolated as a source of oligosaccharides whose processing beyond glucose and/or mannose trimming, if involved, would be prevented. Man8GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2 were released by peptide-N-glycosidase F from alg3,secl8 invertase in a 1:5 molar ratio. 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed Man8GlcNAc2 to be the alpha 1,2-mannosidase-trimming product described earlier (Byrd, J. C., Tarentino, A. L., Maley, F., Atkinson, P. H., and Trimble, R. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14657-14666), while Man5GlcNAc2 was Man alpha 1, 2Man alpha 1,2Man alpha l,3(Man alpha 1,6)Man beta 1,4GlcNAc beta1, 4GlcNAc. This provides a structural proof for the lipid-linked Man5GlcNAc2 originally proposed from enzymatic and chemical analyses of the radiolabeled mammalian precursor. Experimental evidence indicates that, unlike the mammalian cell mutants which are unable to synthesize Man-P-dolichol, alg3 yeast accumulate Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol due to a defective alpha 1,3-mannosyltransferase required for the next step in oligosaccharide-lipid elongation. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amutants 3aasparagine 3aoligosaccharides 2aCarbohydrate Conformation 2aChromatography, Gel 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMutation 2aOligosaccharidesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxmetabolism. 2abeta-Fructofuranosidase 0aasparagine linked glycosylation1 aAtkinson, P.H.1 aTrimble, R.B.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1991 Mar. 25, v. 266, no. 9 p.5547-5551x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03516naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016600158300001800324500001900342520209800361650002202459650002802481650001502509650002602524650001302550650001602563650001602579650001402595650001302609650002302622650002002645650002902665650001302694650001702707650001402724651001002738700001502748700001302763700001502776773017302791856004102964856004403005852000903049655001203058IND60726344020221120151606.0210204e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072634402DNAL7 a10.4315/JFP-20-0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Jiehong10aOccurrence of Virulence Factors and Antibiotic and Heavy Metal Resistance in Vibrio parahaemolyticus Isolated from Pacific Mackerel at Markets in Zhejiang, China  ap. 1411-1419.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVibrio parahaemolyticus is a widespread bacterium in the marine environment and is one of the leading causes of food-derived bacterial poisoning in humans worldwide. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, virulence factors, and antibiotic and heavy metal resistance profiles of V. parahaemolyticus in Pacific mackerel (Pneumatophorus japonicus) from different markets in Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. In total, 112 (31.11%) V. parahaemolyticus isolates were identified from 360 Pacific mackerel samples, with an extremely low occurrence of the virulence genes trh (1.79%, 2 of 112) and tdh (0%, 0 of 112). Antibiotic resistance testing revealed that most isolates showed resistance to ampicillin (96.43%, 108 of 112) and streptomycin (90.18%, 101 of 112), whereas all strains were sensitive to kanamycin, florfenicol, cefamandole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Furthermore, 46.43% (52 of 112) of isolates, which had 12 different phenotypes, were classified as multidrug resistant. In addition, the multiple antibiotic resistance index values of isolates were between 0.05 and 0.63, and the maximum multiple antibiotic resistance index was attributed to two isolates that exhibited resistance to 12 antibiotics. Heavy metal resistance patterns were similar among the six different markets. The majority of isolates showed resistance to Cd2+ (78.57%) and Pb2+ (51.79%), and fewer were resistant to Cu2+ (37.50%), Zn2+ (25.00%), Co2+ (9.82%), Ni2+ (6.25%), and Mn2+ (4.46%). No isolates were resistant to Cr3+. In total, 22.32% (25 of 112) of strains were multiheavy metal resistant. Furthermore, multidrug resistance and multiheavy metal resistance were found to be positively correlated in the V. parahaemolyticus strains by using Pearson's correlation analysis (P = 0.008; R = 0.925). This information will contribute to the monitoring of variations in the antibiotic and heavy metal resistance profiles of V. parahaemolyticus strains from seafood and provide insight into the appropriate use of antibiotics and the safe consumption of seafood. 3aScomber japonicus 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3aflorfenicol 3afood safety 3akanamycin 3amackerel 3amarine environment 3ametal tolerance 3amultiple drug resistance 3aseafoods 3astreptomycin 3avirulence 3aChina1 aCheng, Hui1 aYu, Ting1 aJiang, Han0 tJournal of food protection.g2020 Aug., v. 83, no. 8 p.1411-1419dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/JFP-20-09140uhttp://handle.usda.gov/10.13031/7263440  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010400161300001800265500001900283520182100302650001702123650002702140650001502167650002002182650002002202650001702222650001602239650001402255650001902269650000902288650001502297650002102312650002702333650001302360651001602373700002002389700001802409700001702427700002402444700002202468773017402490856004102664961000902705852000902714655001202723IND60726349720221120141142.0210204e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072634972DNAL7 a10.4315/JFP-19-4682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderegg, Janine10aDetection of Biogenic Amines and Tyramine-Producing Bacteria in Fermented Sausages from Switzerland  ap. 1512-1519.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFermented foods can cause human illness because of the unhealthy effect of biogenic amines (BAs) that accumulate by decarboxylation of free amino acids. Salami-type fermented sausages can contain BAs, but which bacteria and environmental factors contribute to BA production is not clear. Sixty-two sausages purchased from Swiss markets were evaluated for decarboxylating bacterial strains and concentrations of the BAs cadaverine, histamine, putrescine, and tyramine. Based on the size and number of employees of the meat processing plants, sausages were separated into two groups: artisanal and industrial. Concentrations of all four BAs were higher in industrial sausages than in artisanal sausages. Tyramine was the major BA detected in 46 of 62 sausages, at a maximum concentration of 785.22 mg/kg. Enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mainly the meat starter culture Staphylococcus xylosus) were the main tyramine producers. Putrescine was found in 20 of 62 samples, at a maximum concentration of 707.77 mg/kg. Concentrations of these two BAs were significantly correlated (P = 0.0407). Cadaverine and histamine were detected in nine and eight samples, respectively, and both were found in significantly higher concentrations (P = 0.019 and 0.036, respectively) in industrial sausages. Based on the tyramine concentration, five groups of fermented sausages were identified: group 1, very high concentrations (>700 mg/kg); group 2, high concentrations (400 to 700 mg/kg); group 3, moderate concentrations (200 to 400 mg/kg); group 4, low concentrations (<200 mg/kg); group 5, concentrations below the detection limit (0.05 mg/kg). Product samples with tyramine concentrations >200 mg/kg were considered of lower quality because consumption of such samples could be unhealthy for sensitive consumers. 3aEnterococcus 3aStaphylococcus xylosus 3acadaverine 3adecarboxylation 3adetection limit 3afermentation 3afood safety 3ahistamine 3ahuman diseases 3ameat 3aputrescine 3astarter cultures 3atraditional technology 3atyramine 3aSwitzerland1 aFischer, Mortiz1 aDurig, Jovana1 aDie, Alfonso1 aLacroix, Christophe1 aMeile, L.q(Leo),0 tJournal of food protection.g2020 Sept., v. 83, no. 9 p.1512-1519dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/JFP-19-468  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245011400170300001600284520177100300653001202071653002502083653002102108653002702129653002702156700002102183700001802204700002102222700002102243700002202264700002302286700002402309700002302333773013602356852000902492856008502501946001102586655001202597IND4450683320221120125313.0110316e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445068332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00228-010-0958-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoluzzi, Elisabetta 10aCardiovascular events in statin recipients: impact of adherence to treatment in a 3-year record linkage study  ap. 407-414.  aPurpose In the general population, lack of adherence to statin therapy remains a widespread phenomenon and an important matter of concern both in terms of cost-effectiveness and risk-benefit profile. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of cardiovascular events in Italian statin recipients, focussing on the relationship between degree of adherence to therapy and occurrence of events in a 3-year follow-up. Methods Our cohort consisted of all patients from Emilia Romagna (4,027,275 inhabitants) who received statin prescriptions in January-February 2005 and who were followed for up to 36 months for cardiovascular hospital admission (i.e. coronary disease, cerebrovascular accidents, peripheral arthropathy), adherence to statin treatment (proportion of days covered: ≥80%) and use of other cardiovascular drugs. The relationship between adherence and cardiovascular events was analysed by multivariate logistic regression; age, sex, other cardiovascular drugs and previous events were covariates of the model. Results Patients non-adherent to a statin regimen over the 3-year period (76% of the cohort) had higher odds of events, irrespective of risk factors, by more than 40% when compared with adherent patients. Odds of events were in particular: strongly non-adherent, adjOR = 1.19 (CI95% 1.15-1.23), slightly non-adherent, adjOR = 1.25 (1.21-1.30), highly variable in the amount of statins received, adjOR = 1.69 (1.62-1.77). Conclusions This study shows the key role of adherence to statins in cardiovascular prevention at any level of risk. Appropriateness of statin use needs not only careful selection of patients to be treated, but also cooperation between patient and physician to ensure continued drug use whenever treatment is appropriate. 0aStatins 0aMedication adherence 0aGeneral practice 0aCardiovascular disease 0aMedical record linkage1 aPiccinni, Carlo 1 aCarta, Paolo 1 aPuccini, Aurora 1 aLanzoni, Monica 1 aMotola, Domenico 1 aVaccheri, Alberto 1 aDe Ponti, Fabrizio 1 aMontanaro, Nicola 0 tEuropean journal of clinical pharmacology.g2011 Apr., v. 67, no. 4 p.407-414dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0031-69707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00228-010-0958-33Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03273naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012300163300001600286520162900302650002201931650002101953650001901974650002001993650001602013650001702029650001302046650001102059650001202070650004102082650001102123650001802134650001602152650002202168650001002190650002102200650002002221650002102241650000902262650001902271650001202290650002302302653002002325653002002345653001702365700001602382700001702398700001802415700001502433773010902448852000902557856008502566930003302651946001102684655001202695IND4450685920221120121117.0110316e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445068592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0652-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xue Feng 10aAllelopathic potential of Artemisia frigida and successional changes of plant communities in the northern China steppe  ap. 383-398.  aIn the northern China steppe, overgrazing has decreased the abundance of many species that were originally dominant, but increased the abundance of Artemisia frigida.

Volatile compounds released from A. frigida leaves and aqueous extracts (0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, and 0.15 g ml⁻¹) from A. frigida leaves and roots and from soil under A. frigida inhibited seed germination and seedling growth of three dominant species (Leymus chinensis, Stipa krylovii, and Cleistogenes squarrosa). Allelopathic activity varied according to extract concentration, test species, and extract source. Germination was most strongly inhibited in S. krylovii, followed by L. chinensis and then C. squarrosa. Seedling growth was most strongly inhibited in L. chinensis, followed by S. krylovii and then C. squarrosa. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of the leaf volatiles identified 27 compounds, primarily monoterpene or sesquiterpene compounds and their oxygen-containing derivatives, such as eucalyptol, beta.-myrcene, 1,6-octadien-3-ol,3,7-dimethyl, 3-carene, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one,1,7,7-trimethyl-,(1R), cis-sabinenehydrate, camphene, and alpha-Pinene. These findings suggest that allelochemicals from A. frigida can modify the surrounding micro-habitat. The responses of target plants to allelopathy of A. frigida may be one reason for changes in plant community succession in the northern China steppe. 3aArtemisia frigida 3aLeymus chinensis 3aStipa krylovii 3aallelochemicals 3aallelopathy 3aalpha-pinene 3acamphene 3acarene 3acineole 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aleaves 3amicrohabitats 3aovergrazing 3aplant communities 3aroots 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3asesquiterpenoids 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asteppes 3avolatile compounds 0aDegraded steppe 0aInhibitory rate 0aTest species1 aWang, Jian 1 aHuang, Ding 1 aWang, Li Xue 1 aWang, Kun 0 tPlant and soil.g2011 Apr., v. 341, no. 1-2 p.383-398dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0652-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20110316b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03094naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245009300194300001600287520161300303650002001916650001701936650001301953650002601966650002201992650001702014650002002031650001202051650001302063650000902076650002002085650002102105650002202126650001702148650001902165650002202184650002402206650003102230650002102261650001802282650002002300651001402320700001602334700001702350773009302367852000902460930003302469945002502502946001302527655001202540IND4380153720221120041134.0060512e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438015372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCorre, M.D.10aSoil nitrogen cycling following montane forest conversion in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia  ap. 359-366.  aThe lower montane forest zone of Indonesia is undergoing rapid conversion of indigenous forests to agriculture. In this tropical region, however, the effects of forest conversion on soil N processes have not been investigated. Corn (Zea mays L.) and cacao (Theobroma cacao L.)-coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre ex Froehner) agroforestry are the main land use types in cleared lower montane forests in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Our main objective was to compare the soil N dynamics under agroforest systems and corn cultivation with indigenous forest. We measured the gross rates of N transformation processes using 15N pool dilution. The agroforest systems and indigenous forests had higher gross N mineralization rates and faster turnover rates of NH4(+) and microbial N pools than the long-term cultivated corn sites. Faster soil N turnover rates in agroforest systems suggest a more dynamic soil N cycling. Leguminous shade trees, which are important components of these agroforest systems, may have influenced the fast microbial N cycling through release of N-rich root exudates and plant residues. Our results show that compared with corn, agroforestry is a better option in terms of sustainability in the N-supplying capacity of the soil. In addition, we measured higher 15NH4(+) recoveries than 15NO3(-) recoveries after 15 min of 15N addition in all our sites. Our measured rates of gross nitrification were very low to negligible, due to rapid disappearance of added 15NO3(-). Such fast reaction of NO3(-) warrants further investigation, especially in tropical areas where 15N studies are very few. 3amontane forests 3aforest soils 3anitrogen 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aagricultural land 3aclearcutting 3aland use change 3atropics 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aTheobroma cacao 3aCoffea canephora 3acoffee (beverage) 3aagroforestry 3amineralization 3aammonium nitrogen 3asoil microorganisms 3aorganic nitrogen compounds 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrification 3astable isotopes 3aIndonesia1 aDechert, G.1 aVeldkamp, E.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2006 , v. 70, no. 2 p.359-366x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20070315b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle02582naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245008000179300001800259500001500277520132000292650002101612650000901633650001301642650001501655650001701670650001301687650002701700650001201727650002301739650001501762650001501777650001901792650001501811651001301826653002901839700002001868700002201888700001501910773009501925852000902020930003302029945002502062946001302087655001202100IND4376191820221120041145.0051121e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437619182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Insufficient nutrient P seriously limits rice growth and yield. A local rock phosphate (RP) Kanchanaburi RP (KRP), a reference RP (Gafsa from Tunisia), and a KRP containing soluble P (KRPS) were used to investigate the dissolution and availability in six acid sulfate soils under flooded conditions. The soil properties that have a major influence on RP dissolution and P sorption were investigated for developing a model and algorithms for estimating the RP requirement for rice. High KCl-extractable aluminum (Al_KCl) and low soil pH enhanced the dissolution of KRP, Gafsa, and KRPS. The substantial calcium carbonate equivalent of the RP increased the pH of soils and limited RP dissolution. The P sorption of the soils was estimated using Bray 1 and 2 extractions. The P sorption was apparently greater than RP dissolution a few days after submergence in some acid sulfate soils, decreasing the Bray 1 level. Phosphorus extractable by Bray 2 increased with incubation time where KRP, Gafsa, and KRPS were applied. Amounts of RP predicted using an algorithm based on predicted dissolution and sorption in the various soils were similar to a local estimate of RP requirement. 3awater solubility 3arice 3asulfates 3aacid soils 3aOryza sativa 3asorption 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asoil pH 3aflooded conditions 3aphosphorus 3aalgorithms 3arock phosphate 3aprediction 3aThailand 0asoil chemical properties1 aAttanandana, T.1 aSidibe-Diarra, A.1 aYost, R.S.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 , v. 69, no. 6 p.2000-2011x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/11/30  aOther US 7aarticle02862naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002000178245012400198300001800322520165800340650001601998650002302014650001702037650002002054650002002074650002202094650002102116650001202137650001902149650001402168651001902182700001702201700001502218700002002233773009502253852000902348930003302357945002502390946001302415655001202428IND4376190220221120032243.0051121e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437619022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aEisenbies, M.H.10aSoil physical disturbance and logging residue effects on changes in soil productivity in five-year-old pine plantations  ap. 1833-1843.  aThere has been much concern that traffic associated with the harvesting of intensively managed pine plantations reduces long-term soil-site productivity. Trafficking, especially during wet periods, can cause severe soil physical disturbance and redistribution of woody residues. Although the negative effects of soil compaction and rutting on root growth and the importance of organic matter for maintaining site productivity are well known, the connection between these factors and actual changes in soil and site productivity has been difficult to evaluate. Three productive, 20-ha loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations located on fertile "wet pine flats" on the coastal plain of South Carolina were subjected to wet- and dry-weather harvesting and mechanical site preparation. A factorial design was used to evaluate changes in soil-site quality after 5 yr based on postharvest classifications of soil physical disturbance, harvest residue removal, and the type of site preparation using a recently developed rank diagnostic approach. Trees on disturbed sites performed as well or better than trees on minimally disturbed sites with average levels of harvest residues. Bedding restored relative soil-site productivity (based on the rank diagnostic) on all but heavily disturbed sites with >25% bare soil; however, these heavily disturbed sites comprised about 5% of the total area harvested. Moderate levels of disturbance may increase relative soil-site productivity, perhaps by controlling competition or increasing nitrogen mineralization rates. Sites such as these may be good alternatives to more sensitive sites for wet-weather harvesting. 3aPinus taeda 3aforest plantations 3aforest soils 3adisturbed soils 3asoil compaction 3asoil productivity 3asite preparation 3alogging 3aplant residues 3adead wood 3aSouth Carolina1 aBurger, J.A.1 aAust, W.M.1 aPatterson, S.C.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 , v. 69, no. 6 p.1833-1843x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02979naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245008800195300001800283500001500301520152300316650001801839650002501857650001501882650001701897650002301914650001201937650001701949650001201966650002501978650001602003650001902019650001302038650002102051650001802072650002702090650002102117650001402138650002302152651001302175653002902188653002702217700001802244773009502262852000902357930003302366945002502399946001302424655001202437IND4376189820221120032249.0051121e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437618982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Don plantations on soils of low nutrient status in Tasmania require the development of nutrient management systems involving fertilization throughout the life of the stand. Periodic fertilization through 15 yr, in a Pinus radiata D. Don plantation in northeastern Tasmania was evaluated for effects on stand growth and soil. Substantial stem volume increases due to N and P fertilizer, applied as ammonium sulfate and single superphosphate were observed. Two applications of P fertilizer totaling 144 kg P ha(-1) produced substantial increases in stem volume growth from 67 to 192 m3 ha(-1). With P plus 13 annual applications of N fertilizer at 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), stem volume growth increased from 192 to 344 m3 ha(-1) over the 15-yr period. Although fertilizing every second and fourth year produced less response, these treatments had better fertilizer-use efficiency. Long-term fertilization resulted in increases in concentrations of nutrients in the forest floor and the surface soil. The highest rates of fertilization were accompanied by significant reductions in soil pH throughout the soil profile, from 4.1 to 3.4 units. Reduction in pH occurred with both nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers. Substantial reductions in exchangeable Mg concentrations, from 235 to 88 microgram g(-1), were also measured throughout the soil profile. The highest rate of N application significantly increased the total O2 horizon biomass, with N mass doubling within the O2 horizon. 3aPinus radiata 3aspatial distribution 3asoil depth 3aforest soils 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3aforest trees 3acalcium 3anitrogen fertilizers 3atree growth 3asoil nutrients 3atree age 3afertilizer rates 3aforest litter 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aorganic horizons 3amagnesium 3aforest plantations 3aTasmania 0asoil chemical properties 0afertilizer application1 aNeilsen, W.A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 , v. 69, no. 6 p.1799-1805x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02844naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245009200195300001800287500001500305520131500320650002501635650001501660650001701675650002301692650001201715650001701727650001201744650002101756650002501777650001601802650001901818650001901837650001301856650002101869650001801890650002301908650002701931650002101958650001401979650002301993651001302016653002902029653002702058700001802085773009502103852000902198930003302207945002502240946001302265655001202278IND4376189920221120032230.0051121e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437618992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of periodic fertilization through 15 yr on stand growth and soil chemistry of a Eucalyptus regnans F. Mueller plantation on a high rainfall site in southern Tasmania. Substantial response to N fertilizer, applied as ammonium sulfate, were measured, but there was no response to P applied as single superphosphate, either alone or in combination with N. Annual applications of N fertilizer, for a period of 13 yr, at 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) doubled volume growth from 125 to 281 m3 ha(-1), at Age 19 yr. Long-term fertilization resulted in the accumulation of nutrients within the forest floor and surface soils. Significant reductions in soil pH, from 4.5 to 3.6 in the surface soil, were associated with the highest rate of fertilization. Reductions in pH occurred with both nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers. Substantial reductions in exchangeable Mg concentrations in surface soils, from 258 to 71 mg kg(-1) were also measured. The research highlights the balance needed between obtaining growth response and causing detrimental soil effects from long-term fertilization. 3aspatial distribution 3asoil depth 3aforest soils 3asoil acidification 3asoil pH 3aforest trees 3acalcium 3aammonium sulfate 3anitrogen fertilizers 3atree growth 3asuperphosphate 3asoil nutrients 3atree age 3afertilizer rates 3aforest litter 3aEucalyptus regnans 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aorganic horizons 3amagnesium 3aforest plantations 3aTasmania 0asoil chemical properties 0afertilizer application1 aNeilsen, W.A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 , v. 69, no. 6 p.1806-1812x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02623naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001900195245012500214300001800339520122300357650002201580650002301602650001701625650002601642650002301668650001501691650001201706650001401718650002501732650002701757650001301784650002601797650002101823650002901844650002901873650001901902651001301921700002001934773009501954852000902049930003302058945002502091946001302116655001202129IND4376188920221120032330.0051121e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437618892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We examined the effects of soil disturbance (simulated tillage) and N-fertilizer additions on methane oxidation in old-growth forest, mid-successional, and no-till maize ecosystems in southwest Michigan, USA. We found highest oxidation rates in forest sites (about 30 microgram CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) on average), with average rates in successional and agricultural sites about 75 and 12% of this, respectively. In the forest and successional sites a one-time N-fertilizer addition (100 kg NH4NO3-N ha(-1)) significantly suppressed oxidation for the several weeks that inorganic N pools were elevated. There was no effect of fertilizer addition in the agricultural site, where available N was already high and oxidation rates low. Soil disturbance by itself had no detectable effect on fluxes in any of the sites. Results confirm the overriding importance of elevated N for suppressing CH4 oxidation in managed and unmanaged ecosystems, and suggest further that recovery of CH4 suppression following agriculture is related to slow-changing soil properties such as soil organic matter composition or microbial community structure. 3adeciduous forests 3aold-growth forests 3aforest soils 3aecological succession 3aagricultural soils 3ano-tillage 3amethane 3aoxidation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3asandy loam soils 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil physical properties 3acarbon dioxide 3aMichigan1 aRobertson, G.P.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 , v. 69, no. 6 p.1722-1729x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02936naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245010300175300001800278520155100296650002001847650001501867650002101882650002001903650001301923650002401936650002101960650002701981650002102008650002702029650001902056650001802075650002202093650002702115650002202142651001202164700001502176700001502191700001302206700001502219700002102234773009502255852000902350930003302359945002502392946001302417655001202430IND4376191520221120024130.0051121e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437619152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAccoe, F.10aEstimation of gross nitrogen transformations and nitrogen retention in grassland soils using FLUAZ  ap. 1967-1976.  aThe flux of N through mineralization-immobilization turnover (MIT) in grassland soils is a major determinant for plant N uptake and for N loss processes. In this study we investigated the dynamics of gross N transformation rates and potential N retention on mineral fertilizer addition in three permanent grassland soils of varying texture (loamy sand, loam, and clay loam). Gross N transformation rates were calculated with the 15N-tracing model FLUAZ. Differentially 15N-labeled NH4NO3 (at a rate of 100 mg N kg(-1) soil) was added to the soils in paired laboratory incubation experiments. Size and 15N enrichment of the NH4(+), NO3(-), and soil organic N pools were measured at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 d after NH4NO3 addition. The accuracy of the simulations of the data using FLUAZ were robust, but tended to decrease (i) with increasing incubation times, (ii) with increasing duration of the time intervals considered, and (iii) with increasing experimental variability. The proportion of the initial N content mineralized on incubation was largest in the loamy sand soil (2.5%), followed by the clay loam soil (1.2%) and the loam soil (0.8%). The actual gross nitrification and N immobilization activity followed the same trend. The loam soil showed the lowest relative N retention (ratio N immobilization over [gross N mineralization + gross nitrification]), which was attributed to its low C availability. In general, the 15N retention after addition of 15NH4(14)NO3 was approximately five times larger than after addition of 14NH4(15)NO3. 3agrassland soils 3aloam soils 3asandy loam soils 3aclay loam soils 3anitrogen 3amineral fertilizers 3aammonium nitrate 3afertilizer application 3aisotope labeling 3aimmobilization in soil 3amineralization 3anitrification 3abiotransformation 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asimulation models 3aBelgium1 aBoeckx, P.1 aVidela, X.1 aPino, I.1 aHofman, G.1 aCleemput, O. van0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 , v. 69, no. 6 p.1967-1976x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/11/30  aOther US 7aarticle03167naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245009000158300001800248500001500266520164400281650001801925650002301943650001301966650002401979650002302003650001802026650002302044650000902067650002202076650002002098650001702118650001602135650002202151650001702173650002402190650001502214651001302229653001902242653002402261653002602285653002902311700001502340700001402355700002502369700001402394700001802408773009502426852000902521930003302530945002502563946001302588655001202601IND4374331220221120024110.0050915e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437433122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMzuku, M.10aSpatial variability of measured soil properties across site-specific management zones  ap. 1572-1579.  a2019-12-05  aThe spatial variation of productivity across farm fields can be classified by delineating site-specific management zones. Since productivity is influenced by soil characteristics, the spatial pattern of productivity could be caused by a corresponding variation in certain soil properties. Determining the source of variation in productivity can help achieve more effective site-specific management. The objectives of this study were (i) to characterize the spatial variability of soil physical properties across irrigated corn (Zea Mays L.) production fields and (ii) to determine if soil physical properties could explain the variability in productivity between site-specific management zones. The study was conducted over three study sites in northeastern Colorado. The soil properties measured were bulk density, cone index, surface soil color, organic C, texture, sorptivity, and surface water content. A multi-response permutation procedure was used to test for significant differences among soil properties between management zones. Box plots of soil physical properties were created for each management zone within each study site to determine if trends in soil physical properties corresponded to the productivity potential of the management zones. Overall, this study showed that soil physical properties exhibited significant spatial variability across production fields. The trends observed for the measured soil physical properties corresponded to the productivity potential of the management zones. Utilizing site-specific management zones could help manage the in-field variability of yield-limiting soil physical properties. 3ayield mapping 3aagricultural soils 3aZea mays 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil water content 3asoil strength 3asoil heterogeneity 3acorn 3airrigated farming 3airrigated soils 3abulk density 3agrain yield 3aspatial variation 3asoil texture 3acontinuous cropping 3asoil color 3aColorado 0asurface layers 0asoil organic matter 0aprecision agriculture 0asoil physical properties1 aKhosla, R.1 aReich, R.1 aInman, D.q(Douglas)1 aSmith, F.1 aMacDonald, L.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 , v. 69, no. 5 p.1572-1579x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20051220b20060102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/10/05  aOther US 7aarticle03382naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012600183300001800309500002400327520174300351650001702094650001602111650001402127650002002141650001302161650001902174650002702193650001602220650003002236650002702266650002802293650000902321650002302330650002302353650005102376650002002427650004202447650001402489650002802503651001002531700001702541700001402558700001502572700001902587700001802606700001902624700001802643773011002661852000902771856004802780655001202828IND4397394220221123013538.0071104e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439739422DNAL7 a178516472pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-007-0635-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Chang-Jie10aIdentification and characterization of a major QTL responsible for erect panicle trait in japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 1093-1100.  aIncludes references  aPanicle erectness (PE) is one of the most important traits for high-yielding japonica cultivars. Although several cultivars with PE trait have been developed and released for commercial production in China, there is little information on the inheritance of PE traits in rice. In the present study, 69 widely cultivated japonica cultivars and a double haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between a PE cultivar (Wuyunjing 8) and a drooping panicle cultivar (Nongken 57) were utilized to elucidate the mechanisms of PE formation and to map PE associated genes. Our data suggested that panicle length (PL) and plant height (PH) significantly affected panicle curvature (PC), with shorter PL and PH resulting in smaller PC and consequently more erect. A putative major gene was identified on chromosome 9 by molecular markers and bulk segregant analysis in DH population. In order to finely map the major gene, all simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers on chromosome 9 as well as 100 newly developed sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were used to construct a linkage group for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. A major QTL, qPE9-1, between STS marker H90 and SSR marker RM5652, was detected, and accounted for 41.72% of PC variation with pleiotropic effect on PH and PL. another QTL, qPE9-2, was also found to be adjacent to qPE9-1. In addition, we found that H90, the nearest marker to qPE9-1, used for genotyping 38 cultivars with extremely erect and drooping panicles, segregated in agreement with PC, suggesting the H90 product was possibly part of the qPE9-1 gene or closely related to it. These data demonstrated that H90 could be used for marker-aided selection for the PE trait in breeding and in the cloning of qPE9-1. 3aOryza sativa 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3ahaploidy 3ainflorescences 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amajor genes 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aFlowering Topsxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aModels, Genetic 2aOryzaxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 3aChina1 aZhou, Ji-Hua1 aYan, Song1 aChen, Feng1 aYeboah, Martin1 aTang, Shu-Zhu1 aLiang, Guo-Hua1 aGu, Ming-Hong0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2007 Nov., v. 115, no. 8 p.1093-1100dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-007-0635-9 7aarticle03718naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002900157245013200186300001800318500002400336500001500360520159100375650002601966650001301992650001502005650001502020650002602035650001302061650000902074650002502083650001102108650002402119650001002143650001302153650001502166650001902181650003102200650001002231650001602241650001002257650002302267650003002290650003802320650002102358650002502379650004402404650001402448650002702462650004202489650003902531650005202570650002402622650002402646650002702670650003602697653001502733700002902748700002602777700002702803773011502830852000902945856007802954655001203032IND4406810620221123002459.0080613e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440681062DNAL7 a185030422pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ern1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalderon-Vazquez, Carlos10aTranscript profiling of Zea mays roots reveals gene responses to phosphate deficiency at the plant- and species-specific levels  ap. 2479-2497.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMaize (Zea mays) is the most widely cultivated crop around the world; however, it is commonly affected by phosphate (Pi) deficiency in many regions, particularly in acid and alkaline soils of developing countries. To cope with Pi deficiency, plants have evolved a large number of developmental and biochemical adaptations; however, for maize, the underlying molecular basis of these responses is still unknown. In this work, the transcriptional response of maize roots to Pi starvation at 1, 3, 6, and 10 d after the onset of Pi deprivation was assessed. The investigation revealed a total of 1179 Pi-responsive genes, of which 820 and 363 genes were found to be either up- or down-regulated, respectively, by 2-fold or more. Pi-responsive genes were found to be involved in various metabolic, signal transduction, and developmental gene networks. A large set of transcription factors, which may be potential targets for crop breeding, was identified. In addition, gene expression profiles and changes in specific metabolites were also correlated. The results show that several dicotyledonous plant responses to Pi starvation are conserved in maize, but that some genetic responses appear to be more specific and that Pi deficiency leads to a shift in the recycling of internal Pi in maize roots. Ultimately, this work provides a more comprehensive view of Pi-responses in a model for economically important cereals and also sets a framework to produce Pi-specific maize microarrays to study the changes in global gene expression between Pi-efficient and Pi-inefficient maize genotypes. 3atranscription factors 3aZea mays 3astarvation 3aacid soils 3amicroarray technology 3abreeding 3acorn 3adeveloping countries 3amodels 3asignal transduction 3agenes 3agenotype 3aphosphates 3aplant response 3agene expression regulation 3aroots 3ametabolites 3acrops 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLipid Metabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPhenotype 2aPhosphatesxdeficiency 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transduction 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aadaptation1 aIbarra-Laclette, Enrique1 aCaballero-Perez, Juan1 aHerrera-Estrella, Luis0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2008 June, v. 59, no. 9 p.2479-2497dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern1153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02969naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014700172300001400319500002400333520178700357650002102144650001902165650002302184650002302207650001802230650003202248650001002280650002002290650001402310650001402324650002402338650002202362650001302384700002202397773010002419852000902519856005502528655001202583IND4447896620221122212303.0110125e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444789662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01753.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawley, Dana M.10aDisease ecology meets ecological immunology: understanding the links between organismal immunity and infection dynamics in natural populations  ap. 48-60.  aIncludes references  a1. Ecological immunology and disease ecology are two relatively young disciplines that apply ecological approaches and principles to traditionally non-ecological fields. In both cases, an ecological perspective has allowed new insights to emerge by focusing attention on variation over space and time, and by emphasizing the role of the environment in shaping individual responses and the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. Here we review the growing conceptual interface between these two rapidly evolving fields. 2. Areas of synergy between ecological immunology and disease ecology aim to translate variation in within-host processes (e.g. immunity) into between-host dynamics (e.g. parasite transmission). Emerging areas of synergy include potential immune mechanisms that underlie host heterogeneity in disease susceptibility, teasing apart the effects of environmental factors such as seasonality and climate on host susceptibility and pathogen dynamics, and predicting the outcome of co-infection by functionally distinct groups of parasites that elicit different immune responses. 3. In some cases, practical limitations have constrained the merging of ideas in ecological immunology and disease ecology. We discuss several logistical challenges, including dissecting the relative roles of host exposure and susceptibility, establishing links between measures of immunity and pathogen resistance in wild populations, and incorporating relevant immune variation into prevailing disease ecology modeling frameworks. 4. Future work at the interface of these two fields should advance understanding of life-history theory, host-pathogen dynamics, and physiological ecology, and will also contribute to targeted approaches for wildlife health and zoonotic disease prevention. 3aclimatic factors 3adisease models 3adisease prevention 3adisease resistance 3aecophysiology 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apopulation dynamics 3aspatial variation 3azoonoses1 aAltizer, Sonia M.0 tFunctional ecology.g2011 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.48-60dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01753.x 7aarticle02282naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009200127300001800219500009900237520105000336650002001386650000901406650002601415650002001441650001901461650002101480650003501501650002001536650002501556650002601581650002001607650002801627653002701655700001901682700001601701700001801717773008201735852000901817939003301826946001301859655001201872IND9207618520221120202951.0921216s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920761852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaleem, A.A.10aIron availability as influenced by phosphate and ferrous-and ferric-sulfate fertilizers  ap. 1955-1970.  aPaper presented at the "Sixth International Symposium on Iron," July 14-19, 1991, Logan, Utah.  aFerrous- and ferric-sulfate was banded alone or with phosphate fertilizers [urea phosphate (10-30-0), urea sulfate phosphate (10-30-0-7S), diammonium phosphate (DAP), and mono calcium phosphate (MCP) in an Fe-deficient soil in a greenhouse experiment.

Addition of P fertilizers with FeSO4 increased the DTPA-extractable soil Fe in the following order: DAP > 10-30-0 > 10-30-0-7S > MCP. The addition of P fertilizers also increased NaHCO3-extractable soil P, but decreased the DTPA extractable soil Mn and Zn. The ferrous-Fe source generally was more effective than was the ferric-Fe source. Ferrous and ferric sulfate availability was enhanced by banding with P fertilizers. 3aSorghum bicolor 3airon 3anutrient availability 3aferrous sulfate 3aferric sulfate 3airon fertilizers 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aurea phosphates 3adiammonium phosphate 3amonocalcium phosphate 3anutrient uptake 3adry matter accumulation 0aurea sulfate phosphate1 aAnderson, W.B.1 aSadik, M.K.1 aSalam, A.A.A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1992, v. 15, no. 10 p.1955-1970x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01962naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011600167300001600283520073900299650001201038650001901050650001101069650002601080650002001106650002601126650001801152650001501170650001601185650001801201650002101219653001901240700001601259700001901275700002401294773011201318852000901430856006901439930003301508946001101541655001201552IND4387718220221120094913.0070211e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438771822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-006-0408-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinchasov, Yulia 10aPhotoacoustics: a novel tool for the determination of photosynthetic energy storage efficiency in phytoplankton  ap. 251-256.  aPhotosynthetic energy storage efficiency controls the development and decline of phytoplankton biomass.

Our results reveal that the amount of phosphorus released form ³²P-saturated M. aeruginosa is determined by its growth phase and most of phosphorus is assimilated by Pseudomonas finally while the amount of phosphorus released from ³²P-saturated Pseudomonas is also determined by the growth phase of M. aeruginosa and most of them are assimilated by M. aeruginosa. The results suggest that phosphorus transference occurs between M. aeruginosa and its attached Pseudomonas . This process makes microenvironment of mucilage of M. aeruginosa attached bacteria maintain relative high amounts of phosphorus. Attached bacteria may be a temporary phosphorus bank to the growth of M. aeruginosa, and assimilation of phosphorus by M. aeruginosa becomes easy when M. aeruginosa is in lag growth phase. Thus, the phosphorus exchange between M. aeruginosa and attached Pseudomonas in microenvironment may be important to microfood web and cyanobacteria bloom. 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas 3abacteria 3aisotopes 3alakes 3amitosis 3aphosphorus 0aAttached bacterium 0aPseudomonas sp 0aLake Taihu 0a³²P release1 aYang, Liuyan 1 aXiao, Lin 1 aShi, Xiaoli 1 aGao, Guang 1 aQin, Boqiang 0 tHydrobiologia.g2007 May, v. 581, no. 1 p.161-165dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0518-03electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03287naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245016600168300001600334520170200350650001302052650002002065650001902085650001402104650002202118650001002140650001902150650002202169650001302191650002202204650001502226650001802241650002202259650002502281650001102306650001402317650001102331651001002342653001502352653002602367700002602393700002002419700001502439700001702454700001802471700002302489773011102512852000902623856006902632930003302701946001102734655001202745IND4389040120221120053641.0070318e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438904012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-006-0496-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarthy, Mark J. 10aNitrogen dynamics and microbial food web structure during a summer cyanobacterial bloom in a subtropical, shallow, well-mixed, eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China)  ap. 195-207.  aNitrogen dynamics and microbial food web structure were characterized in subtropical, eutrophic, large (2,338 km²), shallow (1.9 m mean depth), and polymictic Lake Taihu (China) in Sept-Oct 2002 during a cyanobacterial bloom. Population growth and industrialization are factors in trophic status deterioration in Lake Taihu. Sites for investigation were selected along a transect from the Liangxihe River discharge into Meiliang Bay to the main lake. Water column nitrogen and microbial food web measurements were combined with sediment-water interface incubations to characterize and identify important processes related to system nitrogen dynamics. Results indicate a gradient from strong phosphorus limitation at the river discharge to nitrogen limitation or co-limitation in the main lake. Denitrification in Meiliang Bay may drive main lake nitrogen limitation by removing excess nitrogen before physical transport to the main lake. Five times higher nutrient mineralization rates in the water column versus sediments indicate that sediment nutrient transformations were not as important as water column processes for fueling primary production. However, sediments provide a site for denitrification, which, along with nitrogen fixation and other processes, can determine available nutrient ratios. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was important, relative to denitrification, only at the river discharge site, and nitrogen fixation was observed only in the main lake. Reflecting nitrogen cycling patterns, microbial food web structure shifted from autotrophic (phytoplankton dominated) at the river discharge to heterotrophic (bacteria dominated) in and near the main lake. 3abacteria 3adenitrification 3aeutrophication 3afood webs 3aindustrialization 3alakes 3amineralization 3anitrate reduction 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation growth 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3asediments 3asummer 3aChina 0aLake Taihu 0aCyanobacterial blooms1 aLavrentyev, Peter J. 1 aYang, Longyuan 1 aZhang, Lu 1 aChen, Yuwei 1 aQin, Boqiang 1 aGardner, Wayne S. 0 tHydrobiologia.g2007 May, v. 581, no. 1 p.195-207dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0496-23electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02590naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008500164300001400249520138500263650000801648650001101656650001901667650001001686650001301696650002101709650001401730650001501744650000901759650001101768650001501779650001901794651001001813653002001823653001501843700001801858700002001876700001701896773010901913852000902022856006902031930003302100946001102133655001202144IND4389041620221120053707.0070318e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438904162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-006-0515-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Liancong 10aTotal inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen by wet deposition into Lake Taihu, China  ap. 63-70.  aLake Taihu suffers from eutrophication caused by riverine nutrient inputs and air deposition. To characterize wet deposition of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) to the lake, precipitation collection and measurements of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) and other components at five cities around Lake Taihu were made from July 2002 to June 2003. TP and TN concentrations and deposition rates exhibited strong spatial variation in the whole catchment. An inverse correlation between station-averaged TP and TN concentrations and precipitation amount was found. Maximal TP concentration in rainfall was found in Suzhou, and maximal TN in Wuxi. However, highest wet deposition rates of TP and TN were found in Suzhou, which suggests that atmospheric nutrients are mostly from the east and northwest area of Lake Taihu. Mean TP and TN deposition rates were 0.03 and 2.0 t km-² year-¹ respectively in Lake Taihu, which are greater than reported values in other areas by comparision. Total N and P contributed to the lake by wet deposition were 75 and 4720 t per year, respectively, which represent about 7.3% and 16.5% of total annual N and P inputs via inflow rivers. Wet deposition, especially N, could have significant effects on eutrophication in the lake, which shows that air deposition should be taken into account while reducing the external nutrients in the lake. 3aair 3acities 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3arain 3arivers 3awatersheds 3awet deposition 3aChina 0aRiverine inputs 0aLake Taihu1 aQin, Boqiang 1 aYang, Longyuan 1 aSong, Yuzhi 0 tHydrobiologia.g2007 May, v. 581, no. 1 p.63-70dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0515-33electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02704naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001600169245010400185300001800289500002400307520094700331650001701278650001001295650001201305650001301317650001401330650001801344650001901362650001101381650002301392650002301415650001601438650001101454650001601465650001201481650001801493650001601511650001601527650004801543650001701591650000901608650002901617650000901646650001001655650002401665650002301689650002201712650002301734650001601757650001901773650001701792650001401809700001801823700001901841700001701860700001601877773009901893852000901992856005302001655001202054IND4435527620221120042544.0100416e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443552762DNAL7 a201893792pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Bockki10aUtilization of pectin-enriched materials from apple pomace as a fat replacer in a model food system  ap. 5414-5418.  aIncludes references  aWater soluble pectin-enriched materials (PEMs) from apple pomace, were evaluated as a fat replacer in a model food system. When PEM solutions were subjected to steady-shear measurements, shear-thinning behavior was observed. The flow behaviors could be described by the Cross model (R ² =0.99), and temperature effects were investigated by the Arrhenius equation. The addition of PEMs significantly increased the pasting parameters of wheat flour as measured by a starch pasting rheometer. Gelatinization temperature and enthalpy increased with increasing PEM concentrations. When PEMs were incorporated into cookie formulations in place of shortening (semisolid fat generally used in baked foods) up to 30% by the weight of shortening, the cookie spread diameter was reduced while an increase in the moisture content was observed. Moreover, replacement of shortening with PEMs contributed to a more tender texture and lighter surface color. 3aapple pomace 3acolor 3acookies 3aenthalpy 3aequations 3afat replacers 3agelatinization 3alipids 3amodel food systems 3apasting properties 3ashortenings 3astarch 3atemperature 3atexture 3awater content 3awheat flour 2aCalibration 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanningxmethods 2aDietary Fats 2aFood 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aGels 2aMalus 2aModels, Statistical 2aPectinsxchemistry 2aRheologyxmethods 2aStress, Mechanical 2aTemperature 2aThermodynamics 2aTime Factors 2aViscosity1 aBae, In Young1 aLee, Hyeon Gyu1 aYoo, Sang-Ho1 aLee, Suyong0 tBioresource technology.g2010 July, v. 101, no. 14 p.5414-5418dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.02.022 7aarticle03025naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245015500168300001600323500002400339500001500363520174600378650004802124650002002172650001202192650001202204650001402216650001102230650004302241650001902284650000702303650001502310650001602325650002002341650002402361650001102385653001002396700001402406773012202420852000902542856005202551655001202603IND4463301920221120032341.0120524e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330192DNAL7 a10.1016/S1466-8564(02)00016-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasiljevic, T.10aLactose hydrolysis in milk as affected by neutralizers used for the preparation of crude β-galactosidase extracts from Lactobacillus bulgaricus 11842  ap. 175-184.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThree different neutralizers (NaOH, KOH, NH4OH) were employed for pH maintenance during the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842, used as a source of β-galactosidase extracts. The crude enzymatic extract (CEE) was obtained by bead milling of the cell paste, collected from the cultivation of the source microorganism in skim milk at 43 °C and constant pH. Lactose hydrolysis kinetics in skim milk and proteolytic activity during the hydrolysis were evaluated. The use of NH4OH as a neutralizer resulted in significantly (P<0.05) higher enzyme activity of the CEE than that obtained using NaOH or KOH. The kinetic parameters, kcat and Km, of the Michaelis–Menten model were determined for lactose hydrolysis in skim milk using 1% (v/v) addition of a CEE. There was no significant (P>0.05) difference in kcat among the different extracts, with a clear temperature dependence following Arrhenius kinetics. The rate of lactose hydrolysis was dependent on the initial enzyme activity and temperature. The highest initial rate was observed at 65 °C; however, the enzyme deactivation occurred within 1–1.5 h. The proteolytic activity determined by HPLC peptide mapping was significantly (P<0.05) higher in the moderate temperature range (20 and 37 °C) than at 7 or 55 °C. Industrial relevance: Since lactose intolerance affects a large proportion of the world's population, an economically feasible and effective process with a cheap source of β-galactosidase may have a substantial potential. The use of crude β-galactosidase extracts from Lactobacillus bulgaricus 11842 appears to be a promising approach for development of a technologically feasible process of lactose hydrolysis for food or non-food uses. 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3apeptide mapping 3alactose 3aenzymes 3askim milk 3amodels 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3ahydrolysis 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3alactose intolerance 3apastes 0afoods1 aJelen, P.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2002 June, v. 3, no. 2 p.175-184dElsevier Sciencex1466-85647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1466-8564(02)00016-4 7aarticle03164naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002900182245010400211300001600315500002400331506007600355520166400431506003702095650002502132650001802157650001702175650001202192650001202204650001602216650001102232650002102243650001202264650001302276650001402289650001302303650002402316650002202340700002302362700001802385700002402403700001902427700002202446773011202468852000902580856008102589655001202670IND4457737320221207101951.0110507e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445773732DNAL7 a214027952pmid7 aPMC30910612pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.111.1722542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, Mohammad Anowar10aInvolvement of Endogenous Abscisic Acid in Methyl Jasmonate-Induced Stomatal Closure in Arabidopsis  ap. 430-438.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, we examined the involvement of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) in methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced stomatal closure using an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, fluridon (FLU), and an ABA-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant, aba2-2. We found that pretreatment with FLU inhibited MeJA-induced stomatal closure but not ABA-induced stomatal closure in wild-type plants. The aba2-2 mutation impaired MeJA-induced stomatal closure but not ABA-induced stomatal closure. We also investigated the effects of FLU and the aba2-2 mutation on cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca²⁺]cyt) in guard cells using a Ca²⁺-reporter fluorescent protein, Yellow Cameleon 3.6. In wild-type guard cells, FLU inhibited MeJA-induced [Ca²⁺]cyt elevation but not ABA-induced [Ca²⁺]cyt elevation. The aba2-2 mutation did not affect ABA-elicited [Ca²⁺]cyt elevation but suppressed MeJA-induced [Ca²⁺]cyt elevation. We also tested the effects of the aba2-2 mutation and FLU on the expression of MeJA-inducible VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN1 (VSP1). In the aba2-2 mutant, MeJA did not induce VSP1 expression. In wild-type leaves, FLU inhibited MeJA-induced VSP1 expression. Pretreatment with ABA at 0.1 μM, which is not enough concentration to evoke ABA responses in the wild type, rescued the observed phenotypes of the aba2-2 mutant. Finally, we found that in wild-type leaves, MeJA stimulates the expression of 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3, which encodes a crucial enzyme in ABA biosynthesis. These results suggest that endogenous ABA could be involved in MeJA signal transduction and lead to stomatal closure in Arabidopsis guard cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3aenzymes 3aguard cells 3aleaves 3amethyl jasmonate 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3astomatal movement1 aMunemasa, Shintaro1 aUraji, Misugi1 aNakamura, Yoshimasa1 aMori, Izumi C.1 aMurata, Yoshiyuki0 tPlant physiology.g2011 May, v. 156, no. 1 p.430-438dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.1722543Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03004naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245010100186300001600287500002400303520138000327650001901707650002801726650002401754650001401778650001701792650001001809650001501819650001501834650001601849650001701865650002201882650002001904650002201924650001401946650001401960650003701974650001202011650001102023650001502034650000902049650003202058650001602090650001602106650002802122650002202150650002302172650001402195650001802209700002202227700002402249773008402273852000902357856004802366655001202414IND4456825920221123002835.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445682592DNAL7 a210492992pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-010-1821-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, Daniela10aMycorrhiza-induced trophic cascade enhances fitness and population growth of an acarine predator  ap. 141-149.  aIncludes references  aResearch on trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems has only recently revealed that root-associated organisms interact with organisms living on aboveground plant parts. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is a ubiquitous phenomenon, yet studies on its effect on aboveground natural enemies of herbivores are scarce and mainly deal with plant-mediated rather than herbivore-mediated interactions. Here, we studied herbivore-mediated effects of AM symbiosis on an acarine predator. We measured life history characteristics and population growth rates of Phytoseiulus persimilis preying on two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae, which were feeding on bean plants colonized or not colonized by the AM fungus Glomus mosseae. All major life history characteristics of P. persimilis, foremost oviposition rate, minimum prey requirements needed to reach adulthood, and developmental time, were positively affected by AM colonization of the host plant of their prey, together resulting in enhanced population growth rates of the predators. Hence, we hypothesize that a bottom-up trophic cascade may counteract the apparent negative effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis when promoting herbivory by promoting the predation of herbivores due to improved prey quality. We argue that this pathway may be involved in stabilizing plant-mycorrhizal symbiosis in ecosystems over time. 3aGlomus mosseae 3aPhytoseiulus persimilis 3aTetranychus urticae 3aadulthood 3aaerial parts 3abeans 3aecosystems 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3alife history 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anatural enemies 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3apredators 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFood Chain 2aMale 2aMitesxgrowth & development 2aMycorrhizae 2aOviposition 2aPhaseolusxparasitology 2aPopulation Growth 2aPredatory Behavior 2aSymbiosis 2aTetranychidae1 aVierheilig, Horst1 aSchausberger, Peter0 tOecologia.g2011 May, v. 166, no. 1 p.141-149dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1821-z 7aarticle02406naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245007100165300001600236500002400252520154800276650002501824650001301849650001501862650001701877650001601894700001401910700001601924773010301940852000902043856005202052655001202104IND4463352220221122220350.0120604e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446335222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2003.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarrega, A.10aFlow behaviour of semi-solid dairy desserts. Effect of temperature  ap. 345-353.  aIncludes references  aThe flow behaviour of seven commercial samples of natillas, a popular semisolid dairy dessert in Spain, was analysed at the two common consumption temperatures, 5°C and 25°C, with special attention to their time-dependent properties. All samples showed flow time dependence at both temperatures tested. For the same temperature, differences in the form and in the magnitude of the hysteresis loop were observed among samples, these differences being more noticeable at 5°C. An analysis of variance of the thixotropic area values, considering sample and temperature as factors, showed a significant interaction between these factors, the corresponding F value (F(int)) being 53.21 (p=0.000), which indicates that the effect of temperature on this area was different depending on samples. Similar results were obtained by analysing Weltmann parameters A and B, from shear stress decay experiments. Shear stress decay data fitted well to a second-order structural kinetics model [(η0−ηe)/(η−ηe)]=kt+1, and the sample–temperature interaction was also significant on parameter k from this model (F(int)=5.46, p=0.004). Flow of samples, after eliminating thixotropy, fitted well to the Herschel–Bulkley model . Here again, sample–temperature interactions were significant for σ0 (Fint=5.40, p=0.005) and for η1 (F(int)=6.63, p=0.002). Although the extent of the differences varied among samples, in general, time dependence, plasticity and consistency were lower and pseudoplasticity was slightly higher at the higher temperature. 3aanalysis of variance 3adesserts 3ahysteresis 3ashear stress 3atemperature1 aDuran, L.1 aCostell, E.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2004 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.345-353dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2003.12.004 7aarticle03652naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009600183300001600279500002400295520155300319650000801872650001301880650001601893650001701909650001201926650002501938650000701963650001901970650001401989650002302003650001802026650002002044650001102064650003202075650002102107650004002128650004002168650001602208650008402224650002802308650003102336650001402367650003002381650003402411650002702445650003602472650002002508650002202528650002402550651001002574651001002584653002602594653001502620653002002635700001402655700001702669700001802686700001802704700001602722700001602738700001602754773010302770852000902873856004802882655001202930IND4442335720221122122901.0100910e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444233572DNAL7 a204614642pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-010-9453-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi-Guang10aYaniella soli sp. nov., a new actinobacterium isolated from non-saline forest soil in China  ap. 395-401.  aIncludes references  aA novel Gram-stain-positive, slightly halophilic, facultatively alkaliphilic, non-motile, non-sporulating, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, aerobic bacterium, designated strain JSM 070026T, was isolated from non-saline forest soil in China. Growth occurred with 0-20% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 2-4%) and at pH 6.0-10.5 (optimum, pH 8.0) and 5-40°C (optimum, 30°C). Good growth also occurred in the presence of 0-28% (w/v) KCl (optimum, 2-5%) or 0-25% (w/v) MgCl₂·6H₂O (optimum, 1-4%). The peptidoglycan type was A4α (l-Lys-Gly-l-Glu). Cell-wall sugars contained mannose and xylose. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0. Strain JSM 070026T contained menaquinone 8 as the major respiratory quinone and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol as the major polar lipids. The DNA G + C content of strain JSM 070026T was 56.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain JSM 070026T was a member of the suborder Micrococcineae and most closely related to Yaniella flava YIM 70178T (sequence similarity 99.4%) and Yaniella halotolerans YIM 70085T (97.9%). The three strains formed a distinct branch in the phylogenetic tree. The combination of phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA relatedness values, phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic data supports the proposal that strain JSM 070026T represents a novel species of the genus Yaniella, for which the name Yaniella soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JSM 070026T (=DSM 22211T = KCTC 13527T). 3aDNA 3abacteria 3afatty acids 3aforest soils 3amannose 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3apeptidoglycans 3aphylogeny 3apotassium chloride 3aribosomal RNA 3asodium chloride 3axylose 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBase Composition 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMicrococcaceaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSodium Chloride 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTreesxmicrobiology 3aChina 0aChina 0aYaniella soli sp. nov 0aHalophilic 0aNon-saline soil1 aChen, Jun1 aChen, Qi-Hui1 aTang, Shu-Kun1 aZhang, Yu-Qin1 aHe, Jian-Wu1 aLi, Wen-Jun1 aLiu, Yan-Qi0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2010 Oct., v. 98, no. 3 p.395-401dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-010-9453-1 7aarticle02949naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245012700169300001400296520160700310650001601917650001701933650001101950650002001961650000901981650001501990650001502005650001102020650000902031650001802040650001402058653001602072653001402088700002202102700001902124700002002143700002302163700001902186700001902205700002402224773010902248852000902357856006902366930003302435946001102468655001202479IND4389945720221122084115.0070401e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438994572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-006-0545-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivertsgård, Rolf 10aEffects of salmon lice infection and salmon lice protection on fjord migrating Atlantic salmon and brown trout post-smolts  ap. 35-42.  aEffects of artificial salmon lice infection and pharmaceutical salmon lice prophylaxis on survival and rate of progression of Atlantic salmon (n = 72) and brown trout post-smolts (n = 72) during their fjord migration, were studied by telemetry. The infected groups were artificially exposed to infective salmon lice larvae in the laboratory immediately before release in the inner part of the fjord to simulate a naturally high infection pressure. Groups of infected Atlantic salmon (n = 20) and brown trout (n = 12) were also retained in the hatchery to control the infection intensity and lice development during the study period. Neither salmon lice infection nor pharmaceutical prophylaxis had any effects on survival and rate of progression of fjord migrating Atlantic salmon post-smolts compared to control fish. Atlantic salmon spent on average only 151.2 h (maximum 207.3 h) in passing the 80 km fjord system and had, thus, entered the ocean when the more pathogenic pre-adult and adult lice stages developed. The brown trout, in comparison to Atlantic salmon, remained to a larger extent than Atlantic salmon in the inner part of the fjord system. No effect of salmon lice infection, or protection, was found in brown trout during the first weeks of their fjord migration. Brown trout will, to a larger extent than Atlantic salmon, stay in the fjord areas when salmon lice infections reach the more pathogenic pre-adult and adult stages. In contrast to Atlantic salmon, they will thereby possess the practical capability of returning to freshwater when encountering severe salmon lice attacks. 3aSalmo salar 3aSalmo trutta 3aadults 3adisease control 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahatcheries 3alarvae 3alice 3asurvival rate 3atelemetry 0aSalmon lice 0aMigration1 aThorstad, Eva B. 1 aØkland, Finn 1 aFinstad, Bengt 1 aBjørn, Pål Arne 1 aJepsen, Niels 1 aNordal, Trude 1 aMcKinley, R.

  1 aPrincipato, Maryann10aEffect of Thermal Processing during Yogurt Production upon the Detection of Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B  ap. 2212-2216.  a2019-12-04  aThis research was conducted to examine the inherent properties of yogurt contaminated with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). Two types of yogurts were produced for this study. Type I yogurts were produced by adding SEB at the start of yogurt production, and type II yogurts were produced by adding SEB after the milk base had been boiled. Biochemical characteristics inherent to yogurt, including pH, lactic acid and acetaldehyde concentrations, were analyzed weekly for each batch beginning at a time just after production and throughout a storage period of at least 4 weeks. The presence of toxin during yogurt production did not result in any significant biochemical or physical changes in yogurt. However, we were unable to detect SEB toxin in type I yogurt using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In contrast, SEB was easily detectable by our ELISA in type II yogurt samples. Higher levels of SEB were recovered from type II yogurt that had been stored for 1 week than from type II yogurt that had been stored for any other length of time. These results indicate that the biochemical characteristics of yogurt did not change significantly (relative to control yogurt) in the presence of either thermally processed SEB or native SEB. However, the ability to detect SEB by ELISA was dependent on whether the toxin had been processed. 3aenterotoxins 3achemical composition 3aStaphylococcus 3amicrobial load 3amicrobiological quality 3afood contamination 3ayogurt 3avalidity 3aphysicochemical properties 3afood processing 3afood pathogens 3areliability 3amicrobial detection 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aheat treatment 3abacterial toxins 2aAnimals 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aEnterotoxinsxisolation & purification 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFermentation 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aYogurtxanalysisxmicrobiologyxstandards. 0amethodology 0aproduct quality 0aenterotoxin B1 aBoyle, Thomas1 aNjoroge, Joyce1 aJones, Robert L.1 aO'Donnell, Michael0 tJournal of food protection.g2009 Oct., v. 72, no. 10 p.2212-2216x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20100127b20100205c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/01/14  aOther US 7aarticle02230naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010100163300001600264520101200280650002501292650001601317650001901333650001901352650001501371650002401386650001001410650001401420650001701434653001601451653001901467700001701486700001901503700001701522700001901539700001701558773011101575852000901686856006901695930003301764946001101797655001201808IND4389039020221122051830.0070318e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438903902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-006-0503-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yiyong 10aVariations in kinetics of alkaline phosphatase in sediments of eutrophic, shallow, Chinese lakes  ap. 109-116.  aKinetics of alkaline phosphatase in sediments of a shallow Chinese freshwater lake (Lake Donghu) were investigated. Spatially, among 20 sites sampled, V max and K m values of alkaline phosphatase in surface sediments were higher in the zone adjacent to sites with the highest chlorophyll a concentrations. Vertically, there was a peak in V max at intermediate sediment depths in addition to the expected maximum at the surface. Some inhibitors, such as CuSO₄, ZnSO₄ and Na₂WO₄, showed significantly different effects on kinetics of alkaline phosphatase in interstitial water and sediments. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase in interstitial water and sediments responded to Na₂WO₄ in different ways in Lake Taihu. These observations imply that the enzyme is immobilized in sediments, which became more stable with accelerated eutrophication, as suggested by highest alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) in sediments corresponding with highest water column chlorophyll a concentrations in Lake Donghu. 3aalkaline phosphatase 3achlorophyll 3acopper sulfate 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3aimmobilized enzymes 3alakes 3asediments 3azinc sulfate 0aInhibitions 0aImmobilization1 aCao, Xiuyun 1 aSong, Chunlei 1 aLi, Jianqiu 1 aChen, Guoyuan 1 aPeng, Liang 0 tHydrobiologia.g2007 May, v. 581, no. 1 p.109-116dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0503-73electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02452naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012500160300001600285520114800301650002301449650002101472650001201493650002401505650001301529650002601542650001001568651001301578653003001591653002001621700002001641700001701661700001801678700002801696700002001724700001901744700002101763773011201784852000901896856006901905930003301974946001102007655001202018IND4389037020221122051644.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438903702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-006-0455-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoura, A. 10aEffect of depth and reef structure on early macrobenthic communities of the Algarve artificial reefs (southern Portugal)  ap. 173-180.  aThis study was carried out on the “Faro/Ancão” artificial reef (AR), located off Faro, deployed in May 2003. We aimed to characterise early macrobenthic community colonisation of two concrete AR groups located at different depths (16 m and 20 m depth) and to test the effect of reef structure on these communities. The non-colonial organisms were counted; barnacles and colonial species were quantified using biomass. Multivariate analyses indicated that early macrobenthic communities (6 months of immersion) were affected by depth, and that barnacles and colonial species were also affected by reef structure. Univariate analyses showed that the biomass of barnacles and colonial species was significantly different among reefs and layers of modules. Both AR groups were characterised by the species Balanus amphitrite, Gregariella subclavata, Musculus cf. subpictus, Paleanotus cf. bellis and Syllidia armata. Jassa marmorata and Bugula neritina were characteristic species at 16 m depth, particularly on the AR Upper layer of modules, whereas Anomia ephippium was particularly common at 20 m, especially on the Lower layer of modules. 3aBalanus amphitrite 3aartificial reefs 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3aconcrete 3amultivariate analysis 3areefs 3aPortugal 0aMacrobenthic colonisation 0aArtificial reef1 aBoaventura, D. 1 aCúrdia, J. 1 aCarvalho, S. 1 ada Fonseca, L.

Surface sediment data show that the northern area of the Lake has the worst heavy metals pollution, and high heavy metal concentrations were attributed to discharge of untreated and partially treated industrial waste water from cities to the north of the lake. To study geochemical features and pollution history of heavy metals, total content and chemical fractionations of Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were analyzed for core sediments from western Lake Taihu using the speciation extraction procedure, proposed by the Commission of the European Communities Bureau of Reference (BCR), together with grain size and organic carbon measurements. Results show that sediments are composed of organic-poor clayey-fine silts for Cores MS and DLS, and have similar geochemical features shown by heavy metals. Cu, Fe, Ni, and Zn mainly are associated with the residue fraction, Mn is concentrated in the exchangeable-carbonate and residue fractions, and Pb is concentrated in the Fe-Mn oxide fraction and organic-sulfide fraction. The fractions of Ni, Pb, and Zn bound to Fe-Mn oxide show significant correlations with Mn from the Fe-Mn oxide fraction, and the organic-sulfide fractions of Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn are correlated with TOC. The increase of Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn content and percentage of extractable fractions in the upper layers of the sediments are correlated with anthropogenic input of heavy metals due to rapid industrial development. This coincides with rapid economic development in the Taihu basin since late 1970s. Heavy metals in the surface sediments have certain potential biological toxicity as shown by the higher SEM/AVS ratio. 3abasins 3acarbon 3acities 3acopper 3afractionation 3aheavy metals 3aindustrial wastes 3aindustrialization 3airon 3alakes 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3apollution 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asediments 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3azinc 3aChina 0aDistribution 0aLake Taihu1 aLiu, Enfeng 1 aZhu, Yuxin 1 aHu, Shouyun 1 aQu, Wenchuan 0 tHydrobiologia.g2007 May, v. 581, no. 1 p.141-150dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0523-33electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02347naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014500163300001600308520104200324650002501366650001101391650001101402650001501413650002301428650001401451650001001465651001001475651001001485653002601495653002101521653001501542653001501557653002601572700001501598700001701613700001701630700002001647773011201667852000901779856006901788930003301857946001101890655001201901IND4389037320221122032513.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438903732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-006-0452-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBramanti, L. 10aSettlement and early survival of red coral on artificial substrates in different geographic areas: some clues for demography and restoration  ap. 219-224.  aThe red coral Corallium rubrum (L 1758) is a long-lived, slow-growing gorgonian, endemic to Mediterranean rocky bottoms. Because of its high economic value, red coral has long been harvested, and most populations have been depleted. In the present study, 54 marble tiles were placed in June 2003 within red coral populations over 3 different geographic areas (Calafuria-Livorno and Elba MPA in Italy and Medes Islets MPA, in Spain), on vertical cliffs between 25 and 35 m. In each area 2 different sites were randomly selected. Tiles were subsequently sampled photographically. Between July and August 2003 red coral recruits settled on tiles in all the geographic areas and sites, exhibiting wide variability in their density. On the basis of a 2-factors nested ANOVA a significant variability between different sites at a few hundred metres distance occurred, indicating high variations in the recruitment process within the same red coral population. Mortality, measured in June 2004, widely varied between different geographic areas. 3aanalysis of variance 3acliffs 3acorals 3ademography 3aeconomic valuation 3amortality 3atiles 3aItaly 3aSpain 0aArtificial substrates 0aCorallium rubrum 0aOctocorals 0aSettlement 0aWestern Mediterranean1 aRossi, S. 1 aTsounis, G. 1 aGili, J.

Clay-humus complexes were isolated from soil samples collected from different depths of 2 soil profiles from an Inceptisol of North India under long-term rice-wheat and maize-wheat cropping systems. Clay-humus complexes were subjected to repeat extraction with 100mg/L of tartaric acid solutions before and after removal of humus with 30% hydrogen peroxide and the resultant release of potassium and silica was measured. Before removal of humus, K release followed Elovich kinetics for the maize-wheat cropping system.For the rice-wheat cropping system, except surface soil, which followed Elovich kinetics, other subsurface soils followed the power form of kinetic equations. But when humus was partially removed, K release increased exponentially, therelease rate increasing with time. This indicated that for humus-depleted clay, initial release triggered further release of K. Silica was released at a constant rate. The dissolution reaction was incongruent, i.e. the amount of constituents released in solution was not proportional to their mole fraction present in the mineral. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that micaceous mineral was partially dissolved and vermiculite was completely dissolved when humus was partially removed from clay before extraction. This observation indicates that humus adsorbed on clay plays an important role in preventing clay dissolution by organic acids. 3aInceptisols 3aX-ray diffraction 3aclay 3acropping systems 3aequations 3ahumus 3ahydrogen peroxide 3apotassium 3asilica 3asilicon 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3atartaric acid 3avermiculite 3aIndia 0aclay-humus complex 0aK 0aSi 0arelease1 aTakkar, P.N.1 aVerma, U.K.0 tSoil research.g2009, v. 47, no. 7 p.715-724dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-95737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR090023Available from publisher's Web site  a20091106b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02614naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245006900151300001600220500002400236500001500260520127400275650002601549650001201575650002201587650001401609650001401623650002501637650002201662650001301684650003201697650001801729650002101747650003001768651000901798653001501807700001801822700002001840773018001860852000902040856004802049930003302097945001302130946001302143655001202156IND2268188920221121040334.0010405e200102  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226818892DNAL7 a112222492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarzbach, A.E.10aTransgressive character expression in a hybrid sunflower species  ap. 270-277.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDiploid hybrid lineages often are ecologically distinct from their parental species. However, it is unclear whether this niche divergence is typically achieved via hybrid intermediacy, a mixture of parental traits, and/or the evolution of extreme (transgressive) morphological and ecophysiological features. Here we compare an extensively studied hybrid sunflower species, Helianthus anomalus, with its putative parents, H. annus and H. petiolaris, for 41 morphological and 12 ecophysiological traits. Helianthus anomalus was morphologically intermediate for one trait (2.4%), parental-like for 23 traits (56.1%), and transgressive for 17 traits (41.5%). For ecophysiological traits, H. anomalus was not significantly different from one or both parents for nine traits (75%), and was transgressive for the remaining three (25%). Thus, H. anomalus appears to be mosaic of parental-like and transgressive phenotypes. Although the fitness effects of the transgressive characters are not yet known, many of these characters are consistent with adaptations reported for other sand dune plants. Genetic studies are currently underway to ascertain whether these extreme characters arose as a direct byproduct of hybridization or whether they evolved via mutational divergence. 3aHelianthus petiolaris 3ahybrids 3aHelianthus annuus 3aphenotype 3aevolution 3awater use efficiency 3agenetic variation 3amutation 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aplant ecology 3aplant morphology 3atransgressive segregation 3aUtah 0aadaptation1 aDonovan, L.A.1 aRieseberg, L.H.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2001 Feb., v. 88, no. 2 p.270-277dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle04101naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015800129300001600287500013200303500002400435500001500459520212200474650001702596650001302613650002002626650001502646650002302661650001002684650002602694650001602720650001302736650001402749650001302763650002102776650001102797650001102808650002202819650002402841650001802865650001402883650001202897650001402909650002302923650001802946650003502964650001202999650002603011651001603037651001003053653001903063653001503082653001903097700001703116700001803133700001503151773012203166852000903288856008503297930003303382945001303415946001103428655001203439IND2268188520221121025816.0010405e200011  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226818852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, R.B.10aUsing a crop/soil simulation model and GIS techniques to assess methane emissions from rice fields in Asia.

Neue.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe MERES (Methane Emissions from Rice EcoSystems) simulation model was tested using experimental data from IRRI and Maligaya in the Philippines and from Hangzhou in China. There was good agreement between simulated and observed values of total aboveground biomass, root weight, grain yield, and seasonal methane (CH4) emissions. The importance of the contribution of the rice crop to CH4 emissions was highlighted. Rhizodeposition (root exudation and root death) was predicted to contribute about 380 kg C ha-1 of methanogenic substrate over the season, representing 37% of the total methanogenic substrate from all sources when no organic amendments were added. A further 225 kg C ha-1 (22%) was predicted to come from previous crop residues, giving a total of around 60% originating from the rice crop, with the remaining 41% coming from the humic fraction of the soil organic matter (SOM). Sensitivity analysis suggested that the parameter representing transmissivity to gaseous transfer per unit root length (lambda(r)) was important in determining seasonal CH4 emissions. As this transmissivity increased, more O2 was able to diffuse to the rhizosphere, so that CH4 production by methanogens was reduced and more CH4 was oxidized by methanotrophs. These effects outweighed the opposing influence of increased rate of transport of CH4 through the plant, so that the overall effect was to reduce the amount of CH4 emitted over the season. Varying the root-shoot ratio of the crop was predicted to have little effect on seasonal emissions, the increased rates of rhizodeposition being counteracted by the increased rates of O2 diffusion to the rhizosphere. Increasing the length of a midseason drainage period reduced CH4 emissions significantly, but periods longer than 6-7 d also decreased rice yields. Organic amendments with low C/N were predicted to be more beneficial, both in terms of enhancing crop yields and reducing CH4 emissions, even when the same amount of C was applied. This was due to higher rates of immobilization of C into microbial biomass, removing it temporarily as a methanogenic substrate. 3aOryza sativa 3avalidity 3asoil amendments 3acrop yield 3aseasonal variation 3aroots 3abiogeochemical cycles 3arhizosphere 3asoil air 3aoxidation 3adrainage 3aroot shoot ratio 3aoxygen 3aweight 3asimulation models 3asoil organic matter 3acrop residues 3aemissions 3abiomass 3amortality 3amethane production 3aroot exudates 3ageographic information systems 3amethane 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aPhilippines 3aChina 0aorganic matter 0asubstrates 0aimmobilization1 aWassmann, R.1 aBuendia, L.V.1 aKnox, J.W.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2000 Nov., v. 58, no. 1/3 p.161-177dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-13143Tables of contents  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03033naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001700149245006200166300001600228500008100244500002400325506007600349520123000425506003701655650002001692650002001712650001901732650001101751650001001762650001201772650001701784650002501801650002501826650002101851650002501872650001801897650001301915650006601928650001801994650007102012650002602083650002902109653001702138653001102155653001102166700001702177773015102194852000902345856005402354930003302408945001302441946001302454655001202467IND2268115620221207120256.0010403e200101  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226811562DNAL7 a111543322pmid7 aPMC610052pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearce, R.S.10aFreezing of barley studied by infrared video thermography  ap. 227-240.  aIn the Special Issue: 75th Anniversary--Conceptual Breakthroughs in Biology.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFreezing of barley (Hordeum vulgare), Hordeum murinum, and Holcus lanatus was studied using infrared video thermography. In the field, ice could enter H. lanatus leaves through hydathodes. In laboratory tests with barley, initially 0.4% of the leaf water froze, spreading in alternate strips of high and low freezing intensity longitudinally at 1 to 4 cm s-1, and simultaneously spreading laterally at 0.3 cm s1. Similar results were obtained in the field with H. lanatus. A distinct second, more intense, freezing event spread slowly from the margins of the leaves toward the midrib. Organs of uprooted barley tested in the laboratory froze in this order: nucleated leaf, roots, older leaves, younger leaves, and secondary tillers. When ice spread from one leaf to the rest of the plant the crown delayed spread to the roots and other leaves. There was a longer delay above than below -2 degrees C, helping to protect the crown from freezing during mild frosts. Initial spread of freezing was not damaging. However, the initial spread is a prerequisite for the second freezing event, which can cause damage. The route of the initial spread of ice may be extracellular, drawing water from moregel-like parts of the cell wall.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum vulgare 3aHordeum murinum 3aHolcus lanatus 3aleaves 3aroots 3atillers 3afrost injury 3aspatial distribution 3adevelopmental stages 3aplant morphology 3ainfrared photography 3avideo cameras 2aFreezing 2aHordeumxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aInfrared Rays 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aThermographyxmethods 2aVideo Recordingxmethods 0athermography 0atiming 0aspread1 aFuller, M.P.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Jan., v. 125, no. 1 p.227-240dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03507naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001700149245008100166300001600247500008100263500002400344500001500368506007600383520098500459506003701444650002601481650001601507650001001523650001501533650001001548650001001558650002001568650001101588650002501599650001401624650001301638650001201651650001001663650002201673650002001695650002301715650001101738650001301749650001201762650002001774650003601794650002801830650003301858650001701891650001301908650005401921650004201975650002902017650004902046650005202095650003602147653001202183653001702195653001502212653002302227653002002250653003202270700001502302700001702317700001802334700001802352700001702370700001702387773015102404852000902555856005402564930003302618945001302651946001302664655001202677IND2268118720221207120302.0010403e200101  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226811872DNAL7 a111543452pmid7 aPMC610182pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilyeu, K.D.10aMolecular and biochemical characterization of a cytokinin oxidase from maize  ap. 378-386.  aIn the Special Issue: 75th Anniversary--Conceptual Breakthroughs in Biology.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is generally accepted that cytokinin oxidases, which oxidatively remove cytokinin side chains to produce adenine and the corresponding isopentenyl aldehyde, play a major role in regulating cytokinin levels in planta. Partially purified fractions of cytokinin oxidase from various species have been studied for many years, but have yet to clearly reveal the properties of the enzyme or to define its biological significance. Details of the genomic organization of the recently isolated maize (Zea mays) cytokinin oxidase gene (ckx1) and some of its Arabidopsis homologs are now presented. Expression of an intronless ckx1 in Pichia pastoris allowed production of large amounts of recombinant cytokinin oxidase and facilitated detailed kinetic and cofactor analysis and comparison with the native enzyme. The enzyme is a flavoprotein containing covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide, but no detectable heavy metals. Expression of the oxidase in maize tissues is described.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKomagataella pastoris 3anucleotides 3agenes 3aflavonoids 3aroots 3astems 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acorn meal 3aZea mays 3aadenine 3aseeds 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzyme activity 3achemical structure 3aPichia 3akinetics 3aflowers 3aoxidoreductases 3achemical constituents of plants 2aArabidopsisxenzymology 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aKinetics 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aZea maysxenzymologyxgenetics. 0acloning 0alocalization 0ackx1 genes 0agenetic regulation 0aPichia pastoris 0aflavin adenine dinucleotide1 aCole, J.L.1 aLaskey, J.G.1 aRiekhof, W.R.1 aEsparza, T.J.1 aKramer, M.D.1 aMorris, R.O.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Jan., v. 125, no. 1 p.378-386dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03375naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245005400135300001400189500002400203520200400227650002002231650001702251650001202268650001802280650001802298650002202316650001302338650001402351650001102365650002202376650001102398650002102409651001102430653001502441653002702456700001502483700001502498700001502513700001702528773012502545852000902670856016902679930003302848945001302881946001102894655001202905IND2268117920221120232820.0010403e20000925ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226811792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeda-Martinez, A.N.10aScallop growout using a new bottom-culture system  ap. 73-84.  aIncludes references  aA new bottom-culture system was tested at a commercial level to grow catarina scallops (Argopecten ventricosus) in the Rancho Bueno tidal channel in Bahia Magdalena, Mexico. The system consisted of a 50 X 1-m sleeve of 19-mm mesh polyethylene netting placed on the sea floor of selected growout areas. A total of 448 sleeves were deployed at various times from October 1994 to April 1995 in four zones from the mouth to the head of the tidal channel. Each sleeve contained 10,000 scallops (initially 32 mm shell height) at a density of 200 scallops/m2. Fifty-four percent of the spat were produced in a hatchery and the rest were collected using onion-bag collectors. Hatchery and wild spat were deployed separately. Water parameters were measured monthly in each zone: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and total suspended solids. There were better water conditions towards the mouth of the channel. The scallops were harvested from 27 July to 18 August 1995: a total of 2.87 million scallops from the original 4.48 million. Their mean shell height was 56.2 mm and the mean weight of their adductor muscles was 6.8 g. The production was 19.3 t of adductor muscles. Statistically significant differences in mean shell height and mean adductor weight were found between scallops grown in different zones, but no statistically significant differences were found comparing yields from hatchery vs. wild scallops. To find the best culture conditions, a scallop relative value (SRV) was calculated by multiplying survival by adductor muscle weight and relative market price, and dividing by the growout duration. There were higher SRVs for scallops cultured in zones closer to the channel mouth. The highest SRV was found in a group from this zone, with 86% survival, 6.25 g mean adductor weight, and a growout duration of only 3.6 months.

PCC 6803. The Synechocystis NhaP antiporter (SynNhaP) was expressed in Escherichia coli mutant cells, which were deficient in Na+/H+ antiporters. It was found that the SynNhaP complemented the salt-sensitive phenotype of the E. coli mutant. Membrane vesicles prepared from the E. coli mutant transformed with the SynNhaP exhibited the Na+/H+ and Li+/H+ antiporter activities, and their activities were insensitive to amiloride. Moreover, its activity was very high between pH 5 and 9. The replacement of aspartate-138 in SynNhaP with glutamate or tyrosine inactivated the SynNhaP antiporter activity. The deletion of a part of the long C-terminal hydrophilic tail significantly inhibited the antiporter activity. A topological model suggests that aspartate-138 in SynNhaP is conserved in NhaP, SOS1, and AtNHX1 and is involved in the exchange activity. Thus, it appeared that the SynNhaP would provide a model system for the study of structural and functional properties of eucaryotic Na+/H+ antiporters.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyanobacteria 3asodium 3ahydrogen 3aion transport 3agenes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene transfer 3aEscherichia coli 3agene expression 3amutants 3agenetic variation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspartic Acid 2aBase Sequence 2aComputer Simulation 2aCyanobacteriaxmetabolism 2aDNA Primers 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSOS1 Proteinxchemistry 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSodium-Hydrogen Exchangersxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0adeletions 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data 0asynnhap genes 0asynnhap2 genes 0anhap genes 0achaa genes1 aHibino, T.1 aNakamura, T.1 aTakabe, T.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Jan., v. 125, no. 1 p.437-446dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02335naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013200126300001600258500002400274500001500298520079400313650004201107650001801149650001001167650001601177650001201193650001301205650001301218650001401231650001301245650001001258650001301268650001101281650002601292650002101318653001401339653001801353653002601371700001501397700001701412700002301429700001501452773012701467852000901594856016901603930003301772945001301805946001101818655001201829IND2268119420221120222956.0010403e20000925ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226811942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurizi, A.14aThe effect of glycerol dissolved in the rearing water on the transition to exotrophy in gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata larvae  ap. 119-131.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of glycerol added to seawater at different concentrations were tested in monocultures of Chlorella minutissima and Brachionus plicatilis in mixed cultures of these two species and on starved or fed Sparus aurata larvae. Glycerol enhanced the growth of Chlorella and seemed to indirectly benefit the rotifers that feed on it. Its beneficial effect on gilthead sea bream prelarvae and larvae resulted in glycogen accumulation in the liver and absence of signs of cholestasis-like pathology. This effect varied according to the glycerol concentration in the water, to its addition timing and to light and feeding conditions. The gluconeogenic origin of the hepatic glycogen reserves is discussed, together with the mediating role of the food chain in glycerol larval assimilation. 3apathological processes and conditions 3awater quality 3aliver 3acholestasis 3arearing 3aglycogen 3aglycerol 3anutrition 3aRotifera 3awater 3aduration 3alarvae 3aChlorella minutissima 3aapplication rate 0aChlorella 0apagrus aurata 0abrachionus plicatilis1 aDiaz, J.P.1 aDivanach, P.1 aPapandroulakis, N.1 aConnes, R.0 tAquaculture.g2000 Sept. 25, , no. 1/2 p.119-131dElsevier Pub.

The mean erythrocyte surface sialic acid (ESA) concentration was 57.08 ± 1.67, 34.50 ± 2.30 and 20.20 ± 3.54 mg/dl for Mongrel, Alsatian (German shepherd) and Terrier breeds of dogs, respectively, on acid hydrolysis. The mean values of ESA obtained following enzymic hydrolysis of haemoglobin-free erythrocyte membranes using Clostridium chauvoei (Jakari strain) sialidase were 49.08 ± 0.41, 30.97 ± 1.82 and 18.64 ± 0.75 mg/dl for Mongrel, Alsatian (German shepherd) and Terrier dogs respectively. When Trypanosoma vivax sialidase was used the ESA values obtained were 50.81 ± 0.37, 41.70 ± 0.94 and 19.65 + 0.65 mg/dl for Mongrel, Alsatian (German shepherd) and Terrier breeds of dogs respectively. This represents a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) between the mean ESA concentration of all the breeds of dogs investigated in this study. The higher mean ESA concentration in Mongrel dogs, compared to the exotic breeds may be responsible for their resistance to disease conditions, whose aetiologic agents produce neuraminidase and also cause anaemia. 0aSialic acid 0aMongrel 0aExotic dogs1 aAina, Adenike I. 1 aAdeiza, Abubakar A. 1 aNok, Andrew J. 0 tGlycoconjugate journal.g2007 Nov., v. 24, no. 8 p.491-495dBoston : Springer USx0282-00807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10719-007-9041-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03257naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245016200124300001600286500002400302500001500326520169500341650001002036650002002046650002202066650001202088650001302100650001902113650002102132650002002153650001102173650001802184650001602202650002002218650001702238650002102255653001602276653001002292653001802302653002902320653001102349700001602360700001402376773012602390852000902516856016902525930003302694945001302727946001102740655001202751IND2256371120221120211216.0010328e20000720ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND225637112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, S.M.10aEffects of feeding frequency and dietary moisture content on growth, body composition and gastric evacuation of juvenile Korean rockfish (Sebastes schlegeli)  ap. 399-409.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA 7-week feeding experiment was conducted to determine the optimum feeding frequency for growth, body composition and gastric evacuation of the juvenile Korean rockfish. Three replicate groups of the fish (average weight of 5.7 g) were fed to visual satiety either dry pellets (DP) or moist pellets (MP), at different feeding frequencies (two meals a day, one meal a day or one meal every 2 days). At the end of the feeding trial, gastric evacuation rate of the fish was monitored after feeding. Weight gain and daily feed intake of the fish were not affected by dietary moisture content, whereas they were significantly affected by feeding frequency (P < 0.05). Weight gain and daily feed intake of the fish fed DP or MP once a day and twice a day were significantly higher than once every 2 days (P < 0.05). Feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio in the fish fed MP were not affected by feeding frequency (P > 0.05), but these variables in the fish fed DP once every 2 days were significantly higher than once a day or twice a day (P < 0.05). As feeding frequency decreased, moisture content of muscle and liver increased. Both feeding frequency and dietary moisture content had no significant effect on protein content of muscle and viscera (P < 0.05). As feeding frequency increased, lipid content of muscle, viscera and liver significantly increased (P < 0.05). Gastric contents peaked at 4 h after feeding, then gradually decreased until the 20th h and reached the pre-feeding level within 24 h. It is concluded that one meal a day is more effective than two meals a day or one meal every 2 days for improving growth performance of juvenile Korean rockfish grown from 6 to 20 g. 3aliver 3afeed conversion 3afeeding frequency 3amuscles 3aSebastes 3apelleted feeds 3abody composition 3aliveweight gain 3alipids 3awater content 3afeed intake 3aprotein content 3afish feeding 3agastric emptying 0aperformance 0afeeds 0aanimal organs 0aprotein efficiency ratio 0agrowth1 aHwang, U.G.1 aCho, S.H.0 tAquaculture.g2000 July 20, , no. 3/4 p.399-409dElsevier Pub.

Studies were conducted to understand the impact of reduced water in peach production and fruit quality that might help to manage chlorosis. Two field experiments were conducted in 2011 and 2012 in âCresthavenâ and âRedhavenâ peaches, respectively at the Western Colorado Research Center, Grand Junction, CO. In 2011, a randomized block design with five different treatments, irrigation set for 12 hours (control) and 6 hours, and set on a -1,000, -1,500 and -2,000 millibar (mb) trigger, were applied and replicated 4 times. In 2012 slightly different treatments of triggering irrigation at -1,000 mb, -1,500 mb, -2,000 mb, for a preset 12 hour period, and for 24 hours equal to a grower standard (control) were tested and replicated three times. In both years, two trees per replication were selected for observation where the water was monitored at a weekly interval until fruit ripening. Fruits were harvested twice during normal harvest, and total number of fruits and total fruit weight per tree were recorded. Five random fruits in each treatment were randomly selected for fruit quality analysis. Individual fruit weight, fruit size, brix, pH, and acid content were measured. The fruit firmness was tested on the sun and shade sides of a single randomly selected fruit out of the five fruits selected for fruit quality. The data were analyzed and mean comparisons done by SAS. The results indicated that there was no impact of irrigation practices tested on fruit number, total weight, size, brix, tartaric acid, and firmness in both the cultivars. This clearly indicated that limiting water is possible without impacting fruit production and quality. This will help growers to overcome iron chlorosis by reducing irrigation with high pH water. 3abrix 3achlorosis 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3afield experimentation 3afirmness 3afruit growing 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agrowers 3aorchards 3apeaches 3aripening 3asoil pH 3atartaric acid 3atrees 3aColorado1 aReighard, G.

The four genera of the subfamily differ, however, in chromosome number, floral novelties, and pollen exine sculpturing, which led to suggestions that the Gronovioideae were polyphyletic. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the chloroplast gene matK and the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of nuclear rDNA have been conducted using parsimony and maximum likelihood methods to assess the monophyly of Gronovioideae and to determine the sister group relationships of gronovioid genera. The results show Gronovioideae are monophyletic and placed as the sister to Mentzelia. Within Gronovioideae, Petalonyx is sister to a clade consisting of Cevallia, Gronovia, and Fuertesia. Among the remaining Loasaceae, subfamily Mentzelioideae, as originally circumscribed, is paraphyletic.

Rice fields are a major source of atmospheric CH4, which is an important greenhouse gas. In this study, field and laboratory experiments showed that growing Azolla as a dual crop could enhance CH4 emission from rice fields. In pot experiments, indications showed that Azolla could mediate CH4 transport from the floodwater of a rice soil into the atmosphere. It was also found that due to the presence of Azolla, chemical soil properties could be developed, stimulating CH4 production and decreasing in situ CH4 removal. 3agas production (biological) 3aOryza sativa 3aAzolla 3aoxidation 3afield experimentation 3adiffusion 3asoil chemistry 3amethane 3aemissions 3arice 3aflooded conditions 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3amethane production 3aChina1 aBoeckx, P.1 aChen, G.X.1 aCleemput, O. van.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2000 Nov., v. 58, no. 1/3 p.321-326dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-13143Tables of contents  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02099naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011500176300001800291520087000309536008301179592002801262596001901290650001101309650001301320650001601333653003201349653002401381653002401405653002001429653003201449653002001481700001701501773012401518856008601642852000901728655001201737IND60781208520221122010829.0220625e20220611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078120852DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2022.20727352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Mustafa Utku10aDevelopment of ensemble approaches based on performance of statistical methods for daily streamflow estimation  ap. 1199-1215.  aThis study presents an extension of an existing performance-based weighting system to combine statistical streamflow estimates for ungauged basins. Three statistical methods, namely the drainage area ratio (DAR) method, the standardization with mean (SM) method, and the inverse similarity weighting (ISW) method, have been applied to two sub-basins of the Euphrates basin in Turkey. To improve the effectiveness of the daily streamflow estimation in ungauged basins, ensemble approaches that combine the results of two or three statistical methods have been proposed based on a weighting system using various performance measures. The overall results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approaches with the performance-based weighting system are beneficial to enhance the performance of the statistical methods in estimating daily streamflow at ungauged basins.  aThis work was supported by the Istanbul Technical University [MDK-2017-40717].  aPublisher supplied data  aMDK-2017-40717 3abasins 3adrainage 3astream flow 0adaily streamflow estimation 0adrainage area ratio 0aensemble approaches 0aEuphrates basin 0aperformance-based weighting 0aungauged basins1 aOnoz, Bihrat0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2022 June 11, v. 67, no. 8 p.1199-1215dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2022.20727353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04400naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005200140245016200192500001900354500002000373520270200393592002803095596005903123650002103182650003103203650001403234650002003248650003803268650002103306650002003327650002003347650001703367650002403384650003703408650001703445650004103462650002003503650003403523650001903557650000903576650003603585700001503621700001603636700001703652700001503669773012703684856007403811852000903885655001203894IND60723925520221122132341.0210118e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072392552DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.135442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7518-723110aβ‐Carotene attenuates LPS‐induced rat intestinal inflammation via modulating autophagy and regulating the JAK2/STAT3 and JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathways  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInflammation is a protective response of the immune defense system and inflammatory response could be regulated by autophagy. β‐Carotene has shown anti‐inflammatory potential. However, whether β‐carotene could alleviate rat intestinal inflammation by modulating autophagy and its anti‐inflammation underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we found that β‐carotene significantly reduced (p < .05) the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin (PG)E2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α, and interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) levels by the Griess reaction and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and we found that β‐carotene significantly suppressed (p < .05) the mRNA expression levels of IL‐1β and TNF‐α by RT‐PCR. In addition, H&E staining revealed that β‐carotene could improve intestinal morphology and cell morphology. Furthermore, the levels of signaling proteins of microtubule‐associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), AKT, Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3), nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB), and c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) were detected by Western blot analysis. We found that β‐carotene significantly attenuated (p < .05) the related signaling proteins activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in rats. Moreover, this conclusion was also verified in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)‐6. 3‐Methyladenine (3‐MA) is widely used as inhibitor of autophagy via its inhibitory effect on class III PI3K. Simultaneously, pretreatment of 3‐MA suppressed the inhibiting effects of β‐carotene on the related signaling proteins. This study demonstrates that β‐carotene could attenuate the LPS‐induced intestinal inflammation in rats via modulating autophagy and regulating the JAK2/STAT3 and JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathways. We also found the same phenomenon when we verified the results with the IEC‐6 cells. These findings provide new insights into improving the nutritional value of basic diets and enhancing immune performance. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: β‐Carotene is a generally acknowledged natural carotenoid nutrient that exhibits provitamin A activity, and it is widely found in fruits or vegetables. Our study provide a new insight into the anti‐inflammatory mechanism of β‐carotene. Treatment with β‐carotene can be used for the beneficial effect against LPS‐induced inflammation damage. This study not only lays the foundation for the related research on the anti‐inflammatory properties of β‐carotene in vitro and in rat models, but also holds important significance in the field of food.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672511cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aautophagy 3acell structures 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3anutritive value 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprostaglandins 3arats 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aLi, Ruonan1 aHui, Junnan1 aLi, Lingqian1 aZheng, Xin0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e13544-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.135443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015400158300001800312520104700330592002801377650003401405650001701439650002401456650002101480650001501501650001601516650004301532650001901575650002201594650002001616650002601636650002301662650002601685700001501711700001601726700001501742700001701757700001401774700001501788700001701803700001601820773012801836856007401964852000902038655001202047IND60656757820221121202725.0190814e20140612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065675782DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00193a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Hui-Long12aA systematic quality control method of Huangqi decoction: simultaneous determination of eleven flavonoids and seven triterpenoid saponins by UHPLC-MS  ap. 4593-4601.  aA novel method of ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) was developed for the quantitative analysis of 18 major bioactive components from Huangqi decoction (HQD). HQD is a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) commonly used to treat consumptive and chronic liver diseases. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reverse-phase C₁₈ column for 30 min at a flow rate of 1 mL min⁻¹. The optimum mobile phase for the gradient elution was 0.05% aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile. All of the analytes showed good linearity over the tested concentration ranges (r² > 0.9972). The recoveries of the three concentration levels ranged from 91.14% to 106.21% with relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 4.69%. Intra- and inter-day precisions were less than 4.73% and 4.97%, respectively. Moreover, this method was successfully used to determine the content of HQD extracts in three different batches. Hence, this method could be used for the multi-component quality control of HQD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aacetonitrile 3abioactive compounds 3achemical species 3aflavonoids 3aformic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliver diseases 3amass spectrometry 3aquality control 3aquantitative analysis 3astandard deviation 3atriterpenoid saponins1 aZhong, Jie1 aYe, Fu-Yuan1 aWang, Qian1 aMa, Yue-Ming1 aLiu, Ping1 aZhang, Hua1 aSun, Ming-Yu1 aJiang, Jian0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 June 12, v. 6, no. 13 p.4593-4601dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00193a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014500166300001600311520103800327592002801365650002901393650001601422650003501438650001501473650001601488650001101504650000901515650002401524650001301548650001501561651001401576651001101590700002601601700002201627700002201649700002001671773009601691856008101787852000901868655001201877IND60123629820221118002515.0150327e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012362982DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293150300232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBugaets, A.

The analysis of the territory was consecutively performed for its mountain and plain parts and for floodplain landscapes. The morphometric parameters of the relief (height, slope steepness, and slope curvature) were analyzed with the help of overlay functions of geographic information systems for the areas of the main soils of the studied territory and compared with the major soil cover characteristics in order to find stable combinations of the factors explaining the spatial distribution of the soil areas. As a result, we determined the major elements of the relief controlling the spatial differentiation of the soil cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigital elevation models 3afloodplains 3ageographic information systems 3alandscapes 3amorphometry 3arivers 3asoil 3asoil classification 3asoil map 3awatersheds 3aEast Asia 3aRussia1 aPshenichnikova, N.

The electrochemical behavior of guaiacol was studied on different carbon material surfaces. Compared with the bare glassy carbon, graphite, and GO, RGO nanosheets exhibited a strong enhancement effect and the electrochemical oxidation response of guaiacol was remarkably improved. The influences of the pH value, amount of RGO, scan rate and accumulation time on the oxidation signal of guaiacol were investigated. Based on the enhancement effect of RGO, a simple, fast and sensitive electrochemical method was developed for the detection of guaiacol. The linear range was from 0.5 μM to 500 μM with a correlation coefficient of 0.998, and the limit of detection was as low as 0.2 μM (S/N = 3).

Existing approaches that modify bottom roughness or a drag coefficient are inadequate for macro-structures (large emergent or submerged obstacles) in subgrid-scale narrow twisted channels. Such structures partially block the cross-sectional area and provide enhanced topographic dissipation – effects that are not well represented by a drag coefficient that scales on a coarse-grid cell-averaged velocity and the cell volume. The relative alignment between mesh and flow further complicates this problem as it makes the subgrid model sensitive to mesh design. In the present study, three new approaches for simulating subgrid-scale macro-structures in narrow channels are proposed. The interior partial-blocking effect of structures is modeled as reduction of grid face-area. The sheltering of flow volumes around obstacles, which leads to topographic dissipation, is modeled by reducing the cell volume in the momentum equation (only). A mesh-shift procedure is designed to optimize mesh alignment for identifiable subgrid features. Combining the three subgrid methods improves the approximation of surface elevation and in-channel flow rate with a coarse-grid model. Tests are conducted for channelized flow using both synthetic domains and real marsh topography. The new methods reduce the overall mesh dependency of the subgrid model and provides stronger physical connection between effects of macro-structures and their geometry at coarse grid scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrag coefficient 3aequations 3amarshes 3amodels 3amomentum 3aroughness 3atopography 3awater resources 0aSubgrid topography model 0aGrid alignment 0aNarrow twisted channel 0aSubgrid macro-structures 0aTopographic dissipation1 aHodges, Ben R.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2020 Jan., v. 135 p.103465-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.1034653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245006100158300001800219500001100237520109000248592002801338650002501366650001501391650002901406650001701435650002601452650002201478650001401500650001301514700001901527700002201546700002101568700001801589773009501607856007301702852000901775655001201784IND60408567720221119172509.0150909e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040856772DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.124862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlouin, Manuel10aLevels and limits in artificial selection of communities  ap. 1040-1048.  aLETTER  aArtificial selection of individuals has been determinant in the elaboration of the Darwinian theory of natural selection. Nowadays, artificial selection of ecosystems has proven its efficiency and could contribute to a theory of natural selection at several organisation levels. Here, we were not interested in identifying mechanisms of adaptation to selection, but in establishing the proof of principle that a specific structure of interaction network emerges under ecosystem artificial selection. We also investigated the limits in ecosystem artificial selection to evaluate its potential in terms of managing ecosystem function. By artificially selecting microbial communities for low CO₂ emissions over 21 generations (n = 7560), we found a very high heritability of community phenotype (52%). Artificial selection was responsible for simpler interaction networks with lower interaction richness. Phenotype variance and heritability both decreased across generations, suggesting that selection was more likely limited by sampling effects than by stochastic ecosystem dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial selection 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheritability 3amicrobial communities 3anatural selection 3aphenotype 3avariance1 aKarimi, Battle1 aMathieu, Jérôme1 aLerch, Thomas Z.1 aGrover, James0 tEcology letters.g2015 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.1040-1048dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.124863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245016600207300001100373506007600384520219800460592002802658506003702686650002002723650001602743650002002759650001502779650001102794650001402805650000902819650001102828650001202839650002402851650001102875651001002886700001802896700002402914700006102938700002102999773011203020856008203132852000903214655001203223IND60615141520221207132726.0200722e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061514152DNAL7 a303058342pmid7 aPMC61711982pmcid7 a10.1186/s12983-018-0281-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattioli, Luca10aEstimation of pack density in grey wolf (Canis lupus) by applying spatially explicit capture-recapture models to camera trap data supported by genetic monitoring  ap. 38.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Density estimation is a key issue in wildlife management but is particularly challenging and labour-intensive for elusive species. Recently developed approaches based on remotely collected data and capture-recapture models, though representing a valid alternative to more traditional methods, have found little application to species with limited morphological variation. We implemented a camera trap capture-recapture study to survey wolf packs in a 560-km² area of Central Italy. Individual recognition of focal animals (alpha) in the packs was possible by relying on morphological and behavioural traits and was validated by non-invasive genotyping and inter-observer agreement tests. Two types (Bayesian and likelihood-based) of spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) models were fitted on wolf pack capture histories, thus obtaining an estimation of pack density in the area. RESULTS: In two sessions of camera trapping surveys (2014 and 2015), we detected a maximum of 12 wolf packs. A Bayesian model implementing a half-normal detection function without a trap-specific response provided the most robust result, corresponding to a density of 1.21 ± 0.27 packs/100 km² in 2015. Average pack size varied from 3.40 (summer 2014, excluding pups and lone-transient wolves) to 4.17 (late winter-spring 2015, excluding lone-transient wolves). CONCLUSIONS: We applied for the first time a camera-based SCR approach in wolves, providing the first robust estimate of wolf pack density for an area of Italy. We showed that this method is applicable to wolves under the following conditions: i) the existence of sufficient phenotypic/behavioural variation and the recognition of focal individuals (i.e. alpha, verified by non-invasive genotyping); ii) the investigated area is sufficiently large to include a minimum number of packs (ideally 10); iii) a pilot study is carried out to pursue an adequate sampling design and to train operators on individual wolf recognition. We believe that replicating this approach in other areas can allow for an assessment of density variation across the wolf range and would provide a reliable reference parameter for ecological studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aCanis lupus 3acamera trapping 3agenotyping 3amodels 3aphenotype 3apups 3asummer 3asurveys 3awildlife management 3awolves 3aItaly1 aCanu, Antonio1 aPassilongo, Daniela1 aScandura, Massimo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2754-68661 aApollonio, Marco0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2018 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.38-38dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001775x1742-99947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-018-0281-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245005400206300001800260500001500278506007600293520145400369592002801823506003701851650002501888650002401913650000901937650002401946650001401970650001101984650001401995653001702009700002402026700002102050700001902071773009502090856007302185852000902258655001202267IND60408567820221207101525.0150909e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040856782DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.124792doi7 aPMC48608162pmcid7 a262610492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Pieter T.

Here, we review recent research on diversity–disease relationships and identify future priorities. Growing evidence from experimental, observational and modelling studies indicates that biodiversity changes alter infection for a range of pathogens and through diverse mechanisms. Drawing upon lessons from the community ecology of free‐living organisms, we illustrate how recent advances from biodiversity research generally can provide necessary theoretical foundations, inform experimental designs, and guide future research at the interface between infectious disease risk and changing ecological communities. Dilution effects are expected when ecological communities are nested and interactions between the pathogen and the most competent host group(s) persist or increase as biodiversity declines. To move beyond polarising debates about the generality of diversity effects and develop a predictive framework, we emphasise the need to identify how the effects of diversity vary with temporal and spatial scale, to explore how realistic patterns of community assembly affect transmission, and to use experimental studies to consider mechanisms beyond simple changes in host richness, including shifts in trophic structure, functional diversity and symbiont composition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afunctional diversity 3ainfectious diseases 3arisk 3aexperimental design 3asymbionts 3amodels 3apathogens 0abiodiversity1 aOstfeld, Richard S.1 aKeesing, Felicia1 aSeabloom, Eric0 tEcology letters.g2015 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.1119-1133dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.124793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01151naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245005600162300001600218520024200234592002800476650001000504650001400514650001800528650001500546650002200561700001500583700001400598700001500612773011800627856008300745852000900828655001200837IND60648019820221119135149.0190917e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064801982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-019-02722-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, S.12aA New Cucurbitacin Glucoside from Luffa graveolense  ap. 490-492.  aA new cucurbitacin glucoside has been isolated from an ethanolic extract of Luffa graveolense, along with four known cucurbitacins.

Several hypotheses derived from theory, experiments and observational field studies have been advanced, yet a unified explanation remains elusive. Here, we identify common predictors of trophic control in a synthetic analysis of 52 observational field studies conducted within marine ecosystems across the Northern Hemisphere and published between 1951 and 2014. Spatial regression analysis of 45 candidate variables revealed temperature to be the dominant predictor, with unimodal effects on trophic control operating both directly (r² = 0.32; P < 0.0001) and indirectly through influences on turnover rate and quality of primary production, biodiversity and omnivory. These findings indicate that temperature is an overarching determinant of the trophic dynamics of marine ecosystems, and that variation in ocean temperature will affect the trophic structure of marine ecosystems through both direct and indirect mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3amarine ecosystems 3aomnivores 3aprimary productivity 3aregression analysis 3awater temperature1 aFrank, Kenneth T.1 aWorm, Boris1 aLeggett, William C.1 aDe Leo, Giulio0 tEcology letters.g2015 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.1001-1011dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.124813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016500170300001600335520095100351592002801302653003401330653002501364653001201389653001501401653001901416700002001435700001801455700001201473700001501485700001601500700001201516700001901528700001401547773010301561856008701664852000901751655001201760IND60594161320221117003447.0180510e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059416132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2018.01.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dandan10aElectrochemical performance of Li-rich Li[Li0.2Mn0.56Ni0.17Co0.07]O2 cathode stabilized by metastable Li2SiO3 surface modification for advanced Li-ion batteries  ap. 244-253.  aWith the desirable energy densities, Li-rich layered cathodes have attracted great attention as potential candidates for next generation Li-ion batteries (LIBs). In this context, the Li-rich layered cathode Li[Li0.2Mn0.56Ni0.17Co0.07]O2 (LMNCO) is prepared and surface modified homogeneously with Li-conductive Li2SiO3 layer via a facile co-precipitation process. It is found that the 3 wt% Li2SiO3 modified Li-rich cathode delivers a specific capacity as high as 207 mAh g⁻¹ after 50 cycles, which results from the interplay among the electrode, Li2SiO3 coating layer and the electrolyte. Further analysis indicates that the Li2SiO3 layer could effectively balance the exfoliation of surface alkaline speciation and the dissolution of surface transition metal to generate the LiMnNiCoSiO protection layer, which will beneficial to the Li surface diffusion kinetics and the electrochemical stability of Li-rich layered materials as well.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLi[Li0.2Mn0.56Ni0.17Co0.07]O2 0aSurface modification 0aLi2SiO3 0aLewis acid 0aLi-ion battery1 aZhang, Xiaoping1 aXiao, Ruijuan1 aLu, Xia1 aLi, Yaping1 aXu, Tinghua1 aPan, Du1 aHu, Yong-Sheng1 aBai, Ying0 tElectrochimica acta.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 265 p.244-253dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2018.01.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245005900161300001600220520142400236592002801660650001201688650001801700650001001718650002001728650002201748650001501770650000901785650002701794650001401821650002501835650001001860650001701870650003501887700001901922700001701941700001501958773010601973856008102079852000902160655001202169IND60574320920221121032445.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057432092DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954170100452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aE, G. -X.10aGenetic diversity of three Chinese native sheep breeds  ap. 118-127.  aThe sheep (Ovis aries L.) has been an important farm animal species since its domestication. A wide array of indigenous sheep breeds with abundant phenotypic diversity exists for domestication and selection. Therefore, assessing the genetic diversity of a local sheep resource using a multi-molecular system is helpful for maintaining and conserving those breeds. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of three native Chinese sheep breeds (Tibetan sheep, Sishui Fur sheep, and Small-tailed Han sheep) using 15 microsatellite markers and the second exon of the DRA gene. In regards to the microsatellites, on average, 19 alleles per loci were observed among all individuals. Across loci, the HO within the population was 0.652 ± 0.022 in Tibetan sheep, 0.603 ± 0.023 in Small-tailed Han sheep and 0.635 ± 0.022 in SFS, and for most populations, the H E and H O were inconsistent. In addition, affluent private alleles within the breed indicated that the breeds have different domestication histories or sites. In regards to the 2 exon of the DRA gene, three haplotypes were constructed by seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were identified in the second DRA exon and inferred the potential for phenotypic variety in these Chinese native sheep. In summary, the current study reveals the importance of implementing effective conservation strategies for these three native Chinese sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3adomestication 3aexons 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3asheep 3asheep breeds 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aHuang, Y. -Fu.1 aZhao, Y. -Ju1 aHe, J. -N.0 tRussian journal of genetics.g2017 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.118-127dPleiades Publishingx1022-79547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10227954170100453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002100163245011300184300001600297500001900313500000900332520074900341592002801090650002401118650001401142650003101156650001201187650002401199700001801223773012101241856009801362852000901460655001201469IND60665329720221119142029.0191122e196809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066532972DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1968.0011183X000800050041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurton, Glenn W.10aReciprocal Maintainer-Restorer Relationship between A1 and A2 Sterile Cytoplasms Facilitates Millet Breeding  ap. 632-634.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aThe reciprocal maintainer-restorer relationship found to exist between the maintainers for A₁ and A₂ sterile cytoplasms in pearl millet, Pennisetum typhoides (Burm.)

In this study, stigma lengths were compared among four different developmental stages (T1-T4) of 30 rice materials under two environments (years) and in 10 measurement periods (D1-D120) of 3 rice materials after treatment with 6 fixatives (S1–S6), and finally the results revealed that the T3 were the best sampling stage and the S6 was the most suitable fixative for stigma length. This study thoroughly describes the process for surveying and measuring stigma length in 6 steps: preparation before sampling, flower sampling, focusing, flower dissection and imaging, obtaining measurements, and data analysis. These findings provide an outline of the methodology for the discovery, fine mapping, and functional analysis of the genes that control the stigma length trait.  aThis research was funded by the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice (Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center), grant number 2018KF01; the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 31601374 and the Program of Rice Genetic Breeding Key Laboratory of Anhui Province, the Program of Rice Molecular Breeding International Joint Research Center and Joint Laboratory of Rice Institute of Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Temasek Academy of Life Sciences, grant number SDKF-201904.

The amphibian disease chytridiomycosis, caused by infection with the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is implicated in the severe decline of over 200 amphibian species. In species that have declined but not become extinct, Bd persists and can cause substantial ongoing mortality. High rates of mortality associated with Bd may drive major changes in host demography, but this process is poorly understood. Here, we compared population age structure of Bd‐infected populations, Bd‐free populations and museum specimens collected prior to Bd emergence for the endangered Australian frog, Litoria verreauxii alpina (alpine tree frog). We then used population simulations to investigate how pathogen‐associated demographic shifts affect the ability of populations to persist in stochastic environments. We found that Bd‐infected populations have a severely truncated age structure associated with very high rates of annual adult mortality. Near‐complete annual adult turnover in Bd‐infected populations means that individuals breed once, compared with Bd‐free populations where adults may breed across multiple years. Our simulations showed that truncated age structure erodes the capacity of populations to withstand periodic recruitment failure; a common challenge for species reproducing in uncertain environments. We document previously undescribed demographic shifts associated with a globally emerging pathogen and demonstrate how these shifts alter host ecology. Truncation of age structure associated with Bd effectively reduces host niche width and can help explain the contraction of L. v. alpina to perennial waterbodies where the risk of drought‐induced recruitment failure is low. Reduced capacity to tolerate other sources of mortality may explain variation in decline severity among other chytridiomycosis‐challenged species and highlights the potential to mitigate disease impacts through minimizing other sources of mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3aLitoria 3aadults 3aage structure 3ademography 3adrought 3afrogs 3afungi 3amortality 3apathogens 3apopulation dynamics 3arisk 3asurface water1 aHunter, David A.1 aBanks, Sam C.1 aPierson, Jennifer C.1 aSkerratt, Lee F.1 aWebb, Rebecca1 aDriscoll, Don A.0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 85, no. 6 p.1453-1460dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.125693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245016600172300001600338520110700354592002801461653002201489653001701511653001201528653002201540700002101562700002301583700001901606773010301625856008701728852000901815655001201824IND60594161520221117002848.0180510e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059416152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2018.01.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Shibin10aRole of electrochemical process parameters on the electrodeposition of silicon from 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ionic liquid  ap. 166-174.  aThe electrodeposition from Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) has recently emerged as a low cost technique for the growth of group IV thin films or nanostructures giving some promising alternative to classical physical vapour or chemical vapour deposition techniques. As a relatively new field of research, only few studies exist describing the growth mechanism of electrodeposition from RTILs, especially for Si films. In the present work, Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (EQCM) and potentiostatic electrodeposition techniques have been used to study the role of the applied potential, the concentration of electroactive species, the temperature, and the use of organic additive on the electrodeposition of Si from 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ionic liquid. The demonstrated investigation of the influence of these parameters on the purity and morphological features gives a better control over the growth of Si thin films and optimizes the technique to grow Si with structural properties suitable for specific applications.  aPublisher supplied data 0aElectrodeposition 0aIonic liquid 0aSilicon 0aGrowth parameters1 aKowalski, Damian1 aMolinari, Michaël1 aMallet, Jeremy0 tElectrochimica acta.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 265 p.166-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2018.01.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009800169300001600267520090600283536009501189592002801284596002601312650000801338650001501346650002001361650001301381653001401394653001901408653000901427653001201436700002201448700002201470700002001492773011801512856008501630852000901715655001201724IND60746193720221116200335.0210729e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074619372DNAL7 a10.1080/1343943X.2020.18348672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamura, Shin10aRoot sampling and RNA extraction methods for field-based gene expression analysis of soybeans  ap. 339-345.  aIsolation of an adequate quantity of high-quality RNA is a crucial step in gene expression analysis. Difficulties in sampling and RNA extraction of field-grown crops, especially from roots, are substantial obstacles to understanding actual gene expression in the field. We examined the effectiveness of the RNA extraction method (FRP) using pot- and field-grown soybean roots. High quantity and quality of total RNA could extract by the FRP method from both pot- and field-grown soybean roots at different growth stages. To determine the influence of root washing during the sampling process, roots were washed with water for 5 s, 1 min, and 5 min, then analyzed for aquaporin gene expression levels. Root washing for 5 min affected gene expression of some aquaporins. To obtain RNA that reflects the correct gene expression profile, it is necessary to minimize the effects of the sampling process.  aThis research was financially supported in part by JSPS KEKENHI [Grant Number JP18K14451].  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant Number 18K14451 3aRNA 3aaquaporins 3agene expression 3asoybeans 0aAquaporin 0aRNA extraction 0aroot 0asoybean1 aMumtahina, Nabila1 aShimono, Hiroyuki1 aMatsunami, Maya0 tPlant production science.g2021 July 03, v. 24, no. 3 p.339-345dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18963x1349-10087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1343943X.2020.18348673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04076naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003300188245010800221300001100329506007600340520245500416592002802871506003702899650001902936650002702955650001902982650001303001650002403014650002803038650002403066650002303090650001403113650001603127650001203143650002403155650001003179651000903189651001003198700003303208700002703241700002803268700002903296700002803325773012703353856008103480852000903561655001203570IND60615141920221207132715.0190618e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061514192DNAL7 a10.1186/s13006-018-0187-42doi7 aPMC61712302pmcid7 a303058372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Pascual, Juan Luis10aComparison of attitudes to breastfeeding among Spanish-born and Chinese-born postpartum women in Madrid  ap. 45.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Maternal breastfeeding is a practice that is associated with multiple health benefits for mothers and children. One of the lowest rates of breastfeeding has been observed among Chinese women who immigrate to high income countries. At present, there is a lack of comparative information between this group and that of Spanish-born women. Considering the relationship between the attitude of women towards breastfeeding and the initiation of breastfeeding, the aim of the study was to determine whether the attitude towards breastfeeding among Chinese postpartum women who have immigrated to Spain differs from that of Spanish-born postpartum women. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, with between-group comparison, of 73 postpartum Spanish-born and Chinese immigrant women admitted to the maternity units of “12 de Octubre” Hospital (Spain) between April and November 2016. Attitudes toward breastfeeding were analyzed using the Spanish or Chinese version of the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS). A wide set of socioeconomic, biological, working and attitudinal conditions were considered as covariates. The association between IIFAS and country of origin was assessed by three multiple linear regression models (B, SE, and 95% confidence interval were calculated). RESULTS: All Chinese women were first generation immigrants. Chinese-born women were four years younger than Spanish-born mothers, had a lower educational level, more frequently had a paid job (mainly self-employed), and planned to return to work almost two months earlier than Spanish-born mothers did. Most Chinese women did not breastfeed exclusively. Chinese immigrant women obtained scores of approximately 9 points less in the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) when compared to Spanish-born women [95% CI -15.59, -2.48], after adjusting for the different socioeconomic, educational and work-related factors. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese-born women resident in Spain present a lower score on the IIFAS, when compared to Spanish-born women, which implies a more negative attitude towards breastfeeding. The between-groups difference is consistent, even when adjusting for known confounders and other factors which could affect the attitude of the mothers. It is therefore striking that, despite being in Spain, Chinese-born women maintain these preferences/attitudes regarding breastfeeding, compared with Spanish-born women, who obtain overall high scores.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChinese people 3aattitudes and opinions 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3adeveloped countries 3aeducational status 3ahospitals 3aimmigration 3amothers 3aregression analysis 3awomen 3aIowa 3aSpain1 aAguilar-Ortega, Juana María1 aEsteban-Gonzalo, Laura1 aMesa-Leiva, Concepción1 aPérez-García, Santiago1 aCardenete-Reyes, César0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-018-0187-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010400168300001600272520153200288536026301820592002802083596002202111596001602133596001602149596001902165650001402184650002202198650001302220650001402233650001602247650002102263650001102284650001302295650001702308650001702325653001602342653002302358653001602381653001002397700001902407700002002426700001602446700001702462700001802479773011802497856008502615852000902700655001202709IND60746193820221116200953.0210729e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074619382DNAL7 a10.1080/1343943X.2020.18393502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengyou10aContribution of different genotypic roots to drought resistance in soybean by a grafting experiment  ap. 317-325.  aKnowledge on the existing root diversity in germplasms has been emphasized for soybean breeding to improve drought resistance. Yet, evaluation of root diversity for vast genotypes still remains challenging. Here we investigated the contribution of different genotypic roots to drought resistance by a grafting experiment. A total of 22 cultivars were used as rootstocks to graft with scions of drought-sensitive cultivar L21. Water withholding was imposed during 15 days at podding stage in pot-culture experiments. The root-related traits were measured under well-watered (WW) and water-stressed (WS) conditions. At maturity, the drought-resistance coefficient (DRC) was calculated as the yield under WS condition relative to WW yield. The DRC varied from 0.56 to 0.85 among grafts; thus, the rootstocks were categorized as drought-sensitive (DS), moderate (M) and drought-resistant (DR) types. The L21 scion grafted onto DR rootstocks resulted in higher DRC and greater drought resistance than those self-grafts. There were also significant interactions between water stress and genotype for root-related traits. With the increase of DRC, the plants showed linear increases in root length, root surface area, and root volume, but had linear decreases in root dry mass, root–shoot ratio and root tissue density under WS rather than WW conditions. We suggested that developed rooting with a low investment on dry matter identified by grafting experiments should be selected to improve drought resistance in soybean breeding.  aThis study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFD0100201-01), Liaoning Doctoral Foundations (2019-BS-134), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant (2017M621157) and Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System (CARS-004-CES11).  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0100201-01  a2019-BS-134  a2017M621157  aCARS-004-CES11 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3apot culture 3aroot shoot ratio 3ascions 3asoybeans 3asurface area 3awater stress 0aroot traits 0adrought resistance 0aglycine max 0agraft1 aCao, Yongqiang1 aWang, Changling1 aSun, Xugang1 aWang, Wenbin1 aSong, Shuhong0 tPlant production science.g2021 July 03, v. 24, no. 3 p.317-325dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18963x1349-10087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1343943X.2020.18393503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01042naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007600166300001200242500002200254520006200276592002800338650001500366650001700381650001900398650001400417700001700431700002000448700002000468700001800488773011800506856008300624852000900707655001200716IND60648020420221117021900.0190917e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064802042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-019-02756-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurlat, S.

The effects of solid-to-solvent ratio in slurry-making, numbers of blending, slurry filtration and starch washings were studied for obtaining maximum yield and purity of starch with desired color and amylose content. The goal of the study was to develop a suitable process for small scale/on-farm processing of sweet potato for preparation of starch. A widely grown pink-skinned cream fleshed cultivar (Kanjangad) was used for the experiments. The studied parameters were slurry making solid-to-solvent ratio (1:2, 1:3 and 1:4), number of blendings (1 and 2 times), number of slurry filtration water washings (2, 3 and 4 times) and starch washings (2, 3 and 4 times). The study showed that the starch yield, purity, color and amylose were influenced by altering the starch isolation procedures. The solid-to-solvent ratio of 1:2 in the starch isolation process yielded the best results. Also, the increase in number of blendings degraded the purity, amylose and color of starch. The optimal process was slurry making at 1:2 solid-to-solvent ratio and once blending, slurry filtration washing for 2 times and starch washing for 2 times. Accordingly, the starch yield, purity, amylose, and L, a and b values were 13.967 ± 1.135%, 80.640 ± 1.139%, 29.220 ± 0.759%, and 57.88 ± 2.982, 0.386 ± 0.204, and 2.68 ± 0.127, respectively. The prepared starch was characterized for chemical composition, water activity, paste clarity, swelling power, water solubility index, pasting property and granule size and morphology. The study suggested that the prepared starch was suitable for food uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3acentrifugation 3achemical composition 3acolor 3acultivars 3afiltration 3apasting properties 3aslurries 3asweet potatoes 3aswelling (materials) 3awater activity 3awater solubility1 aDash, Sanjaya K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7406-10821 aRayaguru, Kalpana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9151-98091 aPanda, Manoj K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4963-930X1 aNedunchezhiyan, M.0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2020 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.1520-1532dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-020-00401-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007100163300001600234520134000250592002801590650002801618650001301646650001901659650001101678650003001689650001601719650000901735651001601744700001501760773011301775856008101888852000901969655001201978IND60081771320221121110705.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008177132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-013-1057-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTīpā, R.,10aIndian summer monsoon onset vortex formation during recent decades  ap. 237-249.  aThis study investigates the decrease in the frequency of onset vortex of summer monsoon during recent decades using the National Center for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis (1982–2011) data. Onset vortices are known to occur over the Arabian Sea mini warm pool where the sea surface temperature peaks just before the onset of monsoon. Even though the Arabian Sea mini warm pool intensifies during the recent decades, they are not seen as a regular feature. It is found from the analysis of irrotational and non-divergent wind component at 850 and 200 hPa that during the recent decades, convergent winds dominate at upper levels and divergent winds at lower levels which inhibits convection. Moreover, the cyclonic shear vorticity shows a decrease in the recent decades which tend to reduce the boundary layer moisture convergence and lower tropospheric humidity which is an important component for the initiation of a cyclonic system. The recent decades are characterized by weak convection due to the presence of strong northerlies and descending motion at lower levels in the southeast Arabian Sea. The response of atmospheric circulation to the interdecadal variations in the warm pool and the corresponding decrease in the frequency of onset vortex formation is analyzed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric circulation 3ahumidity 3amonsoon season 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3atroposphere 3awind 3aArabian Sea1 aOh, Jai Ho0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 Oct., v. 118, no. 1-2 p.237-249dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1057-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009700169300001200266520084300278592002801121653001901149653001901168653000701187653001401194653002301208700001701231700001601248700001601264700001901280773009901299856008701398852000901485655001201494IND60594161820221117002924.0180510e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059416182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2018.01.1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qianjun10aNanofiber-based La0.4Sr0.6TiO 3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9-Ni composite anode for solid oxide fuel cells  ap. 1-9.  aLa0.4Sr0.6TiO3 (LST) nanofibers are prepared by electrospinning method, the LST nanofiber scaffolds are sintered on YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3-92 mol% ZrO2) electrolyte flakes, and Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC) and Ni infiltrate into La0.4Sr0.6TiO3 nanofiber scaffolds.

Carbon deposition appears on the surface of nanofiber-based LST-GDC-Ni composite anodes after being fed with CH4 fuel gas for 100 h. The amount of carbon deposition is proportional to the mass ratio of Ni:LST.

This model incorporates a resistance-capacitance network to reduce the required computation time to several hours compared with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method which requires several days or weeks to run under high-performance computing. The accuracy of the non-equilibrium model is validated with two sets of experimental data, and thermodynamic equilibrium and CFD models, respectively. Our results indicate that the non-equilibrium and equilibrium models have a similar accuracy to predict the pressure and temperature changes in vertical and horizontal LNG storage tanks under stationary conditions. However, the equilibrium model fails to predict the tank performance under sudden pressure changes such as those produced via vapor return from heavy-duty trucks duringre fueling. In contrast, the non-equilibrium model accurately predicts the pressure of LNG storage tank under dynamic conditions. Our results also indicate that, compared to vertical tanks and under dynamic operating conditions, horizontal storage tanks can hold LNG for longer periods without methane release to the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluid mechanics 3aliquefied natural gas 3amethane 3amodel validation 3atanks 3atemperature 3athermodynamic models 3athermodynamics 3atrucks 3avapors 0aNon-equilibrium model 0aLiquefied natural gas 0aStorage tank 0aBoil-off gas 0aRefueling station 0aMethane emissions1 aSharafian, Amir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6860-11231 aMérida, Walter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8126-75480 tEnergy.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 190 p.116412-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1164123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245011100166300001800277520149400295592002801789650002301817650002101840650001301861650002601874650002801900650001001928650002101938650001001959650001401969650001401983650002501997650003702022650001102059700001902070700002102089700002102110700002102131700002402152700002502176700002602201700002102227773010602248856007902354852000902433655001202442IND60408568720221119172838.0150909e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040856872DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.128072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRödiger, Stefan10aIntestinal Escherichia coli colonization in a mallard duck population over four consecutive winter seasons  ap. 3352-3361.  aWe report the population structure and dynamics of one Escherichia coli population of wild mallard ducks in their natural environment over four winter seasons, following the characterization of 100 isolates each consecutive season. Macro‐restriction analysis was used to define isolates variously as multi‐ or 1‐year pulsed‐field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types. Isolates were characterized genotypically based on virulence‐associated genes (VAGs), phylogenetic markers, and phenotypically based on haemolytic activity, antimicrobial resistance, adhesion to epithelial cells, microcin production, motility and carbohydrate metabolism. Only 12 out of 220 PFGE types were detectable over more than one winter, and classified as multi‐year PFGE types. There was a dramatic change of PFGE types within two winter seasons. Nevertheless, the genetic pool (VAGs) and antimicrobial resistance pattern remained remarkably stable. The high diversity and dynamics of this E. coli population were also demonstrated by the occurrence of PFGE subtypes and differences between isolates of one PFGE type (based on VAGs, antimicrobial resistance and adhesion rates). Multi‐ and 1‐year PFGE types differed in antimicrobial resistance, VAGs and adhesion. Other parameters were not prominent colonization factors. In conclusion, the high diversity, dynamics and stable genetic pool of an E. coli population seem to enable their successful colonization of host animal population over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aEscherichia coli 3aadhesion 3aantibiotic resistance 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aducks 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahemolysis 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3awinter1 aKrämer, Toni,1 aFrömmel, Ulrike1 aWeinreich, Jörg1 aRoggenbuck, Dirk1 aGuenther, Sebastian1 aSchaufler, Katharina1 aSchröder, Christian,1 aSchierack, Peter0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2015 Sept., v. 17, no. 9 p.3352-3361dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.128073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04209naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010000166300001800266500002000284520274100304592002803045650002203073650002603095650001803121650002003139650002003159650001203179650002403191650002103215650001703236650001503253650002703268650002603295650001703321650001003338650001303348650001403361650002503375650001503400650001303415700002203428700001803450700002003468700001803488773010903506856007903615852000903694655001203703IND60571286320221118005544.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057128632DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.125752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGermain, Ryan R.10aDirect and indirect genetic and fine‐scale location effects on breeding date in song sparrows  ap. 1613-1624.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQuantifying direct and indirect genetic effects of interacting females and males on variation in jointly expressed life‐history traits is central to predicting microevolutionary dynamics. However, accurately estimating sex‐specific additive genetic variances in such traits remains difficult in wild populations, especially if related individuals inhabit similar fine‐scale environments. Breeding date is a key life‐history trait that responds to environmental phenology and mediates individual and population responses to environmental change. However, no studies have estimated female (direct) and male (indirect) additive genetic and inbreeding effects on breeding date, and estimated the cross‐sex genetic correlation, while simultaneously accounting for fine‐scale environmental effects of breeding locations, impeding prediction of microevolutionary dynamics. We fitted animal models to 38 years of song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) phenology and pedigree data to estimate sex‐specific additive genetic variances in breeding date, and the cross‐sex genetic correlation, thereby estimating the total additive genetic variance while simultaneously estimating sex‐specific inbreeding depression. We further fitted three forms of spatial animal model to explicitly estimate variance in breeding date attributable to breeding location, overlap among breeding locations and spatial autocorrelation. We thereby quantified fine‐scale location variances in breeding date and quantified the degree to which estimating such variances affected the estimated additive genetic variances. The non‐spatial animal model estimated nonzero female and male additive genetic variances in breeding date (sex‐specific heritabilities: 0·07 and 0·02, respectively) and a strong, positive cross‐sex genetic correlation (0·99), creating substantial total additive genetic variance (0·18). Breeding date varied with female, but not male inbreeding coefficient, revealing direct, but not indirect, inbreeding depression. All three spatial animal models estimated small location variance in breeding date, but because relatedness and breeding location were virtually uncorrelated, modelling location variance did not alter the estimated additive genetic variances. Our results show that sex‐specific additive genetic effects on breeding date can be strongly positively correlated, which would affect any predicted rates of microevolutionary change in response to sexually antagonistic or congruent selection. Further, we show that inbreeding effects on breeding date can also be sex specific and that genetic effects can exceed phenotypic variation stemming from fine‐scale location‐based variation within a wild population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelospiza melodia 3aadditive gene effects 3aanimal models 3aautocorrelation 3abreeding season 3afemales 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variance 3aheritability 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding coefficient 3ainbreeding depression 3alife history 3amales 3apedigree 3aphenology 3aphenotypic variation 3aprediction 3avariance1 aWolak, Matthew E.1 aArcese, Peter1 aLosdat, Sylvain1 aReid, Jane M.0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 85, no. 6 p.1613-1624dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.125753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245007200171300001600243520163900259592002801898653001501926653001401941653002301955653001501978653002101993653001702014700002102031773010602052856008102158852000902239655001202248IND60131143020221121134912.0151127e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013114302DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-09-00056.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephenson, Daniel O.10aWeed Management in Single- vs. Twin-Row Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)  ap. 275-280.  aResearch was conducted to determine the effect of planting pattern, plant density, and levels of weed management intensity on intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), weed control, and cotton lint yield in glyphosate-resistant cotton. Twin-row planting pattern canopy IPAR was 55%% 7 wk after emergence (WAE) and 76%% 9 WAE compared to 48%% for single-row planting pattern 7 WAE and 59%% 9 WAE. Regardless of cotton density, row spacing, or weed management intensity, control of browntop millet and Florida beggarweed was at least 88%% 18 WAE. Benghal dayflower, sicklepod, and smallflower morningglory control was greater in twin-rows compared to single-rows at a cotton density of 7 plants m⁻⁻². Control of Benghal dayflower and sicklepod increased when cotton density increased at low weed management intensities; however, cotton density had no effect on weed control at higher levels of weed management input. At a cotton plant density of 7 plants m⁻⁻², twin-row cotton yielded 220 kg ha⁻⁻¹ more than the single-row planting pattern. Data indicates twin-row cotton production is feasible and that control of various weeds was better in twin-row than single-row pattern at lower cotton density and weed management intensity.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; MSMA; prometryn; S-metolachlor; Benghal dayflower, Commelina benghalensis L.

It functions as a metal transporter for Cd, Mn and Co accumulation. Numerous natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMPs) have been functionally identified in various plant species, including Arabidopsis, rice, soybean and tobacco, but no information is available on NRAMP genes in wheat. In this study, we isolated a TpNRAMP5 from dwarf Polish wheat (DPW, Triticum polonicum L.), a species with high tolerance to Cd and Zn. Expression pattern analysis revealed that TpNRAMP5 is mainly expressed in roots and basal stems of DPW. TpNRAMP5 was localized at the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis leaf protoplast. Expression of TpNRAMP5 in yeast significantly increased yeast sensitivity to Cd and Co, but not Zn, and enhanced Cd and Co concentrations. Expression of TpNRAMP5 in Arabidopsis significantly increased Cd, Co and Mn concentrations in roots, shoots and whole plants, but had no effect on Fe and Zn concentrations. These results indicate that TpNRAMP5 is a metal transporter enhancing the accumulation of Cd, Co and Mn, but not Zn and Fe. Genetic manipulation of TpNRAMP5 can be applied in the future to limit the transfer of Cd from soil to wheat grains, thereby protecting human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aTriticum 3acadmium 3acobalt 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3ahuman health 3airon 3aleaves 3amacrophages 3amanganese 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3aprotoplasts 3arice 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3asoybeans 3astems 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3awheat 3ayeasts 3azinc1 aWang, Chao1 aZhu, Jianshu1 aZeng, Jian1 aKang, Houyang1 aFan, Xing1 aSha, Lina1 aZhang, Haiqin1 aZhou, Yonghong1 aWang, Yi0 tPlanta.g2018 June, v. 247, no. 6 p.1395-1406dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-018-2872-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245021400155300001800369520126400387592002801651650003401679650002101713650002201734650001201756650001501768650004301783650000901826650002201835650001601857650001801873650001401891650001801905700001701923700001601940700001701956700001601973700001601989773012802005856007402133852000902207655001202216IND60656758920221121171258.0190814e20140424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065675892DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00213j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fang10aRapid identification of polyphenols in Kudiezi injection with a practical technique of mass defect filter based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with linear ion trap/orbitrap mass spectrometry  ap. 3515-3523.  aIn the present study, a practical approach of mass defect filter (MDF), a data-mining technique, was developed and evaluated for the rapid classification of complicated peaks into well-known chemical families based on the exact mass acquired by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The full-scan mass data of Kudiezi injection was acquired by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer system (HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap) that features high resolution, mass accuracy and sensitivity. To screen the polyphenols including chlorogenic acids (CGAs) and flavonoids in the injection, the MDF approach was employed to rapidly screen them from the complex system. First, two filtering templates and several filters were set to remove the interference ions of a complex matrix by MetWorks 1.3 Software. Then, the filtered target peaks were characterized according to their accurate mass data and MSⁿ fragment ions. Utilizing the proposed approach, 14 CGAs and 16 flavonoids could be screened and identified. The results of rapid screening and detection showed that the developed MDF approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry would be adaptable to the analysis of a complex system of traditional Chinese medicines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3achlorogenic acid 3acomputer software 3afilters 3aflavonoids 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3apolyphenols 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3aspectrometers1 aZhang, Jiayu1 aYin, Peihua1 aWang, Zijian1 aDong, Luyan1 aLu, Jianqiu0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Apr. 24, v. 6, no. 10 p.3515-3523dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00213j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009500168300001800263500002000281520220300301592002802504650002002532650001702552650001302569650002002582650001802602650001502620650000902635650001002644650003002654650002402684650001402708650001502722650001002737650001702747650002302764650002002787650001402807650001402821650001602835700002302851773010902874856007902983852000903062655001203071IND60571286420221118005625.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057128642DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.125812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeung, Tommy L. F.10aNematode parasite diversity in birds: the role of host ecology, life history and migration  ap. 1471-1480.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrevious studies have found that migratory birds generally have a more diverse array of pathogens such as parasites, as well as higher intensities of infection. However, it is not clear whether this is driven by the metabolic and physiological demands of migration, differential selection on host life‐history traits or basic ecological differences between migratory and non‐migratory species. Parasitic helminths can cause significant pathology in their hosts, and many are trophically transmitted such that host diet and habitat use play key roles in the acquisition of infections. Given the concurrent changes in avian habitats and migratory behaviour, it is critical to understand the degree to which host ecology influences their parasite communities. We examined nematode parasite diversity in 153 species of Anseriformes (water birds) and Accipitriformes (predatory birds) in relation to their migratory behaviour, diet, habitat use, geographic distribution and life history using previously published data. Overall, migrators, host species with wide geographic distributions and those utilizing multiple aquatic habitats had greater nematode richness (number of species), and birds with large clutches harboured more diverse nematode fauna with respect to number of superfamilies. Separate analyses for each host order found similar results related to distribution, habitat use and migration; however, herbivorous water birds played host to a less diverse nematode community compared to those that consume some animals. Birds using multiple aquatic habitats have a more diverse nematode fauna relative to primarily terrestrial species, likely because there is greater opportunity for contact with parasite infectious stages and/or consumption of infected hosts. As such, omnivorous and carnivorous birds using aquatic habitats may be more affected by environmental changes that alter their diet and range. Even though there were no overall differences in their ecology and life history compared with non‐migrators, migratory bird species still harboured a more diverse array of nematodes, suggesting that this behaviour places unique demands on these hosts and warrants further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAccipitriformes 3aAnseriformes 3aNematoda 3aaquatic habitat 3abirds of prey 3acarnivores 3adiet 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat preferences 3ahelminths 3aherbivores 3ahosts 3alife history 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory birds 3aomnivores 3apathogens 3awater birds1 aKoprivnikar, Janet0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 85, no. 6 p.1471-1480dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.125813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03988naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005600188245015200244300001200396506007600408520220800484592002802692506003702720650002502757650002002782650002402802650002302826650002602849650001802875650001402893650002002907650001102927650001402938650002302952650000902975650001902984650002003003650002503023650001203048651001603060700001903076700002003095700002503115700001703140700001803157700002203175700003303197773011303230856008203343852000903425655001203434IND60615142320221207132729.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061514232DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-018-3107-y2doi7 aPMC61711482pmcid7 a302859062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŌwada, Kei,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4274-205910aSpatial distribution and populations at risk of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura co-infections and infection intensity classes: an ecological study  ap. 535.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are highly prevalent in the Philippines. Mapping the prevalence and high-intensity of STH co-infections can help guide targeted intervention programmes to reduce morbidity, especially among vulnerable school-aged children. In this study, we aimed to predict the spatial distribution of the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura co-infection and infection intensity classes in the Philippines to identify populations most in need of interventions. METHODS: Data on STH infections from 29,919 individuals during the nationwide parasitological survey in 2005 to 2007 were included in the analysis. To geographically predict the prevalence of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura co-infections and infection intensity classes, Bayesian multinomial geostatistical models were built including age, sex, environmental variables and a geostatistical random effect. The number of individuals co-infected and belonging to each of the infection intensity classes in 2017 was forecast by combining our predictive prevalence maps with population density maps. RESULTS: Our models showed that school-aged children (5–19 years) are most at risk of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura co-infections and of moderate/high infection intensity compared to other age groups. We identified target provinces where the likelihood of STH-associated morbidity was highest: Luzon (Bulacan, Benguet, Cavite, Sorsogon, Metropolitan Manila, Pampanga and Rizal), the Visayas (Cebu, Iloilo, Leyte and Negros Occidental), and in Mindanao (Agusan Del Norte, Davao Del Sur, Davao Oriental, Lanao Del Sur, Maguindanao, Misamis Oriental, Sulu and Zamboanga Del Sur). Luzon had the highest estimated number of school-aged children with A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura co-infections (estimated total 89,400), followed by the Visayas (38,300) and Mindanao (20,200). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided epidemiological evidence to highlight national priority areas for controlling co-infections and high intensity infections in the Philippines. Our maps could assist more geographically targeted interventions to reduce the risk of STH-associated morbidity in the Philippines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAscaris lumbricoides 3aBayesian theory 3aTrichuris trichiura 3aat-risk population 3aenvironmental factors 3ageostatistics 3ahelminths 3amixed infection 3amodels 3amorbidity 3apopulation density 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aschool children 3aspatial distribution 3asurveys 3aPhilippines1 aLau, Colleen L1 aLeonardo, Lydia1 aClements, Archie C A1 aYakob, Laith1 aNielsen, Mark1 aCarabin, Hélène1 aSoares Magalhães, Ricardo J0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.535-535dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3107-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013900175300001600314520181100330592002802141653001402169653001802183653002302201653002702224653003802251700002802289700002702317700002302344773010302367856008702470852000902557655001202566IND60594162120221117003410.0180510e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059416212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2018.01.1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotshakeri, Mahsa10aRapid electroanalysis of uric acid and ascorbic acid using a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-modified sensor with application to milk  ap. 184-193.  aHere we present a sensitive and selective electrochemical sensor that has been developed for the analysis of uric acid and ascorbic acid in milk with minimum interference from each other. A conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), was prepared electrochemically as a thin layer on a glassy carbon electrode and then acclimatized to an aqueous buffer before sample analysis. The modified sensor showed an excellent catalytic response towards the oxidation of uric acid, with an anodic peak during cyclic voltammograms at around 350 mV (Ag/AgCl), taken at pH 6.6 as typical of untreated milk samples. A small peak due to ascorbic acid was located close to 0 mV, enabling the simultaneous detection of the two antioxidants. A stronger response for ascorbic acid was produced at pH 3, a pH value obtained after treating milk with acids to remove protein material prior to HPLC analysis. The electrochemical oxidation of uric acid at the modified electrode involved pre-adsorption of uric acid and a form of stripping voltammetry. This was not the case with ascorbic acid where the oxidation proceeded under diffusion control, with a diffusion coefficient of 6.9 × 10⁻⁶ cm² s⁻¹ obtained from cyclic voltammograms. Good linear relationships between peak current intensities and concentrations were obtained in the range of 6–100 μM for uric acid and 30–500 μM for ascorbic acid. The sensitivity and limit of detection (S/N = 3) for the PEDOT-modified electrode were 2.5 μA μM⁻¹ cm⁻² and 7 μM for uric acid, and 0.6 μA μM⁻¹ cm⁻² and 45 μM for ascorbic acid, respectively. The newly developed sensor was successfully applied to milk samples for a fast voltammetric determination of uric acid and ascorbic acid concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUric acid 0aAscorbic acid 0aCyclic voltammetry 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aPoly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)1 aTravas-Sejdic, Jadranka1 aPhillips, Anthony R.J.1 aKilmartin, Paul A.0 tElectrochimica acta.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 265 p.184-193dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2018.01.1473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01294naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007500164300001600239520030600255592002800561650001500589650001700604650002300621650001400644650001400658700002100672700002200693700002200715700002100737773011800758856008300876852000900959655001200968IND60648020920221117021800.0190917e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064802092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-019-02710-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMrug, G.

The Santa Teresita clams were heavier (shell, soft parts) than the Mar del Plata clams. Cross sections stained with Mutvei’s solution and acetate peels revealed an internal shell growth pattern of well-defined slow-growing translucent bands and alternating fast-growing opaque bands. Translucent bands (clusters) representing external rings were formed mostly during October in both sites, coinciding with gonadal maturation processes and spawning. Data confirm the annual formation of translucent bands in this species. Comparison of growth parameters showed a higher growth rate k and lower maximum age in Mar del Plata (8 years) than in Santa Teresita (9 years), which could be triggered by differences in salinity between localities due to the influence of the Rio de la Plata estuary, which is strongly linked to climate variability. Shell mass condition index and Oceanic Niño Index were negatively correlated, showing the influence of El Niño in shell properties of the species. Considering that events are becoming more intense and frequent, changes in growth rates and shell properties of Santa Teresita’s population could be expected to be more vulnerable under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aMesodesma 3aacetates 3aclams 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aestuaries 3agonads 3amorphometry 3asalinity 3aspawning 3aArgentina 0abivalve 0ayellow clam 0aMesodesma mactroides 0aAmarilladesma mactroides 0aintertidal 0aOceanic Niño Index1 aBaldoni, A.1 aGiménez, J.1 aLomovasky, B.J.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2020, v. 98, no. 7 p.481-494dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2019-02593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245006600160300001800226500002000244520210100264592002802365650001502393650002902408650002402437650001802461650001402479650002702493650001402520650001002534650002002544650001802564650001102582650001502593650001602608650001402624700001902638700002102657700001802678700002302696773010902719856007902828852000902907655001202916IND60571286720221118005446.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057128672DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.125792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFors, Lisa10aGeographic variation and trade‐offs in parasitoid virulence  ap. 1595-1604.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHost–parasitoid systems are characterized by a continuous development of new defence strategies in hosts and counter‐defence mechanisms in parasitoids. This co‐evolutionary arms race makes host–parasitoid systems excellent for understanding trade‐offs in host use caused by evolutionary changes in host immune responses and parasitoid virulence. However, knowledge obtained from natural host–parasitoid systems on such trade‐offs is still limited. In this study, the aim was to examine trade‐offs in parasitoid virulence in Asecodes parviclava (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) when attacking three closely related beetles: Galerucella pusilla, Galerucella calmariensis and Galerucella tenella (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). A second aim was to examine whether geographic variation in parasitoid infectivity or host immune response could explain differences in parasitism rate between northern and southern sites. More specifically, we wanted to examine whether the capacity to infect host larvae differed depending on the previous host species of the parasitoids and if such differences were connected to differences in the induction of host immune systems. This was achieved by combining controlled parasitism experiments with cytological studies of infected larvae. Our results reveal that parasitism success in A. parviclava differs both depending on previous and current host species, with a higher virulence when attacking larvae of the same species as the previous host. Virulence was in general high for parasitoids from G. pusilla and low for parasitoids from G. calmariensis. At the same time, G. pusilla larvae had the strongest immune response and G. calmariensis the weakest. These observations were linked to changes in the larval hemocyte composition, showing changes in cell types important for the encapsulation process in individuals infected by more or less virulent parasitoids. These findings suggest ongoing evolution in parasitoid virulence and host immune response, making the system a strong candidate for further studies on host race formation and speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEulophidae 3aGalerucella calmariensis 3aGalerucella pusilla 3aencapsulation 3aevolution 3ageographical variation 3ahemocytes 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3alarvae 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3avirulence1 aMarkus, Robert1 aTheopold, Ulrich1 aEricson, Lars1 aHambäck, Peter A.0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 85, no. 6 p.1595-1604dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.125793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013600168300001600304520126200320536009201582592002801674596000901702650003901711650001101750650000901761650001601770650002701786650002401813650001601837650001801853650001901871653001901890653002901909653001901938653001001957700002101967700001901988700002302007700002002030700002202050700001702072773011802089856008502207852000902292655001202301IND60746194420221116200839.0210729e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074619442DNAL7 a10.1080/1343943X.2020.18511422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirzel, Juan10aCanola production and effect on soil chemical properties in response to different residue levels from three biannual crop rotations  ap. 287-296.  aConservation agriculture using crop rotations and residue management is increasingly accepted in conventional agricultural systems. However, the effects on crop productivity and soil properties of different rotations, levels of use, and residue management have yet to be fully understood. Our study considered the effect of three previous crops (bread wheat, durum wheat, and corn) and four levels of residue incorporation (0%, 50%, 100%, and 200%) in a split plot design with four replicates on canola production parameters and soil chemical properties at the end of this crop. Production parameters and soil chemical properties were mostly affected by the previous crop and less by the residue incorporation rates under the conditions of this experiment; however, neither of these factors affected grain yield (ranging from 4.0 to 4.8 Mg ha⁻¹). Canola residue production was higher (9.7%) after the corn crop, regardless of the residue incorporation rate, but the harvest index was lower after this crop. Most of the soil chemical properties were also affected, revealing increased organic matter and exchangeable K when the previous crop was corn and decreased concentrations of the cations with basic reaction when the previous crop was durum wheat.  aThis work was supported by the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias Chile [INIA].  aPublisher supplied data  aINIA 3aagricultural conservation practice 3acanola 3acorn 3adurum wheat 3aexchangeable potassium 3aexperimental design 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aorganic matter 0aBrassica napus 0aconservation agriculture 0asoil fertility 0awheat1 aUndurraga, Pablo1 aLeón, Lorenzo1 aPanichini, Marcelo1 aCarrasco, Jorge1 aGonzález, Jorge,1 aMatus, Iván0 tPlant production science.g2021 July 03, v. 24, no. 3 p.287-296dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18963x1349-10087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1343943X.2020.18511423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011700158300001800275520132300293592002801616650002301644650001101667650001901678650001301697650002001710650001601730650001401746650000901760650000901769650001401778650001401792650001601806650001401822650001101836650001801847650000901865700002001874700001501894700001901909700001701928773012801945856007402073852000902147655001202156IND60656759220221123031119.0190814e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065675922DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00218k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yang-Ming10aExtraction induced by emulsion breaking for trace multi-element determination in edible vegetable oils by ICP-MS  ap. 5105-5111.  aIn this study, a simple, fast and reliable method for the simultaneous ICP-MS determination of Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ag, Ba, Pb and Cr in edible vegetable oils using extraction induced by emulsion breaking is proposed. In the method, each sample of oil was emulsified with a Triton X-114 solution containing HNO₃ and the emulsion was broken by centrifugation for 12 min at 6800 rcf, and then the acid aqueous phase deposited in the bottom of the centrifuge tube was collected for the determination of the metals of interest. The optimization of the method was performed by studying the effect of several parameters that could affect the extraction efficiency such as the concentrations of HNO₃ and the emulsifying agents (Triton X-114 and Triton X-100) in the extractant solution, the centrifugal speed and the extraction time. The limits of detection and quantification for Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ag, Ba, Pb and Cr were in the range of 0.004–0.271 μg L⁻¹ and 0.013–0.903 μg L⁻¹, respectively. The proposed method was applied in the determination of metals in eighty edible vegetable oil samples produced with different plants. The accuracy of the method was performed by spiking the samples with known amounts of the metals in the form of organometallic standards and the recoveries were in the range of 87–108%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abarium 3acentrifugation 3achromium 3adetection limit 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitric acid 3aoctoxynol 3asilver 3avegetable oil 3azinc1 aChen, Jing-Jing1 aZhou, Ying1 aWang, Xiao-Jun1 aLiu, Xiao-Yi0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 June 26, v. 6, no. 14 p.5105-5111dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00218k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017400156300001600330520115800346592002801504650001501532650001401547650000901561650001401570650001001584650000901594650001601603650001301619651001401632700001301646700001801659700001401677700001301691773012301704856007301827852000901900655001201909IND60123631220221118004306.0150327e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012363122DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.123072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaraconji, B10aEffect of an anti‐gonadotropin‐releasing factor vaccine on sexual and aggressive behaviour in male pigs during the finishing period under Australian field conditions  ap. 121-123.  aOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an anti‐gonadotropin‐releasing factor vaccine in controlling sexual and aggressive behaviour of male pigs in the late finishing period under Australian field conditions. METHODS: Male pigs from four consecutive batches over a 4‐month period were randomly assigned to two groups: an untreated control group (n = 434) or a group treated with Improvac® (n = 433). The vaccine was administered at 10 and 16 weeks of age. Pigs were housed under commercial conditions in ecoshelters, a commonly used housing system in Australia in which pigs are kept in large pens often containing >100 animals. The occurrence of sexual and aggressive behaviours was recorded and evaluated after second vaccination until slaughter at 22 weeks of age. RESULTS: Male pigs treated with Improvac demonstrated significant reductions in mounting, fighting, pushing, head butting and tail manipulation when compared with control animals. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that vaccination with Improvac can improve the welfare of entire male pigs by inhibiting sexual and aggressive behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3afinishing 3ahead 3aslaughter 3aswine 3atail 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aAustralia1 aLloyd, B1 aCampbell, N.,1 aMeaney, D1 aAhern, T0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2015 Apr., v. 93, no. 4 p.121-123dAustralian Veterinary Association]x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.123073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245014200153520184800295592002802143650002502171650001302196650001102209650001902220650001202239650002302251650001102274650001302285650001202298650001102310650001102321650001402332650002602346650001002372650001402382650001102396650001202407650001202419650001902431650001002450650001702460700002002477700002402497700001402521700001502535700001602550700001602566773012002582856007202702852000902774655001202783IND60648890420221122054804.0190701e20181204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064889042DNAL7 a10.3390/f91207542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bin 10aAllocation Mechanisms of Non-Structural Carbohydrates of <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> L. Seedlings in Response to Drought and Waterlogging  aClimate change is likely to lead to an increased frequency of droughts and floods, both of which are implicated in large-scale carbon allocation and tree mortality worldwide. Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) play an important role in tree survival under stress, but how NSC allocation changes in response to drought or waterlogging is still unclear. We measured soluble sugars (SS) and starch in leaves, twigs, stems and roots of Robinia pseudoacacia L. seedlings that had been subjected to a gradient in soil water availability from extreme drought to waterlogged conditions for a period of 30 days. Starch concentrations decreased and SS concentrations increased in tissues of R. pseudoacacia seedlings, such that the ratio of SS to starch showed a progressive increase under both drought and waterlogging stress. The strength of the response is asymmetric, with the largest increase occurring under extreme drought. While the increase in SS concentration in response to extreme drought is the largest in roots, the increase in the ratio of SS to starch is the largest in leaves. Individual components of SS showed different responses to drought and waterlogging across tissues: glucose concentrations increased significantly with drought in all tissues but showed little response to waterlogging in twigs and stems; sucrose and fructose concentrations showed marked increases in leaves and roots in response to drought but a greater response to drought and waterlogging in stems and twigs. These changes are broadly compatible with the roles of individual SS under conditions of water stress. While it is important to consider the role of NSC in buffering trees against mortality under stress, modelling this behaviour is unlikely to be successful unless it accounts for different responses within organs and the type of stress involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3abranches 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aflooded conditions 3afloods 3afructose 3aglucose 3aleaves 3amodels 3amortality 3aplant available water 3aroots 3aseedlings 3astarch 3asucrose 3atissues 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awater stress1 aPeng, Changhui 1 aHarrison, Sandy P.,1 aWei, Hua 1 aWang, Han 1 aZhu, Qiuan 1 aWang, Meng 0 tForests.g2018 Dec. 04, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f91207543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245012800184520157500312592002801887650003101915650001501946650001601961650002001977650002801997650002302025650001002048650001502058650001102073650001502084651001002099700002402109700002202133700002102155700003102176700002602207700002202233700001902255700002802274700002602302700002002328773012702348856008502475852000902560655001202569IND60748620920221118183910.0210827e20210822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074862092DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90817812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberhardt, Kirsten Alexandra10aIntestinal Colonization with Tropheryma whipplei—Clinical and Immunological Implications for HIV Positive Adults in Ghana  aBackground: Recent studies demonstrated higher prevalence rates of Tropheryma whipplei (T. whipplei) in HIV positive than in HIV negative subjects. However, associations with the immune status in HIV positive participants were conflicting. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, stool samples of 906 HIV positive and 98 HIV negative individuals in Ghana were tested for T. whipplei. Additionally, sociodemographic parameters, clinical symptoms, medical drug intake, and laboratory parameters were assessed. Results: The prevalence of T. whipplei was 5.85% in HIV positive and 2.04% in HIV negative participants. Within the group of HIV positive participants, the prevalence reached 7.18% in patients without co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, 10.26% in subjects with ART intake, and 12.31% in obese participants. Frequencies of clinical symptoms were not found to be higher in HIV positive T. whipplei carriers compared to T. whipplei negative participants. Markers of immune activation were lower in patients colonized with T. whipplei. Multivariate regression models demonstrated an independent relationship of a high CD4+ T cell count, a low HIV-1 viral load, and an obese body weight with the presence of T. whipplei. Conclusions: Among HIV positive individuals, T. whipplei colonization was associated with a better immune status but not with clinical consequences. Our data suggest that the withdrawal of co-trimoxazole chemoprophylaxis among people living with HIV on stable cART regimen may inadvertently increase the propensity towards colonization with T. whipplei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aTropheryma 3abody weight 3achemoprevention 3across-sectional studies 3adisease prevention 3adrugs 3aintestines 3apeople 3aviral load 3aGhana1 aSarfo, Fred Stephen1 aKlupp, Eva-Maria 1 aDompreh, Albert 1 aDi Cristanziano, Veronica 1 aOsei Kuffour, Edmund 1 aBoateng, Richard 1 aNorman, Betty 1 aPhillips, Richard Odame1 aAepfelbacher, Martin 1 aFeldt, Torsten 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Aug. 22, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90817813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245010200178300001600280520129800296592002801594650001101622650001801633650001201651650001001663650001401673650001401687650002601701650001901727650001901746651001201765653001601777653002301793653002001816653001901836653002501855653002001880653002001900700002001920700002401940700001901964700002101983773012602004856008302130852000902213655001202222IND60593343520221116141524.0180426e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059334352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2016.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradák-Hayashi, Balázs10aNew aspects of the interpretation of the loess magnetic fabric, Cérna Valley succession, Hungary  ap. 348-358.  aAnisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a frequently applied method in sedimentology, especially in the determination of the orientation of transport processes. We present an analysis of magnetic fabric (MF) studies on loess. New aspects of fabric development reveal: i) The deposition of the aeolian sediments was controlled by gravity, low-energy transport and local geomorphology, hence no clarified wind direction can be defined. ii) The influence of phyllosilicates is also significant among the magnetic components. iii) While the primary MF is relatively well-defined, the secondary MF is influenced by several processes. The analysis of stereoplots combined with the q–β diagram and photostatistics showed encouraging results during the characterization of various secondary MF such as redeposited MF and pedogenic fabric. iv) Changes in processes from aeolian to water-lain deposition and the increasing transportation energy were reflected by the connection between AMS and observed micro-scale sedimentary features. v) A relationship was obvious between the degree of pedogenesis and the transformation of sedimentary MF into a vertical MF typical for paleosols. vi) The significant role of very fine grained magnetite on the formation of inverse MF could not be excluded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ageomorphology 3agravity 3aloess 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3apaleosolic soil types 3asoil formation 3awind direction 3aHungary 0aMicrofabric 0aDirectional fabric 0aPhotostatistics 0aImage analysis 0aVisible grain fabric 0aMicromorphology 0aMagnetic fabric1 aBíró, Tamás,1 aHorváth, Erzsébet1 aVégh, Tamás,1 aCsillag, Gábor,0 tQuaternary research.g2016 Nov., v. 86 p.348-358dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of WashingtonwJournal:12398x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2016.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008800172300001600260520089000276592002801166650001001194650001601204650001001220650002301230650001801253650001901271650001801290650001501308650001801323651001001341700001601351700002101367700001801388700001901406773012501425856008101550852000901631655001201640IND50061312620221119183333.0160903e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006131262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-009-1426-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPastor-Cavada, Elena10aFatty Acid Distribution in the Seed Flour of Wild Vicia Species from Southern Spain  ap. 977-983.  aThe fatty acid distribution in the seed flour from 31 Vicia taxa distributed throughout southern Spain was analyzed by gas chromatography. Fatty acids ranged from myristic acid to araquidic acid. Linoleic acid (from 28.7 to 66.3% of the fatty acids), oleic acid (from 7.2 to 32.5% of the fatty acids) and linolenic acid (from 2.7 to 16.6% of the fatty acids) were the most abundant among unsaturated ones and palmitic acid among saturated ones. The total unsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio ranged between 2.6 in V. hirsuta and 4.2 in V. hybrida. Polyunsaturated to monounsaturated fatty acids ratio ranged between 1.3 in V. ervilia and 9.0 in V. pyrenaica. The ω-6 to ω-3 ratio ranged between 1.7 in V. articulata and 17.3 in V. faba. The fatty acids distribution observed in the Vicia species studied supports the use of these plants as a source of important dietary lipids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia 3adietary fat 3aflour 3agas chromatography 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3amyristic acid 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aSpain1 aJuan, Rocio1 aPastor, Julio E.1 aAlaiz, Manuel1 aVioque, Javier0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2009 Oct., v. 86, no. 10 p.977-983dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-009-1426-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245006100157300001600218520134500234592002801579650002601607650001901633650002101652650001901673650000901692650001401701650000901715650001201724650001201736650001401748651001601762653001701778653000801795653002001803653001501823653000901838653002001847653001301867700001601880700001701896700002201913773012701935856007202062852000902134655001202143IND60781205320221122042125.0220625s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078120532DNAL7 a10.1071/WF211502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcotte, A. L.10aCan ash from smoldering fires increase peatland soil pH?  ap. 607-620.  aPeatland wildfire frequency and severity are increasing globally owing to climate change. The direct risk of elevated greenhouse gas emissions from peat burning receives much attention, yet the risks to vegetation composition or peat decomposition from alkaline ash inputs are poorly understood. We explored whether ash produced during smoldering increases peatland topsoil (&#x223c;0&#x2013;25&#x2009;cm) pH through field observations and laboratory experiments. We assessed spatial patterns of smoldering and ash presence, and measured soil and ash pH after a peatland wildfire in the Netherlands. Additionally, a peat smoldering experiment was conducted to compare freshly produced ash pH with aged ash pH collected 2&#x2009;months following the wildfire. Additionally, we assessed the amount of ash needed to increase soil pH. Results showed that ash inputs at the field site were insufficient to increase pH of the acidic peatland after the wildfire. Incubation experiments showed that a &#x2265;3&#x2009;cm ash layer (ash load 163&#x2009;t ha&#x2013;1) would be required to increase soil pH by at least 1&#x2009;unit. Given that aged ash was slightly acidic and fresh ash was alkaline, leaching and neutralisation of ash after wildfire is likely, suggesting that elevated soil pH from ash input may be transient rather than long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gases 3aneutralization 3apeat 3apeatlands 3arisk 3asoil pH 3atopsoil 3awildfires 3aNetherlands 0aalkalisation 0aash 0anature recovery 0asmoldering 0asoil 0aThe Netherlands 0awildfire1 aLimpens, J.1 aStoof, C.

It is based on a flexible design of microfluidic, electropneumatic, and electronic sections and different configurations can easily be implemented. Automated injection into the capillary is performed hydrodynamically by the application of a pressure for a controlled length of time. The performance of the device was tested with a contactless conductivity detector by separating different metal ions. In addition, nine metal cations related to the quality of honey were separated in 2.3 min and four honey samples were analysed quantitatively to demonstrate the applicability of the method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acapillary electrophoresis 3ahoney1 aBoillat, Marc‐Aurèle1 aHauser, Peter C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7506-59710 tElectrophoresis.g2020 Dec., v. 41, no. 24 p.2075-2082dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2020002113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245008800154300001600242520149500258592002801753650002001781650001201801650001301813650000901826650001401835653001801849653001401867653001401881653001601895653002201911653002101933653002101954653001301975653003101988700002102019700001902040700002102059700002102080700002002101700001902121773012702140856007202267852000902339655001202348IND60781205420221122042249.0220625s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078120542DNAL7 a10.1071/WF211762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroy, Austin13aAn analysis of factors influencing structure loss resulting from the 2018 Camp Fire  ap. 586-598.  aDespite the intensity of the 2018 Camp Fire, many structures survived in heavily burned areas. Logistic regressions were run to determine which structural and parcel characteristics predicted structure survival using two data sets. The first, CAL FIRE&#x2019;s Damage Inspections (DINS) dataset, included 14&#x2009;518 destroyed and 622 partially damaged structures. The second, combining information from the DINS and Defensible Space (DINS+DSPACE) databases, had many more attributes and was better balanced between destroyed (n &#x2009;=&#x2009;728) and surviving (n &#x2009;=&#x2009;676) structures, but was much smaller. Several approaches were compared for filtering out records with null values. Results were largely consistent with previously literature, finding that structural hardness factors (e.g. double-paned windows, enclosed eaves, ignition-resistant roofs and siding, no vents, etc.) are important in determining structure survival. Newer structures, built after California&#x2019;s recent (2005 and 2007) fire safe building code updates, were more likely to survive, as were homes with higher improvement values. Mobile homes were far more likely to be destroyed. The role of fuel mitigation around structures was less conclusive; defensible space clearance had only a weak association with structure survival, although DINS+DSPACE results suggested a slight reduction in risk due to removing leaves and needles from gutters/roofs and keeping surrounding dead grass mowed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3agrasses 3ahardness 3arisk 3awildfires 0abuilding code 0abuildings 0aCamp Fire 0acommunities 0adamage inspection 0adefensible space 0astructure damage 0awildfire 0awildland–urban interface1 aMoghaddas, Jason1 aSchmidt, David1 aRomsos, J.

Its rapid diagnosis is critical to protect public health. Here, we report a case of anthrax in cattle that was investigated using conventional and molecular methods. In 2015, six cows suddenly died within three days and the number of dead animals increased to a total of 12 within two weeks. At necropsy, anthrax was suspected. Therefore, spleen tissue samples were collected (from 6/12 animals) and laboratory tests (microscopy, cultivation, and real-time PCR) performed. The results of tissue staining for microscopy and cultivation were in congruence, while B. anthracis real-time PCR outperformed both. Spleen tissues from all six animals were real-time PCR-positive, while B. anthracis was successfully cultivated and detected by microscopy from the spleen of only three animals. Additionally, the ear tissue from another (1/12) cow tested positive by real-time PCR, supporting the suitability of ear clippings for molecular confirmation of B. anthracis. Genotyping of the isolates using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) revealed a common source of infection as all three typed isolates had an indistinguishable MLVA genotype, which has not been observed previously in Europe. The results indicate that molecular testing should be selected as the first-line tool for confirming anthrax outbreaks in animals to ensure timely protection of public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3aanthrax 3acows 3aears 3agenotype 3amicroscopy 3amultiple-locus variable number tandem-repeat analysis 3anecropsy 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3aEurope1 aMićunović, Jasna 1 aCociancich, Vasilij 1 aPaller, Tomislav 1 aKušar, Darja 1 aZajc, Urška 1 aOcepek, Matjaž 1 aŠpičić, Silvio 1 aDuvnjak, Sanja 1 aPate, Mateja 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 July 23, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90815673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04539naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010100154500001900255500002000274520246000294592002802754596007402782596006602856596006402922596006402986596004803050596005003098650001603148650002003164650001603184650001003200650001603210650004103226650001903267650001803286650001003304650004003314650003803354650002003392650001403412650001403426650001603440650001403456650000903470650001703479650002503496650002103521700005703542700001303599700001603612700001903628700001903647700001803666700001903684773012703703856007403830852000903904655001203913IND60723922620221122233323.0210118e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072392262DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.135652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenyi10aEffect of the polyphenol‐rich extract from Allium cepa on hyperlipidemic sprague‐dawley rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAllium cepa is used for the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia‐related diseases such as atherosclerosis in the folk. This study was mainly aimed at investigating the effects of A. cepa extract (ACE) enriched in polyphenols on hyperlipidemia Sprague‐Dawley (SD) experiment rat models. The levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum and liver were measured using ELISA kits. In addition, hematoxylin‐eosin (HE) technique was used to observe the liver and the aortic arch pathology. Moreover, western blotting (WB) method was applied to analyze LDL receptor (LDLR) and 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl (HMG)‐CoA reductase (HMGCR) in liver. As a result, quercetin (2.42 mg/g DW) and isoquercitrin (4.60 mg/g DW) were the main constituents of ACE using HPLC analysis. Furthermore, ACE reduced the levels of TC, TG, LDL‐C, and MDA, and increased HDL levels and elevated SOD activity both in serum and liver in hyperlipidemic SD rats (p < .05). HE results showed that liver fat drops of the rats in ACE group were obviously decreased, and the lipid and foam cells of the aortic arch of the rats in ACE group were markedly ameliorated. WB results showed that ACE promoted the degradation of HMGCR and increased LDLR expression in liver (p < .05). In conclusion, ACE alleviated hyperlipidemia with downregulation of HMGCR and upregulation of LDLR. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Atherosclerosis, a major cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed countries. Moreover, accumulating data indicate that, during atherosclerosis development, hyperlipidemia is an important risk factor. To date, hyperlipidemia is mainly treated with hyperlipidemic agents including statins, in spite of the side effects and poor tolerance in some patients. In addition, Allium cepa is a medicinal and edible plant. Furthermore, A. cepa is used for the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia‐related diseases such as atherosclerosis in the folk. But the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In fact, this research showed that A. cepa extract (ACE) alleviated hyperlipidemia with downregulation of HMGCR and upregulation of LDLR, suggesting that ACE might be a potential option for hyperlipidemia as non‐statin lipid‐lowering agent.  aPublisher supplied data  a18ZA0208cKey projects of the Sichuan Provincial Education Department  aNSMC20170446cNanchong City and North Sichuan Medical College  a18SXHZ0254cNanchong City and North Sichuan Medical College  a18SXHZ0250cNanchong City and North Sichuan Medical College  aCBY16‐QD09cNorth Sichuan Medical College  aCBY20‐YLXK03cNorth Sichuan Medical College 3aAllium cepa 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3afoams 3afood plants 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahyperlipidemia 3aisoquercitrin 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein receptors 3amalondialdehyde 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3arats 3arisk factors 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols1 aYang, Chunyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4536-63781 aMei, Xue1 aHuang, Rong1 aZhang, Shipeng1 aTang, Yuanyuan1 aDong, Qiuhong1 aZhou, Chunyang0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e13565-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.135653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009400156300002000250520165500270592002801925650003301953650002501986650001702011650001402028650001202042650001902054650001402073650001102087650002002098650001402118650001902132650001802151650001602169650001302185650003702198650002702235650002202262650001402284650002102298650002002319650001302339650001602352650001702368650001302385700001202398700001302410700001602423773012402439856007402563852000902637655001202646IND60653098020221120050823.0190713e20190710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065309802DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra02721a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jinting10aAnti-oxidative effects of catechins and theaflavins on glutamate-induced HT22 cell damage  ap. 21418-21428.  aBackground: Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that is involved in cell stress caused by oxidation. Polyphenolic compounds display various potential neuroprotective properties due to their ability to donate electrons and hydrogen atoms. Method: In this study, we evaluate the protective effect towards glutamate-induced HT22 cell damage. Two families of polyphenolic compounds are investigated, including the monomer polyphenol catechins, as well as the dimerized theaflavins. The cell apoptosis and intercellular ROS production are quantified by flow cytometry, and the protective mechanism is evaluated by quantifying the expression of cell apoptosis and energy related proteins. Result: Both sets of compounds protect cells against glutamate-induced oxidative stress, partially restore the cell viability, and prevent cells from apoptosis via bcl-2 and bax regulation, and attenuate intercellular ROS production. We demonstrate here that the protective effect is mediated by multiple factors, including reducing intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, increasing glutathione level and related enzyme activity. Thus, the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) show inverse correlation of activity after catechins and theaflavins stimulation. Conclusion: These results suggest both catechins and theaflavins compounds protect cells from glutamate-induced damage via cell apoptosis-related proteins and indirect regulation of cellular energy enzymes. These natural sourced antioxidants provide potential therapeutic agents for glutamate accumulation and toxicity related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acell viability 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3aflavanols 3aflow cytometry 3aglutamic acid 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotransmitters 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3atheaflavins 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aXu, Lei1 aYang, Le1 aSun, Caixia0 tRSC advances.g2019 July 10, v. 9, no. 37 p.21418-21428dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra02721a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245005400172300001600226520123600242592002801478650001801506650000901524650001101533650001401544650001301558650001701571650001001588650002101598650001101619650002001630650001001650650001201660650001401672651001101686773012401697856005701821852000901878655001201887IND4473482620221119183354.0120727e198112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447348262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1981.tb00351.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGIBSON, A. C.10aVegetative anatomy of Pachycormus (Anacardiaceae)  ap. 273-284.  aPachycormus discolor, an arborescent desert perennial endemic to Baja California, has small, pinnately compound, hypostomatic, bifacial leaves produced on short shoots and photosynthetic stem phelloderm covered by exfoliating translucent phellem. Tightly packed laminal palisade cells are filled with tannins and lack chloroplasts. Spongy mesophyll is the major photosynthetic tissue. Leaves possess unicellular trichomes with secondary walls and uniseriate trichomes with glandular heads. Schizogenous resin ducts occur in primary phloem of stems, leaves and roots as well as all living tissues of the bark. Developmental studies reveal that initiation and differentiation of foliar primordia resembles that of other dicotyledons except that tannin cells and secretory ducts arise precociously. Primary vasculature is an open sympodial system with three principal traces diverging toward each foliar primordium. The wood is highly specialized and comprises mostly unlignified cells packed with starch grains. Thick bark is mainly produced as annual layers of secondary phloem marked by a ring of secretory ducts each surrounded by tannin cells. The possible adaptive significance of these unusual anatomical features is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardiaceae 3abark 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3aperiderm 3aresin canals 3aroots 3asecondary phloem 3ashoots 3astarch granules 3astems 3atannins 3atrichomes 3aMexico0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1981 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.273-284dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1981.tb00351.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007100146245010400217300002000321520128800341592002801629650003401657650001101691650000901702650001301711650001101724650001401735650001501749700006701764700002701831773013801858856008001996852000902076655001202085IND60612701320181002000000.0180906e20180814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061270132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b021912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Lima, Guilherme Ferreira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0311-383110aX-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy Calculations on Pristine and Modified Chalcopyrite Surfaces  ap. 20200-20209.  aUnderstanding chemical modifications on the chalcopyrite surface is an important issue to improve hydrometallurgical processes to recover copper from the mineral. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) can be used for this task, but the interpretation of the spectrum and the correlation with chemical changes in the first atomic layers are not straightforward. The present study demonstrates the potential of combining spectrum measurements with theoretical X-ray spectrum simulations to elucidate the chemistry behind weathering of important classes of minerals. We simulated the S and Fe K-edge XANES spectrum for pristine and modified chalcopyrite surfaces using periodic DFT calculations and the transition-potential model. The calculated S K-edge XANES spectra are in good agreement with experimental data and the peaks were attributed using the density of states. The simulated Fe K-edge XANES spectra do not reproduce all features observed experimentally. The effect of surface changes due to reconstruction, hydration, and oxidation on the spectrum was analyzed. Our results show that the S K-edge XANES spectrum is more sensitive to surface modifications than the Fe K-edge XANES spectrum, and this sensitivity could be used to follow the evolution of the surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acopper 3airon 3aminerals 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aweathering1 aDuarte, Hélio Anderson1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8164-44541 aPettersson, Lars G.

To investigate the potential oncogenic role and prognostic value of CIP2A, we comprehensively analyzed the CIP2A expression levels in pan-cancer and observed high expression level of CIP2A in majority cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on a validation cohort including 60 HCC and 20 non-tumorous tissue samples, we further confirmed the high mRNA and protein expression levels of CIP2A in HCC, and found high CIP2A mRNA expression level was associated with unfavorable overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with HCC. Mechanistic investigations revealed that inhibition of CIP2A significantly attenuated cellular proliferation in vitro and tumourigenicity in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that CIP2A might be involved in regulating cell cycle. Our experimental data further confirmed CIP2A knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. We found accumulated cellular senescence in HCC cells with CIP2A knockdown, companying expression changes of senescence associated proteins (p21, CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1, MCM7 and FoxM1). Mechanistically, CIP2A knockdown repressed FoxM1 expression and induced FoxM1 dephosphorylation. Moreover, inhibition of PP2A by phosphatase inhibitor rescued the repression of FoxM1. Taken together, our results showed that CIP2A was highly expressed in HCC. Inhibition of CIP2A induced cell cycle arrest and promoted cellular senescence via repressing FoxM1 transcriptional activity, suggesting a potential anti-cancer target for patients with HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3acell senescence 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3adephosphorylation 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agene expression 3ahepatoma 3ainterphase 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3apatients 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscription (genetics) 0aCIP2A 0aFoxM1 0aHepatocellular carcinoma 0aCell cycle 0aCellular senescence1 aQu, Kai1 aTao, Jie1 aYin, Guozhi1 aHan, Shaoshan1 aLiu, Qingguang1 aSun, Hao0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 08, v. 495, no. 2 p.1807-1814dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017800165300001400343520137600357592002801733650001501761650002501776650001201801650001401813650001101827650000701838650002301845650001701868650001601885700001701901700001401918700001401932700001801946700001901964700001801983773010202001856008102103990002302184852000902207655001202216IND60092951820221120192605.0141103e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009295182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2010.09.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Jianming10aAdsorptive removal of 2,4-didichlorophenol and 2,6-didichlorophenol from aqueous solution by β-cyclodextrin/attapulgite composites: Equilibrium, kinetics and thermodynamics  ap. 40-48.  aβ-Cyclodextrin/attapulgite (β-CD/ATP) composites were prepared for the adsorption of 2,4-didichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and 2,6-didichlorophenol (2,6-DCP) from aqueous solution. β-CD/ATP composites mainly possessed mesopores, high surface area and big pore volume which were benefit for the adsorption capacity. The batch mode adsorption experiments with respect to pH, temperature, initial concentration, contact time and binary dichlorophenol solution were investigated. Equilibrium data, at various temperatures, were described by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm models. The Langmuir isotherm model was fitted to the experimental data significantly better than the other models. The kinetic data were well fitted to the intraparticle diffusion equation, which indicated that three steps belonged to the pseudo-second-order adsorption process. Intraparticle diffusion increased with the increase of adsorbate concentrations while film and pore diffusion decreased. The initial adsorption factor, Rᵢ, showed that initial adsorption for 2,4-DCP was intermediate while was strong for 2,6-DCP. The thermodynamics parameters (positive values of ΔH° and ΔS°, negative values of ΔG°) indicated that binding systems between β-CD/ATP composites and adsorbates (2,4-DCP and 2,6-DCP) were endothermic, entropy gained and spontaneous in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3aentropy 3aequations 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aZou, Xiaohua1 aWang, Xue1 aGuan, Wei1 aLi, Chunxiang1 aYan, Yongsheng1 aWu, Xiangyang0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 166, no. 1 p.40-48dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2010.09.0673Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010600166300001800272520122100290592002801511650001401539650001501553650001801568650001201586650001101598650001801609650001101627650001401638650001301652650001901665650001101684650001601695700006101711700006001772773017001832856008002002852000902082655001202091IND60602017720221118065558.0180709e20180524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060201772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b013382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabibi, Amir H.10aKinetics of Low-Temperature Methane Oxidation over SiO2-Encapsulated Bimetallic Pd–Pt Nanoparticles  ap. 8160-8171.  aA kinetic study of lean methane combustion on a silica-encapsulated bimetallic Pd–Pt (1:1 molar ratio) catalyst at varying methane concentrations and temperatures and in the absence/presence of added water is presented. With dry feed, the kinetic behavior of the bimetallic catalyst is correlated using a previously reported rate expression that is first order in methane and negative one order in water. The model does not adequately correlate the conversion of wet lean CH₄ combustion in the temperature range of 550 to 750 K. For wet conditions, an alternative mechanism is suggested that is based on the previous experimental observations of the prevailing chemical state of Pd in wet feed, the ability of Pt to activate methane in oxygen-deficient atmospheres, and the inhibitory effect of water on the support-mediated oxygen exchange. The corresponding rate expression successfully predicts the activity of the silica-encapsulated Pd–Pt catalyst with wet feed (5 vol % water) in the temperature range of 550 to 750 K. The study also evaluates the internal mass transfer across the silica shell. It is shown that for the catalysts used here, the diffusion resistance across the shell is negligibly small.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3amass transfer 3amethane 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3aprocess design 3asilica 3atemperature1 aSemagina, Natalia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2716-22481 aHayes, Robert E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2681-282X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 May 24, v. 57, no. 24 p.8160-8171dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b013383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008800163300001300251520109600264592002801360650001301388650001801401650001601419650001701435650001201452650002401464650001901488650000701507650001501514650001901529653001201548653001601560653002101576653004001597700001801637700001601655773012501671856008201796852000901878655001201887IND60552677620221120133217.0180830e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055267762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejbt.2016.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ji-Fei10aBuffering action of acetate on hydrogen production by Ethanoligenens harbinense B49  ap. 7-11.  aThe buffering effect of acetate on hydrogen production during glucose fermentation by Ethanoligenens harbinense B49 was investigated compared to phosphate, a widely used fermentative hydrogen production buffer. Specific concentrations of sodium acetate or phosphate were added to batch cultures, and the effects on hydrogen production were comparatively analyzed using a modified Gompertz model. Adding 50mM acetate or phosphate suppressed the hydrogen production peak and slightly extended the lag phase. However, the overall hydrogen yields were 113.5 and 108.5mmol/L, respectively, and the final pH was effectively controlled. Acetate buffered against hydrogen production more effectively than did phosphate, promoting cell growth and preventing decreased pH. At buffer concentrations 100–250mM, the maximum hydrogen production was barely suppressed, and the lag phase extended past 7h. Therefore, although acetate inhibits hydrogen production, using acetate as a buffer (like phosphate) effectively prevented pH drops and increased substrate consumption, enhancing hydrogen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abiotechnology 3acell growth 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahydrogen production 3alogit analysis 3apH 3aphosphates 3asodium acetate 0aAcetate 0aBiohydrogen 0aBuffering action 0aEthanoligenens harbinense phosphate1 aMi, Yuan-Ting1 aRen, Nan-Qi0 tElectronic Journal of Biotechnology.g2016 Sept., v. 23 p.7-11dElsevier España, S.L.U.wJournal:17874x0717-34587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejbt.2016.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245004900166300001400215520100000229592002801229650001501257650001701272650001901289650001801308650003001326650001901356650000901375650001601384653001501400653002601415653001801441653001701459653001901476653003101495653002101526653002101547653001701568653001601585700002701601700001901628773012601647856008201773852000901855655001201864IND60552677720221120133039.0180830e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055267772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejbt.2016.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzionek, Anna10aNatural carriers in bioremediation: A review  ap. 28-36.  aBioremediation of contaminated groundwater or soil is currently the cheapest and the least harmful method of removing xenobiotics from the environment. Immobilization of microorganisms capable of degrading specific contaminants significantly promotes bioremediation processes, reduces their costs, and also allows for the multiple use of biocatalysts. Among the developed methods of immobilization, adsorption on the surface is the most common method in bioremediation, due to the simplicity of the procedure and its non-toxicity. The choice of carrier is an essential element for successful bioremediation. It is also important to consider the type of process (in situ or ex situ), type of pollution, and properties of immobilized microorganisms. For these reasons, the article summarizes recent scientific reports about the use of natural carriers in bioremediation, including efficiency, the impact of the carrier on microorganisms and contamination, and the nature of the conducted research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiocatalysts 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3agroundwater contamination 3amicroorganisms 3asoil 3axenobiotics 0aAdsorption 0aBioethanol production 0aContamination 0aHeavy metals 0aImmobilization 0aImmobilized microorganisms 0aNatural carriers 0aWine alterations 0aWood barrels 0aXenobiotics1 aWojcieszyńska, Danuta1 aGuzik, Urszula0 tElectronic Journal of Biotechnology.g2016 Sept., v. 23 p.28-36dElsevier España, S.L.U.wJournal:17874x0717-34587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejbt.2016.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001300189245019800202300001800400506007600418520155400494592002802048506003702076650001902113650001402132650001502146650002102161650001502182650001102197650001902208650001002227650001502237650001702252650001402269650002902283653000902312653002102321653001602342653003702358653001202395653001902407700001702426700001402443700002202457700001802479700001602497700002502513700001702538700002602555700002002581773014802601856008302749852000902832655001202841IND60586922020221207141606.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058692202DNAL7 a291701332pmid7 aPMC57364392pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Xin10aDownregulation of Bit1 expression promotes growth, anoikis resistance, and transformation of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells via Erk activation-dependent suppression of E-cadherin  ap. 1240-1248.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mitochondrial Bit1 protein exerts tumor-suppressive function in NSCLC through induction of anoikis and inhibition of EMT. Having this dual tumor suppressive effect, its downregulation in the established human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line resulted in potentiation of tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. However, the exact role of Bit1 in regulating malignant growth and transformation of human lung epithelial cells, which are origin of most forms of human lung cancers, has not been examined. To this end, we have downregulated the endogenous Bit1 expression in the immortalized non-tumorigenic human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Knockdown of Bit1 enhanced the growth and anoikis insensitivity of BEAS-2B cells. In line with their acquired anoikis resistance, the Bit1 knockdown BEAS-2B cells exhibited enhanced anchorage-independent growth in vitro but failed to form tumors in vivo. The loss of Bit1-induced transformed phenotypes was in part attributable to the repression of E-cadherin expression since forced exogenous E-cadherin expression attenuated the malignant phenotypes of the Bit1 knockdown cells. Importantly, we show that the loss of Bit1 expression in BEAS-2B cells resulted in increased Erk activation, which functions upstream to promote TLE1-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. These collective findings indicate that loss of Bit1 expression contributes to the acquisition of malignant phenotype of human lung epithelial cells via Erk activation-induced suppression of E-cadherin expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenocarcinoma 3acadherins 3acell lines 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3ametastasis 3amitochondria 3aphenotype 3atranscription (genetics) 0aBit1 0aTumor suppressor 0aLung cancer 0aHuman bronchial epithelial cells 0aAnoikis 0aTransformation1 aGray, Selena1 aPham, Tri1 aDelgardo, Mychael1 aNguyễn, An,1 aDo, Stephen1 aIreland, Shubha Kale1 aChen, Renwei1 aAbdel-Mageed, Asim B.1 aBiliran, Hector0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 495, no. 1 p.1240-1248dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011000168520177800278592002802056650001602084650002302100650001302123650002602136650001502162650001702177650000902194650002602203650002002229650001702249650001902266650002302285650001102308650001102319650002502330650001402355700001502369700001802384700001702402700001502419700001802434700002002452700001702472700001702489773012702506856008502633852000902718655001202727IND60748621720221118184545.0210827e20210823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074862172DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90817882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Yangyi 10aEffects of Age, Diet CP, NDF, EE, and Starch on the Rumen Bacteria Community and Function in Dairy Cattle  aTo understand the effects of diet and age on the rumen bacterial community and function, forty-eight dairy cattle at 1.5 (M1.5), 6 (M6), 9 (M9), 18 (M18), 23 (M23), and 27 (M27) months old were selected. Rumen fermentation profile, enzyme activity, and bacteria community in rumen fluid were measured. The acetate to propionate ratio (A/P) at M9, M18, and M23 was higher than other ages, and M6 was the lowest (p < 0.05). The total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) at M23 and M27 was higher than at other ages (p < 0.05). The urease at M18 was lower than at M1.5, M6, and M9, and the xylanase at M18 was higher than at M1.5, M23, and M27 (p < 0.05). Thirty-three bacteria were identified as biomarkers of the different groups based on the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when the LDA score >4. The variation partitioning approach analysis showed that the age and diet had a 7.98 and 32.49% contribution to the rumen bacteria community variation, respectively. The richness of Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002 and Fibrobacter were positive correlated with age (r > 0.60, p < 0.01) and positively correlated with TVFA and acetate (r > 0.50, p < 0.01). The Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and Saccharofermentans has a positive correlation (r > 0.80, p < 0.05) with diet fiber and a negative correlation (r < −0.80, p < 0.05) with diet protein and starch, which were also positively correlated with the acetate and A/P (r > 0.50, p < 0.01). The genera of Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and Saccharofermentans could be worked as the target bacteria to modulate the rumen fermentation by diet; meanwhile, the high age correlated bacteria such as Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002 and Fibrobacter also should be considered when shaping the rumen function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFibrobacter 3aPseudobutyrivibrio 3aacetates 3abacterial communities 3abiomarkers 3adairy cattle 3adiet 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3astarch 3aurease 3avolatile fatty acids 3axylanases1 aGong, Yue 1 aHuang, Shuai 1 aJi, Shoukun 1 aWang, Wei 1 aWang, Yajing 1 aYang, Hongjian 1 aCao, Zhijun 1 aLi, Shengli 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Aug. 23, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90817883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245007400158520115400232592002801386650001201414650001101426650001201437650001901449650002201468650001001490650001701500650001901517650002601536650002301562650002501585650003401610700001801644700001701662700001701679700002101696773012001717856007201837852000901909655001201918IND60648891320221122102045.0190701e20181207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064889132DNAL7 a10.3390/f91207622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Li-Sheng 10aInvestigation of Bamboo Grid Packing Properties Used in Cooling Tower  aDue to its advantages of good heat-resistance, environmental-friendliness, and low cost, bamboo grid packing (BGP) has become a promising new type of cooling packing. It is being increasingly used in Chinese industrial cooling towers to replace cooling packings made of polyvinyl chloride, cement, and glass fiber reinforced plastic. However, mechanical properties and fungal resistance are a concern for all bamboo applications. In this study, the modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), density, crystallinity, and environment scanning electron microscope (ESEM) properties were compared between fresh BGPs and those that had been in service for nine years in the cooling towers. The results showed that the MOR, MOE, density, crystallinity, and the crystal size of the used BGPs decreased to some extent, but still met the requirements for normal use in a cooling tower. The ESEM observation showed that the used BGPs were not infected by fungi. The decrease in mechanical properties could be caused by the decrease of density, crystallinity, and the decomposition of the chemical components of bamboo, but not by fungal infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3acement 3acooling 3acooling towers 3acrystal structure 3afungi 3aglass fibers 3aheat tolerance 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3ascanning electron microscopes1 aFei, Ben-Hua 1 aMa, Xin-Xin 1 aLu, Ji-Ping 1 aFang, Chang-Hua 0 tForests.g2018 Dec. 07, v. 9, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f91207623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245010100195300001800296500002000314520195800334592002802292650002002320650001502340650001802355650001502373650001002388650002202398650001302420650000902433650001102442650001102453650001402464650001902478650001102497651001102508651002102519651001002540651001102550700002202561700002502583700002302608773012402631856007302755852000902828655001202837IND60597772820221120212128.0180627e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059777282DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.132302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, Hajime1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3014-358510aPost‐glacial East Asian origin of the alpine shrub Phyllodoce aleutica (Ericaceae) in Beringia  ap. 1261-1274.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The ice‐free area around the Bering Land Bridge, Beringia, has been noted as an important refugium of organisms preferring cold environments such as arctic‐alpine plants throughout the Pleistocene climate oscillations. Although numerous phylogeographical studies have supported this refugium, recent studies have challenged the idea of a homogeneous refugium in Beringia. We aim to examine a novel scenario of the post‐glacial colonization history of an alpine plant Phyllodoce aleutica in Beringia. LOCATION: The Japanese Archipelago, the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. METHOD: The range‐wide genetic structure of P. aleutica was elucidated by sequencing 13 nuclear loci. The phylogeographical history was inferred using model‐based approaches based on coalescent simulations together with the potential distributions predicted by ecological niche modelling. RESULTS: Bayesian clustering and phylogenetic networks revealed that P. aleutica was divided into three geographically structured groups: the main island of the Japanese Archipelago, the northern island of the archipelago (Hokkaido) and Beringia, including eastern Hokkaido. The demographic history underlying the genetic structure and the potential distributions at present and during Last Glacial Maximum suggest that their divergence likely predated the last glacial period. Except for genetic admixture with the sister species Phyllodoce glanduliflora, populations in Alaska exhibited lower genetic diversity than those in East Asia and exclusively shared two widespread genotypes. Approximate Bayesian computation showed that a demographic model postulating post‐glacial expansion into Alaska fit better than alternative models. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that P. aleutica in eastern Beringia originated through post‐glacial colonization from East Asia, providing novel insight into the biogeographical history of alpine flora in Beringia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPhyllodoce 3aalpine plants 3acold zones 3aflora 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aloci 3amodels 3aniches 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3ashrubs 3aAlaska 3aAleutian Islands 3aJapan 3aRussia1 aYakubov, Valentin1 aBarkalov, Vyacheslav1 aSetoguchi, Hiroaki0 tJournal of biogeography.g2018 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.1261-1274dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.132303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013500163300001600298520147500314592002801789650001601817650001501833650002501848650002301873650001101896650001101907650002001918650002601938650001501964650000701979650001901986650001302005650001402018650003302032700001702065773010402082856008102186990002302267852000902290655001202299IND60092952420221120182642.0141103e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009295242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2010.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yang10aEffect of solvent/monomer feed ratio on the structure and adsorption properties of Cu²⁺-imprinted microporous polymer particles  ap. 435-444.  aThe effect of solvent/monomer (S/M) feed ratio on the structure and adsorption properties of copper(II)-imprinted microporous polymer particles was investigated. Copper(II) ion-imprinted microporous particles were prepared from two functional monomers, methacrylic acid (MAA) and vinyl pyridine (4-VP), by forming a complex with the template copper ion by ionic interactions. The self-assembled copper/monomer complex was polymerized in the presence of an ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) cross-linker by a suspension polymerization. The diameter of the prepared microparticles was 200–700μm. The chemical structure, morphology and adsorption capacity of the Cu(II)-imprinted microporous particles were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) test, atomic adsorption spectroscopy (AAS), furrier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The adsorption capacity of the imprinted beads for the template ion, Cu(II), was significantly affected by the initial concentration and pH of the feed solution. The imprinted particles showed high selectivity for the copper ion, as the adsorption capacity for the Cu(II) ion was much higher than that of other metal ions such as Ni(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II). The adsorption capacity, adsorption kinetics, and selectivity of the imprinted particles prepared in this study, however, were not significantly affected by the S/M feed ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3achemical structure 3acopper 3aenergy 3aethylene glycol 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ametal ions 3apH 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3apyridines 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aKim, Dukjoon0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 166, no. 1 p.435-444dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2010.11.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009200165300001800257520133600275592002801611650000801639650001201647650001201659650001501671650001301686650001001699650001301709650001101722650001901733650001401752650002501766650001601791651001501807700002001822700002101842773017001863856008002033852000902113655001202122IND60602018220180827000000.0180709e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060201822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b013772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPio, Gianmaria10aComparison and Validation of Detailed Kinetic Models for the Oxidation of Light Alkenes  ap. 7130-7135.  aThe increasing interest in light alkenes oxidation for the development of detailed kinetic model is mainly due to their relevance in the combustion chemistry of most common fuels and their formation in the oxidation of higher alkanes. This study analyses the detailed kinetic mechanisms for the oxidation of linear lighter alkenes, ethylene, propylene and 1-butene, through the comparison of several combustion kinetic models retrieved from current literature with respect to the experimental data for the laminar burning velocity in air, and for the ignition delay time, by varying either reactant concentration or initial temperature. The mechanisms by University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Konnov group (KOM), University of Southern California (USC), Saudi Aramco 2.0 (SAM), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Politecnico of Milano (CRECK) have been evaluated through a unified statistical analysis. A sensitivity analysis for the laminar burning velocity was also performed to assess and compare the reactions described in the studied models and sort by relevance. Best fits are produced by the LLNL and the UCSD model even if the optimal results can depend on the specific hydrocarbon. We then produced a new mechanism by adding the UCSD for C₃ and LLNL for C₄ or more, which resulted to work better.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalkanes 3aburning 3acombustion 3aethylene 3afuels 3akinetics 3amodels 3aprocess design 3apropylene 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3aCalifornia1 aPalma, Vincenzo1 aSalzano, Ernesto0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 May 08, v. 57, no. 21 p.7130-7135dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b013773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245008300202300001800285520084300303592002801146650001201174650001201186650001401198650002401212650000901236650001101245650001301256650002001269650001901289650002701308650001401335650001301349700001301362700001801375700001101393773017001404856008001574852000901654655001201663IND60602018320221118064119.0180709e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060201832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b013872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6455-427010aSelective Catalytic Reduction of NOx with NH3 over Novel Fe–Ni–Ti Catalyst  ap. 7458-7465.  aA novel Fe–Ni–Ti composite oxide prepared via the hydrothermal method has been developed for the selective catalytic reduction of NOₓ with NH₃. This environmentally benign catalyst showed high activity and excellent selectivity to N₂, which is superior to that of Fe–Ti and Ni–Ti catalysts. Catalyst characterization results revealed that over Fe–Ni–Ti catalyst the dual redox cycles (Fe³⁺ + Ni²⁺ ↔ Fe²⁺ + Ni³⁺, Ti⁴⁺ + Ni²⁺ ↔ Ti³⁺ + Ni³⁺) are crucial for the enhanced activity. The synergetic effect among Fe, Ni, and Ti leads to not only the increased redox property, but also improved surface acidity. DRIFT experiments demonstrated that more reactive NH₃/NH₄⁺ and M-NO₂ nitro species formed over Fe–Ni–Ti catalyst, thus resulting in the efficiently catalytic removal of NOₓ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3ahot water treatment 3airon 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3aprocess design 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asynergism 3atitanium1 aFeng, Xu1 aZhou, Zizheng1 aXu, Qi0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 May 15, v. 57, no. 22 p.7458-7465dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b013873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03958naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245013300204300001800337520231600355592002802671650002402699650001502723650001802738650001602756650003102772650003502803650001602838650003802854650001402892650002802906650001002934650001802944650001702962650001302979650001402992650001603006650000903022700006303031700005503094700005503149700006703204773012503271856008303396852000903479655001203488IND60741966420221117085355.0210723e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074196642DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-02667-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoyocak, Ahu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0999-277410aInvestigation of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor, Zinc, and Vitamin B12 Levels in Chronic Gastritis with Helicobacter pylori Infection  ap. 2431-2437.  aHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is known as the most common cause of worldwide common chronic gastritis. Pathogenic mechanisms caused by H. pylori in diseases are still not fully understood. In addition, it has been reported that H. pylori can alter gene expressions in infected tissues and affect transcription factor activation. It is reported that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is a cytoplasmic transcription factor, functions in the immune system and plays a role in immune cells in barrier organs such as the gastrointestinal system, skin, and lungs. H. pylori infection affects the absorption of micronutrients such as trace elements, minerals, and vitamins by disrupting gastric secretion and acidification functions. Zinc (Zn) trace element is thought to be able to modulate the induction of AhR-responsive genes in endothelial cells. Although it is emphasized that trace elements are related with gastritis, relationship between Zn and AhR is not fully known, especially in chronic gastritis accompanied by H. pylori infection. In this study, serum levels of AhR, Zn, and AhR antagonist vitamin B12 were determined in chronic gastritis with H. pylori infection. Fifty volunteers diagnosed with H. pylori positive and negative chronic gastritis were included in this study. Collected from individuals participating were 5 ml of venous blood samples, and their serums were separated. AhR serum level of the study group was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Zn concentrations in serum samples were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. When AhR and Zn serum levels were compared in H. pylori positive and negative chronic gastritis patients, it was found that AhR serum level of H. pylori positive chronic gastritis patients increased but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.595). However it was determined Zn and B12 serum levels were statistically significantly decreased (p < 0.001). This study has a crucial importance since to be the first one investigating relationship between serum AhR, Zn, and vitamin B12 levels in the pathogenesis of H. pylori gastritis in adults. Examination of AhR, Zn and B12 levels in H. pylori positive gastritis patients contributes to elucidating molecular mechanism of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aabsorption 3aacidification 3aantagonists 3aaryl hydrocarbon receptors 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agastritis 3agastrointestinal system 3agenes 3aimmune system 3apathogenesis 3aresearch 3asecretion 3avitamin B12 3azinc1 aErgun, Dilek Duzgun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6245-66311 aKoc, Gulsah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9678-56521 aErgun, Sefa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0315-80441 aOzsobaci, Nural Pastaci1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9133-56950 tBiological trace element research.g2021 July, v. 199, no. 7 p.2431-2437dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02667-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012300170300001600293520136100309592002801670650002901698650002701727650002801754650001801782650002701800650001101827650001301838650002801851650001501879650001001894650001701904650002501921700002101946700002601967700001901993700002202012700001702034700001902051700002102070773011102091856008102202852000902283655001202292IND60548400220221116191824.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054840022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-016-2873-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijkstra, Feike A.10aWater, nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiencies of four tree species in response to variable water and nutrient supply  ap. 187-199.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The commonly observed trade-off between plant water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) has been attributed to physiological constraints in the leaf. We examined if a similar trade-off can occur between WUE and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) and if changes in NUE and PUE in response to water and nutrient supply can be related to microbial N and P immobilisation. METHODS: We studied water and nutrient use efficiencies in leaves of four tree species (Eucalyptus sideroxylon, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Casuarina cunninghamiana, and Pinus radiata) that were grown under rainout shelters for 16 months at low and high levels of water and nutrient supply. RESULTS: Across all four species, WUE increased when water supply was low and nutrient supply was high, while NUE increased when water supply was high and nutrient supply was low. As a consequence, a trade-off was found between WUE and NUE for all four species. In contrast, no trade-off was found between WUE and PUE, likely because PUE and microbial P immobilisation in the soil unexpectedly increased with high nutrient supply. CONCLUSIONS: With variable water and nutrient supply, physiological constraints generate a trade-off between WUE and NUE, but not between WUE and PUE; the latter may have been obscured by microbial control over P supply to plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCasuarina cunninghamiana 3aEucalyptus sideroxylon 3aEucalyptus tereticornis 3aPinus radiata 3aimmobilization in soil 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphosphorus 3atrees 3awater supply 3awater use efficiency1 aCarrillo, Yolima1 aAspinwall, Michael J.1 aMaier, Chelsea1 aCanarini, Alberto1 aTahaei, Hero1 aChoat, Brendan1 aTissue, David T.0 tPlant and soil.g2016 Sept., v. 406, no. 1-2 p.187-199dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-016-2873-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138242013300166245013800299300001600437520136400453592002801817650001901845650001501864650001301879650001801892650001001910650001601920650001701936653001401953653001201967653001201979653002701991653001502018653001402033700002502047700002602072773013602098856007302234852000902307655001202316IND60781206420221122025640.0220625e20220621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078120642DNAL7 a10.1676/21-000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagdaleno, Francisco R.10aUna señal agonística durante el canto: tallar el pico en despliegues multimodales de canto por machos del tordo Molothrus ater13aAn agonistic visual signal during birdsong: Bill wiping in multimodal song displays by the male Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater)  ap. 215-226.  aThe information communicated by displays and their effects on recipients may depend on individual behavioral components that have been ritualized into the displays. This study focused on a visual component, bill wiping, that often occurs at the end of the display that accompanies the perched song (hereinafter referred to as song) of male Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Although bill wiping appears to be a frequent and ritualized component of the cowbird song display, it has received almost no attention despite extensive research on this species' singing behavior. Breeding season observations of group-housed cowbirds of the eastern and midwestern subspecies (M. a. ater) in a semi-naturalistic aviary and pairs of western birds (M. a. obscurus) put together temporarily in an acoustically isolated chamber demonstrated that bill wiping is regularly performed at the end of song displays and is socially modulated. It is much more common in male-than female-directed songs, which led us to hypothesize that it signals aggression. We supported this hypothesis by finding that male-directed songs are also more likely to be accompanied by head-up displays, a known signal of aggression and dominance. Nevertheless, the occurrence of bill wiping (and head-up displays) during female-directed songs, albeit at a low frequency, warrants future study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMolothrus ater 3aaggression 3aaviaries 3agroup housing 3amales 3aornithology 3avocalization 0abird song 0acowbird 0ahead-up 0aintersexual aggression 0amultimodal 0asociality1 aO'Loghlen, Adrian L.1 aRothstein, Stephen I.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2022 June 21, v. 134, no. 2 p.215-226dWilson Ornithological SocietywJournal:6298x1559-44917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1676/21-000043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245008500201300001800286500001900304500002000323520203300343592002802376650001402404650001902418650001402437650001502451650001302466650001602479650002502495650001502520650000902535650001502544650001102559650001102570650001302581650001802594650001602612650001502628651001202643700002402655700006102679700002102740700002702761700001702788700002402805700007002829773012802899856007303027852000903100655001203109IND60720840120221119045820.0201220e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072084012DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.139612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackay, Jonathan D1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4373-574710aProglacial groundwater storage dynamics under climate change and glacier retreat  ap. 5456-5473.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProglacial aquifers are an important water store in glacierised mountain catchments that supplement meltwater‐fed river flows and support freshwater ecosystems. Climate change and glacier retreat will perturb water storage in these aquifers, yet the climate‐glacier‐groundwater response cascade has rarely been studied and remains poorly understood. This study implements an integrated modelling approach that combines distributed glacio‐hydrological and groundwater models with climate change projections to evaluate the evolution of groundwater storage dynamics and surface‐groundwater exchanges in a temperate, glacierised catchment in Iceland. Focused infiltration along the meltwater‐fed Virkisá River channel is found to be an important source of groundwater recharge and is projected to provide 14%–20% of total groundwater recharge by the 2080s. The simulations highlight a mechanism by which glacier retreat could inhibit river recharge in the future due to the loss of diurnal melt cycling in the runoff hydrograph. However, the evolution of proglacial groundwater level dynamics show considerable resilience to changes in river recharge and, instead, are driven by changes in the magnitude and seasonal timing of diffuse recharge from year‐round rainfall. The majority of scenarios simulate an overall reduction in groundwater levels with a maximum 30‐day average groundwater level reduction of 1 m. The simulations replicate observational studies of baseflow to the river, where up to 15% of the 30‐day average river flow comes from groundwater outside of the melt season. This is forecast to reduce to 3%–8% by the 2080s due to increased contributions from rainfall and meltwater runoff. During the melt season, groundwater will continue to contribute 1%–3% of river flow despite significant reductions in meltwater runoff inputs. Therefore it is concluded that, in the proglacial region, groundwater will continue to provide only limited buffering of river flows as the glacier retreats.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3aclimate change 3aevolution 3afreshwater 3aglaciers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrograph 3arain 3ariver flow 3arivers 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3awater storage 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aIceland1 aBarrand, Nicholas E1 aHannah, David M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1714-12401 aKrause, Stephan,1 aJackson, Christopher R1 aEverest, Jez1 aMacDonald, Alan M.,1 aÓ Dochartaigh, Brighid É1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5937-54780 tHydrological processes.g2020 Dec., v. 34, no. 26 p.5456-5473dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.139613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016700168300001600335520146200351592002801813650000901841650002801850650002001878650002201898650001501920650002701935650001401962650001601976650001001992650001802002650001102020650001502031650000902046650002602055700002702081700001802108700002602126700001702152773011102169856008102280852000902361655001202370IND60548400320221116191917.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054840032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-016-2865-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemming, Camilla10aOpportunity costs for maize associated with localised application of sewage sludge derived fertilisers, as indicated by early root and phosphorus uptake responses  ap. 201-217.  aBACKGROUND: Phosphorus recycling from waste and localised placement of fertilisers can potentially improve sustainable P management in agriculture. However, knowledge about root and plant P uptake responses to placement of complex waste-derived fertilisers is lacking. METHODS: Sewage sludge (SS) and sewage sludge ash (ASH) were tested against triple superphosphate (TSP) in a rhizobox setup where maize shoot and root growth and architecture were followed for 30 days. The three P sources were either mixed homogenously into the soil (slightly acidic, low in available P and moderate P fixing capacity; labelled with ³³P) or localised in a patch close to the seed. RESULTS: Localisation of TSP and SS both induced increased root length density in and around the fertiliser patch. For TSP this was followed by enhanced dry matter yield and fertiliser P uptake compared to the mixed source. In contrast, P uptake from SS was not enhanced by the localisation, and while the uptake from the seed was similar, the uptake from soil was lower probably due to weaker root development in the remaining soil. No root response was found for localised ASH, whereas mixed ASH more than doubled dry matter yield and P uptake in comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Young maize plants’ responses to fertiliser localisation imply opportunity costs and under the given soil conditions, localisation of SS and ASH (contrary to TSP) did not entail an overall benefit for the plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3anutrient uptake 3aopportunity costs 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arecycling 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asewage sludge 3ashoots 3asludge ash 3asoil 3atriple superphosphate1 aOberson, A.q(Astrid),1 aHund, Andreas1 aJensen, Lars Stoumann1 aMagid, Jakob0 tPlant and soil.g2016 Sept., v. 406, no. 1-2 p.201-217dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-016-2865-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007300139245012200212300001800334500002000352520197100372592002802343650001102371650001302382650001902395650001502414650002602429650000902455650002402464650001502488650002202503650001202525651001302537700006102550700001902611700003202630700006502662773012402727856007302851852000902924655001202933IND60597773020221120195243.0180627e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059777302DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.132052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues‐Filho, Carlos A.S.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8168-900010aHistorical stability promoted higher functional specialization and originality in Neotropical stream fish assemblages  ap. 1345-1354.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Disturbances are events that influence the structure of biological assemblages, yet how historical disturbances have affected the functional structure of recent assemblages is still poorly known. We used species functional traits to investigate the effects of historical disturbances, such as past climate change (aridification), on the current structure of stream fish assemblages. LOCATION: Amazon Basin and Brazilian Northeast streams. METHODS: We used measures of functional specialization and originality to assess the effects of historical disturbances on the structure of fish assemblages in streams with similar local environmental conditions in each biome (Amazonia and Caatinga). For this, we measured 15 traits related to locomotion, feeding and habitat use for each species sampled. We then compared the functional structure of each assemblage expressed as functional richness (FRic) and evenness (FEve) between biomes. We also used structured and random simulations of species extinctions to identify the influence of the loss of original and specialized species due to historical disturbance. RESULTS: We found high levels of functional specialization in Amazonia (historically more stable) and redundancy in Caatinga (higher frequency of historical disturbances) regional assemblages, regardless of the inter‐biome differences in species richness. These results were also detected in local assemblages, suggesting that the effect of historical disturbances influences the structure of fish assemblages, both at small and large spatial scales. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The historical stability in Amazonian fish assemblages may have favoured a higher taxonomic and FRic, as well as greater functional specialization and originality, compared to Caatinga assemblages. Our results reinforce the importance of understanding and evaluating the evolutionary history of ecosystems in order to describe the current functional structure of species assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acaatinga 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3ahabitat preferences 3alocomotion 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3aAmazonia1 aLeitão, Rafael P.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7990-00681 aZuanon, Jansen1 aSánchez‐Botero, Jorge I.1 aBaccaro, Fabrício B.,1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4747-18570 tJournal of biogeography.g2018 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.1345-1354dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.132053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01821naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245016200165300001800327520054800345592002800893650002300921650001400944650002100958650002300979650002301002650002101025650002501046650002301071650002201094650001701116650001501133700001701148700006001165773013401225856007901359852000901438655001201447IND60612702120221118095336.0180907e20180807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061270212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b010482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazra, Gurupada10aOrganocatalytic, Chemoselective Hydrophosphenylation/oxa-Michael Addition Cascade toward Diastereo- and Enantioenriched 1,3-Dihydroisobenzofuryl Phosphonates  ap. 9654-9666.  aAn efficient method for the construction of chiral C–P bond via an enantioselective 1,2-hydrophosphenylation followed by an oxa-Michael addition cascade of ortho-formyl chalcones has been developed. This provides the diastereoenriched (cis)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuryl phosphonates with excellent enantioselectivities (up to >99%). The origin of enantio- and diastereoselectivity is induced by using a chiral bifunctional organocatalyst. Further, functionalization to highly enantioselective 3-substituted phthalides has also been demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achalcones 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3achemoselectivity 3adiastereoselectivity 3aenantioselectivity 3aorganic chemistry 3aphosphonates 3aphthalides1 aPratap, Shiv1 aGhorai, Prasanta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5120-27000 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2018 Aug. 07, v. 83, no. 17 p.9654-9666dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b010483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245008900161300001600250520098300266592002801249650001901277650001601296650002101312650001701333650002001350650001501370650001501385650001101400650001301411650002101424650001401445650001101459773012801470856007701598852000901675655001201684IND60765122820221120230219.0220422e20091227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076512282DNAL7 a10.17221/40/2008-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠtolcová, J.10aFeeding preferences of <i>Phyllotreta herbivores</i> to winter rape and chosen weeds  ap. 156-160.  aIn model experiments with leaf disks from <i>Brassica napus</i> L. subsp. napus and <i>Thlaspi arvense</i> L. and <i>Sinapis arvensis</i> L. in spring periods (May–June) of 2006–2007 feeding preferences of Phyllotreta herbivores to the above-mentioned crop and two common weeds were investigated.

During cultivation, the different morphological forms displayed by the fungi have an impact on the overall production. The morphology of a recombinant lipase producing Aspergillus oryzae strain was investigated during fed-batch cultivations. During the exponential batch phase of the fed-batch cultivations, the average hyphal length increased as did the number of tips per hyphal element. Most striking was the finding that the diameter of the hyphal elements increased with an average factor of 1.5 during the batch phase from 2.8–2.9 up to 4.0–4.4 μm. The diameter of the hyphal elements remained constant, around 4 μm, after the feed was started. However, the diameter of the immediate hyphal tip, where the enzyme secretion is thought to take place, increased dramatically with up to a factor 2.5 during the feeding period. The expression of the recombinant lipase was induced by the feeding with maltose, and an increase in lipase activity was seen in parallel to a swelling of the tips. The results indicate that the two events are linked as a return to normal growth was observed upon cessation of production due to oxygen limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3afungi 3ahyphae 3amaltose 3aoxygen 3asecretion 3atriacylglycerol lipase 2aAspergillus oryzaexcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aHyphaexcytology 2aLipasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis1 aOlsson, Lisbeth1 aHansen, Kim1 aEliasson Lantz, Anna0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2006 Apr., v. 70, no. 4 p.482-487dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-005-0085-83Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02037naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245010900170300001600279520082400295592002801119650002601147650001001173650001801183650001401201650000701215650002601222653001801248653001901266653001801285653002801303653004301331700002101374700001901395700001901414700001401433773009501447856008801542852000901630655001201639IND60552678720221121052617.0161021e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055267872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Jin-Zhi10aTumor extracellular acidity-activated nanoparticles as drug delivery systems for enhanced cancer therapy  ap. 789-803.  apH-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) are currently under intense development as drug delivery systems for cancer therapy. Among various pH-responsiveness, NPs that are designed to target slightly acidic extracellular pH environment (pHe) of solid tumors provide a new paradigm of tumor targeted drug delivery. Compared to conventional specific surface targeting approaches, the pHe-targeting strategy is considered to be more general due to the common occurrence of acidic microenvironment in solid tumors. This review mainly focuses on the design and applications of pHe-activated NPs, with special emphasis on pHe-activated surface charge reversal NPs, for drug and siRNA delivery to tumors. The novel development of NPs described here offers great potential for achieving better therapeutic effects in cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apH 3asmall interfering RNA 0aNanoparticles 0aCancer therapy 0aDrug delivery 0aSurface charge reversal 0aTumor extracellular acidity responsive1 aMao, Cheng-Qiong1 aYuan, You-Yong1 aYang, Xian-Zhu1 aWang, Jun0 tBiotechnology Advances.g2014 July,  Aug., v. 32 p.789-803dElsevier Inc.x0734-97507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2013.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010100169520136800270592002801638650001801666650002601684650002601710650001001736650002401746650003001770650002401800650005201824700001601876700001801892700001901910700001601929700001701945700001801962773012701980856008502107852000902192655001202201IND60748622620221118183832.0210827e20210723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074862262DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90815732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xianshu 10aColonization of Clostridium butyricum in Rats and Its Effect on Intestinal Microbial Composition  aGut microorganisms participate in many physiological processes. In particular, Clostridium butyricum can modulate gut microorganisms and treat diseases. The colonization and persistence of strains in the gut contribute to beneficial effects, and the colonization by C. butyricum in the gut is currently unknown. We investigated the total intestinal contents of C. butyricum at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and four and six days using real-time reverse transcription-PCR, after oral administration of C. butyricum to rats for seven consecutive days. We assessed the bacterial community structure using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The results showed that C. butyricum was mainly colonized in the colon. The total content of C. butyricum in the gut increased significantly at 12 h after administration. Exogenous C. butyricum could still be detected in the gut six days after administration. Administration of C. butyricum significantly enhanced gut microbial diversity. The relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacterial genera was shown to be higher than that of the control group, and treatment with C. butyricum elevated Firmicutes and diminished Bacteroidetes phyla compared with to the control group. These findings laid the foundation for the study of probiotic colonization capacity and the improvement of microflora for the prevention of gut diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aClostridium butyricum 3abacterial communities 3acolon 3acommunity structure 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aoral administration 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aKong, Qing 1 aWang, Yuming 1 aDuan, Xuefeng 1 aWang, Peng 1 aLi, Chenman 1 aHuan, Yuchen 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 July 23, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90815733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245004700197500001900244500002000263520176100283592002802044650002302072650005202095650001702147650001702164650001402181650002402195650001702219650002102236650001302257650001402270650001702284651001002301700001802311773012702329856007402456852000902530655001202539IND60723923920221123044308.0210118e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072392392DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.135572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLammi, Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7428-448610aFood‐derived antioxidants and COVID‐19  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSARS‐CoV‐2 (previously 2019‐nCoV), the pathogenic agent of COVID‐19 disease, started to expand from Wuhan, China, on December 2019 and in 2 months, it spread worldwide giving origin to a pandemic. COVID‐19 has a stronger transmission capacity by inhalation of infectious aerosols and after an incubation time of 3–14 days, it may be responsible for diseases ranging from the asymptomatic to fatal consequences. COVID‐19 has emerged as a multifaceted, multisystem, multi‐organ disorder, which produces its pathogenic effects through a quite ubiquitous target at the level of multiple organs and in which oxidative stress and inflammatory process play relevant roles. Thus, besides the development of a pharmacological therapy, in the field of alternative and coadjutant therapeutic, the use of dietary supplements or nutraceuticals for the prevention or treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may be a useful strategy. Herein, we specifically comment on some literature evidences, which link the food‐derived antioxidants and metal‐chelating agents with treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation that play a key role in the progression of COVID‐19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Oxidative stress and inflammation are key factors increasing COVID‐19 severity especially in the presence of chronic diseases associated with the antioxidant system fragility. These evidences support the recommendation of antioxidants supplementation as useful strategies against COVID‐19. In light with these observations, herein, a comment which describes the major antioxidants and metal‐chelating agents from food sources that might be useful for the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation during COVID‐19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantioxidants 3abiochemistry 3abreathing 3adietary supplements 3ainflammation 3aoxidative stress 3apandemic 3apathogens 3atherapeutics 3aChina1 aArnoldi, Anna0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e13557-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.135573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009200211300001600303520104500319592002801364650002301392650001901415650002201434650002601456650002801482773011501510856008201625852000901707655001201716IND60648018120221119134859.0190625e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064801812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02421-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Stacy-ann1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3163-877112aA commentary on national adaptation drivers: the case of small island developing states  ap. 303-313.  aThis paper comments on the applicability of the global indicators of climate change adaptation policy drivers contained in Berrang-Ford et al.

SIDS are a globally recognised ‘special’ case in terms of environment and sustainable development issues as they are disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. While acknowledging that the choice of final indicators in the Berrang-Ford et al. (2014) assessment was primarily the function of the results of bivariate analyses with their Adaptation Initiatives Index and that there is no certainty of statistically significant relationships with any measure of adaptation initiatives, this paper proposes the inclusion of a number of predictor variables for a future SIDS-specific quantitative analysis. By doing this, this commentary helps to contribute a more nuanced understanding of potential national adaptation policy drivers in SIDS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abivariate analysis 3aclimate change 3aissues and policy 3aquantitative analysis 3asustainable development0 tClimatic change.g2019 June, v. 154, no. 3-4 p.303-313dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02421-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245007700167300001600244520177400260536004102034592002802075650001802103650002302121650001602144650002102160650001602181650002802197650001502225650001002240650003102250650002002281650001202301650001902313650003002332650002002362650001802382650002202400650002502422650002202447653001402469653001602483653001902499653001702518653002002535653001602555653001702571700002202588773011602610856008002726852000902806655001202815IND60624266820221119143018.0181202e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062426682DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336124560432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Paige E.10aPhytochemicals and Cancer RiskbA Review of the Epidemiological Evidence  ap. 599-612.  aA number of epidemiological studies have investigated associations between various phytochemicals and cancer risk. Phytoestrogens and carotenoids are the two most commonly studied classes of phytochemicals; phytosterols, isothiocyanates, and chlorophyll also have been investigated, although to a much lesser extent. Because there have been no systematic reviews of the literature on all phytochemicals and cancer risk to date, this article systematically reviews 96 published epidemiological studies that examined associations between phytochemicals and cancer risk. Most studies found null associations between individual phytochemicals and cancer risk at various sites. In addition, results from past studies have been largely inconsistent, and observed associations have been of relatively modest magnitude. The most consistent protective effects were observed for higher levels—dietary intake, serum, plasma, or urinary metabolites—of β-carotene and renal cell cancer, β-cryptoxanthin and lung cancer, isothiocyanates and lung cancer, isothiocyanates and gastrointestinal cancer, lignans and postmenopausal breast cancer, and flavonoids and lung cancer. Although elevated risk of certain cancers with higher levels of certain phytochemicals was observed, an insufficient pool of studies examining the same associations or inconsistent findings across studies limit the ability to conclude that any one phytochemical increases cancer risk. Additional research is needed to support previously identified associations in cases where only one study has examined a particular relationship. Importantly, continued research efforts are needed to evaluate the cumulative and interactive effects of numerous phytochemicals and phytochemical-rich foods on cancer risk.  aFinancial disclosure: none declared.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3abeta-cryptoxanthin 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3achlorophyll 3aepidemiological studies 3aflavonoids 3afoods 3agastrointestinal neoplasms 3aisothiocyanates 3alignans 3alung neoplasms 3anutrition risk assessment 3aplant estrogens 3apostmenopause 3aprotective effect 3arenal cell carcinoma 3asystematic review 0aneoplasms 0acarotenoids 0aphytoestrogens 0aphytosterols 0aisothiocyanates 0achlorophyll 0aepidemiology1 aSnyder, Denise C.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 27, no. 5 p.599-612dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336124560433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169300001800304520152800322536012401850592002801974596001502002650001802017650001602035650001902051650001902070650001302089650002102102650003302123650001702156650001602173650002002189650002902209650002602238650001302264650001402277650001502291653002602306653001602332653003202348653001202380653000802392700001202400700001302412700002202425700001702447773012102464856008502585852000902670655001202679IND60746191620221120121331.0210729e20210824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074619162DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2020.17203052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dandan10aTreatment performance and microbial community under ammonium sulphate wastewater in a sulphate reducing ammonium oxidation process  ap. 2982-2990.  aA laboratory testing of simultaneous removal of ammonium and sulphate was studied from the sulphate reducing ammonium oxidation (SRAO) process in a circulating flow completely anaerobic bioreactor. Three different stages of starting SRAO process were studied, and final batch tests analysis of SRAO process was conducted. During the SRAO process, the influent concentrations of NH₄ ⁺-N and SO₄ ²– were controlled to be 80–180 and 300–969 mg L⁻¹ respectively. The highest removal efficiencies of NH₄ ⁺-N and SO₄ ²–-S were up to 94.80% and 52.57%. N/S [n(NH₄ ⁺-N)/n(SO₄ ²–-S)] conversion rates during the experiment had not been unified, which may be caused by the experiment's complex process. In order to further validate the biochemical interaction between ammonium and sulphate, batch tests were carried out. The extra electron acceptor, such as bicarbonate, was thought to react with ammonium by bacteria. The increase of NO₃ ⁻ production and HCO₃ ⁻ removal in the effluent indicated the occurrence of the new interaction between N–C. NH₄ ⁺ was converted to NO₂ ⁻ and NO₃ ⁻. Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria were detected in the anaerobic cycle growth reactor. The conversion of SRAO was mainly caused by the high performance of Planctomycetes. These results showed that nitrogen was converted by the partial nitrifying process, the denitrification process, and the traditional anammox process simultaneously with the SRAO process.  aThis study was supported by the Liaoning Provincial Department of Education General Project: [Grant Number LCD2016001].  aPublisher supplied data  aLCD2016001 3aAcidobacteria 3aChloroflexi 3aPlanctomycetes 3aProteobacteria 3aammonium 3aammonium sulfate 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abicarbonates 3abioreactors 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental technology 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3awastewater 0aAmmonium and sulphate 0abicarbonate 0apartial nitrifying bacteria 0aanammox 0aN/S1 aCui, Li1 aZhu, Hao1 aMadani, Rayan M A1 aLiang, Jiyan0 tEnvironmental technology.g2021 Aug. 24, v. 42, no. 19 p.2982-2990dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2020.17203053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245010700161300001600268520068700284592002800971653001700999653001901016653002601035653002801061653001601089653002301105653002001128700001901148700001901167773010601186856007701292852000901369655001201378IND60131139420221122032350.0151127e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013113942DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-08-059.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgin, Shelley10aAlternanthera philoxeroides in New South Wales, Australia: Are We Closer to Control of Alligator Weed?  ap. 121-126.  aAlligator weed is a serious weed in many countries. In Australia, it is a ““weed of national significance”” because of its actual and potential impact. We surveyed all local governments in New South Wales in 2001 and 2007 to determine whether the weed is being contained. We found an increased number and extent of infestations, despite more resources and a better knowledge base. Most considered that further research is needed in tactics for control of the weed. On the basis of current containment in urban gardens, we recommend that governments better mobilize the community (e.g., bush restoration consultants, Landcare groups) to deal with alligator weed infestations.  aPublisher supplied data 0aWeed control 0aplant invasion 0alocal government area 0acommunity participation 0aweed threat 0abiological control 0aweed management1 aNorris, Andrew1 aKarlson, David0 tWeed technology.g2010 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.121-126dWeed Science Society of Americax0890-037X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWT-08-059.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008000169300001600249520153000265592002801795650002201823650002301845650001901868650002101887650003401908650002701942650002601969650002201995650002902017650003002046650001302076650002202089650001702111650001502128650001002143650001602153650001102169650001102180650001902191650004402210650001402254650002202268650001702290700001902307700002102326700002202347700002002369700002302389700001902412700003002431773015302461856008602614852000902700655001202709IND60549842920170925000000.0160909e20160422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054984292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b004362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wen-Xuan10aAntibacterial Azaphilones from an Endophytic Fungus, Colletotrichum sp. BS4  ap. 704-710.  aThree new compounds, colletotrichones A–C (1–3), and one known compound, chermesinone B (4a), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Colletotrichum sp. BS4, harbored in the leaves of Buxus sinica, a well-known boxwood plant used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses including 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, ECD spectra, UV, and IR, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and shown to be azaphilones sharing a 3,6a-dimethyl-9-(2-methylbutanoyl)-9H-furo[2,3-h]isochromene-6,8-dione scaffold. Owing to the remarkable antibacterial potency of known azaphilones coupled to the usage of the host plant in TCM, we evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of the isolated compounds against two commonly dispersed environmental strains of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, as well as against two human pathogenic clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Compound 1 exhibited marked antibacterial potencies against the environmental strains that were comparable to the standard antibiotics. Compound 3 was also active against E. coli. Finally, compound 2a exhibited the same efficacy as streptomycin against the clinically relevant bacterium S. aureus. The in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds on a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was also assessed. Our results provide a scientific rationale for further investigations into endophyte-mediated host chemical defense against specialist and generalist pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBuxus sempervirens 3aColletotrichum 3aEscherichia coli 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3abacteria 3achemical defenses 3acytotoxicity 3aendophytes 3afungi 3ahost plants 3ahumans 3aleaves 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathogens 3aspectral analysis 3astreptomycin1 aKusari, Souvik1 aLaatsch, Hartmut1 aGolz, Christopher1 aKusari, Parijat1 aStrohmann, Carsten1 aKayser, Oliver1 aSpiteller, M.q(Michael),0 tJournal of natural products.g2016 Apr. 22, v. 79, no. 4 p.704-710dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosyx1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jnatprod.5b004363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245012300187300001800310520096700328592002801295650002001323650001601343650001701359650001401376650001501390650001001405650001901415650001801434650000701452650001501459650001001474650002901484650001101513650002301524650001801547650001001565650001401575650004201589650002501631650002501656650004201681650003101723650004501754650003901799650002701838650001001865650004101875650003601916650001601952650002901968650001001997700001602007773009702023856008602120852000902206655001202215IND4447196320221122220621.0141110e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444719632DNAL7 a208551952pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.08.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Chetna10aUtilization of deoiled Jatropha curcas seed cake for production of xylanase from thermophilic Scytalidium thermophilum  ap. 1722-1726.  aJatropha curcas is a major biodiesel crop. Large amount of deoiled cake is generated as by-product during biodiesel production from its seeds. Deoiled J. curcas seed cake was assessed as substrate for the production of xylanase from thermophilic fungus Scytalidium thermophilum by solid-state fermentation. The seed cake was efficiently utilized by S. thermophilum for its growth during which it produced good amount of heat stable extracellular xylanase. The solid-state fermentation conditions were optimized for maximum xylanase production. Under the optimized conditions viz. deoiled seed cake supplemented with 1% oat-spelt xylan, adjusted to pH 9.0, moisture content 1:3w/v, inoculated with 1×10⁶ spores per 5g cake and incubated at 45°C, 1455U xylanase/g deoiled seed cake was obtained. The xylanase was useful in biobleaching of paper pulp. Solid-state fermentation of deoiled cake appears a potentially viable approach for its effective utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3aScytalidium 3abiobleaching 3abiodiesel 3abyproducts 3acrops 3aheat stability 3aoilseed cakes 3apH 3apaper pulp 3aseeds 3asolid state fermentation 3aspores 3athermophilic fungi 3awater content 3axylan 3axylanases 2aAscomycotaxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aCarbonxpharmacology 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxbiosynthesis 2aFermentationxdrug effects 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aJatrophaxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aNitrogenxpharmacology 2aPaper 2aPlant Oilsxisolation & purification 2aSeedsxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aTemperature 2aWaste Productsxanalysis 2aWater1 aKhare, S.K.0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Jan., v. 102, no. 2 p.1722-1726dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.08.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009600207300001800303520123600321592002801557596006901585650002201654650002201676650001801698650001801716650002301734650003401757650002401791650002001815650002401835650001401859650002501873700002301898700002301921700001601944773013401960856008302094852000902177655001202186IND60690085420221119112651.0200426e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069008542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00366-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Wahab Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5478-354410aMicroencapsulation of vitamin D in protein matrices: in vitro release and storage stability  ap. 1172-1182.  aStability and preservation of vitamin D are major concerns that lead to its encapsulation. Whey protein isolates (WPI) and soy protein isolates (SPI) were used as a carrier to effectively encapsulate vitamin D. The resultant microcapsules were evaluated for encapsulation efficiency, morphological characteristics, XRD diffraction, gastric release and storage stability. Nine different formulations WPI (6, 8, 10%), SPI (6, 8, 10%) and WPI + SPI (6, 8, 10%) were prepared. Among them, 5% WPI + 5% SPI exhibited the highest encapsulation efficiency (> 95%). SPI microcapsules had a large size as compared to WPI. Scanning electron microscope revealed that the combination of both proteins produced smoother beads with fewer fissures and better retention for vitamin D. The structural changes of WPI and SPI from crystallinity to amorphous confirm vitamin D encapsulation through XRD diffraction. Maximum release was observed in SPI (66–50%) in simulated gastric fluid. All the encapsulates showed significantly higher stability and vitamin D retention (> 93%) during storage at 4 °C as compared to free vitamin D. The present study demonstrates both proteins as a potential carrier to encapsulate lipophilic vitamin.  aPublisher supplied data  aIngenious and IRSIP AwardcHigher Education Commission, Pakistan 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3agastric juice 3alipophilicity 3amicroencapsulation 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asoy protein isolate 3astorage quality 3astorage temperature 3avitamin D 3awhey protein isolate1 aButt, Masood Sadiq1 aPāshā, ʻImrān,1 aJamil, Amer0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2020 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.1172-1182dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00366-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010000163300001200263500001900275520138300294592002801677596006301705650001501768650001501783650000901798650001501807650002301822650001501845650001601860650002001876650001501896650001501911650001701926650001601943700001801959700005501977773013502032856008302167852000902250655001202259IND60700203720221118224300.0200809e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070020372DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-09071-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinmin, Li10aFractal and pore structure analysis of structural anisotropic coal under different impact loads  ap. 323.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPore structure is the key factor that affects the adsorption/desorption of coal. In order to study the change characteristics of pore structure in structural anisotropic coal under different impact loads, the low- temperature liquid nitrogen adsorption tests were carried out after the split Hopkinson bar (SHPB) impact, then the pore structure variation and fractal dimension were calculated and analyzed. The results show that before and after impact, the adsorption isotherms change from type II (raw coal) to type III (impacted coal). With impact loads increasing, adsorption and desorption isotherms change from hysteresis loops to overlap which are determined by open pore structure and dead end pore structure. Meanwhile, mesoporous and micropores in coal samples are much more obviously damaged by larger impact load, and the adsorption capacity becomes smaller, especially for coal samples in parallel to the bedding. Pore volume mainly distribute in mesoporous and macropores, and SSA mainly distribute in mesoporous and micropores. On the whole, the pore volume and SSA decrease with the increase of impact load. Not only pore volume but also SSA in perpendicular to the bedding are larger than that in parallel to the bedding under same impact load. Fractal dimension D₂ decreases with impact load increasing, which causes the adsorption capacity linearly reduces.  aPublisher supplied data  a41772163cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aadsorption 3aanisotropy 3acoal 3adesorption 3afractal dimensions 3ahysteresis 3aimpact load 3aliquid nitrogen 3amacropores 3amicropores 3aporous media 3atemperature1 aWeimin, Liang1 aGaowei, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4576-77880 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 July, v. 79, no. 13 p.323-323dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09071-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245012500174300001600299520112400315592002801439653002201467653001901489653001701508653001901525653002601544653003201570700001701602700001801619700001901637700002001656700001901676700001601695700001701711700002001728773010301748856008701851852000901938655001201947IND60594159620221121195648.0180510e20180310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059415962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2017.12.1882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Young Hoon10aInvestigation of electrochemical performance on carbon supported tin-selenium bimetallic anodes in lithium-ion batteries  ap. 193-201.  aBimetallic compound, composed of two different metal elements, has emerged as an important class of electrode system. Amorphous carbon materials are widely used in anodes to reduce the internal resistance of electrodes. Therefore, SnSe bimetallic compound uniformly dispersed in acetylene black as a carbon-support has been fabricated for lithium ion batteries by high energy mechanical milling (HEMM) process under argon atmosphere. The SnSe-C composite retains a reversible capacity of 564 mAh g⁻¹ with a coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, at a current rate of 100 mA g⁻¹ after 50 cycles. In the high rate capability test, the SnSe-C composite exhibits the charge capacity of 530 mAh g⁻¹ at 5000 mA g⁻¹ charge rate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicate that SnSe-C composite shows small increase of surface resistance than that of plain SnSe composite. The enhanced cycle stability of SnSe-C composite can be attributed to the amorphous carbon additive that offers high electrical conductivity as well as a buffer matrix that prevents the volume change during cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBimetallic system 0aAnode material 0aTin-selenium 0aCarbon-support 0aLithium-ion batteries 0aElectrochemical performance1 aKim, Doo Soo1 aKim, Minjung,1 aPark, Min Sang1 aLee, Young-Chul1 aKim, Kwang-ho,1 aKim, Il Tae1 aHur, Jaehyun1 aLee, Seung Geol0 tElectrochimica acta.g2018 Mar. 10, v. 266 p.193-201dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.12.1883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002300143245006000166300001100226520196500237592002802202650001202230650001302242650001702255650001502272650001002287650001802297650001702315650002302332650002302355650002102378650002202399650001502421650002602436650001302462650001002475650001102485650001202496651001102508700001902519700002602538700001902564773010202583856007902685852000902764655001202773IND4514191720221120201424.0150603e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451419172DNAL7 a10.1186/2190-4715-23-232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeller, Reuben P.,10aInvasive species in Europe: ecology, status, and policy  ap. 23.  aGlobalization of trade and travel has facilitated the spread of non-native species across the earth. A proportion of these species become established and cause serious environmental, economic, and human health impacts. These species are referred to as invasive, and are now recognized as one of the major drivers of biodiversity change across the globe. As a long-time centre for trade, Europe has seen the introduction and subsequent establishment of at least several thousand non-native species. These range in taxonomy from viruses and bacteria to fungi, plants, and animals. Although invasive species cause major negative impacts across all regions of Europe, they also offer scientists the opportunity to develop and test theory about how species enter and leave communities, how non-native and native species interact with each other, and how different types of species affect ecosystem functions. For these reasons, there has been recent growth in the field of invasion biology as scientists work to understand the process of invasion, the changes that invasive species cause to their recipient ecosystems, and the ways that the problems of invasive species can be reduced. This review covers the process and drivers of species invasions in Europe, the socio-economic factors that make some regions particularly strongly invaded, and the ecological factors that make some species particularly invasive. We describe the impacts of invasive species in Europe, the difficulties involved in reducing these impacts, and explain the policy options currently being considered. We outline the reasons that invasive species create unique policy challenges, and suggest some rules of thumb for designing and implementing management programs. If new management programs are not enacted in Europe, it is inevitable that more invasive species will arrive, and that the total economic, environmental, and human health impacts from these species will continue to grow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3afungi 3aglobalization 3ahuman health 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3ascientists 3asocioeconomic factors 3ataxonomy 3atrade 3atravel 3aviruses 3aEurope1 aGeist, Juergen1 aJeschke, Jonathan M.,1 aKühn, Ingolf,0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2011 Dec., v. 23, no. 1 p.23-23dSpringer-Verlagx2190-47077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2190-4715-23-233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245012400161300001600285520145200301592002801753653002301781653002101804653001901825653001801844700002601862700002301888700002201911773010601933856007702039852000902116655001202125IND60131139820221122041511.0151127e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013113982DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-09-046.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, Md Kamal10aCharacterizing Weed Populations in Different Turfgrass Sites throughout the Klang Valley of Western Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 173-181.  aA field survey was conducted in 2007 to characterize weed populations in different turfgrass sites throughout the Klang Valley of western Peninsular Malaysia. Sites included golf course putting greens, athletic fields, sod farms, and residential lawns. Weeds present in each site were identified and the data were used to calculate frequency, distribution uniformity, density, relative abundance, and community coefficient values for each species. Seventy-nine weed species, belonging to 16 families, were found. The most species were found on residential lawns, and the fewest were found on golf course putting greens; athletic fields and sod farms ranked intermediately. A total of 19 different weed species were classified as major (relative abundance ≥≥ 15), and abundance rankings varied by turfgrass area. Greater kyllinga had the highest relative abundance values on athletic fields (45.5) and golf course putting greens (71.5), and the second highest value (21.7) on residential lawns. Forked fringerush and annual sedge had the greatest relative abundance values on residential lawns and sod farms, respectively. Cogongrass was reported on 15%% of the residential lawns evaluated. The heterogeneity of weed species composition suggests that control strategies will vary by turfgrass use area. Quantifying weed population dynamics will help researchers delineate integrated weed management strategies to turfgrass managers in Malaysia.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRelative abundance 0aweed populations 0ainvasive weeds 0anoxious weeds1 aJuraimi, Abdul Shukor1 aMohd.

We examined the habitat use and behaviour of Mohua in podocarp forest after their reintroduction to Ulva Island to determine the suitability of this forest type. When in podocarp forest mohua spent <75% of their time foraging, less than when in beech forest (90%). This suggests that podocarp forest provides more food resources than beech forest and is suitable for Mohua. The birds were frequently observed in the coastal scrub surrounding the island, but this habitat type was not used for foraging. We discovered a seasonal variation in foraging patterns: ripping through bark and epiphytes was predominant in spring, and gleaning in the foliage prevailed in summer. Miro, Rata and Rimu were the preferred foraging trees in the interior forest, and Hall's Totara and Kamahi were consistently avoided in both the forest and along the coast. Variation in the use of tree species throughout the season suggests that a structurally diverse forest community is an important habitat requirement for Mohua, as it provides sufficient resources for all seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPasseriformes 3abark 3abirds 3acoasts 3aendangered species 3aepiphytes 3aforaging 3aforest types 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aislands 3aleaves 3aseasonal variation 3ashrublands 3aspring 3asummer 3atrees 3aNew Zealand1 aBeaven, Brent M.0 tEmu.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 104, no. 3 p.235-240dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU030383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245006200203300001600265520152200281592002801803596004001831596007401871650001001945650002101955650001901976650001201995650002502007650001102032650001702043650001602060650001102076650001602087651001902103651001202122651001202134700002102146700002102167700002102188773011502209856008202324852000902406655001202415IND60648018620221119135008.0190625e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064801862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02405-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParkes, Ben1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5936-833110aClimate change in Africa: costs of mitigating heat stress  ap. 461-476.  aWe applied two metrics, apparent temperature and humidex, to calculate heat stress in both present and future climates. We use an ensemble of CORDEX-Africa simulations to estimate heat stress during a baseline period and at two specific warming levels, 2 and 4 ∘C above pre-industrial. The increase in temperatures and changes to the precipitation distribution under climate change are projected to increase the intensity of heat stress events in Sahelian Africa and introduce new heat stress events in Northern and Central Africa. As the intensity of heat stress increases, it is expected that the use of energy-intensive cooling will increase. The energy system, therefore, will need to be able to supply more energy to power fans or air conditioning units. The cooling demand to turn a heat stress event into a non-heat stress event is computed. This value is then weighted by the population to find the total cooling required to prevent heat stress across the continent. Country-level results indicate that the greatest increases in cooling demand will occur in countries with densely populated regions, most notably Nigeria. Supplying this additional cooling demand will present the greatest challenge to less developed countries like Somalia. We find the least-cost future energy system that meets the projected increase in demand and derive the increase in energy system costs with the TIAM-UCL model. The total increase in energy costs to prevent heat stress is found to be $51bn by 2035 and $487bn by 2076.  aPublisher supplied data  a603864cSeventh Framework Programme  aEP/M507970/1cEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (GB) 3aSahel 3aair conditioning 3aclimate change 3acooling 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aheat stress 3amodels 3atemperature 3aCentral Africa 3aNigeria 3aSomalia1 aCronin, Jennifer1 aDessens, Olivier1 aSultan, Benjamin0 tClimatic change.g2019 June, v. 154, no. 3-4 p.461-476dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02405-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245019800160300001800358520148800376592002801864650002001892650001901912650001301931650001601944650001401960650000901974650002901983650001802012650002002030650001302050650001202063650001402075650001202089650001702101650002302118650001202141650001402153650002002167700001502187700001302202700001602215700001702231700001702248773012802265856007402393852000902467655001202476IND60656756820221120114816.0190814e20140424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065675682DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00169a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Zhixiong10aRapid determination of trace phenols migrating into drinking water from plastic-based pipe materials and household water treatment equipment using vortex-assisted emulsification microextraction  ap. 3482-3489.  aA simple and rapid vortex-assisted emulsification microextraction (VAEME) method combined with spectrophotometry was developed for the determination of trace phenols migrating into potable water from plastic-based pipe materials and household water treatment equipments. The oxidative coupling reaction of phenolic compounds with 4-aminoantipyrine was carried out employing potassium peroxodisulfate as the oxidant in alkaline medium. A cloudy mixture was formed facilitating mass transfer of the reaction products into the fine droplets of toluene. The extraction equilibrium was rapidly achieved within 3 min by a combination of vibration and heating. The extract was concentrated in the narrow neck of the vessel, and could be easily withdrawn with a syringe. The VAEME method effectively avoids the analytical errors resulting from fluid leakage, which often occurs during conventional liquid–liquid extraction with a separating funnel. Under the optimal conditions, linearity ranges of 0.2–180 μg L⁻¹ and detection limits of 0.08 μg L⁻¹ (expressed as C₆H₅OH concentration) were achieved. This approach was successfully applied in the determination of trace amounts of phenols in 36 solutions used to soak a variety of matrices. The recoveries were in the range of 86.0–99.8% and the relative standard deviations ranged from 0.53% to 6.5%. Compared with the official method, the proposed method was faster, more sensitive and required lower amounts of reagents.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adrinking water 3adroplets 3aemulsifying 3aequipment 3aheat 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amass transfer 3amicroextraction 3aoxidants 3aphenols 3apotassium 3asoaking 3aspectroscopy 3astandard deviation 3atoluene 3avibration 3awater treatment1 aLi, Gongke1 aWu, Rong1 aLuo, Zhibin1 aZhu, Binghui1 aShao, Yijuan0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Apr. 24, v. 6, no. 10 p.3482-3489dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00169a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245011900214300001600333520199900349592002802348596003902376596003902415596005902454650002802513650001202541650001902553650001902572650002402591650002202615650002102637650002002658650001102678650001602689651003102705700002502736700002402761700001502785773011502800856008202915852000902997655001203006IND60648018720221119135029.0190625e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064801872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02411-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarmalkar, Ambarish V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2940-041710aIdentifying credible and diverse GCMs for regional climate change studies—case study: Northeastern United States  ap. 367-386.  aClimate data obtained from global climate models (GCMs) form the basis of most studies of regional climate change and its impacts. Using the northeastern U.S. as a test case, we develop a framework to systematically sub-select reliable models for use in climate change studies in the region. Model performance over the historical period is evaluated first for a wide variety of standard and process metrics including large-scale atmospheric circulation features that drive regional climate variability. The inclusion of process-based metrics allows identification of credible models in capturing key processes relevant for the climate of the northeastern U.S. Model performance is then used in conjunction with the assessment of redundancy in model projections, especially in summer precipitation, to eliminate models that have better performing counterparts. Finally, we retain some mixed-performing models to maintain the range of climate model uncertainty, required by the fact that model biases are not strongly related to their respective projections. This framework leads to the retention of 16 of 36 CMIP5 GCMs that (a) have a satisfactory historical performance for a variety of metrics and (b) provide diverse climate projections consistent with uncertainties in the multi-model ensemble (MME). Overall, the models show significant variations in their performance across metrics and seasons with none emerging as the best model in all metrics. The retained set reduces the number of models by more than one half, easing the computational burden of using the entire CMIP5 MME, while still maintaining a wide range of projections for risk assessment. The retention of some mixed-performing models to maintain ensemble uncertainty suggests a potential to narrow the ranges in temperature and precipitation. But any further refinement should be based on a more detailed analysis of models in capturing regional climate variability and extremes to avoid providing overconfident projections.  aPublisher supplied data  aG12AC00001cU.S. Geological Survey  aG12AC00001cU.S. Geological Survey  a1056216cDivision of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3ameteorological data 3amodel uncertainty 3amodel validation 3arisk assessment 3asummer 3atemperature 3aNortheastern United States1 aThibeault, Jeanne M.1 aBryan, Alexander M.1 aSeth, Anji0 tClimatic change.g2019 June, v. 154, no. 3-4 p.367-386dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02411-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245012800207300001200335500001900347520200300366592002802369596006502397596003102462650002902493650001102522650001102533650001602544650001602560650001002576650001502586650001102601650000702612650000902619650001102628650002302639650001102662650001102673650002102684650001402705650002202719650001502741650000902756650001102765651001702776651001402793700002202807700001802829700002302847700004002870773013502910856008303045852000903128655001203137IND60700204120221118224702.0200809e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070020412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-09063-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScordo, Facundo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6182-736810aSpatial and seasonal dynamics of water physical–chemical parameters in rivers and lakes of an Argentinian Patagonia basin  ap. 322.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Senguer River basin, located in central Argentinian Patagonia, has its headwater in the Andean Range and ends in extra-Andean Patagonian plains. Within this region, the water bodies may be affected by their localization and the climatic and hydrological seasonality. At the lower basin, there are higher temperatures, evaporation and human impact, and lower precipitation and land cover. In addition, rainfall and runoff are higher during the winter and spring, while temperatures, wind intensity, and evaporation are higher during the summer and autumn. However, the characteristics and dynamics of the water bodies of this basin are not well known. This work aims to study the physical–chemical characteristics of the rivers and lakes of the Senguer River basin to establish their spatial and seasonal variations. During 1 year, seasonally, it was measured the concentration of total, organic and inorganic suspended sediments (TSS, OSS, ISS, respectively), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature, chlorophyll a (Chl a), total phosphorus and Secchi disk depth. At the lower basin, water bodies present higher TSS, TDS, Chl a, and turbidity. The seasonal variability has a high impact on TSS (higher on the spring) and water temperature (higher on summer); however, the effect on the other variables is lower relative to the importance of the localization. The two extremes of the basin, Fontana Lake (Fo; located in the Andean zone) and Musters Lake (Mu; located extra-Andean plains), differed in TSS (Fo = 0.4 ± 0.3 mg L⁻¹; Mu = 4.3 ± 2.8 mg L⁻¹), TDS (Fo = 14 ± 1 mg L⁻¹; Mu = 278 ± 9 mg L⁻¹), water transparency (Fo = 11.8 ± 1.2 m; Mu = 3.1 ± 2.4 mg L⁻¹), and Chl a (Fo = 0.42 ± 0.17 μg L⁻¹; Mu = 3.93 ± 2.23 μg L⁻¹). Our results allow a better understanding of the differences between the Andean and extra-Andean water bodies in Patagonia.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRN3038cInter-American Institute for Global Change Research  aSpecial grantcIAI-CONICET 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautumn 3abasins 3achlorophyll 3aevaporation 3alakes 3aland cover 3aoxygen 3apH 3arain 3arunoff 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atotal phosphorus 3aturbidity 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3awind 3awinter 3aAndes region 3aArgentina1 aSpetter, Carla V.1 aSeitz, Carina1 aPiccolo, M.

We focused on anti-inflammatory activity of SAL-2 which was determined by its ability to suppress COX-2 and iNOS gene expression through suppression of NF-κB and redox regulation. We found that SAL-2 effectively inhibited HNE-induced reactive species generation, while upregulated GSH/GSSG ratio. Prostagrandin (PG) E2 production stimulated by arachidonic acid was suppressed by SAL-2. SAL-2 also downregulated COX-2 and iNOS expression induced by HNE, but salicylate did not. We found that SAL-2 inhibited HNE-mediated IKK phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of p65 which are linked to NF-κB activation. Furthermore, SAL-2 inhibited HNE-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Collectively, SAL-2 inhibited COX-2 and iNOS gene expression through suppression of NF-κB leading to the inhibition of PGE₂ synthesis. Based on these data, we propose that with its combined effect on strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory action, SAL-2 can be a potent anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of inflammatory-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIKappaB kinase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aantioxidants 3aarachidonic acid 3aendothelial cells 3agene expression 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphorylation 3aprostaglandin synthase 3arats 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aSung, Bokyung1 aJang, Eun Ji1 aKim, Dae Hyun1 aPark, Chan Hum1 aChoi, Yeon Ja1 aHa, Young Mi1 aKim, Mi Kyung1 aKim, Nam Deuk1 aYu, Byung Pal1 aChung, Hae Young0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2013 July, v. 36, no. 7 p.880-889dSpringer-Verlagx0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-013-0116-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016000167300001600327520122400343592002801567650003101595650002101626650001301647650001701660650002001677650003801697650001101735650001901746650001401765700002101779700002201800700002201822700001901844773011601863856008101979852000902060655001202069IND60574319420221116140501.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057431942DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838160700732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarutina, M.

The strength of promoters of various genes in the Corynebacterium glutamicum strain GEN1-2 (lys Cᴬ²⁷⁹ᵀ, S³¹⁷ᴬ), which contains aspartokinase (which is resistant to lysine) and threonine feedback inhibition were studied using this vector. It was found that promoters of the genes eftu, sod, cspB and leuC provide higher level of chloramphenicol resistance than promoters of the genes lysC, pyc, tkt, fbp, which are involved in the control of lysine biosynthesis. It was shown that replacement of the natural promotor ddh by the promotor sod increases the level of transcription almost by ten times, whereas the diaminopimelate dehydrogenase activity is increases by three to four times, which results in a 9% enhancement in lysine production. The investigated set of promoters with different strengths is a necessary tool for the optimization of gene activities and the construction of metabolite-producing strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aaspartate kinase 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3achloramphenicol 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 3alysine 3areporter genes 3athreonine1 aRaevskaya, N.

Combined with earlier studies, this observation confirmed an added mechanism of action was introduced by incorporation of the trimethylammonium cation and that C1-CBP-vancomycin exhibits activity against vancomycin-resistant organisms through two synergistic mechanisms of action, both independent of d-Ala-d-Ala/d-Lac binding. New insights into this added mechanism of action, induced cell membrane permeabilization, can be inferred from studies that show added exogenous lipoteichoic acid reduces antimicrobial activity, rescues bacteria cell growth inhibition, and blocks induced cell permeabilization properties of C1-CBP-vancomycin, suggesting a direct binding interaction with embedded teichoic acid is responsible for the added mechanism of action and enhanced antimicrobial activity. Further studies indicate that the trimethylammonium cation does not introduce new liabilities in common pharmacological properties of the analogue and established that 3 is well tolerated in mice, displays substantial PK improvements over both vancomycin and CBP-vancomycin, and exhibits in vivo efficacy against a challenging multidrug-resistant and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strain that is representative of the resistant pathogens all fear will emerge in the general population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterococcus 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3acations 3acell growth 3acell membranes 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3agrowth retardation 3alipoteichoic acids 3amechanism of action 3amedicinal properties 3amembrane permeability 3amice 3amultiple drug resistance 3aorganic chemistry 3apathogens 3ateichoic acids 3avancomycin1 aIsley, Nicholas A.1 aOkano, Akinori1 aWeiss, William J.1 aBoger, Dale L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3966-33170 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Oct. 31, v. 85, no. 3 p.1365-1375dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b023143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012200162300001600284520135800300592002801658650001601686650001501702650001201717650001601729650002201745650002101767650002301788700002301811700002401834773009301858856007301951852000902024655001202033IND60408566820221119172215.0150909e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040856682DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.124822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Anurag A.10aOn the study of plant defence and herbivory using comparative approaches: how important are secondary plant compounds  ap. 985-991.  aSpecies comparisons are a cornerstone of biology and there is a long tradition of using the comparative framework to study the ecology and evolution of plant defensive traits. Early comparative studies led to the hypothesis that plant chemistry plays a central role in plant defence, and the evolution of plant secondary chemistry in response to insect herbivory remains a classic example of coevolution. However, recent comparative work has disagreed with this paradigm, reporting little connection between plant secondary chemicals and herbivory across distantly related plant taxa. One conclusion of this new work is that the importance of secondary chemistry in plant defence may have been generally overstated in earlier research. Here, we attempt to reconcile these contradicting viewpoints on the role of plant chemistry in defence by critically evaluating the use and interpretation of species correlations as a means to study defence–herbivory relationships. We conclude that the notion that plant primary metabolites (e.g. leaf nitrogen content) are the principal determinants of herbivory (or the target of natural selection by herbivores) is not likely to be correct. Despite the inference of recent community‐wide studies of herbivory, strong evidence remains for a prime role of secondary compounds in plant defence against herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoevolution 3aherbivores 3ainsects 3ametabolites 3anatural selection 3anitrogen content 3aplant biochemistry1 aWeber, Marjorie G.1 aScherber, Christoph0 tEcology letters.g2015 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.985-991dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.124823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01536naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245012100162300001800283520050300301592002800804650002300832650002700855650002200882650002200904650001300926700001700939700005700956773013301013856007901146852000901225655001201234IND60683192620221117055024.0200207e20191021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068319262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b023442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuda, Shugo10aEpimerization-Free Preparation of C-Terminal Cys Peptide Acid by Fmoc SPPS Using Pseudoproline-Type Protecting Group  ap. 1674-1679.  aPreparation of C-terminal Cys-containing peptide acid by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is difficult due to base-mediated epimerization at Cys.

To assess whether mothers who had participated in the Nutrition at the Centre (N@C) project effectively demonstrated better EBF practices than did those who did not participate, we documented the processes of this nutritional intervention in Benin. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional design comparing the intervention group, namely, the Village Saving and Loan Association (VSLA-N@C), to the control group. The N@C project was an educational intervention based on behavioural and social changes related to nutrition. Through VSLA groups installed in communities, mothers were connected to the project; had weekly discussions around the process, benefits and challenges linked to EBF, and advocated during Breastfeeding Week celebrations. The study participants were mothers with children aged 4–5.5 months from the VSLA-N@C group (n = 53) and mothers (n = 50) from non-intervention areas who served as controls. With the deuterium oxide dose-to-mother technique, we quantified human milk intake (HMI) and non-milk oral intake (NMOI) and compared both groups using Student’s t-test. A child is considered to be exclusively breastfed if the NMOI is less than 86.6 g/day. Multivariate regression logistics adjusted for VSLA membership, mothers’ body mass index, and children’s age, weight-for-age and weight-for-length, thus enabling us to measure differences in EBF rates. RESULTS: Children of mothers from the VSLA-N@C group consumed significantly more human milk than those of mothers in the control group (900.2 ± 152.5 g/day vs 842.2 ± 188.6 g/day, P = 0.044). Children in the VSLA-N@C group had significantly less non-milk oral intake than did those in the control group (difference: 148.2 g/day, P = 0.000). Therefore, the EBF rate was significantly higher in the VSLA group (38% vs 8%, P < 0.0001), and mothers in VSLAs were 14 times more likely to practise EBF than were those in the control group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 13.9, 95% CI 1.9–116.5, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: The EBF rate was significantly higher in the group of mothers who participated in the VSLA-N@C project than in those who did not receive the intervention. The N@C model could be promoted as a strategy for increasing EBF practices in poor and rural contexts, where it is possible to organize mothers into VSLA groups to discuss the process, benefits and challenges of EBF.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3acelebrations 3achildren 3adeuterium oxide 3amilk consumption 3amodels 3amothers 3anutritional intervention 3aodds ratio 3asocial change 3at-test 3avillages 3awomen 3aBenin1 aHounkpatin, Waliou Amoussa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2902-82481 aIdohou-Dossou, Nicole0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2020 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.58-58dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-020-00302-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245018600164300001800350520099500368592002801363650003501391650002501426650002101451650002001472650001901492650001301511650003401524650002401558700002101582700002901603700002401632773012701656856007401783852000901857655001201866IND60656757220221121235552.0190814e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065675722DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay00176a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, Seyed Reza10aOn-line surfactant-based extraction using ion-pair microparticles combined with ICP-OES for simultaneous preconcentration and determination of rare earth elements in aqueous samples  ap. 3694-3699.  aWe have developed an on-line and in situ method for the extraction and preconcentration of rare earth elements prior to their determination by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide and the chelator PAN are first added to the aqueous sample, followed by hexafluorophosphate (acting as an ion-pairing agent), upon which solutions turn cloudy due to formation of an ion pair between the surfactant and hexafluorophosphate. The solid microparticles were passed through a microcolumn filter of μm pore size, and the adsorbed microparticles (containing the REE–PAN complex) were then eluted with acid which was directly introduced into the ICP-OES nebulizer. Several factors affecting the preconcentration and determination steps were optimized. Under the optimized conditions and preconcentration of 20 mL of sample, the enhancement factors of 90–102 and the detection limits of 0.02–1 μg L⁻¹ were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acationic surfactants 3achelating agents 3adetection limit 3amicroparticles 3aporosity 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3arare earth elements1 aZolfonoun, Ehsan1 aPourjavid, Mohammad Reza1 aAhmadi, Seyed Javad0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 May 15, v. 6, no. 11 p.3694-3699dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00176a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245016900169300001800338520107200356592002801428650001601456650001401472650002301486650002001509650001501529650001801544650001101562650002201573650002201595650001601617650001301633700006001646773013301706856007901839852000901918655001201927IND60683192720221117054055.0200207e20191227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068319272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b023452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGisemba, Solomon A.10aOptimized Ring Closing Metathesis Reaction Conditions To Suppress Desallyl Side Products in the Solid-Phase Synthesis of Cyclic Peptides Involving Tyrosine(O-allyl)  ap. 1407-1415.  aWe are exploring constraining aromatic residues in the kappa opioid receptor selective antagonist arodyn (Ac[Phe¹,²,³,Arg⁴,d-Ala⁸]dynorphin A(1-11)-NH₂) by ring closing metathesis (RCM) involving tyrosine(O-allyl) (Tyr(All)), but desallyl products limited the yields of the desired cyclic peptide. The model dipeptide Fmoc-Tyr(All)-Tyr(All) was used to explore different reaction conditions, including the use of isomerization suppressants, to minimize formation of the desallyl products and enhance formation of the desired RCM product. Reaction conditions were identified that enhanced the RCM product yield while suppressing desallyl products using both second-generation Grubbs and second-generation Hoveyda–Grubbs catalysts. These optimized reaction conditions were then applied to the cyclization of a tripeptide and an arodyn analog resulting in ≥70% conversion to the desired cyclic peptides. These strategies should be applicable to RCM involving Tyr(All) and similar residues in peptide and peptidomimetic cyclizations performed on solid phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3acyclic peptides 3adipeptides 3aisomerization 3amodels 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3atripeptides 3atyrosine1 aAldrich, Jane V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7954-98500 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Dec. 27, v. 85, no. 3 p.1407-1415dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b023453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245019100192300001400383520108700397650003201484650002101516650002501537650001601562650001901578650002201597650002601619650001301645650002001658650001501678650002101693650001301714650001601727650002001743650002401763650002301787650004101810650003301851650003101884650006101915650005401976650002002030650002802050650002102078650002802099650003902127650004802166650002702214650003402241653002602275653002602301653002002327653002302347700002202370700002202392700001902414700002202433773012102455852000902576856009202585930003302677946001102710655001202721IND4399298220221121172650.0071223e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439929822DNAL7 a181773072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.01022.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Tomoki10aCloning of a cDNA encoding a NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase involved in oxalic acid metabolism from the white-rot fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and its gene expression analysis  ap. 64-70.  aThe authors have proposed previously that intracellular degradation of oxalic acid via formate to CO₂ occurs in the white-rot fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora. The formate degradation is catalyzed by NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase (CsFDH). In this study, two cDNAs named CsFDH1 and CsFDH2 encoding CsFDH were cloned. Each cDNA consisting of 1077 bp encodes a mature protein composed of 358 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequences of the deduced CsFDH1 and CsFDH2 showed 99% identity to each other. The predicted molecular mass for each was 39.3 kDa, which was similar to that of CsFDH purified from the vegetative mycelia of Ceriporiopsis subvermispora (purified-CsFDH). The recombinant CsFDH1 and CsFDH2 expressed by Escherichia coli showed FDH activity with similar characteristics to the purified CsFDH. However, the amount of CsFDH1 transcript from the vegetative mycelia was 236-691 times greater than that of CsFDH2. Therefore, the results strongly suggest that CsFDH1, as compared with CsFDH2, predominantly contributes to the production of the purified CsFDH. 3aCeriporiopsis subvermispora 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acarbon dioxide 3acomplementary DNA 3aformate dehydrogenase 3aformates 3agene expression 3ametabolism 3amolecular weight 3amycelium 3aoxalic acid 3awhite-rot fungi 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFormate Dehydrogenasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aOxalic Acidxmetabolism 2aPolyporalesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0aformate dehydrogenase 0aoxalate dacarboxylase 0aoxalate oxidase 0awood-rotting fungi1 aFujiwara, Tadashi1 aUmezawa, Toshiaki1 aShimada, Mikio1 aHattori, Takefumi0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Feb., v. 279, no. 1 p.64-70dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.01022.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02242naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015700129300001800286500001500304520114100319650001701460650001801477650002201495650001901517650001801536650003601554650002301590653001501613653001101628653001101639700001601650700001801666700001301684773009301697852000901790930003301799945001301832946001101845655001201856IND2050896720221121172713.0960419e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205089672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZazimalova, E.14aThe effect of auxin starvation on the growth of auxin-dependent tobacco cell culture: dynamics of auxin-binding activity and endogenous free IAA content  ap. 1205-1213.  a2019-12-05  aThe growth of a cell strain derived from the stem pith of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L., cv. Virginia Bright Italia) was investigated in subcultures grown at various levels of synthetic auxins. Both partial and complete auxin starvation resulted in a decrease of the frequency of cell division. For these treatments the endogenous free indole-3-acetic acid content increased substantially at the commencement of the exponential growth phase. The possibility that the receptivity of the cells to auxin changed during the growth cycle was examined by measuring the activity of a membrane-bound auxin-binding site. In subcultures grown in a medium with an optimal auxin concentration the maximum auxin-binding activity was restricted to the end of the exponential growth phase. In the cells cultivated in partially or completely auxin-deprived media the auxin-binding activity increased to varying extents. These results probably reflect mechanisms controlling both the intracellular content of free auxin and the sensitivity of the cells to exogenous auxin supply (including auxin binding) with respect to the cell division and/or growth. 3acell culture 3acell division 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acell membranes 3abinding sites 3achemical constituents of plants 3aindole acetic acid 0adeficiency 0aauxins 0agrowth1 aOpatrny, Z.1 aBrezinova, A.1 aEder, J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1995 Sept., v. 46, no. 290 p.1205-1213x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03019naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001600165245017200181300001800353500002400371500001500395520097700410650002401387650002101411650002301432650002501455650001301480650002501493650002201518650001401540650002001554650001301574650001301587650002001600650002301620650002501643650002801668650002301696650003601719650002201755650005301777650002201830650003501852653002501887653001201912653002801924700001601952700001401968700001801982700001702000700001402017700001802031773016302049852000902212856007702221930003302298945002502331946001302356655001202369IND4408133420221121172716.0080722e20080625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440813342DNAL7 a185008132pmid7 a10.1021/jf800109a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aFlurkey, A.10aEnzyme, Protein, Carbohydrate, and Phenolic Contaminants in Commercial Tyrosinase Preparations: Potential Problems Affecting Tyrosinase Activity and Inhibition Studies  ap. 4760-4768.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCommercial mushroom tyrosinase contains other proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, and phenolic material besides tyrosinase.

Enzyme assays identified the presence of tyrosinase, laccase, β-glucosidase, β-galactosidase, β-xylosidase, cellulase, chitinase, xylanase, and mannanase in the commercial tyrosinase. Protein sequencing indicated the presence of tyrosinase, a lectin, and a putative mannanase as well as 10 unidentified protein/peptides in the commercial tyrosinase preparations. Characteristics of tyrosinase isoforms were similar in two different commercial tyrosinase sources. Inhibition studies indicated that I50 values for some tyrosinase inhibitors were different when the crude powder was compared to a partially purified tyrosinase. The presence of these contaminants has the potential to affect studies using commercial tyrosinase. 3aexperimental design 3acatechol oxidase 3afood contamination 3acarbohydrate content 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme inhibitors 3amushrooms 3aprotein content 3aisozymes 3aaccuracy 3aenzyme activity 3aphenolic compounds 2aAgaricusxenzymology 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aDrug Contamination 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aEnzymesxanalysis 2aMonophenol Monooxygenasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aProteinsxanalysisxchemistry. 0achemical composition 0aenzymes 0amolecular sequence data1 aCooksey, J.1 aReddy, A.1 aSpoonmore, K.1 aRescigno, A.1 aInlow, J.1 aFlurkey, W.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 June 25, v. 56, no. 12 p.4760-4768dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf800109a3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090428b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle02150naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245012600171300001600297500002400313520117300337650001301510650001601523650001401539650001301553650001201566651002101578700001701599700002201616700001801638773010401656852000901760856005501769655001201824IND4460547420221121172717.0110729e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446054742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.01005.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Kyeong Mi12aA New agarophyte species, gelidium eucorneum sp. nov.

Although the taxonomy of Gelidium has been the focus of many published studies, there is still a need to reevaluate species-level diversity. Herein, we describe Gelidium eucorneum sp. nov. based on specimens collected off Geojedo on the southern coast of Korea. G. eucorneum is distinguished by cartilaginous thalli with brush-like haptera, rhizoidal filaments concentrated in the medulla, and globose cytocarps that are horned with multiple determinate branchlets. The species occurs in wave-exposed intertidal sites, sometimes in association with other mat-forming algae. Phylogenetic analyses (rbcL, psaA, and cox1) reveal that G. eucorneum is unique and clearly distinct from other species of the genus. The clade containing Gelidium vagum and Acanthopeltis longiramulosa was resolved as a sister group to G. eucorneum. We suggest that the diverse morphologies of G. eucorneum, G. vagum, and Acanthopeltis developed from a common ancestor in East Asian waters. This study shows that even in well-studied areas, more agarophyte species are to be added to the world inventory of red algae. 3aGelidium 3ainventories 3aphylogeny 3ataxonomy 3athallus 3aKorean Peninsula1 aHwang, Il Ki1 aPark, Jeong Kwang1 aBoo, Sung Min0 tJournal of phycology.g2011 Aug., v. 47, no. 4 p.904-910dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.01005.x 7aarticle03462naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001500165245011900180300001800299500002400317500001500341520137500356650001601731650002101747650001801768650002201786650002101808650002001829650001701849650001401866650001101880650001601891650002501907650001701932650002501949650002101974650002301995650001402018650003002032650004202062650002802104650002602132650005902158650002202217650001502239650001102254650002902265650004002294650002802334653003102362653002802393700001502421700001502436700001702451773016302468852000902631856007702640930003302717945002502750946001302775655001202788IND4408134120221121134444.0080722e20080625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440813412DNAL7 a185224052pmid7 a10.1021/jf800175a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aJuan, M.E.10aResveratrol Induces Apoptosis through ROS-Dependent Mitochondria Pathway in HT-29 Human Colorectal Carcinoma Cells  ap. 4813-4818.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  atrans-Resveratrol is a polyphenol found in blueberries, grapes, and wine with cancer chemopreventive properties. The low bioavailability of this compound enhances its concentration in the luminal content and becomes a potential chemopreventive agent against colon cancer. In the present study, the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on the human colorectal carcinoma HT-29 cells as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects were examined. Proliferation, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis were measured by fluorescence-based techniques. Studies of dose-dependent effects of trans-resveratrol showed antiproliferative activity with an EC50 value of 78.9 5.4 μM. Caspase-3 was activated in a dose-dependent manner after incubation for 24 h giving an EC50 value of 276.1 1.7 μM. Apoptosis was also confirmed with microscopic observation of changes in membrane permeability and detection of DNA fragmentation. The activity of trans-resveratrol on the mitochondria apoptosis pathway was evidenced by the production of superoxide anions in the mitochondria of cells undergoing apoptosis. In conclusion, trans-resveratrol inhibits cell proliferation without cytotoxicity and induces apoptosis in HT-29. Results of the present study provide evidence demonstrating the antitumor effect of trans-resveratrol via a ROS-dependent apoptosis pathway in colorectal carcinoma. 3apolyphenols 3ahuman cell lines 3adose response 3aDNA fragmentation 3aoxidative stress 3abioavailability 3acytotoxicity 3acarcinoma 3adosage 3aresveratrol 3abiochemical pathways 3amitochondria 3acolorectal neoplasms 3asuperoxide anion 3acell proliferation 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aHT29 Cells 2aHumans 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aStilbenesxpharmacology 0aeffective concentration 50 0areactive oxygen species1 aWenzel, U.1 aDaniel, H.1 aPlanas, J.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 June 25, v. 56, no. 12 p.4813-4818dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf800175a3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090427b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle03368naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001500191245011100206300001800317500002400335520145300359650001301812650000901825650002501834650002701859650002501886650002601911650002301937650002301960650001601983650002701999650002802026650002802054650001702082650001202099650003702111650003002148650001402178650004402192650005202236650001902288650002202307650005402329653002102383653001402404700001202418700001902430700002102449773012302470852000902593856006902602930003302671945002502704946001302729655001202742IND4383474920140723000000.0060911e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438347492DNAL7 a169028182pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-006-9147-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF821 0aF6001 aRostas, M.10aFungal Infection Reduces Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles of Maize but does not Affect Naïve Parasitoids  ap. 1897-1909.  aIncludes references  aPlants attacked by insects release volatile compounds that attract the herbivores' natural enemies. This so-called indirect defense is plastic and may be affected by an array of biotic and abiotic factors. We investigated the effect of fungal infection as a biotic stress agent on the emission of herbivore-induced volatiles and the possible consequences for the attraction of two parasitoid species. Maize seedlings that were simultaneously attacked by the fungus Setosphaeria turcica and larvae of Spodoptera littoralis emitted a blend of volatiles that was qualitatively similar to the blend emitted by maize that was damaged by only the herbivore, but there was a clear quantitative difference. When simultaneously challenged by fungus and herbivore, the maize plants emitted in total 47% less of the volatiles. Emissions of green leaf volatiles were unaffected. In a six-arm olfactometer, the parasitoids Cotesia marginiventris and Microplitis rufiventris responded equally well to odors of herbivore-damaged and fungus- and herbivore-damaged maize plants. Healthy and fungus-infected plants were not attractive. An additional experiment showed that the performance of S. littoralis caterpillars was not affected by the presence of the pathogen, nor was there an effect on larvae of M. rufiventris developing inside the caterpillars. Our results confirm previous indications that naïve wasps may respond primarily to the green leaf volatiles. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aphytophagous insects 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3ainduced resistance 3avolatile compounds 3aparasitoids 3aCotesia marginiventris 3aMicroplitis rufiventris 3atritrophic interactions 3aolfactometry 2aAnimals 2aLarvaxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aLepidopteraxparasitology 2aOdorants. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aSpodopteraxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aVolatilization 2aWaspsxphysiology 2aZea maysxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 0aindirect defense 0acorn odor1 aTon, J.1 aMauch-Mani, B.1 aTurlings, T.C.J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2006 Sept., v. 32, no. 9 p.1897-1909dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-006-9147-33electronic resource  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/03/07  aOther US 7aarticle02729naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245016900190300001600359520098900375650002801364650002601392650001401418650001001432650001901442650001101461650001801472650001301490650001301503650001401516650005601530650002001586650004101606650004401647650007301691650007101764653001101835653002001846653002101866700002101887700002701908700001901935773012401954852000902078856009202087930003302179946001102212655001202223IND4393611020221121101418.0070729e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439361102DNAL7 a176637052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00825.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManteca, Angel10aAerial hyphae in surface cultures of Streptomyces lividans and Streptomyces coelicolor originate from viable segments surviving an early programmed cell death event  ap. 118-125.  aMorphogenesis in streptomycetes is characterized by the formation of aerial hyphae that emerge from the substrate mycelium. Despite many years of study, a detailed picture of the events that occur during the transition from substrate to aerial mycelium has yet to be defined. In this paper, it was shown that a specific cell death event takes place during early growth of the substrate mycelium in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans. Subsequently, a second mycelium starts to develop from the remaining viable segments of these substrate hyphae in the form of islands, which progressively cover the plate surface. Interestingly, the genes coding for the chaplin and rodlin proteins, which are involved in the formation of the hydrophobic layer characteristic of aerial structures, are specifically expressed in the second mycelium islands, strongly suggesting that this second mycelium should be considered the early precursor of the mature hydrophobic aerial mycelium. 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3aStreptomyces lividans 3aapoptosis 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3ahyphae 3amorphogenesis 3amycelium 3aproteins 2aApoptosis 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxanalysis 2aSpores, Bacterialxgrowth & development 2aStreptomyces coelicolorxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aStreptomyces lividansxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 0arodlet 0aaerial mycelium 0asurface cultures1 aClaessen, Dennis1 aLopez-Iglesias, Carmen1 aSanchez, Jesus0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2007 Sept., v. 274, no. 1 p.118-125dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00825.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03666naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100001400183245008200197300001800279500002400297520146300321650002201784650001001806650001601816650001801832650001701850650001601867650002101883650002301904650002101927650002401948650002001972650001601992650002302008650002502031650001502056650001302071650002502084650002002109650002702129650005202156650002602208650002902234650002102263650005402284650003902338650006202377650006402439650005402503650006102557700001402618700001502632700001302647773016302660852000902823856007702832930003302909945002502942946001302967655001202980IND4408134320221121075344.0080722e20080625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440813432DNAL7 a185224062pmid7 a10.1021/jf800795v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aF600 0aH0001 aYin, X.L.10aToxic Reactivity of Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Plants to Herbicide Isoproturon  ap. 4825-4831.  aIncludes references  aThe herbicide isoproturon is widely used for controlling weed/grass in agricultural practice. However, the side effect of isoproturon as contaminants on crops is unknown. In this study, we investigated isoproturon-induced oxidative stress in wheat (Triticum aestivum). The plants were grown in soils with isoproturon at 0-20 mg/kg and showed negative biological responses. The growth of wheat seedlings with isoproturon was inhibited. Chlorophyll content significantly decreased at the low concentration of isoproturon (2 mg/kg), suggesting that chlorophyll was rather sensitive to isoproturon exposure. The level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), an indicator of cellular peroxidation, showed an increase, indicating oxidative damage to plants. The isoproturon-induced oxidative stress resulted in a substantial change in activities of the majority of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Activities of the antioxidant enzymes showed a general increase at low isoproturon concentrations and a decrease at high isoproturon concentrations. Activities of CAT in leaves showed progressive suppression under the isoproturon exposure. Analysis of nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) confirmed these results. We also tested the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and observed the activity stimulated by isoproturon at 2-10 mg/kg. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aisoproturon 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant damage 3agrass weeds 3aoxidative stress 3aherbicide residues 3aresidual effects 3anontarget organisms 3aseedling growth 3achlorophyll 3alipid peroxidation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aperoxidase 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aenzyme activity 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aCatalasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aOxidative Stress 2aPeroxidasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aPhenylurea Compoundsxpharmacology 2aSeedlingsxchemistryxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substancesxanalysis 2aTriticumxchemistryxdrug effectsxgrowth & development.1 aJiang, L.1 aSong, N.H.1 aYang, H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 June 25, v. 56, no. 12 p.4825-4831dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf800795v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090428b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle02935naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245006000174300001400234500013500248520131600383650002001699650001701719650002901736650001301765650000901778650001901787650001401806650001201820650001701832650001001849650001701859650001601876650001101892650001301903650001101916650001101927650002501938650001201963650002001975650000901995650001102004650001702015650001002032651002402042651001502066651001002081651002502091700001802116700001502134773013502149856005502284961000902339852000902348655001202357IND60656364920221121060745.0190812s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065636492DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1241.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrendranath, R.10aChalta (Dillenia indica Linn.): an untouched fruit crop  ap. 65-68.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Underutilized Plant Species held August 5, 2015, Maduarai, Tamil Nadu, India  aDillenia indica Linn. (syn. P. lanigerum; chalta in Bangla; Family Dilleniaceae) is an evergreen large shrub or small to medium-sized tree that grows all over the NE states, especially Tripura and Bangladesh. Named after Johann Jacob Dillenius, a German botanist, Dillenia is a genus of about 100 species of flowering plants in tropical and subtropical trees of southern Asia, Australasia, and the Indian Ocean Islands. However, up to now, only eight Dillenia species have been reported to be used traditionally for different medical purposes including treatment of cancerous growth. Medicinal properties of the fruit juices of D. indica are manifold, as a cooling beverage to treat fever and to relieve fatigue. Although mainly a source of food for elephants and monkeys, the ripped fruits are taken orally to increase appetite and overcome weakness, as laxative and medication for abdominal pain. Native communities in Mizoram, India, have used the fruits of the plant as a remedy for jaundice. All the plant parts viz., leaves, bark, fruit, fruit peel, etc. all have proven medicinal properties against most of the common ailments including anti-cancer and anti-microbial properties. Some of the major compounds with medicinal and nutritive value are lupeol, betulinaldehyde, betulinic acid and stigmasterol. 3aDillenia indica 3aElephantidae 3aantimicrobial properties 3aappetite 3abark 3abetulinic acid 3abeverages 3acooling 3adrug therapy 3afever 3afruit juices 3afruit peels 3afruits 3ajaundice 3aleaves 3alupeol 3amedicinal properties 3amonkeys 3anutritive value 3apain 3ashrubs 3astigmasterol 3atrees 3aAustralasian region 3aBangladesh 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean Islands1 aNashipudi, R.1 aHarita, K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1241 p.65-68dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1241.10  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002100161245012900182300001600311500002400327520115400351650005301505650001401558650001801572650001001590650000901600650000901609650001601618650001701634650001101651650001101662650000901673650001101682650001001693650000901703650000901712650001401721650002001735650001401755650002401769650001301793650001501806650001301821650001501834650000901849650000901858650001101867650001401878650000901892650001601901650003501917650001701952651002101969651002501990700001902015700002002034773011102054852000902165856004502174655001202219IND4416753220221121060747.0090220e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441675322DNAL7 a190511872pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2008001782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Hyun Kyung10aExploratory correlations of dietary nutrients with prostate cancer mortality using over two decades of observations in Korea  ap. 185-190.  aIncludes references  aProstate cancer is now the eighth leading cause of cancer mortality among Korean males. We investigated the relationship between various nutrients in the diet and prostate cancer deaths. Nutrient intake data were obtained from the Korean Nutrition Survey between 1963 and 1995 and the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey since 1998. Prostate cancer mortality rates for these time periods were obtained from the National Statistics Office. The correlations between different nutrients in the diet and mortality were calculated using Spearman's rank correlation analysis with a lag period. Carbohydrates and grains showed significant negative correlations while protein, fat, iron, and riboflavin, and the food groups including fruits, seafood, seasonings and drinks, meat, eggs, fish, and milk showed significant positive correlations. In addition, the correlation results for age-specific rates virtually coincided with the crude rate correlations. However, we urge caution in interpreting these results because they could merely be a consequence of the changing patterns of food consumption and the recording of deaths in Korea. 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abeverages 3acarbohydrates 3adeath 3aeggs 3afish 3afood groups 3afood records 3afruits 3agrains 3airon 3alipids 3amales 3ameat 3amilk 3amortality 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aproteins 3ariboflavin 3aseafoods 3astatistics 2aAged 2aDiet 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxmortality 2aTime Factors 3aKorean Peninsula 0aKoreaxepidemiology.1 aKim, Chae Yoon1 aLee, Seung Wook0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2009 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 p.185-190dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200800178 7aarticle04626naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245011700173300001400290500013500304520264900439650001803088650001203106650001803118650001203136650001603148650001303164650001903177650001503196650002003211650001403231650002103245650000903266650002403275650002003299650001603319650001803335650001203353650001103365650001503376650001703391650000903408650002503417650000903442650001203451650000903463650002203472650001603494650002103510650001703531650001603548650001303564650001003577650001603587650001303603650001603616651001003632700001503642700001603657700001803673700001703691773013503708856005503843961000903898852000903907655001203916IND60656365020221121045427.0190812s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065636502DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1241.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalanisamy, A.10aPotential vegetable crops - need for exploration and conservation for nutritional security for rural livelihoods  ap. 69-74.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Underutilized Plant Species held August 5, 2015, Maduarai, Tamil Nadu, India  aUnderexploited vegetables are known to play a major role in the nutritional livelihood of the Indian population especially in the rural areas where people cannot pay for meat, egg and milk. They are minor, neglected potential crops but not fully exploited for nutritional security, health, poverty alleviation and providing daily diet. In the face of threats posed by climate change as exemplified by drastic changes in rainfall pattern, temperature, relative humidity, radiation, weeds-pests-diseases complex and general alterations in the trends of climatic elements, there is the need to discuss the future of the uncultivated but edible plant species which have served as basis of livelihood for the poor people over several years. Underexploited vegetable crops have many uses like quick, easy to grow and hardy in nature, these crops tolerate adverse climatic and soil conditions, they are a nutritionally rich source of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, protein, fats and protect from malnutrition deficiency disease in poor rural children mainly under the age limit of 3-4 years in India. Underexploited vegetable crops have a long history of local consumption and people are aware about their nutritional and medicinal properties. These are cheap and readily available. Cultivation of these crops is restricted to specialized geographical regions mainly by poor farming communities which derive their sustenance and livelihood from such plants. Evidently, these crops of widely consumed nutritious vegetables have been relatively neglected in research and conservation. In India 47% of children below the age of three years are malnourished or underweight, out of a global estimated total of 146 million, south Asia has the highest rates. Presently most of the research work is focused on more popular vegetables like tomato, chili, watermelon, cucumber, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, etc. Minor work is done on improvement of these underutilized vegetables. However, some preliminary work was carried out on improvement of these future vegetables and cultivars developed are discussed under different groups such as underutilized cucurbits, minor legumes, less leafy vegetables, solanaceous vegetables, tree vegetables and underutilized cole crops. This paper therefore discusses the diversity of underexploited vegetables in India by taking into account the available species, the uses, the mode of exploitation and the role that extension education can play in bringing these crops into cultivation, especially in this era of climate change in order to prevent them from extinction and provide nutritional security to rural people. 3aCucurbitaceae 3acabbage 3acarbohydrates 3acarrots 3acauliflower 3achildren 3aclimate change 3acole crops 3acrop production 3acucumbers 3adietary minerals 3aeggs 3aextension education 3afarming systems 3afood plants 3afood security 3alegumes 3alipids 3alivelihood 3amalnutrition 3ameat 3amedicinal properties 3amilk 3apoverty 3arain 3arelative humidity 3arural areas 3arural population 3asoil quality 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3atrees 3aunderweight 3avitamins 3awatermelons 3aIndia1 aKannan, D.1 aKavitha M.,1 aRavindran, C.1 aRajangam, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1241 p.69-74dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1241.11  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008400163300001600247500002400263520100400287650002501291650001801316650000901334650002101343650001601364650001501380650002301395650002401418650002701442650001401469650001201483650001401495650001101509650000901520653001801529653001501547653001801562653002101580700001701601700001801618773009801636852000901734856004801743655001201791IND4432993620221121034535.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443299362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-010-0020-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Z. -C.10aEfficient regeneration of Eucalyptus urophylla from seedling-derived hypocotyls  ap. 131-134.  aIncludes references  aSeedling hypocotyls were used as explants to establish a regeneration protocol for Eucalyptus urophylla and N-phenyl-N′-[6-(2-chlorobenzothiazol)-yl] urea (PBU), one kind of di-substituted urea, was found useful growth regulator.

(Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)  ap. 183-204.  aHypolimnas misippus, a sexually dimorphic, nymphalid butterfly with a very variable female, was sampled for 41 consecutive months, along with its supposed model, Danaus chrysippus (Danaidae), at Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Hypolimnas larvae collected in the field were reared to compare their range of variation with that of the wild adult population. Some breeding data are presented. Although I show that the colour variations in Danaus and Hypolimnas are remarkably similar, the frequency rankings of the analogous forms within each species differ markedly in the long term. Moreover, 24% of Hypolimnas are transitional forms which are poor mimics. As the range of variation at Dar es Salaam is similar to that reported from Ghana, where the “model” is of quite different appearance, I conclude that mimetic resemblance is not of over-riding importance to its maintenance and perpetuation. The continuous variation in both fore- and hindwing coloration in the field is reflected in reared broods which fail to segregate into discontinuous phenotypes so that H, misippus is not truly polymorphic at Dar es Salaam. Females with transitional forewings have white on their hindwings more often than do the two extreme phenotypes, misippus and inaria. Transitional or white winged females are abundant only at times of high population density, whereas inaria larvae seem to have an advantage in crowded conditions. The extreme rarity of association between the inaria forewing and white hindwing suggests disruptive selection, the former being associated with the conditions of K selection and the latter with r selection. The calculation of selection coefficients supports this interpretation. Phenotypic diversity is greatest at high population density when the proportion of poor mimics is also maximal. At these times, apostatic selection may be important. At low density, diversity is minimal. Recent evidence concerning the efficiency of D. chrysippus as a model is discussed.

NFR activity was found associated with 9000g (20 min) and 110000g (1 h) sediments, purified plasma membrane and 110000g supernatants. No differences were observed between the properties of reductases from Fe-starved versus Fe-sufficient roots. The characterization of NFR was undertaken. Low Mr forms (46 and 28 kDa, as detected by size-exclusion chromatography) were present in all fractions whereas 210 and 110 kDa forms were unique in membranes and 110000g supernatants, respectively. The 210 kDa form was solubilized from microsomes and characterized. The enzyme is acetone-resistant and appears to be comprised largely if not totally of the low Mr forms (46 and 28 kDa, corresponding to 30 and 32kDa bands, respectively, in SDS-PAGE). The 210 kDa form tended to break down to subunits following dilution, and the effect could be prevented by addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol. A three-step purification procedure for microsomal NFR was devised, consisting of acetone fractionation of lysophosphatidylcholine solubilized microsomes, Blue Sepharose CL-6B affinity chromatography and a final size exclusion chromatography in the absence of detergent, resulting in a 700-fold purification of the 28 kDa protein. The best electron acceptor for the purified 28 kDa form was ferricyanide (400 micromole min-1 mg-1 protein) followed by Fe3+-chelates (up to 200 micromole min-1 mg-1 protein) and other compounds to a lesser extent (cyt c, DCPIP). The 46 kDa form, on the other hand, had high ferricyanide reductase activity (about 300 micromole min-1 mg-1 protein) and relatively low Fe3+-chelate reductase activity. The properties of NFR (high Mr active forms, donor and acceptor specificity, purification behaviour, large hydrophilic domains, size of subunits) suggest a relationship with the NADH-cyt b5 reductase family of FAD-containing proteins. None of the latter flavoproteins is a transmembrane enzyme. 3aZea mays 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3abiochemical polymorphism 3achelates 3aelectron transfer 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aoxidoreductases 3aanions 3aplasma membrane 3amolecular weight 3aroots 3aenzyme activity 0apurification 0atrace element deficiencies 0aferricyanide reductase 0aferric ions 0aferricyanide 0atrace elements1 aPupillo, P.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1995 Oct., v. 46, no. 291 p.1497-1503x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03572naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001400185245018700199300001600386500002400402520208100426650001502507650001102522650001702533650001702550650002102567650001402588650002002602650001302622650002902635650002102664650001502685650001802700650004302718700001502761700001602776700001502792773012002807852000902927856007302936930003303009945002503042946001103067655001203078IND4383479320221121023758.0060911e20060823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438347932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM310 0aL810 0aL600 0aM0011 aLance, E.10aInteractions between cyanobacteria and Gastropods: I. Ingestion of toxic Planktothrix agardhii by Lymnaea stagnalis and the kinetics of microcystin bioaccumulation and detoxification  ap. 140-148.  aIncludes references  aThe last two decades have been marked by an increasing occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in aquatic ecosystems. These pose an expanding threat to the environment and to human health. Among the intracellular toxins produced by cyanobacteria, microcystins (hepatotoxins) are the most frequent and widely studied. As an ubiquitous herbivore living in eutrophic freshwaters, the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis (Gastropoda: Pulmonata) is particularly exposed to cyanobacteria. The toxic filamentous Planktothrix agardhii is common in temperate lakes and is, therefore, a potential food resource for gastropods. We have studied the consumption of P. agardhii by L. stagnalis juveniles and adults in the presence or absence of non-toxic food (lettuce) over a 5-weeks period. Intoxication was followed by a 3-week detoxification period when snails were fed only on lettuce. The kinetics of microcystin accumulation and detoxification in the gastropods were established using the ELISA analytical method. The results showed an ingestion of toxic P. agardhii by L. stagnalis, even in the presence of lettuce, and the absence of food selection regardless of the age of the snails. Juveniles and adults consumed the same number of cells per millilitre and consumption was proportional to food availability. On average, 63% of cyanobacteria available were taken up during the first 24 h. After 5 weeks of intoxication, 61% of the toxins present in the ingested cyanobacterial cells had accumulated in snail tissues (95% in the digestive-genital gland complex) with a concentration up to 80.4 ± 4.9 μg g DW-1. Toxin accumulation was greater in the gastropods fed on P. agardhii alone than those fed on the mixed diet, and was also greater in juveniles than in adults. After the removal of toxic cyanobacteria, detoxification was rapid: 64% of the toxins disappeared from snail tissues during the first week, but microcystins were still detected after 3 weeks (on average, 3.5 ± 0.9 μg g DW-1). These results are discussed in terms of potential contamination to the food web. 3aGastropoda 3asnails 3amicrocystins 3ahepatotoxins 3adietary exposure 3aingestion 3abioaccumulation 3akinetics 3ametabolic detoxification 3afeeding behavior 3afood chain 3agrowth models 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography1 aBrient, L.1 aBormans, M.1 aGerard, C.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2006 Aug. 23, v. 79, no. 2 p.140-148dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.06.0043electronic resource  a20070110b20070202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/01/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02119naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245008600201300001800287506007600305520065200381506003701033650000801070650001101078650001801089650001601107650001201123650001301135650001701148650001201165650001401177650001401191650001201205700001401217700001901231700001801250700001701268700001801285700002301303773017301326852000901499856008301508930003301591946001301624655001201637IND4432982520221207133404.0100220e20100216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443298252DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09147061072doi7 aPMC28402852pmcid7 a201337662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Paul M.10aAspartate racemase, generating neuronal D-aspartate, regulates adult neurogenesis  ap. 3175-3179.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aD-Aspartic acid is abundant in the developing brain. We have identified and cloned mammalian aspartate racemase (DR), which converts L-aspartate to D-aspartate and colocalizes with D-aspartate in the brain and neuroendocrine tissues. Depletion of DR by retrovirus-mediated expression of short-hairpin RNA in newborn neurons of the adult hippocampus elicits profound defects in the dendritic development and survival of newborn neurons and survival. Because D-aspartate is a potential endogenous ligand for NMDA receptors, the loss of which elicits a phenotype resembling DR depletion, D-aspartate may function as a modulator of adult neurogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aadults 3aaspartic acid 3ahippocampus 3amammals 3aneonates 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3atissues1 aDuan, Xin1 aHuang, Alex S.1 aLiu, Cindy Y.1 aMing, Guo-li1 aSong, Hongjun1 aSnyder, Solomon H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 16, v. 107, no. 7 p.3175-3179dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09147061073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03278naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001400176245013200190300001600322500002400338500001500362520193900377650001402316650003502330650001702365650001502382650001402397650001902411650001202430650002102442653002102463700001902484700001702503700001402520700001502534773012002549852000902669856007302678930003302751945002502784946001102809655001202820IND4383479720221121014247.0060911e20060823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438347972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aM0011 aJolly, C.10aDevelopment of a stickleback kidney cell culture assay for the screening of androgenic and anti-androgenic endocrine disrupters  ap. 158-166.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIssues raised by the presence in the environment of chemicals able to mimic or antagonize the action of androgenic hormones are of growing concern. Here we report the development of a novel in vitro test for the screening of (anti-)androgenic chemicals, based on primary cultures of stickleback kidney cells that produce a protein, the spiggin, in response to androgenic stimulation. Cell spiggin content was measured by ELISA. Comparison between cell cultures from quiescent males, photoperiodically stimulated males, control females and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-primed females led to the selection of cell cultures from DHT-primed females for the development of a standardized protocol. 48 h of treatment with androgens proved to be sufficient to induce concentration-dependent increase in spiggin cell content with a high sensitivity. DHT induced a significant spiggin increase at 10-12 M, while testosterone (T) and the teleost specific androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) had a significant effect at 10-10 M. Maximal responses were obtained with 10-8 M DHT and 10-6 M T and 11-KT. This indicates a higher sensitivity to DHT than to T and 11-KT, in agreement with previous data on stickleback kidney androgen receptor affinity. No effect was observed with other steroids or thyroid hormone, indicating the androgen specificity of the test. The anabolic steroid 17β-Trenbolone (TB) was able to stimulate spiggin synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner with a significant effect at a concentration as low as 10-10 M, and a maximal effect at 10-6 M. The synthetic human androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide had no effect alone, but concentration-dependently inhibited the stimulatory effect of 10-8 M 11-KT with a complete inhibition at 10-6 M flutamide. This cell culture system provides an innovative tool for the rapid and sensitive screening of androgenic and anti-androgenic properties of environmental contaminants. 3aandrogens 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3acell culture 3apollutants 3abioassays 3aGasterosteidae 3akidneys 3atoxicity testing 0ain vitro culture1 aKatsiadaki, I.1 aLe Belle, N.1 aMayer, I.1 aDufour, S.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2006 Aug. 23, v. 79, no. 2 p.158-166dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.06.0053electronic resource  a20070111b20070202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/01/11  aNon-US 7aarticle04032naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100001400201245017300215300001600388500002400404500001500428520190000443650002402343650003002367650001802397650001802415650001802433650002202451650001702473650002502490650002002515650002502535650002002560650001102580650002402591650001202615650001402627650001802641650002302659650003002682650002302712650003302735650003202768650005802800650002802858650004602886650005202932650003402984653003203018653002803050700001403078773011803092852000903210856007003219930003303289945002503322946001103347655001203358IND4383479120221120232122.0060911e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438347912DNAL7 a169352202pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL200 0aL001 0aL6001 aZhang, J.10aCharacterization of a chitin synthase cDNA and its increased mRNA level associated with decreased chitin synthesis in Anopheles quadrimaculatus exposed to diflubenzuron  ap. 712-725.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aChitin synthase (EC 2.4.1.16) is a crucial enzyme responsible for chitin biosynthesis in all chitin-containing organisms. This paper reports a complete cDNA encoding chitin synthase 1 (AqCHS1), change of AqCHS1 mRNA level in response to diflubenzuron exposure, and concentration-dependent effect of diflubenzuron on chitin synthesis in the common malaria mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus). The cDNA consists of 5723 nucleotides, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 4734 nucleotides that encode 1578 amino acid residues and a non-translated region of 989 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence contains all the chitin synthase signature motifs (EDR, QRRRW and SWGTR) and shows 97% identity to that of An. gambiae (AgCHS1, XM_321337). Northern blot and real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed a significant increase of AqCHS1 mRNA level in the larvae exposed to diflubenzuron at 100 and 500 μg/L. As confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR, AqCHS1 mRNA level was enhanced by 2-fold in the larvae exposed to diflubenzuron at 500 μg/L for 24 h. In contrast, exposures of the larvae to diflubenzuron at 4.0, 20, 100 and 500 μg/L for 48 h resulted in decreases of chitin content by 9.0%, 43%, 58% and 76%, respectively. Significantly increased AqCHS1 mRNA level associated with decreased chitin synthesis may imply possible inhibition of chitin synthase, or abnormal chitin synthase translocation or chitin microfibril assembly conferred by diflubenzuron. Increased AqCHS1 expression due to increased transcription and/or increased mRNA stability may serve as a feedback mechanism to compensate such an effect in the mosquitoes. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the relationship between reduced chitin synthesis and increased expression of AqCHS1 in order to shed new light on trafficking and regulation of chitin biosynthesis in the mosquito affected by diflubenzuron. 3amechanism of action 3aAnopheles quadrimaculatus 3amessenger RNA 3adiflubenzuron 3adose response 3acomplementary DNA 3abiosynthesis 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3achitin synthase 3achitin 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnopheles 2aBase Sequence 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aChitin Synthasexgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysis 2aDiflubenzuronxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messengerxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0achitin synthesis inhibitors 0amolecular sequence data1 aZhu, K.Y.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2006 Sept., v. 36, no. 9 p.712-725dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.06.0023electronic resource  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01069naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245005900130300001200189520030000201650002700501650002600528650002200554650002200576650001200598650003200610773007400642852000900716939003300725945000800758946001300766655001200779991609410900742620221120232226.0930304e199210  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930009382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozoff, B.10aLong-term effects of iron deficiency anemia in infancy  ap. 1-2.  aThe author presents data on the effect of iron deficiency anemia on the behavior and development of infant's.

  1 aSlimestad, R.10aContent of chalconaringenin and chlorogenic acid in cherry tomatoes is strongly reduced during postharvest ripening  ap. 7251-7256.  aThe contents of chalconaringenin, chlorogenic acid, rutin, ascorbic acid, lycopene, and beta-carotene were analyzed during postharvest and vine ripening of cherry tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) (cv. Jennita) produced in a greenhouse. A remarkable decrease in the content of chalconaringenin took place during postharvest ripening. The tomatoes were found to contain 15.26 mg 100 g(-1) fresh weight (FW) at harvest but held only 0.41 mg after 3 weeks at 20 degrees C in darkness. Chalconaringenin did not convert into naringenin. The content of chlorogenic acid fell from 0.51 to 0.06 mg 100 g(-1) FW at the same conditions. The content of rutin and that of total phenolics remained stable during postharvest ripening. The amounts of lycopene as well as beta-carotene and ascorbic acid increased during postharvest ripening. No significant change in the amount of methanol soluble antioxidants or total soluble solids was found during postharvest ripening of the tomato fruits. During vine ripening, the total amount of phenolics and that of soluble solids (% Brix) increased. The content of phenolics correlated well with the content of methanol soluble antioxidants (p < 0.001). The amount of ascorbic acid increased from 9.7 mg in green-yellow tomatoes to 17.1 mg 100 g(-1) FW in red tomatoes. The amount of chalconaringenin decreased to 8.16 mg 100 g(-1) FW, whereas no significant change was observed for chlorogenic acid or rutin. Possible causes for the decrease in chalconaringenin are discussed. 3atomatoes 3apostharvest physiology 3aripening 3afood composition 3achlorogenic acid 3aflavonoids 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aascorbic acid 3avitamin content 3alycopene 3astorage time 3astorage temperature 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme1 aVerheul, M.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Sept. 7, v. 53, no. 18 p.7251-7256x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf050737d3Available from publisher's Web site  a20051104b20051202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/20  aOther US 7aarticle01811naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245003400135300001800169500021100187500002300398520068200421650001101103650002601114650003201140653002301172653003001195653001701225653003101242653001401273773009801287852001301385939003301398945000801431946001301439852000901452655001201461991609407020742620221120190932.0930311e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930010622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPharoah, P.O.D.10aIodine-supplementation trials  ap. 276S-279S.  aIn the series analytic: Interrelationships between selenium deficiency, iodine deficiency, and thyroid hormones / edited by J.R.

The evidence is also strong that iodine supplementation is effective in preventing both varieties of endemic cretinism, provided it is given before conception: early fetal and infant death may also be prevented. However, the reason for the variation in prevalence of the different types of cretinism is still a matter of conjecture. Iodine supplementation may improve motor and cognitive performance, but the evidence needs to be evaluated in light of the difficulty in transposing tests of intellectual and motor ability developed in one culture to another very different one. 3aiodine 3anutrient deficiencies 3adietary mineral supplements 0aliterature reviews 0ainternational comparisons 0aintervention 0atrace element deficiencies 0acretinism0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1993 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.276S-279Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245006700133300001800200500021100218520082100429650001301250650001101263650002301274650002101297650002701318650003501345650002201380650000901402650001301411650002601424650003201450651001901482653001401501653003101515700001801546700001901564700001501583700002301598700001301621700002001634700001701654773009801671852001301769939003301782945000801815946001301823852000901836655001201845991609405890742620221120175846.0930311e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930010562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorvilain, B.10aSelenium and the thyroid: how the relationship was established  ap. 244S-248S.  aIn the series analytic: Interrelationships between selenium deficiency, iodine deficiency, and thyroid hormones / edited by J.R. Arthur. Proceedings of a consultation held March 25-27, 1992 in Aberdeen, UK.  aSeveral hypotheses concerning consequences of selenium deficiency on iodine metabolism can be proposed on the basis of experimental studies in rats and from epidemiological and experimental studies in humans. By decreasing intracellular GSH peroxidase activity, selenium deficiency may increase hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) supply and lead over several weeks to the thyroid atrophy observed in myxoedematous cretins. By improving thyroid hormone synthesis and by decreasing peripheral thyroxin (T4) deiodination, selenium deficiency could protect fetal brain T4 supply and thus prevent neurologic cretinism. Selenium deficiency may protect against iodine deficiency by decreasing T4 metabolism--and thus iodide leakage and perhaps also by increasing H2O2 supply and thyroid hormone synthesis and thus thyroid efficiency. 3aselenium 3aiodine 3amineral metabolism 3athyroid hormones 3aglutathione peroxidase 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3arats 3apatients 3anutrient deficiencies 3adietary mineral supplements 3aCentral Africa 0acretinism 0atrace element deficiencies1 aContempre, B.1 aLongombe, A.O.1 aGoyens, P.1 aGervy-Decoster, C.1 aLamy, F.1 aVanderpas, J.B.1 aDumont, J.E.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1993 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.244S-248Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245004800151300001600199520073400215650001900949650002300968650001200991650001901003650001101022650001101033650001601044650002001060650001201080700001501092700001901107700001701126773007101143852000901214939003301223945000801256946001301264655001201277991609405790742620221120175937.0930311e19930213xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930010442DNAL7 a80941712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVictora, C.G.10aUse of pacifiers and breastfeeding duration  ap. 404-406.  aPacifiers are widely used in many developing countries.

Among 249 children still breastfed at 1 month, the risk that a child would be weaned at any age between 1 and 24 months was higher in pacifier users than in non-users (hazard ratio 3.0, 95% CI 2.0-4.6).

The Fusarium moniliforme D-pantonohydrolase was selected for directed evolution through error-prone Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) combined with DNA shuffling for improved activity and pH stability using a convenient two-step high-throughput screening method based on the product formation and pH indicator. After three sequential error-prone PCRs and two rounds of DNA shuffling followed by screening, about 60 positive mutants were produced and a best mutant, Mut H-1287, with improved activity and pH stability was obtained. As compared to wild-type D-pantonohydrolase, Mut H-1287 showed a 10.5-fold higher specific activity; moreover, it could retain 85% of its original activity after incubation under low pH. Gene analysis indicated that the Mut H-1287 had D63H, K118Q, and V241I substitutions. The wild-type and evolved D-pantonohydrolase (Mut H-1287) was purified in three steps. The activities and characteristics of purified wild-type and evolved D-pantonohydrolase were also studied and compared. 3aorganic acids and salts 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3aamino acid substitution 3agenes 3amutants 3ascreening 3aenzyme activity 3aartificial selection 0adirected evolution 0aD-pantoic acid 0aGibberella fujikuroi 0aD-pantonohydrolase 0aDNA shuffling 0aerror-prone polymerase chain reaction1 aSun, Z.1 aLeng, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Aug. 9, v. 54, no. 16 p.5823-5830dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf060794m3electronic resource  a20070323b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/23  aOther US 7aarticle02965naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001500155245010300170300001800273500002400291500001500315520116300330650002601493650001801519650002401537650002201561650002101583650001301604650002701617650001101644650001901655650001301674650001001687650001901697650002001716650002701736650001701763650002101780650001701801650002901818653002401847653002701871653002901898653001601927653004101943653001901984700001502003700001502018700001502033773016202048852000902210856006102219930003302280945002502313946001302338655001202351IND4383470020221120171008.0060908e20060809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438347002DNAL7 a10.1021/jf060658h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ300 0aQ2001 aRhim, J.W.10aPreparation and Characterization of Chitosan-Based Nanocomposite Films with Antimicrobial Activity  ap. 5814-5822.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFour different types of chitosan-based nanocomposite films were prepared using a solvent-casting method by incorporation with four types of nanoparticles, that is, an unmodified montmorillonite (Na-MMT), an organically modified montmorillonite (Cloisite 30B), a Nano-silver, and a Ag-zeolite (Ag-Ion). X-ray diffraction patterns of the nanocomposite films indicated that a certain degree of intercalation was formed in the nanocomposite films, with the highest intercalation in the Na-MMT-incorporated films followed by films with Cloisite 30B and Ag-Ion. Scanning electron micrographs showed that in all of the nanocomposite films, except the Nano-silver-incorporated one, nanoparticles were dispersed homogeneously throughout the chitosan polymer matrix. Consequently, mechanical and barrier properties of chitosan films were affected through intercalation of nanoparticles, that is, tensile strength increased by 7-16%, whereas water vapor permeability decreased by 25-30% depending on the nanoparticle material tested. In addition, chitosan-based nanocomposite films, especially silver-containing ones, showed a promising range of antimicrobial activity. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3ananoparticles 3apackaging materials 3aX-ray diffraction 3aEscherichia coli 3achitosan 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3asilver 3afood packaging 3azeolites 3awater 3afood pathogens 3amontmorillonite 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aedible films 3atensile strength 3apermeability 3aantibacterial properties 0ananocomposite films 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0awater vapor permeability 0aNano-silver 0aorganically modified montmorillonite 0asilver zeolite1 aHong, S.I.1 aPark, H.M.1 aNg, P.K.W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Aug. 9, v. 54, no. 16 p.5814-5822dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf060658h3electronic resource  a20070323b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/23  aOther US 7aarticle02338naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245005100130300001600181520132000197650000901517650002601526650001701552650001501569650002001584650002301604650002501627650002301652650003201675650001701707651001001724653001301734700001801747700002001765700001601785773007601801852000901877939003301886945000801919946001301927655001201940991609404570742620221120160415.0930312e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930010752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemalatha.10aAssessment of mild zinc deficiency in children  ap. 115-122.  aGross zinc deficiency is not common in India. However, the extent of subclinical zinc deficiency in the undernourished population is not so far established. Plasma and leukocyte zinc levels were determined in 103 preschool children belonging to different nutritional grades. In addition, serum thymulin activity was determined to detect mild zinc deficiency. All three parameters showed gross impairment in severely malnourished children compared to normal and undernourished groups (P<0.001). However, normal and undernourished children were comparable with respect to plasma and leukocyte zinc and basal thymulin activity (2-9 and 2-6). The undernourished children showed a significant increase (P<0.025) in thymulin activity after in vitro zinc supplementation reflecting mild zinc deficiency. Estimation of rise in thymulin activity following zinc supplementation appears to be a sensitive indicator to detect mild zinc deficiency. However, the functional significance of such a mild zinc deficient status in populations in whom invariably other nutritional deficiencies are coexistent, is not clear. Until the functional significance of mud zinc deficiency is established, leukocyte and plasma zinc levels estimated under controlled conditions might be useful parameters to detect gross changes in zinc status. 3azinc 3anutrient deficiencies 3ablood plasma 3aleukocytes 3aenzyme activity 3anutritional status 3anutrition assessment 3apreschool children 3adietary mineral supplements 3amalnutrition 3aIndia 0athymulin1 aBhaskaram, P.1 aQadri, S.S.Y.H.1 aKumār, Pa.0 tNutrition research.g1993 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.115-122x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03166naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245014100130300001800271500001500289520166500304650001201969650002201981650001502003650001002018650001102028650002102039650001902060650002202079650002002101650002402121650002202145650002102167650002502188650002302213650001402236650002002250650002802270650002002298650001902318650002102337650001302358653001602371653002802387653001902415700001702434700001402451773009302465852000902558930003302567945001302600946001102613655001202624IND2050894220221120160454.0960419e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205089422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroelstra, S.R.10aNitrogen utilization by plant species from acid heathland soils. 1. Comparison between nitrate and ammonium nutrition at constant low pH  ap. 1103-1112.  a2019-12-05  aSeven heathland species, four herbaceous plants and three dwarf shrubs, were tested for their capacity to utilize NH4+ or NO3-. When cultured in solution at pH 4.0 with 2 mol m-3 N, all species showed similar growth responses with respect to N source. Nitrate was assimilated almost equally well as ammonium, with relative growth rate generally averaging 5-8% lower for NO(3-)-grown plants, albeit not always significantly. However, N source was significantly and consistently correlated with biomass partitioning, as NH(4+)-fed plants allocated more dry matter to shoots and less to roots when compared to NO(3-)-fed plants. The strong difference in biomass partitioning may relate to the relative surplus of carbon per unit plant N (or, alternatively, the relatively suboptimal rate of N assimilation per unit plant C) in NO(3-)-fed plants. Inherently slow-growing dwarf shrubs accumulated virtually no free nitrate in their tissues and reduction of nitrate was strictly root-based. Faster-growing herbaceous plants, however, partitioned the assimilation of nitrate over both shoots and roots, thereby accumulating relatively high tissue NO3- levels. Ion uptake rates depended clearly on the 'relative shoot demand'. At similar shoot demands, especially in the herbaceous species, specific uptake rates for N and total inorganic (non-N) anions were higher in NH(4+)-fed plants, whereas the uptake rate for total (non-N) cations was higher in NO(3-)-fed plants. Rate of P uptake was enhanced with increasing plant demand, but was independent of the N source. Net H+ extrusions ranged from 1.00 to 1.34 H+ per NH4+, and from -0.48 to -0.77 H+ per NO3 taken up. 3aacidity 3anitrate reductase 3aphosphorus 3aroots 3ashoots 3anitrogen content 3aErica tetralix 3aPotentilla erecta 3anutrient uptake 3anitrogen metabolism 3anitrate reduction 3aMolinia caerulea 3aDeschampsia flexuosa 3aammonium compounds 3apotassium 3aenzyme activity 3adry matter partitioning 3aEmpetrum nigrum 3aNardus stricta 3aCalluna vulgaris 3anitrates 0agrowth rate 0adry matter accumulation 0amineral uptake1 aWagenaar, R.1 aSmant, W.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1995 Sept., v. 46, no. 290 p.1103-1112x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03952naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245019300190300001600383520147300399650002101872650001301893650002601906650001101932650001601943650001001959650001301969650002101982650001002003650001402013650001702027650001002044650001702054650002702071650006402098650001202162650004002174650001102214650004902225650003002274650004102304650007202345650007302417650004202490650003202532650003002564650001502594650005202609650002002661650003102681650001002712650004802722650003102770651001802801651003302819653002002852700001902872700002502891700002402916700002202940773012302962852000903085856009203094930003303186946001103219655001203230IND4398994520221120145400.0071216e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439899452DNAL7 a180530662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00991.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnne, Virve I.12aA high prevalence of antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli isolated from pigs and a low prevalence of antimicrobial resistant E. coli from cattle and sheep in Great Britain at slaughter  ap. 193-199.  aThe incidence of antimicrobial resistance and expressed and unexpressed resistance genes among commensal Escherichia coli isolated from healthy farm animals at slaughter in Great Britain was investigated. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among the isolates varied according to the animal species; of 836 isolates from cattle tested only 5.7% were resistant to one or more antimicrobials, while only 3.0% of 836 isolates from sheep were resistant to one or more agents. However, 92.1% of 2480 isolates from pigs were resistant to at least one antimicrobial. Among isolates from pigs, resistance to some antimicrobials such as tetracycline (78.7%), sulphonamide (66.9%) and streptomycin (37.5%) was found to be common, but relatively rare to other agents such as amikacin (0.1%), ceftazidime (0.1%) and coamoxiclav (0.2%). The isolates had a diverse range of resistance gene profiles, with tet(B), sul2 and strAB identified most frequently. Seven out of 615 isolates investigated carried unexpressed resistance genes. One trimethoprim-susceptible isolate carried a complete dfrA17 gene but lacked a promoter for it. However, in the remaining six streptomycin-susceptible isolates, one of which carried strAB while the others carried aadA, no mutations or deletions in gene or promoter sequences were identified to account for susceptibility. The data indicate that antimicrobial resistance in E. coli of animal origin is due to a broad range of acquired genes. 3aEscherichia coli 3aamikacin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acattle 3aceftazidime 3agenes 3amutation 3apromoter regions 3asheep 3aslaughter 3astreptomycin 3aswine 3atetracycline 2aAmikacinxpharmacology 2aAmoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combinationxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxpharmacology 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aCeftazidimexpharmacology 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPrevalence 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSheep, Domestic 2aStreptomycinxpharmacology 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aTetracyclinexpharmacology 3aGreat Britain 0aGreat Britainxepidemiology. 0aresistance gene1 aCassar, Claire1 aSprigings, Katherine1 aWoodward, Martin J.1 aBennett, Peter M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Jan., v. 278, no. 2 p.193-199dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00991.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071216b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03208naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100001200205245008700217300001600304500002400320520128000344650001001624650002401634650002201658650001901680650002101699650001601720650001301736650002501749650001401774650001501788650001101803650002801814650001301842650001801855650001701873650002401890650001801914650001201932650005201944650001101996650002802007650003202035650000902067650002402076650004202100650003302142650003002175650002702205653002302232700001502255773009602270852000902366856009002375930003302465945002502498946001102523655001202534IND4430235620221120145601.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443023562DNAL7 a197999082pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL810 0aF821 0aL0011 aXu, Jin10aThiotepa, a reliable marker for sperm precedence measurement in a polyandrous moth  ap. 102-106.  aIncludes references  aThe determination of paternity of offspring produced by polyandrous females is essential for the understanding of sperm competition mechanisms. The sterile male technique using radiation is one of the most commonly employed methods for this purpose. However, sterilization using radiation is likely to be restricted by the equipment availability and cost. Chemosterilization may thus be a cheaper and easier alternative for sterilizing male insects in sperm competition studies. Here we report a reliable chemomarker, thiotepa (N,N′,N″-triethylenethiophosphoramide), for the study of sperm competition and precedence in a polyandrous moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Dipping heads of male moths in 1% thiotepa aqueous solution for 10 s resulted in complete sterilization, i.e. their sperm still fertilized eggs but those eggs did not hatch. The sterilization treatment did not significantly affect male copulation ability, female fecundity, and sperm transfer, motility and fertilization. Our results indicate that 86% offspring of the twice-copulated females were fathered by the second males and 14% by the first males. Males treated with 5% thiotepa aqueous solution died within 24 h while those treated with 0.5% thiotepa were not fully sterilized. 3amoths 3ainsect reproduction 3asperm competition 3ainsect control 3achemical control 3asterilizing 3athiotepa 3aantifertility effect 3abioassays 3abiomarkers 3adosage 3areproductive efficiency 3avalidity 3ainsect models 3ainsect pests 3aEphestia kuehniella 3adose response 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Alkylatingxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFertilityxdrug effects 2aFertilizationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMothsxdrug effects 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aSperm Motilityxdrug effects 2aSpermatozoaxdrug effects 2aThiotepaxpharmacology 0achemosterilization1 aWang, Qiao0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.102-106dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.09.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/02/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03451naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003400171245015300205300001400358520127200372650001901644650000801663650001201671650001401683650001801697650003001715650001901745650002001764650001801784650001101802650002401813650001401837650002101851650001401872650001001886650001301896650002501909650002901934650003001963650001601993650002002009650004002029650001702069650006702086650001602153650002802169650003002197650002702227650002202254650002202276650002602298653002902324653001902353700001902372700003002391700003002421700001902451700001702470773012102487852000902608856009202617930003302709946001102742655001202753IND4399296220221120124940.0071223e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439929622DNAL7 a180700722pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00975.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues Coelho, Marcia Reed10aDiversity of nifH gene pools in the rhizosphere of two cultivars of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) treated with contrasting levels of nitrogen fertilizer  ap. 15-22.  aThe diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria was assessed in the rhizospheres of two cultivars of sorghum (IS 5322-C and IPA 1011) sown in Cerrado soil amended with two levels of nitrogen fertilizer (12 and 120 kg ha⁻¹). The nifH gene was amplified directly from DNA extracted from the rhizospheres, and the PCR products cloned and sequenced. Four clone libraries were generated from the nifH fragments and 245 sequences were obtained. Most of the clones (57%) were closely related to nifH genes of uncultured bacteria. NifH clones affiliated with Azohydromonas spp., Ideonella sp., Rhizobium etli and Bradyrhizobium sp. were found in all libraries. Sequences affiliated with Delftia tsuruhatensis were found in the rhizosphere of both cultivars sown with high levels of nitrogen, while clones affiliated with Methylocystis sp. were detected only in plants sown under low levels of nitrogen. Moreover, clones affiliated with Paenibacillus durus could be found in libraries from the cultivar IS 5322-C sown either in high or low amounts of fertilizer. This study showed that the amount of nitrogen used for fertilization is the overriding determinative factor that influenced the nitrogen-fixing community structures in sorghum rhizospheres cultivated in Cerrado soil. 3aBradyrhizobium 3aDNA 3aDelftia 3aIdeonella 3aMethylocystis 3aPaenibacillus azotofixans 3aRhizobium etli 3aSorghum bicolor 3acerrado soils 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3acultivars 3afertilizer rates 3agene pool 3agenes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3asoil amendments 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFertilizers 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductasesxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSorghumxmicrobiology 0adiazotrophic communities 0anifH sequences1 ade Vos, Marjon1 aCarneiro, Newton Portilho1 aMarriel, Ivanildo Evódio1 aPaiva, Edilson1 aSeldin, Lucy0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Feb., v. 279, no. 1 p.15-22dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00975.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02993naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245007900204300001800283506007600301520127100377506003701648650001501685650002101700650001001721650002201731650001601753650001201769650001101781650001801792650001801810650001201828650002101840650001601861650002001877650001201897650002701909700002401936700001701960700001701977700001901994700002302013700001902036700001902055700002402074700001802098773017302116852000902289856008302298930003302381946001302414655001202427IND4432983320221207121505.0100220e20100216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443298332DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09071281072doi7 aPMC28403022pmcid7 a201336102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVessey, John P.10aMammalian Pumilio 2 regulates dendrite morphogenesis and synaptic function  ap. 3222-3227.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Drosophila, Pumilio (Pum) is important for neuronal homeostasis as well as learning and memory. We have recently characterized a mammalian homolog of Pum, Pum2, which is found in discrete RNA-containing particles in the somatodendritic compartment of polarized neurons. In this study, we investigated the role of Pum2 in developing and mature neurons by RNA interference. In immature neurons, loss of Pum2 led to enhanced dendritic outgrowth and arborization. In mature neurons, Pum2 down-regulation resulted in a significant reduction in dendritic spines and an increase in elongated dendritic filopodia. Furthermore, we observed an increase in excitatory synapse markers along dendritic shafts. Electrophysiological analysis of synaptic function of neurons lacking Pum2 revealed an increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency. We then identified two specific mRNAs coding for a known translational regulator, eIF4E, and for a voltage-gated sodium channel, Scn1a, which interacts with Pum2 in immunoprecipitations from brain lysates. Finally, we show that Pum2 regulates translation of the eIF4E mRNA. Taken together, our data reveal a previously undescribed role for Pum2 in dendrite morphogenesis, synapse function, and translational control.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aRNA interference 3abrain 3aelectrophysiology 3ahomeostasis 3amammals 3amemory 3amessenger RNA 3amorphogenesis 3aneurons 3aprecipitin tests 3apseudopodia 3asodium channels 3asynapse 3atranslation (genetics)1 aSchoderboeck, Lucia1 aGingl, Ewald1 aLuzi, Ettore1 aRiefler, Julia1 aDi Leva, Francesca1 aKarra, Daniela1 aThomas, Sabine1 aKiebler, Michael A.1 aMacchi, Paolo0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 16, v. 107, no. 7 p.3222-3227dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09071281073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03212naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245013000202300001800332506007600350520172300426506003702149650001102186650001002197650001102207650002402218650001802242650001402260650002402274650002002298650001302318650001902331650001602350651001002366700002102376700002502397700002102422773017302443852000902616856008302625930003302708946001302741655001202754IND4432984120221207121508.0100220e20100216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443298412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09115961072doi7 aPMC28403402pmcid7 a201336602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Joseph T.10aLogistical feasibility and potential benefits of a population-wide passive-immunotherapy program during an influenza pandemic  ap. 3269-3274.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTreatment strategies for severe cases of pandemic influenza have focused on antiviral therapies. In contrast, passive immunotherapy with convalescent blood products has received limited attention. We consider the hypothesis that a passive-immunotherapy program that collects plasma from a small percentage of recovered adults can harvest sufficient convalescent plasma to treat a substantial percentage of severe cases during a pandemic. We use a mathematical model to estimate the demand and supply of passive immunotherapy during an influenza pandemic in Hong Kong. If >5% of 20- to 55-year-old individuals recovered from symptomatic infection donate their plasma (donor percentage > 5%), >67% of severe cases can be offered convalescent plasma transfusion (treatment coverage > 67%) in a moderately severe epidemic (R ₀ < 1.4 with 0.5% of symptomatic cases becoming severe). A donor percentage of 5% is comparable to the average blood donation rate of 38.1 donations per 1,000 people in developed countries. Increasing the donor percentage above 15% does not significantly boost the convalescent plasma supply because supply is constrained by plasmapheresis capacity during most stages of the epidemic. The demand-supply balance depends on the natural history and transmission dynamics of the disease via the epidemic growth rate only. Compared to other major cities, Hong Kong has a low plasmapheresis capacity. Therefore, the proposed passive-immunotherapy program is a logistically feasible mitigation option for many developed countries. As such, passive immunotherapy deserves more consideration by clinical researchers regarding its safety and efficacy as a treatment for severe cases of pandemic influenza.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3ablood 3acities 3adeveloped countries 3aimmunotherapy 3ainfluenza 3amathematical models 3anatural history 3apandemic 3aplasmapheresis 3aresearchers 3aChina1 aLee, Cheuk Kwong1 aCowling, Benjamin J.1 aYuen, Kwok-yung.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 16, v. 107, no. 7 p.3269-3274dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09115961073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03533naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100002100205245016500226300001400391500002400405520129700429650002701726650001901753650001301772650002401785650001901809650001801828650002001846650002001866650001001886650001201896650002101908650002601929650002001955650002501975650002502000650002002025650001602045650001302061650002102074650002302095650002302118650004702141650001202188650002802200650001302228650001102241650003202252650002202284650002102306650000902327650002102336650002102357650002102378650004502399653002202444700002202466700002502488773009402513852000902607856009002616930003302706945002502739946001102764655001202775IND4430234920221120120958.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443023492DNAL7 a197815472pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL600 0aL500 0aL0011 aJudd, Timothy M.12aA nutritional profile of the social wasp Polistes metricus: Differences in nutrient levels between castes and changes within castes during the annual life cycle  ap. 42-56.  aIncludes references  aIn wasps, nutrition plays a vital role for colony cohesion and caste determination. However, there is no baseline data set for the nutritional levels of wasps during the different stages of the colony cycle. Here we examined the levels of carbohydrates, lipids, protein, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, and Zn in the wasp Polistes metricus at different stages of the wasp's lifecycle. Individuals were collected at the following stages (1) spring gynes, (2) foundress colonies, (3) early worker colonies, (4) late worker colonies, (5) emerging reproductives (gynes and males), (6) early fall reproductives, and (7) late fall reproductives. All eggs, larvae, pupae and adults were analyzed for their nutritional content to determine if there were any differences between the nutrient levels in the different castes and how these nutrients changed within a caste during its lifetime. The results show there are differences in macro and micronutrient levels between the reproductive females and workers during development. Gynes showed changes in nutrient levels during their lifetime especially as they changed roles from a solitary individual to a nesting queen. Males also showed distinct nutritional changes during their lifetime. The implications for these nutritional differences are discussed. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3asocial insects 3aPolistes 3acaste determination 3aworker insects 3areproductives 3ainsect behavior 3asocial behavior 3amales 3afemales 3ainsect nutrition 3anutrient requirements 3ainsect colonies 3adevelopmental stages 3adietary carbohydrate 3adietary protein 3adietary fat 3avitamins 3adietary minerals 3atemporal variation 3agender differences 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aElements 2aFemale 2aInsect Proteinsxmetabolism 2aLarvaxmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMale 2aOvumxmetabolism 2aPupaxmetabolism 2aSocial Dominance 2aWaspsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aPolistes metricus1 aMagnus, Roxane M.1 aFasnacht, Matthew P.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.42-56dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.09.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/02/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03754naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001600185245014700201300001400348500002400362500001500386520206300401650002002464650001202484650001602496650002502512650001802537650002202555650001502577650003702592650002002629650003002649650001702679650001702696650001402713650002902727651001102756653001602767700001602783700001602799700001702815700001802832700001602850700001402866700001502880773011802895852000903013856007303022930003303095945002503128946001103153655001203164IND4383477720221120121031.0060911e20060812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438347772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL200 0aM0011 aLe Goff, J.10aDNA adduct measurements in zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas: Potential use for genotoxicant biomonitoring of fresh water ecosystems  ap. 55-64.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe purpose of this study was to examine PAH accumulation and bulky DNA adduct formation in the digestive gland of zebra mussels exposed in their habitat or in controlled laboratory conditions to complex mixture of PAH. DNA adducts were measured using a 32P-postlabelling protocol with nuclease P1 enrichment adapted from Reddy and Randerath [Reddy, M.V., Randerath, K., 1986. Nuclease P1-mediated enhancement of sensitivity of 32P-postlabelling test for structurally diverse DNA adducts. Carcinogenesis 7, 1543-1551]. Specimens collected in the upper part of the Seine estuary were shown to accumulate higher levels of PAH (up to 1.6 μg g-1 dry weight) in comparison to individuals from the reference site (0.053 μg g-1 dry weight). The former exhibited elevated levels of DNA adducts (up to 4.0/10⁸ nucleotides) and higher diversity of individual adducts with five distinct spots being specifically detected in individuals originating from the Seine estuary. Zebra mussels exposed for 5 days to 0.01% (v/v) of organic extract of sediment from the Seine estuary were shown to accumulate high amounts of PAH (up to 138 μg g-1 dry weight) but exhibited relatively low levels of DNA adducts. Exposure to benzo[a]pyrene led to a dose-dependent accumulation of B[a]P (up to 7063 μg g-1 dry weight) and a clear induction of DNA adduct formation in the digestive gland of mussels (up to 1.13/108 nucleotides). Comparisons with other bivalves exposed to the same model PAH, revealed similar levels of adducts and comparable adduct profiles with a main adduct spot and a second faint one. This study clearly demonstrated that zebra mussels are able to biotransform B[a]P and probably other PAH into reactive metabolites with DNA-binding activity. This work also demonstrated the applicability of the nuclease P1 enhanced 32P-postlabelling method for bulky adduct detection in the digestive gland of zebra mussels. DNA adduct measurement in zebra mussels could be a suitable biomarker to monitor PAH-exposure and evaluate genotoxicity in fresh water ecosystems. 3awater pollution 3amussels 3aDNA adducts 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aecotoxicology 3aindicator species 3abiomarkers 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3abioaccumulation 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3agenotoxicity 3abenzopyrenes 3aestuaries 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aFrance 0abenzopyrene1 aGallois, J.1 aPelhuet, L.1 aDevier, M.H.1 aBudzinski, H.1 aPottier, D.1 aAndre, V.1 aCachot, J.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2006 Aug. 12, v. 79, no. 1 p.55-64dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.05.0023electronic resource  a20070110b20070202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/01/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02756naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100004000152245013600192300001600328500002400344520151500368650001401883650001301897650002001910650001401930650001001944650001301954650002601967650002001993650002502013650001402038650001602052650002602068700002202094700003002116700002302146773012502169852000902294856005502303655001202358IND4381462320221120105034.0060627e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438146232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2006.00531.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGradstein, S.

Metzgeriopsis is not phylogenetically isolated from other taxa of Lejeuneaceae, as previously suggested, but is nested within Cololejeunea. The two genera share many morphological features, especially in the sporophyte generation, which is newly described. Metzgeriopsis and Cololejeunea are members of the Tuyamaella-Cololejeunea clade, characterized by neotenic features that probably evolved as adaptations to ephemeral habitats in tropical rain forests. Three different types of neoteny occur in this clade, which apparently originated by multiple heterochronic events. Within Lejeuneaceae, protonemal neoteny is unique to Metzgeriopsis and apparently resulted by evolution from a primary neotenic ancestor. The occurrence of protonemal neoteny in bryophytes is briefly reviewed and two types are recognized: species having a persistent thalloid protonema and species having a persistent filamentous protonema. The thalloid type is very rare and exclusive to epiphyllous liverworts, whereas the filamentous type is much more common and is characteristic of many terrestrial bryophytes, including the rare genus Protocephalozia. The new combination Cololejeunea metzgeriopsis (K.I.Goebel) comb. nov. is proposed. 3aBryopsida 3aancestry 3achloroplast DNA 3aepiphytes 3agenes 3ahabitats 3amosses and liverworts 3anew combination 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3asporophytes 3atropical rain forests1 aWilson, Rosemary.1 aIlkiu-Borges, Anna Luiza.1 aHeinrichs, Jochen.0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2006 July, v. 151, no. 3 p.293-308dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2006.00531.x 7aarticle03292naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010300193300001600296520109600312650002101408650001401429650002401443650001001467650003701477650001201514650001301526650002101539650005201560650001601612650004001628650001801668650002801686650004101714650007201755650004601827650004001873650004201913650001101955650003201966650002801998650001302026650004002039650005202079650003002131653002402161653002502185700001902210700001702229700002102246700002002267700002902287700002102316700001902337700002302356773012202379852000902501856007602510930003302586946001102619655001202630IND4390473220221120085726.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439047322DNAL7 a173267532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00672.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTracz, Dobryan M.10aampC gene expression in promoter mutants of cefoxitin-resistant Escherichia coli clinical isolates  ap. 265-271.  aReverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the amount of overexpression of the ampC gene in 52 cefoxitin-resistant Escherichia coli clinical isolates that had previously characterized mutations in their ampC promoter/attenuator regions. The results showed that mutations that create a consensus -35 box (TTGACA) are the most important factor in strengthening the ampC promoter, followed by base pair insertions that increase the distance between the -35 and -10 boxes to 17 or 18 bp. Mutations in the -10 box are of lesser importance and those in the attenuator region appear to have little effect on ampC expression. Three strains overexpress ampC due to the effect of insertion elements located in the ampC promoter regions. Further, the data show that there is no correlation between ampC overexpression and the minimum inhibition concentration of cefoxitin in clinical isolates. Overall, the data indicate that a combination of ampC promoter mutations and other strain-specific factors combine to contribute to the magnitude of cefoxitin resistance in E. coli. 3aEscherichia coli 3acefoxitin 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amutants 3amutation 3apromoter regions 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransposons 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBase Sequence 2aCefoxitinxpharmacology 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2abeta-Lactamasesxgenetics 0aampC overexpression 0acefoxitin resistance1 aBoyd, David A.1 aHizon, Romeo1 aBryce, Elizabeth1 aMcGeer, Allison1 aOfner-Agostini, Marianna1 aSimor, Andrew E.1 aPaton, Shirley1 aMulvey, Michael R.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2007 May, v. 270, no. 2 p.265-271dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00672.x3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03673naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001800185245011300203300001600316500002400332520134900356650002101705650002101726650002301747650002301770650001501793650001901808650002601827650002501853650001701878650002601895650002801921650002701949650002201976650002501998650002802023650001002051650005202061650001202113650004002125650007202165650005602237650002702293650003102320650003902351650001602390650002402406650001302430650003102443650004602474650005002520651001202570651002702582653001902609700001802628700002202646700002102668773009602689852000902785856008802794930003302882945002502915946001102940655001202951IND4422064720221120085702.0090619e20090702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442206472DNAL7 a193037242pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aMessens, Winy10aMultiple typing for the epidemiological study of contamination of broilers with thermotolerant Campylobacter  ap. 120-131.  aIncludes references  aThis study aims to investigate the genetic diversity of thermotolerant Campylobacter in commercial broiler flocks and in the environment of broiler farms in Belgium. Seven out of 18 investigated flocks became colonized during rearing. Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), restriction fragment length polymorphism of the flagellin A gene (flaA-RFLP) and antimicrobial resistance profile (ARP) were used for typing of the isolates. By the combination of FAFLP and PFGE, 22 Campylobacter genotypes could be distinguished. Colonization was almost exclusively with Campylobacter jejuni and unique genotypes were found in each flock. Multiple genotypes were detected in the broilers of 3 flocks, either simultaneously or successively. In 5 flocks, strains that were resistant to at least one antibiotic (mostly tetracycline) were found. The presence of other broiler houses on the farm did not result in a higher probability of colonization. The nipple water was contaminated with the same genotype as the broilers, illustrating its importance for transmission of Campylobacter. The same genotype was detected in a water puddle and in the broiler flock during rearing in 3 flocks. Once, the same genotype was isolated from the ditch water shortly before it was detected in the broilers. 3abroiler chickens 3apoultry diseases 3acampylobacteriosis 3adisease prevalence 3apathotypes 3aheat tolerance 3aantibiotic resistance 3adisease transmission 3arisk factors 3aenvironmental factors 3aepidemiological studies 3amolecular epidemiology 3agenetic variation 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3abacterial contamination 3awater 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCampylobacterxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aEnvironment 2aFlagellinxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aHousing, Animalxstandards 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 3aBelgium 0aBelgiumxepidemiology. 0aflagellin gene1 aHerman, Lieve1 aDe Zutter, Lieven1 aHeyndrickx, Marc0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2009 July 2, v. 138, no. 1-2 p.120-131dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.02.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02230naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245014800153300001400301500001500315520087200330650002201202650001401224650001601238650001001254650000801264650001001272650001901282650000901301650001501310650001001325650000901335650004201344650003301386650001101419650001101430650000901441650001601450650001601466650002101482653002001503653001901523700001901542773010001561852000901661939003301670945000801703946001301711655001201724991609396840742620221120085737.0930305e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930009902DNAL7 a84408172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKesteloot, H.E.10aRelationship between dietary protein intake and serum urea, uric acid and creatinine, and 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion: the BIRNH study  ap. 42-46.  a2019-12-04  aRelationships between dietary protein intake of a large free-living group and serum creatinine (Cr), urea and uric acid levels have been studied, based on data obtained from the BIRNH (Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health) study.

In a subgroup, the relationship between dietary protein intake and 24-hour urinary Cr excretion has also been studied. The range of +/- 2 SD of the mean for total protein and animal and vegetable protein daily intakes resulted in a calculated range of 24-hour Cr excretion of 430, 317 and 209 mg/24 hours in men and of 192, 169 and 125 mg/24 hours in women, respectively. The 24-hour urinary Cr excretion was significantly influenced by both dietary protein and polyunsaturated fat intake. 3avegetable protein 3auric acid 3ablood serum 3aurine 3amen 3awomen 3aprotein intake 3aurea 3acreatinine 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCreatininexbloodxmetabolismxurine. 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aUreaxblood 2aUric Acidxblood 0adietary protein 0aanimal protein1 aJoossens, J.V.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g1993 Feb., v. 12, no. 1 p.42-46x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02807naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245008300205300001800288506007600306520123800382506003701620650001801657650002801675650001401703650001301717650000901730650001101739650002101750650001301771650001101784650001501795650001201810650001501822650001701837650003201854700001901886700002901905700001701934700001801951700002101969773017301990852000902163856008302172930003302255946001302288655001202301IND4433278020221207134755.0100228e20100223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443327802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09065011072doi7 aPMC28404712pmcid7 a201336662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Ramille N.10aSupramolecular design of self-assembling nanofibers for cartilage regeneration  ap. 3293-3298.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMolecular and supramolecular design of bioactive biomaterials could have a significant impact on regenerative medicine. Ideal regenerative therapies should be minimally invasive, and thus the notion of self-assembling biomaterials programmed to transform from injectable liquids to solid bioactive structures in tissue is highly attractive for clinical translation. We report here on a coassembly system of peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules designed to form nanofibers for cartilage regeneration by displaying a high density of binding epitopes to transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ-1). Growth factor release studies showed that passive release of TGFβ-1 was slower from PA gels containing the growth factor binding sites. In vitro experiments indicate these materials support the survival and promote the chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. We also show that these materials can promote regeneration of articular cartilage in a full thickness chondral defect treated with microfracture in a rabbit model with or even without the addition of exogenous growth factor. These results demonstrate the potential of a completely synthetic bioactive biomaterial as a therapy to promote cartilage regeneration.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3abiocompatible materials 3acartilage 3aepitopes 3agels 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amedicine 3amodels 3ananofibers 3arabbits 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factors1 aShah, Nirav A.1 aDel Rosario Lim, Marc M.1 aHsieh, Caleb1 aNuber, Gordon1 aStupp, Samuel I.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 23, v. 107, no. 8 p.3293-3298dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09065011073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02687naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245013800153300001400291520141700305650001501722650002801737650000901765650002701774650001101801650000801812650001001820650001001830650005901840650002701899650001101926650001101937650000901948650001601957650003401973650002102007650003202028700001802060773010002078852000902178939003302187945000802220946001302228655001202241991609396370742620221120075211.0930305e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930009932DNAL7 a84408212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernstein, A.L.10aBrief communication: effect of pharmacologic doses of vitamin B6 on carpal tunnel syndrome, electroencephalographic results, and pain  ap. 73-76.  aThe role of vitamin B6 as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome was examined by monitoring both the standard clinical and electrophysiological parameters for entrapment neuropathy at the wrist. Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies were done in an attempt to identify patients most likely to benefit from B6 treatment. EEGs did not prove useful as predictors of clinical response to vitamin B6. Our patients, however, did not show any abnormalities prior to treatment, and no changes occurred during the treatment period. Motor latency, while the most common screening test for carpal tunnel syndrome, was not significantly changed during the course of treatment. It did not prove to be a useful test for monitoring clinical effectiveness of the treatment. Parameters showing the greatest changes were pain scores and sensory latency, which most closely paralleled clinical assessments. Pain scores, more than any other parameters, were improved in these patients following vitamin B6 treatment. Vitamin B6 has been shown to change pain thresholds in clinical and laboratory studies. This may be the basis of the significant improvement in pain scores when electrophysiologic data showed only mild improvement. This study suggests that vitamin B6 deficiency may not be a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome in spite of the observed therapeutic effect, without toxicity, of vitamin B6 treatment. 3apyridoxine 3anervous system diseases 3apain 3aelectroencephalography 3adosage 3amen 3awomen 2aAdult 2aCarpal Tunnel Syndromexdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aElectroencephalography 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPainxdrug therapyxetiology. 2aPain Measurement 2aPyridoxinextherapeutic use1 aDinesen, J.S.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g1993 Feb., v. 12, no. 1 p.73-76x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03126naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245013900203300001800342506007600360520148300436506003701919650001201956650001501968650002501983650001902008650001702027650001102044650002102055650002102076650000902097650001202106650001702118650001302135650001202148700001502160700001902175700001902194700002202213700002102235700002202256700001902278773017302297852000902470856008302479930003302562946001302595655001202608IND4432980620221207122119.0100220e20100216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443298062DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09123931072doi7 aPMC28403472pmcid7 a201336092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuchez, Sophie10aPremature replacement of μ with α immunoglobulin chains impairs lymphopoiesis and mucosal homing but promotes plasma cell maturation  ap. 3064-3069.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSequentially along B cell differentiation, the different classes of membrane Ig heavy chains associate with the Igα/Igβ heterodimer within the B cell receptor (BCR). Whether each Ig class conveys specific signals adapted to the corresponding differentiation stage remains debated. We investigated the impact of the forced expression of an IgA-class receptor throughout murine B cell differentiation by knocking in the human Cα Ig gene in place of the Sμ region. Despite expression of a functional BCR, homozygous mutant mice showed a partial developmental blockade at the pro-B/pre-BI and large pre-BII cell stages, with decreased numbers of small pre-BII cells. Beyond this stage, peripheral B cell compartments of reduced size developed and allowed specific antibody responses, whereas mature cells showed constitutive activation and a strong commitment to plasma cell differentiation. Secreted IgA correctly assembled into polymers, associated with the murine J chain, and was transported into secretions. In heterozygous mutants, cells expressing the IgA allele competed poorly with those expressing IgM from the wild-type allele and were almost undetectable among peripheral B lymphocytes, notably in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Our data indicate that the IgM BCR is more efficient in driving early B cell education and in mucosal site targeting, whereas the IgA BCR appears particularly suited to promoting activation and differentiation of effector plasma cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aantibodies 3acell differentiation 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin M 3amice 3amutants 3aplasma cells 3apolymers 3atissues1 aAmin, Rada1 aCogné, Nadine1 aDelpy, Laurent1 aSirac, Christophe1 aPascal, Virginie1 aCorthésy, Blaise1 aCogné, Michel0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 16, v. 107, no. 7 p.3064-3069dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09123931073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02609naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012700202300001800329506007600347520101600423506003701439650001701476650001301493650001501506650001101521650000901532650001201541650003701553650002901590650002701619700002501646700001601671700002401687700002301711700002401734700001701758700001801775700002301793773017301816852000901989856008301998930003302081946001302114655001202127IND4432982020221207122120.0100220e20100216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443298202DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09107171072doi7 aPMC28402772pmcid7 a201337712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaoping10aHsp90 inhibitors block outgrowth of EBV-infected malignant cells in vitro and in vivo through an EBNA1-dependent mechanism  ap. 3146-3151.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEBV causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with certain malignancies. EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) mediates EBV genome replication, partition, and transcription, and is essential for persistence of the viral genome in host cells. Here we demonstrate that Hsp90 inhibitors decrease EBNA1 expression and translation, and that this effect requires the Gly-Ala repeat domain of EBNA1. Hsp90 inhibitors induce the death of established, EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines at doses nontoxic to normal cells, and this effect is substantially reversed when lymphoblastoid cell lines are stably infected with a retrovirus expressing a functional EBNA1 mutant lacking the Gly-Ala repeats. Hsp90 inhibitors prevent EBV transformation of primary B cells, and strongly inhibit the growth of EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease in SCID mice. These results suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors may be particularly effective for treating EBV-induced diseases requiring the continued presence of the viral genome.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRetroviridae 3aantigens 3acell death 3agenome 3amice 3amutants 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aBarlow, Elizabeth A.1 aMa, Shidong1 aHagemeier, Stacy R.1 aDuellman, Sarah J.1 aBurgess, Richard R.1 aTellam, Judy1 aKhanna, Rajiv1 aKenney, Shannon C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 16, v. 107, no. 7 p.3146-3151dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09107171073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02989naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245008900206300001800295506007600313520134300389506003701732650000801769650003501777650000901812650002101821650002001842650001701862650002001879650001301899650001401912650002901926700001601955700002501971700002101996700002102017700002102038700001802059700002102077700002002098700001902118700002302137773017302160852000902333856008302342930003302425946001302458655001202471IND4432981820221207122117.0100220e20100216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443298182DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09141421072doi7 aPMC28403132pmcid7 a201336382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerris, Andrea L.10aLens epithelium-derived growth factor fusion proteins redirect HIV-1 DNA integration  ap. 3135-3140.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) fusion proteins can direct HIV-1 DNA integration to novel sites in the host genome. The C terminus of LEDGF contains an integrase binding domain (IBD), and the N terminus binds chromatin. LEDGF normally directs integrations to the bodies of expressed genes. Replacing the N terminus of LEDGF with chromatin binding domains (CBDs) from other proteins changes the specificity of HIV-1 DNA integration. We chose two well-characterized CBDs: the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger from ING2 and the chromodomain from heterochromatin binding protein 1α (HP1α). The ING2 PHD finger binds H3K4me3, a histone mark that is associated with the transcriptional start sites of expressed genes. The HP1α chromodomain binds H3K9me2,3, histone marks that are widely distributed throughout the genome. A fusion protein in which the ING2 PHD finger was linked to the LEDGF IBD directed integrations near the start sites of expressed genes. A similar fusion protein in which the HP1α chromodomain was linked to the LEDGF IBD directed integrations to sites that differed from both the PHD finger fusion-directed and LEDGF-directed integration sites. The ability to redirect HIV-1 DNA integration may help solve the problems associated with the activation of oncogenes when retroviruses are used in gene therapy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aLens 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3agene therapy 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3aoncogenes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aWu, Xiaolin1 aHughes, Christina M.1 aStewart, Claudia1 aSmith, Steven J.1 aMilne, Thomas A.1 aWang, Gang G.1 aShun, Ming-Chieh1 aAllis, C.

With the development of molecular markers for many crops it is now possible to identify major quantitative trait loci (QTL) regulating specific drought responses. By comparing the coincidence of such QTL for specific traits it is possible to test much more precisely than before whether a particular constitutive or adaptive response to drought stress is likely to be of significance in improving drought resistance. We have used this approach to identify QTL for ABA content and other traits likely to be important in determining drought response in maize. Eighty-four RFLP markers were mapped in an F2 population of 81 plants from a cross between parents, Polj17 (drought resistant) and F-2 (drought sensitive), that differ markedly in many constitutive and adaptive responses to drought stress. In a soil glasshouse experiment, from which water was withheld for 3 weeks after anthesis, flowering time, stomatal conductance, tissue ABA contents, leaf water relations parameters and fluorescence characteristics, root pulling force, and nodal root number were measured. The minimum number and location of genes having major effects on the traits were determined and possible causal relationships amongst them tested. Comparing the coincidence of QTL for ABA content and stomatal conductance showed that xylem ABA content was more likely to have had a regulatory effect on the stomatal conductance of those plants than the whole leaf ABA content. However, both xylem and leaf ABA contents were significantly associated with root characteristics, suggesting that the rooting behaviour (either constitutive or adaptive) was important in regulating stress responses, particularly in determining xylem ABA contents. We also found that Fm (a measure of the activity of photosynthetic reaction centres) was positively associated with chlorophyll concentration per unit area. Different methods for comparing QTL are presented and discussed. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aquantitative trait loci 3aZea mays 3aplant development 3aroot systems 3aloci 3astomatal conductance 3adrought tolerance 3adrought 3awater stress 3agenetic markers 3aleaf conductance 3aabscisic acid 3axylem 3aleaves 3aquantitative traits 0aquantitative genetics 0aplant-water relations 0aplant morphology1 aLazic-Jancic, V.1 aSteed, A.1 aPekic, S.1 aQuarrie, S.A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1995 July, v. 46, no. 288 p.853-865x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03266naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002000175245015000195300001600345500002400361500001500385520130300400650002001703650003501723650001301758650001401771650002501785650001101810650001301821650003701834650001701871650001901888650002101907650002001928650002101948650002401969650002301993650003102016650003102047653003302078653001602111653002002127653004402147653003002191700001802221700001802239700002402257700002402281700002102305700002102326773011502347852000902462856008802471930003302559945002502592946001102617655001202628IND4422058820221120041207.0090619e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442205882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL810 0aL8331 aTinega, Alex N.10aFusion of a cell penetrating peptide from HIV-1 TAT to the Theileria parva antigen Tp2 enhances the stimulation of bovine CD8⁺ T cell responses  ap. 107-113.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aImmunity to the bovine apicomplexan parasite Theileria parva is associated with MHC-I restricted CD8 ⁺ T cell responses directed against the intralymphocytic schizont stage of the parasite. A number of schizont-stage antigens that are targets of CD8 ⁺ T cell responses from immune animals have been identified but an effective delivery strategy that consistently induces protective CD8 ⁺ T cell responses remains to be developed. This study aimed to determine whether fusing Tat, a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) from HIV-1 TAT, to a CD8 ⁺ T cell target antigen from T. parva (Tp2) enhances the cytosolic delivery and subsequent stimulation of bovine CD8 ⁺ T cell responses in vitro. Using IFN-γ ELISpot and cytotoxicity assays, it was demonstrated that recombinant Tat-Tp2 fusion protein possessed a superior ability to access MHC-I processing and presentation pathway and to stimulate CD8 ⁺ T cell responses compared to recombinant Tp2 protein. Exposure of APC to Tat-Tp2 protein for only 30min was sufficient for protein uptake and stimulation of CD8 ⁺ T cells. This work describes for the first time the utility of a CPP to enhance MHC-I presentation in a veterinary species and supports the evaluation of CPP fusion proteins in the induction of CD8 ⁺ T cell responses in vivo. 3acattle diseases 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantigens 3aschizonts 3arecombinant proteins 3acattle 3apeptides 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3atheileriosis 3aviral proteins 3aimmunostimulants 3aTheileria parva 3ain vitro studies 3avaccine development 3adisease resistance 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 0aprotein transduction domains 0aconjugation 0aimmune response 0atrans-acting activator of transcription 0acell penetrating peptides1 aPellé, Roger1 aKang'a, Simon1 aGicheru, Michael M.1 aTaracha, Evans L.N.1 aNene, Vishvanath1 aGraham, Simon P.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2009 July 15, v. 130, no. 1-2 p.107-113dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle00671naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245002500136300001200161520008800173650001600261650002200277773007100299852000900370939003300379945000800412946000900420655001200429991609391980742620221120033543.0930316s1992    xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930010842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliamson, C.C.10aPlanning a microwave  ap. 6-7.  aThis article gives food safety tips for preparing holiday poultry in the microwave. 3aturkey meat 3amicrowave cooking0 tFood news for consumers.g1992, v. 9, no. 3 p.6-7x1057-77857nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aUSDA 7aarticle03742naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002200176245008800198300001400286500002400300500001500324520170900339650001402048650002202062650001102084650002502095650000902120650002102129650002702150650002302177650001402200650002302214650001402237650002302251650002202274650001902296650002702315650001202342650003402354650002102388650002102409650001102430650003702441650003702478650003202515650004402547650006402591653002802655653001102683653001502694653001502709700002102724700002302745700002102768773011302789852000902902856008802911930003302999945002503032946001103057655001203068IND4422059520221120033548.0090619e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442205952DNAL7 a192010352pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8001 aLacunza, Ezequiel10aIdentification and expression of the epithelial Muc1 mucin in normal feline tissues  ap. 17-24.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMany pathogens require direct binding to, or penetration of, mucosal cells to cause pathology. Cell surface mucins are critical components of mucosal defense. Mucin 1, named MUC1 in humans and Muc1 in non-human species, is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in apical mammalian epithelial tissues. The aim of this study was to determine the Muc1 profile expression in healthy cat epithelial tissues. An extensive analysis of Muc1 expression was performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot (WB) and RT-PCR. By IHC, the presence of Muc1 protein was observed in the epithelial cells of the esophagus, stomach, trachea, lung, small and large intestine, liver, pancreas, salivary glands, lactating mammary glands and bladder. The predominantly linear patterns of reaction as well as the ubiquitous expression of feline Muc1 were consistent with normal human tissues. By WB, a band of 35kDa, corresponding to that predicted for the Muc1 cytoplasmic tail, was detected. The RT-PCR analysis showed a fragment of 115bp, consistent with that found in MCF7 and T47D human cell lines. The results showed that the widest distribution of feline Muc1 expression is in the mucosal tissues most at risk of infections such as the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract and lactating mammary gland. This study provides a normal model of cat Muc1 pattern expression as a starting point to evaluate and compare the expression of this epithelial mucin in pathological feline tissues. We believe that the CT33 antibody and the universal primers designed could be valuable tools for veterinary pathologists involved in the diagnostic interpretation of alterations in Muc1 expression of infected tissues in cats. 3aviability 3aprotein synthesis 3amucins 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acats 3amucosal immunity 3amembrane glycoproteins 3abinding properties 3abioassays 3arespiratory system 3alactation 3adisease resistance 3aintestinal mucosa 3amammary glands 3abiochemical mechanisms 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aCatsximmunology 2aEpithelial Cells 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aMucin-1xbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMucous Membraneximmunology 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 0agastrointestinal system 0amucosa 0aepithelium 0aMuc1 mucin1 aAbba, Martín C.1 aSegal-Eiras, Amada1 aCroce, María V.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2009 July 15, v. 130, no. 1-2 p.17-24dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.01.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03734naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002200194245017300216300001600389500002400405520133100429650001001760650002401770650001801794650002501812650003301837650001701870650002001887650002501907650002201932650002001954650002101974650002901995650001502024650001702039650001602056650001602072650005302088650001202141650005502153650007202208650003102280650003702311650004102348650004802389650002402437650004402461650006402505650007902569650001802648653002002666700002202686700002202708700002502730773011502755852000902870856008802879930003302967945002503000946001103025655001203036IND4422059120221120030432.0090619e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442205912DNAL7 a192683732pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aM001 0aQ2061 aVillarroel, Franz10aDetection of up-regulated serum amyloid A transcript and of amyloid AA aggregates in skeletal muscle lesions of rainbow trout infected with Flavobacterium psychrophilum  ap. 120-124.  aIncludes references  aSerum amyloid A (SAA) is a family of acute-phase proteins, recognized as important effectors of innate immunity in higher vertebrates. Under pro-inflammatory conditions, up-regulation of saa transcripts occurs not only in the liver, but also in several extrahepatic tissues of a wide variety of vertebrates. SAA is also known as the precursor to amyloid A (AA), a major component of amyloid fibrils deposited in liver, kidney and spleen of humans suffering chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we show the up-regulation of saa transcription in lesions affecting skin, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of rainbow trout naturally and experimentally infected with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of cold water disease (CWD). Using an antiserum against a trout acute SAA peptide that was previously shown to specifically recognize intact recombinant trout SAA and peptides derived from it, we showed by confocal microscopy analysis extensive colocalization of SAA and thioflavin T (ThT) staining in the skeletal muscle fibers of infected fish, suggesting for the first time the presence of AA-derived aggregates in the skeletal muscle of a lower vertebrate. These findings support the idea that SAA and/or its derivatives could constitute relevant markers for fish health and also for fish meat quality control. 3atrout 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afish diseases 3abacterial infections 3aFlavobacterium psychrophilum 3apathogenesis 3aimmune response 3aacute phase proteins 3auptake mechanisms 3askeletal muscle 3alesions (animal) 3atranscription (genetics) 3abiomarkers 3ainflammation 3aamyloidosis 3afood safety 2aAmyloidxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aAnimals 2aFish Diseasesxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aFlavobacteriaceae Infectionsximmunologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aFlavobacteriumxphysiology 2aMicroscopy, Confocalxveterinary 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescencexveterinary 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aOncorhynchus mykiss 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSerum Amyloid A Proteinxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aUp-Regulation 0aserum amyloid A1 aZambrano, Ángara1 aAmthauer, Rodolfo1 aConcha, Margarita I.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2009 July 15, v. 130, no. 1-2 p.120-124dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.02.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03349naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245003800129300001600167500001500183520228500198650001802483650002302501650000902524650001602533650000802549650001002557650001602567650001402583650002102597650002402618650001402642650001602656653003302672653001702705700001902722700001602741700001902757773007602776852000902852939003302861945000802894946001302902655001202915991609390920742620221120030527.0930312e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930010792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, BJ.10aVitamin A status in HIV infection  ap. 157-166.  a2019-12-04  aHIV+ individuals may be at particular risk for deficiency of vitamin A, a critical micronutrient in the maintenance of epithelial barriers and normal immune function. We studied 25 HIV+ outpatients with CD4+ T cell counts less than 800:5 had AIDS, 2 had diarrhea and weight loss and 18 were asymptomatic. Vitamin A status was assessed with a battery of tests; conjunctival impression cytology (CIC), relative dose responses (RDR) and serum retinol and retinol binding protein (RBP) levels. We also measured mitogen-induced lymphoproliferation and in vitro cytokine production (soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)) with and without supplemental retinol. Eight subjects (32%) had one or more tests suggestive of vitamin A deficiency: serum retinol levels < 1.05 micromolar (4), abnormal CIC (6), abnormal RDR (1), RBP < 7 (1). Correspondence between the various measures of vitamin status was limited but subjects with abnormal CIC tended to have lower serum retinol levels than those with normal CIC (1.54 +/- 0.30 vs 2.20 +/- 0.21 micromolar/L; P = .15). 60% of subjects with AIDS had abnormal CIC (vs 17% in non-AIDS subjects; P < .04). Retinol levels in subjects with CD4+ counts less than or equal to 300 tended to be lower than in those with CD4+ counts > 300 (1.80 +/- 0.24 vs 2.20 +/- 0.24 micromolar/L; P = .15). Subjects taking a daily multivitamin containing modest amounts of vitamin A had higher serum retinol levels than those taking no supplements (2.50 +/- 0.24 vs 1.47 +/- 0.21 micromolar/L; P < .009), an association which remained after stratification by CD4+ cell counts. In vitro proliferation and cytokine production were not correlated with measures of vitamin A status. Retinol supplementation in cultures with the lowest baseline cytokine levels increased production of sIL-2R (> 27-fold; P < .03) and IFN-gamma (> 3.1-fold; P < .02) regardless of apparent vitamin A status. These preliminary observations suggest that vitamin A status may deteriorate with advancing HIV and that even modest doses of vitamin A can have significant impact on serum retinol levels. Increased cytokine production with supplemental retinol in vitro demonstrates that lymphocytes can be retinoid responsive despite apparently normal vitamin A status. 3adose response 3anutritional status 3aeyes 3ablood serum 3amen 3awomen 3alymphocytes 3acytokines 3abinding proteins 3avitamin supplements 3avitamin A 3ainterferons 0ahuman immunodeficiency virus 0acell biology1 aHumphrey, J.H.1 aClement, L.1 aChaisson, R.E.0 tNutrition research.g1993 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.157-166x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02790naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245007300192300001200265520098300277650002001260650001401280650001901294650001101313650001401324650001001338650002001348650001701368650001401385650001001399650001401409650001101423650002301434650001301457650001401470650003001484650001101514650005401525650002601579650005101605650003301656650003101689650003901720651001601759651002901775651001101804651001601815653002601831653001401857700001901871700002201890773011901912852000902031856009202040930003302132946001102165655001202176IND4399294720221120022240.0071223e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439929472DNAL7 a180700712pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00986.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalters, Dale R.10aRamularia collo-cygni: the biology of an emerging pathogen of barley  ap. 1-7.  aRamularia collo-cygni is now recognized as an important pathogen of barley in Northern Europe and New Zealand. It induces necrotic spotting and premature leaf senescence, leading to loss of green leaf area in crops, and can result in substantial yield losses. The fungus produces a number of anthraquinone toxins called rubellins, which act as host nonspecific toxins with photodynamic activity. These toxins induce lipid peroxidation and are possibly the cause of the chlorosis and necrosis observed in leaves infected with R. collo-cygni. The fact that the fungus can remain latent in barley plants until flowering, coupled with its very slow growth in vitro, makes it difficult to detect in crops. As a result, the epidemiology of this pathogen remains poorly understood. However, the recent development of rapid and reliable PCR methods for specific detection of R. collo-cygni offers the prospect of increased understanding of its epidemiology and improved disease control. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aRamularia 3aanthraquinones 3abarley 3achlorosis 3acrops 3adisease control 3aepidemiology 3aflowering 3afungi 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3anecrosis 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atoxins 2aAscomycotaxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aHordeumxmicrobiology 2aMycotoxinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 3aNew Zealand 3aNorthern European region 0aEurope 0aNew Zealand 0aRamularia collo-cygni 0arubellins1 aHavis, Neil D.1 aOxley, Simon J.P.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Feb., v. 279, no. 1 p.1-7dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00986.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02526naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188072000900197100001600206245009900222300001800321500002400339520078700363650002001150650001401170650001901184650002101203650003601224650001201260650001601272650001901288650001801307650002901325650001701354650001601371650001601387650002301403650001201426650003001438650003701468650001101505650002801516650003001544650004901574700002201623700001801645700001601663773009201679852000901771856007501780930003301855945002501888946001101913655001201924IND4383483420221120022213.0060911e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438348342DNAL7 a168871562pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aSadeghi, A.10aDeterrent activity of plant lectins on cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) oviposition  ap. 2078-2084.  aIncludes references  aA set of 14 plant lectins was screened in a binary choice bioassay for inhibitory activity on cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) oviposition.

However, no clear correlation could be established between deterrent activity and sugar-binding specificity/molecular structure of the lectins. Increasing the insect density reduced the inhibitory effect of the lectins confirming that female insects are capable of adjusting their oviposition rates as a function of host availability. 3aCicer arietinum 3achickpeas 3aArum maculatum 3aArachis hypogaea 3achemical constituents of plants 3alectins 3aagglutinins 3ainsect control 3adose response 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3aoviposition 3apopulation density 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxdrug effects. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aOvipositionxdrug effects 2aPlant Lectinsxclassificationxpharmacology.1 aDamme, E.J.M. van1 aPeumans, W.J.1 aSmagghe, G.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Sept., v. 67, no. 18 p.2078-2084dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.0323electronic resource  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/09/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03482naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001900197245008900216300001800305500002400323500001500347520124100362650002701603650001501630650002201645650002101667650001801688650001701706650003701723650002201760650003601782650001501818650001201833650006601845650004101911650002501952650002901977650004102006650002402047650003202071650004502103650002802148650004802176650006302224651001102287653001702298653002502315653003102340653001802371653001502389653002302404700001702427700001502444700001702459700002302476700001602499773009202515852000902607856007502616930003302691945002502724946001102749655001202760IND4383483320221120022339.0060911e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438348332DNAL7 a169306422pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aL823 0aX3801 aMuzitano, M.F.14aThe antileishmanial activity assessment of unusual flavonoids from Kalanchoe pinnata  ap. 2071-2077.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe importance of flavonoids for the antileishmanial activity of Kalanchoe pinnata was previously demonstrated by the isolation of quercitrin, a potent antileishmanial flavonoid. In the present study, the aqueous leaf extract from the medicinal plant K. pinnata (Crassulaceae) afforded a kaempferol di-glycoside, named kapinnatoside, identified as kaempferol 3-O-α-l-arabinopyranosyl (1 to 2) α-l-rhamnopyranoside (1). In addition, two unusual flavonol and flavone glycosides already reported, quercetin 3-O-α-l-arabinopyranosyl (1 to 2) α-l-rhamnopyranoside (2) and 4',5-dihydroxy-3',8-dimethoxyflavone 7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (3), have been isolated. Their structures were determined via analyses of mono and bi-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic experiments and HR-MALDI mass spectra. Because of its restricted occurrence and its abundance in K. pinnata, flavonoid (2) may be a chemical marker for this plant species of high therapeutic potential. The three flavonoids were tested separately against Leishmania amazonenis amastigotes in comparison with quercitrin, quercetin and afzelin. The quercetin aglycone - type structure, as well as a rhamnosyl unit linked at C-3, seem to be important for antileishmanial activity. 3aLeishmania amazonensis 3akaempferol 3aKalanchoe pinnata 3amedicinal plants 3aleishmaniasis 3ahuman health 3astructure-activity relationships 3aspectral analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3aglycosides 2aAnimals 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aKalanchoexchemistry 2aLeishmaniaxdrug effects 2aMannosidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Structure 2aParasitic Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aProanthocyanidinsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aQuercetinxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxpharmacology. 3aBrazil 0aCrassulaceae 0aBryophyllum pinnatum 0aantileishmanial properties 0akapinnatoside 0aflavonoids 0achemical structure1 aTinoco, L.W.1 aGuette, C.1 aKaiser, C.R.1 aRossi-Bergmann, B.1 aCosta, S.S.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Sept., v. 67, no. 18 p.2071-2077dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.0273electronic resource  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/09/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03107naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153100001700162245013800179300001600317500002400333520146600357650001801823650002401841650001101865650002001876650002701896650003001923650002201953650001501975650002401990650001802014650001402032650001002046650002602056650000802082650003002090650005802120650002002178653003102198700001902229700001702248700001602265700001902281773012202300852000902422856007702431930003302508945002502541946001102566655001202577IND4383483920221117170245.0060911e20060901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438348392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aAndersen, B.10aReal-time PCR quantification of the AM-toxin gene and HPLC qualification of toxigenic metabolites from Alternaria species from apples  ap. 105-111.  aIncludes references  aSome Alternaria species are able to produce plant pathogenic as well as toxic metabolites. In both agriculture and the food industry it is important know if toxigenic Alternaria are present to rapidly employ the correct corrective actions. The purpose of this work was to establish a real-time PCR method, which can detect and quantify apple pathogenic and toxigenic Alternaria. An AM-toxin I primer set, which could recognize Alternaria DNA only, was designed by using primers complementary to the AM-toxin I gene. The method could detect small amounts of DNA (4 pg) and still obtain a large dynamic range (4 decades) without interference from apple material. Eight Alternaria isolates were analyzed for the presence of AM-toxin I gene and their production of secondary metabolites. Then analyses showed that all eight isolates contained the AM toxin gene and were able to produce the plant pathogenic tentoxin in addition to AM toxin I. The analyses also showed the production of tenuazonic acid, alternariols, Altenuene, altenusin and/or altertoxin I in pure culture. Analyses of inoculated apples showed that both the AM-toxin gene and alternariol monomethyl ether could be detected. Morphological analyses suggested that the eight Alternaria strains, though they all carried the AM toxin genes, probably belong to different but closely related un-described Alternaria taxa in the A. tenuissima species-group based on morphological and chemical differences. 3afood industry 3aon-farm food safety 3aapples 3aMalus domestica 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal diseases of plants 3atoxigenic strains 3aAlternaria 3amicrobial detection 3arapid methods 3avirulence 3agenes 3asecondary metabolites 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aplant pathology 0amolecular screening method1 aSmedsgaard, J.1 aJørring, I.1 aSkouboe, P.1 aPedersen, L.H.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 111, no. 2 p.105-111dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.04.0213electronic resource  a20061025b20061102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/10/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02898naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001700179245008600196300001800282500002400300500001500324520097700339650001301316650001901329650002601348650001801374650001701392650001101409650001501420650003601435650001401471650002301485650006401508650006301572650002201635650003801657650002601695650001101721650002801732650006201760650002401822650003001846650002301876650002301899650002401922651000901946651000901955653002301964653001701987653002302004773009202027852000902119856007502128930003302203945002502236946001102261655001202272IND4383481520221123041627.0060911e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438348152DNAL7 a168898062pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aJassbi, A.R.10aChemistry and biological activity of secondary metabolites in Euphorbia from Iran  ap. 1977-1984.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe chemical constituents of some species of Euphorbia, which grow mostly in semi-desert areas in Iran and on the Alborz Mountains in the north of Tehran, have been found to include chemotaxonomically important myrsinane diterpenoids and cycloartane triterpenoids. The Euphorbia plants collected in province of Azarbaijan in the northwestern part of Iran contained mostly derivatives of skin-irritating ingenol esters. Some of the diterpenoids with myrsinane carbon skeleton inhibited enzymes such as α-glycosidase, urease, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and prolyl endopeptidase. They also showed analgesic and DNA-damaging activities. The present review describes the chemistry and biological activity of several compounds isolated from different species of Iranian Euphorbia: diterpenoids with myrsinane skeletons, flavonoids, tannins, alkanes, sterols, mono-, sesqui- and triterpenoids, skin-irritating and tumor-promoting latexes and their active ingenol diterpenoids. 3asteroids 3aessential oils 3asecondary metabolites 3atriterpenoids 3aditerpenoids 3aesters 3aflavonoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3aEuphorbia 3aphenolic compounds 2aCarcinogensxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aDiterpenesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aEstersxchemistry 2aEuphorbiaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlavonoidsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aHydrocarbonsxchemistry 2aIrritantsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aMolecular Structure 2aOils, Volatilexchemistry 2aPhenolsxchemistry 2aSkinxdrug effects 2aSteroidsxchemistry 3aIran 0aIran 0aplant biochemistry 0ahydrocarbons 0aliterature reviews0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Sept., v. 67, no. 18 p.1977-1984dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.0303electronic resource  a20061113b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/09/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03400naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100001900171245012600190300001600316500002400332520205900356650001902415650002502434650002102459650002102480650002002501650002302521650002202544650002502566651002302591653002302614700002702637700001502664700002202679773008802701852000902789856007502798930003302873945002502906946001102931655001202942IND4422050620221123031020.0090619s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442205062DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ090232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aL100 0aF130 0aL5001 aTilahun Amede.10aHarnessing benefits from improved livestock water productivity in crop livestock systems of sub-Saharan Africa: synthesis  ap. 169-178.  aIncludes references  aThe threat of water scarcity in sub-Saharan Africa is real, due to the expanding agricultural needs, climate variability and inappropriate land use. Livestock keeping is the fastest growing agricultural sector, partly because of increasing and changing demands for adequate, quality and diverse food for people, driven by growing incomes and demographic transitions. Besides the economic benefits, rising livestock production could also deplete water and aggravate water scarcity at local and global scales. The insufficient understanding of livestock-water interactions also led to low livestock productivity, impeded sound decision on resources management and undermined achieving positive returns on investments in agricultural water across sub-Saharan Africa. Innovative and integrated measures are required to improve water productivity and reverse the growing trends of water scarcity. Livestock water productivity (LWP), which is defined as the ratio of livestock outputs to the amount of water depleted, could be improved through: (i) raising the efficiency of the water inputs by integrating livestock with crop, water and landscape management policies and practices. Improving feed water productivity by maximising transpiration and minimising evaporation and other losses is critical; (ii) increasing livestock outputs through improved feed management, veterinary services and introducing system-compatible breeds; and (iii) because livestock innovation is a social process, it is not possible to gain LWP improvements unless close attention is paid to policies, institutions and their associated processes. Policies targeting infrastructure development would help livestock keepers secure access to markets, veterinary services and knowledge. This paper extracts highlights from various papers presented in the special issue of The Rangeland Journal on technologies and practices that would enable improving water productivity at various scales and the premises required to reverse the negative trends of water depletion and land degradation. 3awater quantity 3alivestock production 3arange management 3awater management 3awater resources 3agrazing management 3aissues and policy 3adeveloping countries 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aliterature reviews1 aDescheemaeker, Katrien1 aPeden, Don1 avan Rooyen, Andre0 tRangeland journal.g2009, v. 31, no. 2 p.169-178dCSIRO Publishingx1036-98727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ090233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090721b20090801c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/07/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03184naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001800185245013000203300001600333500002400349520170100373650001602074650001002090650001202100650001002112650002702122650001302149650001402162650003502176650001302211650001402224650001702238650001302255650002402268650001502292650002102307651001102328700001602339700001502355700001302370773012002383852000902503856007302512930003302585945002502618946001102643655001202654IND4383480120221123030906.0060911e20060823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438348012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM310 0aW000 0aL600 0aM0011 aLinderoth, M.10aSex steroids in the female zebrafish (Danio rerio): Effects of cyproterone acetate and leachate-contaminated sediment extract  ap. 192-200.  aIncludes references  aIn Molnbyggen, a leachate-contaminated lake in Sweden, effects on the reproductive system of perch included a decreased frequency of sexually mature female perch, reduced gonadosomatic index and decreased plasma levels of androstenedione and testosterone, but the contaminants responsible for these effects have not yet been identified. A biomarker-directed fractionation approach could be used to narrow the search for the compound(s) responsible for the adverse effects in Molnbyggen female perch. Thus, it is important to develop and test a suitable biomarker, which can be used in this type of approach. We evaluated if decreased concentrations of sex steroids could work as an in vivo end-point in female zebrafish fed an organic extract of bottom sediments from Molnbyggen. The responsiveness of zebrafish to endocrine alteration was evaluated using a positive control substance, cyproterone acetate (CA), which is known to inhibit steroid biosynthesis. After the 21-day exposure period the concentrations of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) were successfully determined by HRGC/HRMS in whole-body homogenates of individual fish. Median T concentrations were 1.7 pmol/g fish in controls and were decreased after exposure both to CA (0.55 pmol/g fish) and Molnbyggen sediment extract (1.2-1.3 pmol/g fish). Median E2 concentrations were 5.3 pmol/g fish in controls and were decreased after CA exposure (2.3 pmol/g fish) and after exposure to Molnbyggen sediment extract (4.0-4.5 pmol/g fish). This suggests that sex steroid concentrations in zebrafish are responsive to endocrine alteration and indicates that compounds with endocrine altering potency are present in Molnbyggen sediments. 3aDanio rerio 3aperch 3afemales 3alakes 3asediment contamination 3aacetates 3aleachates 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3asteroids 3aestradiol 3atestosterone 3aspawning 3aanimal reproduction 3abiomarkers 3atoxicity testing 3aSweden1 aLedesma, M.1 aZebuhr, Y.1 aBalk, L.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2006 Aug. 23, v. 79, no. 2 p.192-200dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.06.0113electronic resource  a20070111b20070202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/01/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03442naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245011600193300001600309520114100325650002401466650003201490650001001522650001301532650001401545650001101559650000901570650003001579650004501609650003301654650001801687650002101705650002301726650003001749650004101779650002201820650001301842650001401855650001101869650002501880650002801905650008501933650006302018650003002081650004602111650004702157650002702204650002702231651001302258651001302271653001802284653002602302653004002328653002402368700002302392700001702415700001902432700002502451773012302476852000902599856009202608930003302700946001102733655001202744IND4392458620221123013826.0070617e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439245862DNAL7 a175594022pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00769.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurcia, Martha I.10aMolecular features of Mycobacterium avium human isolates carrying a single copy of IS1245 and IS1311 per genome  ap. 229-237.  aHuman clinical isolates of the Mycobacterium avium complex, from hospitals in Bogotá, were studied using a wide range of molecular tests including PCR restriction-enzyme analysis (PRA) of the hsp65 gene. Up to 21 of the isolates were identified as M. avium PRA variant III (Mav III), a variant obtained only from isolates on the American continent. In contrast to previous reports, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using IS1245 and IS1311 showed a single copy for each insertion sequence (IS) in the majority (19/21) of the Colombian Mav III isolates under study. In order to analyse whether the ISs were inserted in a relevant genomic region, experimental conditions were established to determine the insertion loci of each single copy of both ISs in the genome. Analysis of genomic insertion loci indicated that both IS1245 and IS1311 were present in areas containing putatively truncated integrases and/or transposases, which may have an influence on the mobility of the inserted IS. In addition, a conserved genomic region was identified for the insertion of IS1311; this region could be part of the IS1311 itself. 3aMycobacterium avium 3aMycobacterium avium complex 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3aloci 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aGenotype 2aHospitals 2aHumans 2aIntegrasesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycobacterium avium Complexxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMycobacterium avium-intracellulare Infectionxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTransposasesxgenetics 3aColombia 0aColombia 0aIS1245/IS1311 0ahsp65 PRA variant III 0ainsertion sequence flanking regions 0aligase-mediated PCR1 aGarcía, María J.1 aOtal, Isabel1 aGómez, Ana.B.1 aMenéndez, M.

This study examined the effects of sesamin on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced endothelial dysfunction. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by measuring the expression levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). To assess the pro-inflammatory effects of oxLDL, ELISA was used to detect IL-8 expression, endothelin-1 (ET-1) secretion, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. The expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin) was examined by flow cytometry. In addition, several apoptotic signaling pathways were also investigated. The data showed that sesamin significantly ameliorated oxLDL-induced ROS generation and SOD-1 inactivation. Sesamin also attenuated the oxLDL-induced activation of NF-κB, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of sesamin on IL-8 and ET-1 release, adhesion molecule expression, and the adherence of THP-1 cells were at least partially through the blockade of NF-κB activation. Furthermore, sesamin attenuated oxLDL-induced apoptotic features, such as intracellular calcium accumulation and the subsequent collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3. Results from this study may provide insight into possible molecular mechanisms underlying sesamin’s beneficial effects against oxLDL-mediated vascular endothelial dysfunction. 3ainflammation 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aoxidative stress 3aendothelial cells 3alow density lipoprotein 3asesame oil 3afunctional foods 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aDioxolesxpharmacology 2aE-Selectinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndothelial Cellsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLignansxpharmacology 2aLipoproteins, LDLximmunology 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPregnancy 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0asesamin1 aOu, Hsiu-Chung1 aWu, Jingmei.1 aLee, I-te1 aLin, Shih-Yi1 aLin, Liyun.1 aTsai, Kun-Ling1 aLee, Shin-Da1 aSheu, Wayne Huey-Herng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Dec. 9, v. 57, no. 23 p.11406–11417-11406–11417dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf902876p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/12  aOther US 7aarticle02943naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001900165245007300184300002200257500002400279520118000303650002301483650001601506650001101522650002501533650000901558650001801567650001001585650001801595650001501613650002101628650001201649650005501661650005601716650001101772650001501783650001201798650001601810650002201826650000901848650002501857650002101882650002101903700002101924700002701945700002001972700002401992773018002016852000902196856007702205930003302282945002502315946001302340655001202353IND4430231520221122231044.0091218e20091209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443023152DNAL7 a199510022pmid7 a10.1021/jf901972c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aTourino, Sonia10aPhenolic Metabolites of Grape Antioxidant Dietary Fiber in Rat Urine  ap. 11418–11426.  aIncludes references  aGrape antioxidant dietary fiber (GADF) combines the putative health benefits of fiber and polyphenols. Polyphenolic metabolites may play a key role in the overall biological effects of this supplement. We identified phenolic GADF metabolites in rat urine at different times after oral administration, using HPLC−ESI-MS/MS techniques. The phenolic metabolic outcome of GADF is essentially an array of mono- and polyconjugated epicatechins and free or conjugated smaller phenolic acids, some of them never reported before. We have detected 18 mono-, di-, and triconjugates of epicatechin with glucuronide, methyl and sulfate moieties and small phenolic acids both free and conjugated. The results suggest that the procyanidin oligomers are both depolymerized in the digestive tract into epicatechin conjugates and degraded by the colonic microbiota into phenolic acids and their conjugates. For several hours after ingestion of GADF, a great variety of phenolic species, including some with an intact catechol group, are in contact with the digestive tract tissues before, during and after metabolization, and many of them are systemically bioavailable before being excreted. 3aphenolic compounds 3ametabolites 3agrapes 3aantioxidant activity 3arats 3aanimal models 3aurine 3adietary fiber 3atest meals 3afunctional foods 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aFlavonoids 2aPhenols 2aPolyphenols 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aUrinexchemistry 2aVitisxchemistry1 aFuguet, Elisabet1 aVinardell, Maria Pilar1 aCascante, Marta1 aTorres, Josep Lluis0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Dec. 9, v. 57, no. 23 p.11418–11426-11418–11426dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf901972c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/12  aOther US 7aarticle03643naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001800166245013900184300001400323500002400337520194100361650001902302650001202321650001902333650002302352650001702375650002002392650002402412650002302436650002402459650001302483650002302496650002102519650002302540650001802563650001602581650002102597650001502618650001602633650001502649650001902664650002002683650001502703651001302718700002102731700002102752700002002773773009402793852000902887856008802896930003302984945002503017946001103042655001203053IND4430231120221122230951.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443023112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2009.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ5001 aSugihara, Soh10aEffect of land management and soil texture on seasonal variations in soil microbial biomass in dry tropical agroecosystems in Tanzania  ap. 80-88.  aIncludes references  aSoil microbes are an essential component of most terrestrial ecosystems; as decomposers they are responsible for regulating nutrient dynamics, and they also serve as a highly labile nutrient pool. Here, we evaluated seasonal variations in microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) as well as microbial activity (as qCO₂) for 16 months with respect to several factors relating to soil moisture and nutrients under different land management practices (plant residue application, fertilizer application) in both clayey (38% clay) and sandy (4% clay) croplands in Tanzania. We observed that MBC and MBN tended to decrease during the rainy season whereas they tended to increase and remain at high levels during the dry season in all treatment plots at both of our test sites, although soil moisture did not correlate with MBC or MBN. qCO₂ correlated with soil moisture in all treatment plots at both sites, and hence soil microbes act as decomposers mainly during the rainy season. Although the effect of seasonal variation of soil moisture on the dynamics of MBC, MBN, and qCO₂ was certainly greater than that attributable to plant residue application, fertilizer application, or soil texture, plant residue application early in the rainy season clearly increased MBC and MBN in both clayey and sandy soils. This suggests that plant residue application can help to not only counter the N loss caused by leaching but also synchronize crop N uptake and N release from soil microbes by utilizing these microbes as an ephemeral nutrient pool during the early crop growth period. We also found substantially large seasonal variations in MBC and MBN, continuously high qCO₂, and rapid turnover of soil microbes in sandy soil compared to clayey soil. Taken together, our results indicate that soil microbes, acting as both a nutrient pool and decomposers, have a more substantial impact on tropical sandy soil than on clayey soil. 3aagroecosystems 3atropics 3atropical soils 3aagricultural soils 3asoil texture 3aland management 3asoil microorganisms 3aseasonal variation 3asoil organic carbon 3anitrogen 3amicrobial activity 3asoil respiration 3asoil water content 3acrop residues 3afertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3aclay soils 3asandy soils 3adry season 3abiodegradation 3anutrient uptake 3awet season 3aTanzania1 aFunakawa, Shinya1 aKilasara, Method1 aKosaki, Takashi0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.80-88dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2009.10.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03845naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002100182245013100203300001600334500002400350520177100374650002402145650001902169650002302188650001402211650002502225650002302250650002502273650001302298650005302311650002202364650002302386650002302409650001702432650001102449650001702460650002002477650001002497650000902507650004602516650002802562650001102590650001102601650001902612650002302631650000902654650001602663650001502679650002102694650001702715650004802732650001602780700002102796700001802817700002102835700002402856773009002880852000902970856008502979930003303064945002503097946001303122655001203135IND4430228320221122181759.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022832DNAL7 a195155342pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2009.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aPlayer, Marty S.10aModerate alcohol intake is associated with decreased risk of insulin resistance among individuals with vitamin D insufficiency  ap. 100-105.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To determine whether moderate alcohol intake modifies the association between low vitamin D levels and insulin resistance (IR), we hypothesized that moderate alcohol intake would have a modifying effect on IR in people with low vitamin D levels. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of subjects ≥20 y old without a history of diabetes, coronary heart disease, or stroke in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2004. Main outcome was IR status measured by homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR;≥2.6) and fasting insulin (>12.2 μU/mL) in moderate drinkers compared with non-drinkers by vitamin D levels (deficient ≤20 ng/mL, insufficient 21-32 ng/mL, normal >32 ng/mL). Results: Two thousand seven hundred twenty-one subjects met the inclusion criteria, representing a weighted total of >138 million people. Of these, 34% were vitamin D deficient and 47% insufficient. In adjusted analysis, compared with moderate drinkers with normal vitamin D levels, non-drinkers had no increased risk of IR by HOMA-IR levels (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-2.30). Vitamin D-deficient individuals had a higher risk of IR regardless of alcohol consumption (moderate drinkers OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.41-3.19; non-drinkers OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.29-3.83). However, in those with insufficient vitamin D levels, moderate alcohol intake had a modifying effect on the odds of IR, with no difference seen in moderate drinkers (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.92-1.80) and an increased risk found in non-drinkers (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.07-3.11). Similar results were seen with fasting insulin. Conclusion: Moderate alcohol consumption appears to have a modifying effect on the risk of IR in individuals with insufficient levels of vitamin D. 3aalcoholic beverages 3arisk reduction 3ainsulin resistance 3avitamin D 3avitamin deficiencies 3anutritional status 3anutritional adequacy 3adiabetes 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3adisease incidence 3adisease prevention 3adisease prevalence 3amalnutrition 3aadults 3adiet therapy 3ahuman nutrition 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAlcohol Drinkingxbloodxphysiopathology. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOdds Ratio 2aReference Values 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxbloodxcomplications. 2aYoung Adult1 aMainous, Arch G.1 aKing, Dana E.1 aDiaz, Vanessa A.1 aEverett, Charles J.0 tNutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.100-105dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2009.03.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle02592naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008600202300001800288506007600306520127700382506003701659650002301696650001401719650001601733650001501749650001601764650001801780650001201798650001901810700002701829700002701856773017301883852000902056856008302065930003302148946001302181655001202194IND4433282120221207123958.0100228e20100223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443328212DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09110271072doi7 aPMC28405172pmcid7 a201335792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Soonjin10aSpontaneous assembly and active disassembly balance adherens junction homeostasis  ap. 3528-3533.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe homeostasis of adherens junctions was studied using E-cadherin and its two mutants tagged by the photoconvertible protein Dendra2 in epithelial A-431 cells and in CHO cells lacking endogenous cadherin. The first mutant contained point mutations of two elements, Lys738 and the dileucine motif that suppressed cadherin endocytosis. The second mutant contained, in addition, an extensive truncation that uncoupled the mutant from β-catenin and p120. Surprisingly, the intact cadherin and its truncated mutant were recruited into the junctions with identical kinetics. The full-size cadherin was actively removed from the junctions by a process that was unaffected by the inactivation of its endocytic elements. The cadherin's apparent half-residence time in the junction was about 2 min. Cadherin clusters made of the truncated mutant exhibited much slower but ATP-independent junctional turnover. Taken together, our experiments showed that adherens junction homeostasis consists of three distinctive steps: cadherin spontaneous recruitment, its lateral catenin-dependent association, and its active release from the resulting clusters. The latter process, whose mechanism is not clear, may play an important role in various kinds of normal and abnormal morphogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadherens junctions 3acadherins 3aendocytosis 3aepithelium 3ahomeostasis 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3apoint mutation1 aTroyanovsky, Regina B.1 aTroyanovsky, Sergey M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 23, v. 107, no. 8 p.3528-3533dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09110271073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02594naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146100001800163245010300181300001600284500002400300520123600324650002501560650003301585650002501618650001501643650002501658650001501683650001801698653002401716653002301740653002001763653002001783653001901803700001601822700001501838700002101853773014501874852000902019856004902028930003302077945002502110946001302135655001202148IND4408347620221122181828.0080731s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440834762DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.24499) @20082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In order to better understand the interactions among the variables and the factors governing the process of degradation in the ponds and to identify the predominant factors in every stage (pond) of the treatment system, the principal components analysis (PCA) was employed in this study. The work was performed in an experimental treatment system comprising a primary (an equalizer, a settling tank, and two anaerobic ponds), a secondary (a high rate algal pond), and a tertiary treatment step (two maturation ponds and one water hyacinth pond), in series. The PCA was applied for the secondary and the tertiary steps of the treatment. It was evident that in the high rate algal pond (HRAP), the main artificial factors were: nutrient removal, algae growth and stabilization process; in the first maturation pond (MP1), nutrient removal, aerobic conditions and organic matter concentration; in the second maturation pond (MP2), nutrient removal and algae growth; and in the water hyacinth pond (WHP), nutrient removal, temperature, and algae growth. The PCA showed the importance of the aerobic conditions associated with the efficient performance of the treatment system. 3abiological treatment 3aprincipal component analysis 3awastewater treatment 3apig manure 3aEichhornia crassipes 3amicroalgae 3awaste lagoons 0asecondary treatment 0atertiary treatment 0asecondary ponds 0awaste treatment 0atertiary ponds1 aBarthel, L.1 aLoesch, C.1 aOliveira, P.A.V.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2008, v. 24, no. 3 p.373-378dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.24499) @2008  a20080820b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/20  aOther US 7aarticle02068naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245006800162300001600230520117800246650001601424653001801440653001501458653003101473653002001504773011601524852000901640856008501649930003301734946001101767655001201778IND4407532520221122181750.0080704e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440753252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0989-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlier, E. 10aComparison of three models of dispersion in dual porosity media  ap. 433-440.  aThe work presented in this paper shows that the probabilistic approach as well as the fractional Brownian motion model are reliable to simulate the dispersion of contaminant in the dual porosity media. Three models were tested on experimental data obtained by tracer tests in chalk characterized by a primary and a secondary porosity: a numerical model (MT3DMS), a probabilistic model based on the Bayesian approach and a fractional Brownian model. By using Einstein's rule, it is demonstrated that the dispersion coefficient is time dependent and that the dispersion is ballistic which is a particular case of superdiffusion. A test of sensitivity was carried out and shows that the numerical model is slightly suitable to simulate the concentration in time and space for a given discharge starting from the physical parameters obtained by calibration for an other discharge because of the great sensitivity of its parameters according to the hydrodynamic conditions. On the other hand, the variability of the parameters of the two other models does not generate important errors on the values of simulated concentrations when other hydrodynamic conditions are considered. 3aprobability 0aDual porosity 0aDispersion 0aFractional Brownian motion 0aNumerical model0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 July, v. 55, no. 2 p.433-440dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0989-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080704b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02988naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008100169300001600250520143900266650002701705650002501732650001701757650001401774650001501788650002501803650002401828650001101852650001401863651001201877651001201889651001101901651001601912651001101928653001601939653002501955653001401980653003101994700001902025700001802044700001802062700001302080700001702093700001902110700001802129700001702147700001302164773011202177852000902289856009202298930003302390946001102423655001202434IND4403279620221122181832.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440327962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2007.01739.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehtinen, A.10aPhenotypic variation in Nordic populations of Phytophthora infestans in 2003  ap. 227-234.  aA total of 743 single-lesion isolates of Phytophthora infestans were collected in summer 2003 from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Most of the isolates were tested for mating type, and subsets were tested for sensitivity to fungicides and virulence (host specific pathogenicity). Approximately 60% of the isolates were A1 mating type in each country. Both mating types were present in 40% of the fields where more than one isolate was tested, indicating strong potential for sexual reproduction. The proportion of metalaxyl-resistant isolates dropped to under 15% from the 60% observed in the early 1990s in Norway and Finland, possibly due to lower selection pressure because of decreased use of metalaxyl. Propamocarb-HCl sensitivity remained unchanged in the Nordic countries compared to the situation in 1997-2000 in Finland. Four isolates collected from Finland and Sweden were able to sporulate in the presence of this fungicide at a concentration of 1000 mg L⁻¹. In Norway and Finland the frequencies of virulence factors and pathotypes remained nearly unchanged since the 1990s, but the mean number of virulence factors per isolate increased from 5·6 to 6·3. In Denmark and Sweden virulence factors 2 and especially 6 were more common than in Norway and Finland. In addition, in the Swedish population the frequencies of pathotypes were quite even while in other countries pathotype 1,3,4,7,10,11 was most prevalent. 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aherbicide resistance 3amating types 3ametalaxyl 3apathotypes 3aphenotypic variation 3asexual reproduction 3asummer 3avirulence 3aDenmark 3aFinland 3aNorway 3aScandinavia 3aSweden 0amating type 0ametalaxyl resistance 0apathotype 0apropamocarb-HCl resistance1 aHannukkala, A.1 aAndersson, B.1 aHermansen, A.1 aLe, V.H.1 aNærstad, R.1 aBrurberg, M.B.1 aNielsen, B.J.1 aHansen, J.G.1 aYuen, J.0 tPlant pathology.g2008 Apr., v. 57, no. 2 p.227-234dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2007.01739.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03776naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001900173245013200192300001600324500002400340520161900364650001501983650001301998650000902011650001402020650001502034650002002049650001902069650001602088650002002104650001902124650002302143650001702166650001802183650001702201650001402218650001802232650001202250650005802262650002202320650004902342650001102391650004602402650006002448650003202508650004502540650000902585650001702594650005602611650004602667650004502713650005302758700001802811700001802829773009002847852000902937856008502946930003303031945002503064946001303089655001203102IND4430228420221122151935.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022842DNAL7 a195961852pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2009.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aDemirkan, Arda10aEndotoxin level in ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats: Effect of glutamine pretreatment on endotoxin levels and gut morphology  ap. 106-111.  aIncludes references  aObjective: We aimed to investigate the effect of enteral glutamine (Gln) pretreatment on plasma endotoxin level and intestinal histopathologic changes during intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Methods: Intestinal I/R was induced by 60-min occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery followed by 60min of reperfusion. Animals were pretreated with Gln by orogastric route for different periods and doses. To investigate the effects of gut decontamination on intestinal I/R injury, animals were pretreated with neomycin sulfate and erythromycin phosphate by orogastric route. In another series, dl-α-tocopherol hydrogen succinate was used to investigate the effects of vitamin E on intestinal I/R injury. Plasma endotoxin level was measured by the colorimetric “limulus amebocyte lysate” test. Intestinal mucosal injury was scored on a scale described by Chiu et al. (Archive in Surgery 1970;101:478-483). Results: Intestinal I/R increased the plasma endotoxin level and worsened the histopathologic score significantly. Gln pretreatment (1g/kg) for 4 d reduced the I/R-induced elevation of plasma endotoxin level. However, a significant improvement in histopathologic score could only be achieved when the pretreatment was given for 7 d. Antibiotic pretreatment lowered plasma endotoxin level without affecting the I/R-induced histopathologic changes, whereas vitamin E pretreatment affected plasma endotoxin level and histopathologic changes. Conclusion: These results suggest a lack of association between plasma endotoxin level and intestinal histopathologic alterations in intestinal I/R. 3aendotoxins 3aischemia 3arats 3aglutamine 3aintestines 3adecontamination 3ahistopathology 3aantibiotics 3adisease control 3adisease course 3adisease prevalence 3ahuman health 3ahealth status 3adiet therapy 3avitamin E 3aanimal models 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aEndotoxinsxblood 2aErythromycinxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aFemale 2aGlutaminexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aIntestinal Mucosaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMesenteric Artery, Superior 2aNeomycinxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReperfusion Injuryxbloodxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aVitamin Expharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aVitaminsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aalpha-Tocopherolxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use.1 aSavaş, Berna1 aMelli, Mehmet0 tNutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.106-111dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2009.04.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle02910naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100002100194245008300215300001600298500002400314520122400338650001301562650001401575650003501589650001301624650001901637650001901656650002401675650002501699650001701724650001501741650002301756650002701779650002301806650001901829650001601848650002301864650001701887653002701904653002201931700001701953700001601970773019101986852000902177856008902186930003302275945002502308946001102333655001202344IND4408351620221122151916.0080731e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440835162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2008.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aQ106 0aQ116 0aQ406 0aQ5061 aChotimarkorn, C.10aAntioxidative effects of rice bran extracts on refined tuna oil during storage  ap. 616-622.  aIncludes references  aAntioxidative and compositional effects of methanolic crude long grain rice bran extracts (0.025%, 0.05% and 0.1% w/w) on oxidative stability of tuna oil were determined from changes in fatty acid composition, oxygen consumption, peroxide value (PV), p-anisidine value, relative % of residual tocopherol, phenolic and gamma-oryzanol contents during storage at 30 °C for 30 days as compared to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) 0.01% (w/w).

In conclusion, this result revealed that methanolic crude long grain rice bran extracts added to tuna oil can significantly retard the process of lipid peroxidation during storage. 3atuna oil 3arice bran 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3amethanol 3aplant extracts 3afood additives 3aoxidative stability 3aantioxidant activity 3afood storage 3ashelf life 3alipid peroxidation 3afatty acid composition 3aoxygen consumption 3aperoxide value 3atocopherols 3aphenolic compounds 3aautoxidation 0agamma-oryzanol content 0ap-anisidine value1 aBenjakul, S.1 aSilalai, N.0 tFood research international.g2008 July, v. 41, no. 6 p.616-622dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2008.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20081112b20081206c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03773naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002300191245014500214300001400359500002400373500001500397520145500412650002001867650001601887650001801903650001401921650002301935650002501958650001701983650001902000650001402019650002002033650001102053650002202064650001502086650001002101650000902111650002002120650000902140650001702149650004502166650001102211650001002222650002402232650002402256650002002280650002102300650001102321650001502332650000902347650001602356650003602372650002102408650002402429650001602453651001302469651001602482651001402498651001102512651001402523651001102537651001602548651001302564653001802577700002202595700002602617700002302643773008802666852000902754856008502763930003302848945002502881946001302906655001202919IND4430229020221122151856.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022902DNAL7 a195922222pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2009.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT300 0aX3801 aVossenaar, Marieke10aConcordance with dietary and lifestyle population goals for cancer prevention in Dutch, Scottish, Mexican, and Guatemalan population samples  ap. 40-52.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjectives: We assessed concordance with selected population goal components of the 1997 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) diet and lifestyle recommendations to decrease cancer risk across four population samples. Methods: This was a prospectively designed survey examining concordance with the population goals of the WCRF/AICR recommendations using target criteria across sites. Population samples were from the Netherlands, Scotland, Mexico, and Guatemala. A total of 3564 men and women aged 18 to 70 y were recruited in equal proportions by site and gender. Results: None of the four pooled samples met the target population average criteria for body mass index or refined sugar intake. The Guatemalan sample had concordance with the largest number of recommended cancer-prevention goals (10 of 12 selected WCRF/AICR components). Successively, Mexican, Scottish, and Dutch samples were concordant with seven, four, and three selected components, respectively. Conclusions: A prospectively designed research instrument and exhaustive prior examination of operative criteria allow for the assessment of group-level concordance with cancer-prevention goals. To the extent that the study samples reflect the respective national situations, geographic variance in concordance exists, with conditions and behaviors in Guatemala bringing that nation into more general compliance with the 1997 WCRF/AICR goals. 3abody mass index 3afood intake 3aenergy intake 3aneoplasms 3adisease prevention 3anutritional adequacy 3afood choices 3arisk reduction 3alifestyle 3adietary surveys 3aadults 3aprotective effect 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiet 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aGoals 2aGuideline Adherence 2aGuidelines as Topic 2aHealth Behavior 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasmsxprevention & control 2aNutrition Policy 2aProspective Studies 2aYoung Adult 3aScotland 3aNetherlands 3aGuatemala 3aMexico 0aGuatemala 0aMexico 0aNetherlands 0aScotland 0aeating habits1 aSolomons, Noel W.1 aValdés-Ramos, Roxana1 aAnderson, Annie S.0 tNutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.40-52dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2009.04.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle03173naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002400182245010200206300001200308500002400320520167600344650001802020650002502038650002202063650002502085650002302110650002502133650002202158650001702180650002102197650001602218650001002234650001002244650002302254650001602277650001802293650001102311650001102322650001802333653002302351700001802374773008602392852000902478856008502487930003302572945002502605946001302630655001202643IND4430228120221122133235.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022812DNAL7 a198049552pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2009.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT3001 aRenzaho, Andre M.N.10aFood security measurement in cultural pluralism: Missing the point or conceptual misunderstanding  ap. 1-9.  aIncludes references  aObjective: Food Security has become a global concern, yet its measurement has varied considerably across disciplines and countries. We examined the current discrepancies in the definitions of food security and propose a framework for understanding and measuring food security. Methods: This conceptual review draws from a range of works published in Medline and the gray literature to advance the understanding of food security concepts. We begin by examining the historical background of food security and then move on to examine its various definitions and interpret food through cultural lenses in terms of food access and utilization. We finish by examining various measurements and indicators of food security and reviewing implications for public health. Results: We argue that the reliance on coping strategies as surrogate measurements of food insecurity without taking into account the social, cultural, and political contexts in which they occur is misleading, and viewing food insecurity solely from a food access or availability perspective, without taking into account food utilization and asset creation as pillars of food security, paints an incomplete picture. Although this review does not claim to provide solutions to the discrepancies in the conceptual definition of food security, it attempts to highlights areas of concern and provide a way forward. Conclusion: When coping strategies are used as an indicator of food insecurity, they need to be culturally relevant and focus tested, and together with objective measurements of nutritional outcomes, would allow policy makers to make evidence-based decisions to inform social and nutrition policies. 3afood security 3acultural differences 3acoping strategies 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional status 3apsychosocial factors 3afood availability 3afocus groups 3afood consumption 3afood policy 2aAdult 2aChild 2aCultural Diversity 2aFood Supply 2aGlobal Health 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aPublic Health 0aliterature reviews1 aMellor, David0 tNutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.1-9dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2009.05.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle03081naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245007600204300001800280506007600298520153700374506003701911650001101948650001501959650001501974650002501989650000902014650001702023650000902040650001102049650001502060650001202075700002202087700001702109700001402126700002002140700001502160700002202175700002002197700002302217700002402240773017302264852000902437856008302446930003302529946001302562655001202575IND4433279020221207124223.0100228e20100223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443327902DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09058511062doi7 aPMC28404652pmcid7 a199663102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Vineet10aEpimorphic regeneration approach to tissue replacement in adult mammals  ap. 3351-3355.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUrodeles and fetal mammals are capable of impressive epimorphic regeneration in a variety of tissues, whereas the typical default response to injury in adult mammals consists of inflammation and scar tissue formation. One component of epimorphic regeneration is the recruitment of resident progenitor and stem cells to a site of injury. Bioactive molecules resulting from degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) have been shown to recruit a variety of progenitor and stem cells in vitro in adult mammals. The ability to recruit multipotential cells to the site of injury by in vivo administration of chemotactic ECM degradation products in a mammalian model of digit amputation was investigated in the present study. Adult, 6- to 8-week-old C57/BL6 mice were subjected to midsecond phalanx amputation of the third digit of the right hind foot and either treated with chemotactic ECM degradation products or left untreated. At 14 days after amputation, mice treated with ECM degradation products showed an accumulation of heterogeneous cells that expressed markers of multipotency, including Sox2, Sca1, and Rex1 (Zfp42). Cells isolated from the site of amputation were capable of differentiation along neuroectodermal and mesodermal lineages, whereas cells isolated from control mice were capable of differentiation along only mesodermal lineages. The present findings demonstrate the recruitment of endogenous stem cells to a site of injury, and/or their generation/proliferation therein, in response to ECM degradation products.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aamputation 3achemotaxis 3aextracellular matrix 3afeet 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodels 3astem cells 3atissues1 aJohnson, Scott A.1 aReing, Janet1 aZhang, Li1 aTottey, Stephen1 aWang, Gang1 aHirschi, Karen K.1 aBraunhut, Susan1 aGudas, Lorraine J.1 aBadylak, Stephen F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 23, v. 107, no. 8 p.3351-3355dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09058511063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01732naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245005800135300001400193300002800207500002300235520084100258650000901099650002501108650001201133650001201145650001001157650000901167650000801176653001301184700001801197773010601215852000901321939003301330945000801363946001101371655001201382991609379970742620221122133241.0870506s1986    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870008762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeathwood, P.D.10aPhosphatidylcholine, choline and cholinergic function  ap. 49-67.  ap. 49-67. ill., charts.  aLiterature review.  aA detailed review examines the thesis that phosphatidylcholine (PC) intake can accelerate in vivo acetylcholine biosynthesis by increasing blood and brain choline, thereby offering a viable therapeutic approach for senile dementia and mental degradation. Animal and human studies have shown that the consumption of a meal containing PC at 4-5 fold the typical daily choline intake results in 2-3 fold increase in plasma choline, and (in animals) increases the brain choline level by about 30 per cent. Studies in old animals also have shown that dosing with cholinomimetics or high levels of PC results in a marked improvement in behavior; however, human trials of PC therapy for senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease) have not proven successful. The limitations and prospects of these and other therapeutic approaches are discussed.(wz) 3adiet 3aphosphatidylcholines 3acholine 3aelderly 3abrain 3arats 3amen 0asenility1 aSchlosser, B.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1986, v. suppl.29 p.49-67x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19870506c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03562naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181100001400190245013900204300001400343500002400357520143700381650000901818650002801827650001301855650002001868650001001888650002001898650001901918650001501937650002101952650002101973650001201994650001802006650001402024650001202038650003002050650005202080650002102132650004602153650001102199650001302210650003902223650005102262650000902313650002602322650001402348650001902362650002202381650003702403650001902440650004502459650001102504700001502515700001802530700001702548700001402565773010202579852000902681856009302690930003302783945002502816946001102841655001202852IND4430227820221122092213.0091218e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022782DNAL7 a195778692pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL2101 aRota, Ada10aPregnancy and conception rate after two intravaginal inseminations with dog semen frozen either with 5% glycerol or 5% ethylene glycol  ap. 94-97.  aIncludes references  aThe primary goal of this study was to compare the effects of 5% ethylene glycol (EG) and 5% glycerol (G) on fertility of frozen-thawed dog semen following intravaginal insemination. The sperm-rich fraction of the ejaculate of three male dogs was collected, pooled and divided into two aliquots, and then frozen with a Tris-glucose-egg yolk-citric acid extender containing either 5% G or 5% EG. A total of 10 bitches were inseminated twice, five with G-frozen-thawed semen and five with EG-frozen-thawed semen; intravaginal inseminations were performed the 4th and the 5th day after the estimated LH peak; four straws, thawed in a 37°C water bath for 1min and diluted in a Tris buffer, were used for insemination (200×10⁶ spermatozoa); the insemination dose was introduced in the cranial vagina of the bitch using a sterile plastic catheter. Ovariohysterectomy was performed in all bitches between days 29 and 31 after the calculated LH surge, and pregnancy status, and the number of conceptuses and corpora lutea were recorded. All bitches were pregnant. Neither the number of conceptuses, nor the ratio of conceptuses to corpora lutea (conception rate) was significantly different between groups. In this first screening, with a limited number of bitches, EG-frozen semen did not show a higher fertility than G-frozen semen when used for two intravaginal inseminations. Irrespective of the semen used, conception rate was 0.50. 3adogs 3aartificial insemination 3aglycerol 3aethylene glycol 3asemen 3aembryo (animal) 3apregnancy rate 3aconception 3acryopreservation 3aanimal fertility 3aspaying 3acorpus luteum 3aconceptus 2aAnimals 2aCryopreservationxmethods 2aCryoprotective Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDogsxphysiology 2aEthylene Glycolxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aFreezing 2aGlycerolxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aInsemination, Artificialxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aPregnancy, Animal 2aSemenxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSemen Analysis 2aSemen Preservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aVagina1 aMilani, C.1 aRomagnoli, S.1 aZucchini, P.1 aMollo, A.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 Mar., v. 118, no. 1 p.94-97dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.06.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03612naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001800173245008100191300001600272500002400288500001500312520168900327650002302016650002302039650001702062650002002079650000902099650001002108650001202118650002002130650001302150650002602163650002202189650002502211650000902236650001202245650003902257650005302296650002202349650003202371650004002403650003402443650003602477650002402513650000902537650003102546650000902577650002502586653002902611653002602640700002202666700001902688773009002707852000902797856008502806930003302891945002502924946001302949655001202962IND4430228620221122092154.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022862DNAL7 a200054672pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2009.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aHara, Hiroshi10aDifructose anhydride III promotes iron absorption in the rat large intestine  ap. 120-127.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjectives: We examined the intestinal segment responsible for and the mechanisms involved in the non-digestible disaccharide difructose anhydride III (DFAIII)-mediated enhancement of iron absorption. Methods: Net iron and calcium absorption (percentage) were observed in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed an AIN93G-based diet with or without DFAIII (30 g/kg of diet) for 2 wk after cecectomy or laparotomy (experiment 1). The absorption rates of calcium and iron from ligated jejunal loops (experiment 2) or ligated cecal sacs (experiment 3) in anesthetized rats fed a control or DFA diet were observed with or without the addition of DFAIII to the instilled mucosal fluid. Levels of the major iron transporter divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1) mRNA per 28S rRNA were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the intestinal mucosa. Results: Net absorption (percentage) of iron and calcium was higher in the DFA group than in the DFA-free group in laparotomized rats. The enhancement of iron absorption was almost and calcium absorption was partly abolished by cecectomy. The absorption rate of calcium, but not of iron, from the jejunal loops was increased by the addition of DFAIII (100 mmol/L). Iron absorption was clearly higher in the ligated cecal sacs of the DFAIII-fed group than in the DFA-free group with or without the mucosal addition of DFAIII. DMT-1 mRNA level per 28S rRNA was maintained in the cecal mucosa through large increases in cecal size due to DFAIII feeding. Conclusion: The DFAIII-induced increases in iron absorption are the result of increased cecal iron absorptive capacity through expansion of the cecal mucosa maintaining DMT-1 mRNA expression. 3anutrient transport 3anutritional status 3atransporters 3airon absorption 3airon 3acecum 3acalcium 3anutrient uptake 3afructose 3anutrient deficiencies 3aintestinal mucosa 3anutrition assessment 3arats 2aAnimals 2aCalcium, Dietaryxpharmacokinetics 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCecumxmetabolism 2aDisaccharidesxpharmacology 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolism 2aIron, Dietaryxpharmacokinetics 2aJejunumxmetabolism 2aMale 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0adifructose anhydride III 0aintestinal absorption1 aOnoshima, Satoshi1 aNakagawa, Chie0 tNutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.120-127dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2009.05.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle03381naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168072000900186072000900195100002400204245007300228300001600301500002400317506007600341520140500417506003701822650002101859650002801880650001201908650001201920650002501932650001701957650002001974650002501994650002502019650001702044650002402061650002302085650000902108650002702117650001102144650001102155650000902166650001602175650001602191650003902207650002402246650002002270650001702290653004102307700002302348700002202371700001702393700001902410700002302429773009002452852000902542856008502551930003302636945002502669946001302694655001202707IND4430228820221207134805.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022882DNAL7 a200054692pmid7 aPMC28748252pmcid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aDonnino, Michael W.10aCoronary artery bypass graft surgery depletes plasma thiamine levels  ap. 133-136.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObjective: Thiamine is an essential component of cellular metabolism, and lack of this vitamin results in a potentially life-threatening biochemical lesion. The stress of surgery and critical disease depletes electrolytes, minerals, and essential biochemical substrates. We hypothesized that critical illness (represented by major surgery) would result in decreased thiamine levels over time. Methods: We performed a prospective, observational study of serial thiamine levels of 15 patients who underwent non-emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The primary endpoint was change in thiamine levels from before to immediately after surgery. Secondary endpoints included change in thiamine levels from presurgical to 6- and 24-h time points. Results: Of the 15 study patients, 1 did not have a plasma thiamine measurement at time 0 because of laboratory error and could not be accounted for in paired comparisons over time. Plasma thiamine levels decreased significantly from before to after coronary artery bypass grafting (P =0.0004). In addition, there was a statistically significant decrease in thiamine levels from before surgery to 24h (P =0.003). Conclusion: Our data suggest that major surgery (as a surrogate for the stress of critical illness) depletes thiamine levels; further study is needed to determine whether routine replacement of thiamine in the critically ill is warranted.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoronary vessels 3acardiovascular diseases 3asurgery 3athiamin 3avitamin deficiencies 3amalnutrition 3ablood chemistry 3apsychological stress 3anutritional adequacy 3adiet therapy 3adietary supplements 3anutritional status 2aAged 2aCoronary Artery Bypass 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObservation 2aPostoperative Complicationsxblood 2aProspective Studies 2aThiaminexblood 2aTime Factors 0acoronary artery bypass graft surgery1 aCocchi, Michael N.1 aSmithline, Howard1 aCarney, Erin1 aChou, Peter P.1 aSalciccoli, Justin0 tNutrition.g2010 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.133-136dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/11  aOther US 7aarticle02492naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002100177245010600198300001400304500002400318520101800342650001101360650002501371650002201396650002201418650002501440650002801465650001901493650002101512650001901533650002201552651002101574653002101595700001701616700001801633700002001651700001701671700002201688700001801710773009001728852000901818856009001827930003301917945002501950946001101975655001201986IND4430225220221122064423.0091218e20100501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.09.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aT300 0aX3801 aŞenol, F.

The dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts prepared from 55 Salvia taxa were tested for their AChE inhibitory activity at 25, 50, and 100μg/ml using an ELISA microplate reader. The extracts were also screened for their scavenging effect against DPPH radical and iron-chelating capacity. Total phenol and total flavonoid contents of Salvia fruticosa were determined. Among the 165 Salvia extracts screened, only the dichloromethane extract of S. fruticosa showed inhibition towards AChE at 100μg/ml having 51.07% of inhibition, while only the dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts of Salvia cilicica had a notable iron-chelating capacity at 100μg/ml having 54.71% of chelating capacity.

Six different vegetable species were examined: carrots (Daucus carota L.), zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.), tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), peas (Pisum sativum L.), and yellow peppers (Capsicum annuum L.). All vegetables were conventional products and were analyzed in season to minimize differences due to agricultural practice and storage. Cooking and freezing are generally regarded as destructive to antioxidants, and this has fostered a belief among many consumers that raw vegetables are nutritionally superior to their frozen and/or cooked forms. In the current study, we provide evidence that this is not always the case. 3afreezing 3ainterspecific variation 3aboiling 3amicrowave cooking 3ahome food preservation 3ahome food preparation 3afood storage 3anutritive value 3asteaming 3afood composition 3avegetables 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aItaly 0aspecies differences 0acooking1 aBordoni, A.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Aug., v. 73, no. 6 p.H109-H112dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00826.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle04235naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100001900199245013300218300001400351500002400365500001500389520211800404650002802522650002402550650002202574650002202596650001002618650002702628650001702655650001702672650002402689650001802713650001102731650001202742650002002754650001202774650002802786650003102814650006702845650003202912650001102944650003002955650004502985650005803030650003603088650002403124650004603148653001903194700001703213700001703230700001703247700002403264773010203288852000903390856009303399930003303492945002503525946001103550655001203561IND4430226820221122035722.0091218e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022682DNAL7 a195414342pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL210 0aL6001 aVázquez, M.I.10aEffects of treatment with a prostaglandin analogue on developmental dynamics and functionality of induced corpora lutea in goats  ap. 42-47.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to compare morphological and functional features of spontaneous and induced corpora lutea (CLs) in goats. Fourteen adult and cycling Anglo Nubian goats (Argentina) were randomly allocated to two groups: Group N (n =7) included goats with natural spontaneous oestrus and Group PG (n =7) included does in which oestrus was synchronized by the administration of two i.m. cloprostenol doses, 10 days apart. In both groups, oestrous behaviour was checked twice daily (Day of oestrus=Day 0) and daily transrectal ultrasonographies were performed for evaluating CLs and follicles dynamics through the complete subsequent oestrous cycle; the luteal activity was determined directly, in terms of progesterone (P4) secretion, and indirectly, by assessing effects of CL on follicular dynamics. All goats exhibited oestrous behaviour and ovulation without differences in ovulation rate (N: 1.67±0.2, PG: 2.0±0.1). The total luteal tissue area showed linear growth from Day 4 to Day 15 of oestrous cycle in all goats, but the developmental dynamics differed between groups, treated goats had larger area (P <0.01). Plasma P4 concentrations also increased from Day 0 to Day 15 in all the does; however, from Day 5 to Day 15, treated does had a lower concentrations than the untreated group (P <0.001). There were differences in the development of follicular waves between groups; assessment of size-distribution showed that treated group had a higher number of small and larger follicles (P <0.05). The largest follicles recorded in treated goats had a higher maximum diameter both at the first (PG: 7.6±0.8mm; N: 4.9±0.7mm, P <0.05) and second follicular waves (PG: 6.3±1.4mm; N: 5.0±0.4mm, P <0.05) and a longer growth phase during the second wave (PG: 6.5±1.7 days; N: 4.6±0.7 days, P <0.05), coincident with the period of maximal luteal secretion. In conclusion, synchronization of oestrus and ovulation by the administration of a prostaglandin analogue causes differences in developmental dynamics and functionality of induced corpora lutea when compared to natural spontaneous ovulation. 3aintramuscular injection 3aNubian (goat breed) 3ahormone secretion 3aovarian follicles 3agoats 3aestrus synchronization 3acloprostenol 3aprogesterone 3aovarian development 3acorpus luteum 3aestrus 3afemales 3aultrasonography 2aAnimals 2aCell Sizexdrug effects 2aCloprostenolxpharmacology 2aCorpus Luteumxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEstrous Cyclexdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGoatsxbloodxphysiology. 2aLuteinizationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOvarian Folliclexcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOvulation Inductionxveterinary 2aProgesteronexblood 2aProstaglandins F, Syntheticxpharmacology 0aprostaglandins1 aBlanch, M.S.1 aAlanis, G.A.1 aChaves, M.A.1 aGonzalez-Bulnes, A.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 Mar., v. 118, no. 1 p.42-47dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.05.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03876naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181100001500190245011900205300001400324500002400338500001500362520185200377650001102229650002102240650001102261650001002272650002002282650001302302650001502315650002702330650001202357650003602369650003202405650004302437650004002480650003202520650003702552650003002589650002202619650001102641650004902652650001002701650002002711650002702731650004902758650002802807653002102835653001602856653001802872700001602890700001702906700001802923773010202941852000903043856009303052930003303145945002503178946001103203655001203214IND4430226420221122031710.0091218e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443022642DNAL7 a196283462pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL2101 aRios, G.L.10aEffect of container, vitrification volume and warming solution on cryosurvival of in vitro-produced bovine embryos  ap. 19-24.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the present research was to develop a low cost and easy to perform vitrification method for in vitro-produced cattle embryos. Effect of container material was evaluated (plastic straw compared to glass capillary, experiment 1), two volume sample (1 compared to 0.5μL, experiment 2) and warming solution composition medium (Tissue Culture Medium 199 (TCM-199) compared to phosphate buffered saline (PBS), experiment 3) as modifications of the open pulled straw (OPS) system in order to reduce embryo damage caused by exposure to cold. In all experiments, day 7 and expanded blastocysts of cattle were exposed to the vitrification solution 1 for 3min and 30s in solution 2. After this, embryos were placed in a droplet and loaded in a narrow end container, and immediately submerged into liquid nitrogen. For warming, vitrified embryos were plunged into warming solution 1 for 3min, and transferred into warming solution 2 for 1min. Fresh embryos kept in culture were used as control group. Hatching rates were recorded in all cases at day 13. In experiment 1 there was no significant effect of container material on hatching rates. Postwarming survival rate of vitrified embryos was lower than control (27.5% plastic straws, 18.9% glass capillary and 80.5% control, P <0.05). In experiment 2, there was no significant effect of volume in hatching rates (58.3% 1μL, 61.3% 0.5μL and 80.5% control, P <0.05). In experiment 3, the composition of the holding medium of warming solution influenced hatching rates (84.1% TCM-199, 74.8% PBS and 91.1% control P <0.05). These data suggest that neither glass capillaries nor reduced sample volume could improve hatching rates after vitrification-warming with open pulled straw (OPS) procedure, and that PBS can replace TCM-199 in warming solutions, but lesser hatching rates should be expected. 3avolume 3acryopreservation 3acattle 3aglass 3aembryo (animal) 3aplastics 3acontainers 3ain vitro fertilization 2aAnimals 2aCattlexembryologyxphysiology. 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCryoprotective Agentsxpharmacology 2aCulture Mediaxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEmbryo Culture Techniques 2aEmbryo, Mammalian 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitroxmethodsxveterinary. 2aGlass 2aHot Temperature 2aPlasticsxpharmacology 2aProduct Packagingxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aSolutionsxpharmacology 0awarming solution 0amethodology 0avitrification1 aMucci, N.C.1 aKaiser, G.G.1 aAlberio, R.H.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 Mar., v. 118, no. 1 p.19-24dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.06.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03399naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001400191245011300205300001800318500002400336520183300360650001202193650001002205650003502215650001502250650001702265650002402282650001702306650001102323650002102334650003302355650003302388650001702421650002302438650001302461653002102474700001502495700001702510700001402527773009302541852000902634856007202643856008502715930003302800945002502833946001102858655001202869IND4422027420221122031626.0090619e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442202742DNAL7 a224437342pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311080023462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL800 0aL8101 aBauer, A.10aEffects of immunization against GnRH on gonadotropins, the GH-IGF-I-axis and metabolic parameters in barrows  ap. 1215-1222.  aIncludes references  aSurgically castrated male piglets (barrows) reveal an increase in LH and a decrease in GH compared to untreated boars. Boars that were castrated by immunization against gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) have decreased LH but maintain GH. The difference in GH levels between barrows and immunological castrated boars cannot be explained by testicular steroids because they are low in surgical and immunocastrated boars as well. Therefore, differences in GH concentrations might be due to an interaction between GnRH and growth hormone releasing hormone (GRH) in the hypothalamus or the pituitary. This hypothesis was tested with twelve male piglets that had been castrated within 1 week postnatally and fitted with indwelling cephalic vein catheters at 17 weeks of age. They were split into a control group and an immunized group (each n = 6). Vaccination with Improvac® was performed at 18 and 22 weeks of age. Specific radioimmunoassays were used for hormone determinations (GH, LH, FSH, testosterone and IGF-I). Additionally, metabolic responses were evaluated by measuring analytical parameters that characterize protein synthesis and breakdown, and body fat content. The second vaccination led to a rapid decrease of LH below the limit of detection whereas FSH decreased more slowly, over a period of 5 weeks, from 2.2 to 0.5 ng/ml. This level of FSH, which corresponds to boar-specific concentrations, was maintained thereafter. GH decreased with increasing age but was not influenced by vaccination and remained at a low concentration typical for barrows. Similarly, IGF-I was not altered by vaccination. Consequently, metabolic status was not changed by immunization. It is concluded that the difference in GH levels between surgical and immunocastrated boars is not explained by an interaction between GnRH and GRH. 3abarrows 3aboars 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3acastration 3aimmunization 3aluteinizing hormone 3asomatotropin 3atestes 3asteroid hormones 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3atestosterone 3aprotein metabolism 3abody fat 0aimmunocastration1 aLacorn, M.1 aDanowski, K.1 aClaus, R.0 tAnimal.g2008 Aug., v. 2, no. 8 p.1215-1222dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.cambridge.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311080023463Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/17  aNon-US 7aarticle04259naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001700197245012100214300001800335500002400353520199300377650001802370650001402388650001702402650001102419650001302430650001302443650002102456650002702477650001402504650002002518650003002538650001802568650002402586650002802610650004602638650006102684650001202745650003102757650002102788650004902809650003802858650005102896650002502947650003002972650004103002650002403043650002803067650002803095653001603123653001603139653002003155653002403175700001803199700001703217700002003234773011403254852000903368856009103377930003303468945002503501946001103526655001203537IND4422056320221122031619.0090619e20090801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442205632DNAL7 a194474732pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.04.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aL810 0aM0011 aKungolos, A.10aEvaluation of toxic and interactive toxic effects of three agrochemicals and copper using a battery of microbiotests  ap. 4610-4615.  aIncludes references  aThree commonly used test organisms of different trophic levels (Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Daphnia magna) were exposed to selected agrochemicals (fosthiazate, metalaxyl-M, imidacloprid) and copper, in single doses or in binary mixtures. The toxicity of each single compound varied up to two orders of magnitude, depending on the test species examined. V. fischeri was the most sensitive test organism regarding fosthiazate and metalaxyl-M, indicating an IC₅₀ value of 0.20 mg/L (0.17-0.25 mg/L) and 0.88 mg/L (0.35-1.57 mg/L), respectively. Imidacloprid was the least toxic compound, indicating an EC₅₀ value on D. magna of 64.6 mg/L (43.3-122.5 mg/L) and an IC₅₀ value on V. fischeri of 226 mg/L (159-322 mg/L), while for imidacloprid at a concentration of 1000 mg/L the effect on P. subcapitata was lower than 50%. Copper was the most toxic compound towards all test organisms exhibiting the highest toxic effect on P. subcapitata, with an IC₅₀ value of 0.05 mg/L (0.003-0.008 mg/L). The toxic effects of the binary mixtures have been compared to the theoretically expected effect, resulting from a simple mathematical model based on the theory of probabilities. The independent action model was used in order to predict the theoretically expected effect. The interactive effects were mostly antagonistic or additive, while in few cases (interactive effects of metalaxyl-M and copper on V. fischeri) a synergistic mode of action was observed for some concentration combinations. Experiments showed that interactive effects of chemicals may vary depending on the test species used as well as on the chemicals and their respective concentrations. Although most of the concentrations of chemicals tested in this study are higher than the ones usually found in natural environment, the evaluation of their interactive toxic effects using a battery of bioassays may comprise a useful tool for the estimation of the environmental hazard of chemicals. 3aagrochemicals 3ametalaxyl 3aimidacloprid 3acopper 3amixtures 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3achemical concentration 3abioassays 3aVibrio fischeri 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aDaphnia magna 3amathematical models 2aAgrochemicalsxtoxicity 2aAlaninexanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity. 2aAliivibrio fischerixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aAnimals 2aComplex Mixturesxtoxicity 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aDaphniaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEukaryotaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aImidazolesxtoxicity 2aNitro Compoundsxtoxicity 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxtoxicity 2aRegression Analysis 2aThiazolidinesxtoxicity 2aToxicity Testsxmethods 0afosthiozate 0ametalaxyl-M 0abinary mixtures 0ainteractive effects1 aEmmanouil, C.1 aTsiridis, V.1 aTsiropoulos, N.0 tScience of the total environment.g2009 Aug. 1, v. 407, no. 16 p.4610-4615dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.04.0383Available from publisher's Web site  a20100218b20100305c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03493naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001300161245015700174300001800331500002400349520171600373650000902089650001802098650001702116650002102133650002002154650002502174650002102199650002502220650002302245650002502268650002002293650001602313650001602329650002002345650001102365650002302376650002902399650002802428650002102456650002402477650002002501700001502521700001402536700001002550700001202560700001102572700001102583700001602594773010902610852000902719856009202728930003302820945002502853946001302878655001202891IND4408371820221122031637.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440837182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00821.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aChen, G.10aEffect of Polysaccharide from Auricularia auricula on Blood Lipid Metabolism and Lipoprotein Lipase Activity of ICR Mice Fed a Cholesterol-Enriched Diet  ap. H103-H108.  aIncludes references  aPolysaccharides from Auricularia auricula (AAP) extracted in hot water and precipitated by ethanol were chemically well defined, including 42.5% total carbohydrate, 19.6% uronic acids, 15.8% sulfate groups, 1.7% N, and 20.3% ash. Gas chromatography analysis demonstrated that the neutral sugars were mainly composed of rhamnose, xylose, and glucose and smaller amounts of mannose, galactose, and arabinose. The present study was designed to investigate the antioxidant capacity of AAP on blood lipid metabolism and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in ICR mice fed cholesterol-enriched diet (CED) for the 1st time. Furthermore, the relationship between the atherosclerotic index (AI) and LPL activity to total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was studied. Thirty-six ICR mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n= 12). The mice in control group (NG) received regular diet and the mice in model group (MG) received CED; these 2 groups were provided with distilled water by oral gavage. The experimental group (EG) was fed CED with oral gavage of AAP (120 mg/kg/d body weight) for an 8-wk period. After 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels of the serum were determined by enzymatic methods. The results indicated that the polysaccharides significantly lowered the concentrations of serum TC and LDL-C compared with the CED control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, oral administration of polysaccharides significantly improved TAC, LPL activity, and decreased MDA level, as well as AI. These conclusions revealed the beneficial effects of AAP on the preventive actions against hypercholesterolemia. 3amice 3aanimal models 3ablood lipids 3alipid metabolism 3apolysaccharides 3aAuricularia auricula 3amedicinal plants 3acholesteremic effect 3alipoprotein lipase 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzyme activity 3acholesterol 3adietary fat 3aatherosclerosis 3adosage 3atemporal variation 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein 3atriacylglycerols 3aoral administration 3amalondialdehyde1 aLuo, Y.-C.1 aJi, B.-P.1 aLi B.1 aGuo, Y.1 aLi, Y.1 aSu, W.1 aXiao, Z.-L.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Aug., v. 73, no. 6 p.H103-H108dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00821.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle02950naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001900170245011200189300001800301500002400319500001500343520140700358650001901765650001401784650000901798650001801807650002001825650001501845650002001860650001701880650001201897650001901909650003101928650001901959650001901978650002801997653002102025653004502046653002702091700001702118700001602135773010902151852000902260856009202269930003302361945002502394946001302419655001202432IND4408371520221122003629.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440837152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00803.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aSivanandan, L.10aEffect of Continuous Flow High-Pressure Throttling on Rheological and Ultrastructural Properties of Soymilk  ap. E288-E296.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSoymilk processing uses a filtration or centrifugation step to remove coarse solids in the comminuted soy. The objective was to utilize the whole beans and determine the effect of continuous flow high pressure throttling (CFHPT) process in reducing particle size and narrowing down the particle size distribution. The rheological and ultrastructural properties of such soymilk were also determined. Whole dehulled soybeans and deionized water were ground in a food processor before comminution in a Megatron (process M) or a Fitzmill (process F) or a Stonemill (process S). The comminuted slurry was homogenized at pressures of 69, 103, 138, 207, and 276 MPa using a CFHPT system, heated to 80 °C in a tubular heat exchanger prior to depressurization, and held at elevated temperatures of 97, 106, 114, 131, and 148 °C, respectively, for each applied pressure after throttling. To avoid flashing, back pressure was applied after the holding tube and soymilk was cooled immediately. Process M produced soymilk with smallest particle size and the highest apparent viscosity. All soymilk samples showed non-Newtonian pseudoplastic flow behavior. Ultrastructural images showed a clear protein network with very small fat globules entrapped in the protein matrix. Particles were uniformly distributed when the highest pressure treatment was applied for process M, which was considered as the best process. 3ahomogenization 3aviscosity 3aflow 3aparticle size 3afood processing 3afiltration 3aheat exchangers 3afat globules 3asoymilk 3aultrastructure 3aparticle size distribution 3acentrifugation 3aheat treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 0aprotein networks 0acontinuous flow high pressure throttling 0arheological properties1 aToledo, R.T.1 aSingh, R.K.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Aug., v. 73, no. 6 p.E288-E296dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00803.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090325b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle01162naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245008100131300001400212520032200226650001700548650001800565650001900583650002000602650001700622650001200639653003100651653002000682773008300702852000900785939003300794945000800827946001300835655001200848991609372790742620221121234323.0930319e198901  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930011182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpeer, M.G.10aContribution of food service to quality of life in long-term-care facilities  ap. 19-26.  aAt a time when the public press is focusing on health care and when newspaper and television stories routinely report sensational violations of nursing home care, there is no better time to review the dietitian's relationship with the geriatric population who live in long-term-care (LTC) or extended-care facilities. 3afood service 3anursing homes 3along term care 3aquality of life 3afood choices 3aelderly 0aindividual characteristics 0aself management0 tTopics in clinical nutrition.g1989 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.19-26x0883-56917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02035naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245003800185300001600223520053400239650001300773650001600786650001200802650001700814650002900831650002900860650004300889650002600932650002300958650001700981650002000998650001501018650002601033653002801059653001601087653001701103700002001120700001801140700002301158700001901181700002301200700001601223773014501239852000901384856009201393930003301485946001101518655001201529IND4407893720221121225230.0080718e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440789372DNAL7 a184300292pmid7 a10.1111/j.1440-169X.2008.01026.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhta, Sho10aGene transduction by sonoporation  ap. 517-520.  aGene transduction technologies are essential tools for understanding of gene functions or gene cascades underlying embryogenesis.

  1 aLin, D.G.10acDNA cloning, expression, and characterization of taro SSII: a novel member of starch synthase II family  ap. 7958-7964.  aA novel soluble starch synthase II (SSII) gene was isolated from taro (Colocasia esculenta var. esculenta) tubers. This 2939 bp SSII transcript encodes 804 amino acids with a putative transit peptide of 52 residues. It displays 58-63% identity and 63-69% similarity with SSIIs from other sources. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses showed that taro SSII is more closely related with dicot SSIIs than with the monocot ones, though taro is a monocot. The identification of taro SSII clone as starch synthase was confirmed by the expression of its enzymatic activity in Escherichia coli. Genomic DNA blot analysis revealed a single copy or low number copies of SSII in taro. Expression profile showed that more transcript and protein were accumulated in tubers of 597 +/- 37 g fresh weight, that is, a stage of rapid starch synthesis, than tubers of other stages. By Western blot analysis, SSII was found in both soluble and granule bound portions of tuber extracts, and more SSII protein was found in aged leaves than in leaves of other stages. These results suggest that taro SSII is a novel starch synthase for the synthesis of both transit and storage starch. 3aColocasia esculenta 3ataro 3atubers 3astarch synthase 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aleaves 3ahistochemistry 3aenzyme activity1 aJeang, C.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Oct. 5, v. 53, no. 20 p.7958-7964x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf050882r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20051114b20051202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/02  aOther US 7aarticle02420naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001400171245011600185300001800301520105900319650002201378650002301400650002401423650002001447650002501467650002401492650002001516650002901536650001301565653002401578653001601602700001501618700002301633700001301656700001601669700001501685773010501700852000901805856007701814930003301891945002501924946001301949655001201962IND4375310120221121225307.0051019e20051005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437531012DNAL7 a10.1021/jf050652c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aEdens, L.10aExtracellular prolyl endoprotease from Aspergillus niger and its use in the debittering of protein hydrolysates  ap. 7950-7957.  aThe observation that the bitterest peptides from casein hydrolysates contain several proline residues led us to hypothesize that a proline-specific protease would be instrumental in debittering such peptides. To identify the desired proline-specific activity, a microbiological screening was carried out in which the chromogenic peptide benzyloxycarbonyl-glycine-proline-p-nitroanilide (Z-Gly-Pro-pNA) was used as the substrate. An Aspergillus niger (A. niger) strain was identified that produces an extracellular proline-specific protease with an acidic pH optimum. On the basis of sequence similarities, we conclude that the A. niger-derived enzyme probably belongs to the S28 family of clan SC of serine proteases rather than the S9 family to which prolyl oligopeptidases belong. Incubating the overexpressed and purified enzyme with bitter casein hydrolysates showed a major debittering effect. Reversed phase HPLC analysis revealed that this debittering effect is accompanied by a significant reduction of the number of hydrophobic peptides present. 3aAspergillus niger 3aserine proteinases 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3acasein hydrolysates 3afood processing 3abitter-tasting compounds 3apeptides 0aprolyl endoprotease 0adebittering1 aDekker, P.1 aHoeven, R. van der1 aDeen, F.1 aRoos, A. de1 aFloris, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Oct. 5, v. 53, no. 20 p.7950-7957x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf050652c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20051114b20051202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/02  aOther US 7aarticle02455naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245010200192300001200294520090700306650002701213650001601240650002101256650002001277650002201297650001701319650001401336650002801350650002901378650004601407650004001453650002201493650003701515650005101552650001401603653002801617653002901645653002901674700001801703773011901721852000901840856009201849930003301941946001101974655001201985IND4407670020221121225205.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440767002DNAL7 a186165932pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01254.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFauvart, Maarten10aRhizobial secreted proteins as determinants of host specificity in the rhizobium-legume symbiosis  ap. 1-9.  aRhizobia are Gram-negative bacteria than can elicit the formation of specialized organs, called root nodules, on leguminous host plants. Upon infection of the nodules, they differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. An elaborate signal exchange precedes the symbiotic interaction. In general, both rhizobia and host plants exhibit narrow specificity. Rhizobial factors contributing to this specificity include Nod factors and surface polysaccharides. It is becoming increasingly clear that protein secretion is important in determining the outcome of the interaction as well. This paper discusses our current understanding of the symbiotic role played by rhizobial secreted proteins, transported both by secretion systems that are of general use, such as the type I secretion system, and by specialized, host-targeting secretion systems, such as the type III, type IV and type VI secretion systems. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3ahost plants 3ahost specificity 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein secretion 3aroot nodules 3asymbiosis 3atype I secretion system 3atype VI secretion system 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFabaceaexmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aProtein Transport 2aRhizobiumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRoot Nodules, Plantxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSymbiosis 0atype I secretion system 0atype IV secretion system 0atype VI secretion system1 aMichiels, Jan0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Aug., v. 285, no. 1 p.1-9dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01254.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03309naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001700154245018300171300001800354500001500372520180300387650001302190650001402203650001902217650002102236650001302257650001702270650002102287650002202308650001402330650002002344653003602364653001902400653001302419700001602432700001802448700001402466700001502480700001502495700001402510700001702524773010502541852000902646856007702655930003302732945002502765946001302790655001202803IND4375309620221121050704.0051019e20051005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437530962DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05096132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRichling, E.10aDetermination of the ²H/¹H and ¹⁵N/¹⁴N ratios of alkylpyrazines from coffee beans (Coffea arabica L. and Coffea canephora var. robusta) by isotope ratio mass spectrometry  ap. 7925-7930.  a2019-12-04  aThe delta15N(AIR) and delta2H(VSMOW) data for several alkylpyrazines formed during the roasting process of coffee are reported. Samples of commercially available roasted (n = 9) as well as self-roasted (n = 8) coffee beans (Coffea arabica L. and Coffea canephora var. robusta) of different origins were investigated. By use of extracts prepared by simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE) and subsequently fractionated by liquid chromatography on silica gel, on-line capillary gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry was employed in the combustion (C) and pyrolysis (P) modes (HRGC-C/P-IRMS) to determine the delta15N(AIR) and delta2H(VSMOW) values, respectively. In addition to the constituents of coffee beans, data for commercial synthetic alkylpyrazines and substances declared to be "natural" were determined. The delta15N(AIR) data for coffee alkylpyrazines under study-2-ethyl-5-methylpyrazine (1) and 2-ethyl-6-methylpyrazine (2) (measured as sum 1/2), 2-ethyl-3-methylpyrazine (3), 2-methylpyrazine (4), 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (5) and 2,6-dimethylpyrazine (6) (measured as sum 5/6), and 2,3-dimethylpyrazine (7), as well as 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine (8)-varied in the range from +8.3 to -10.2 per thousand, thus revealing their biogeneration from amino acids (delta15N(AIR) ranging from +8 per thousand to -10 per thousand). The delta2H(VSMOW) values were determined in the range from -5 per thousand to -127 per thousand. Owing to the analytical differentiation observed between coffee alkylpyrazines and synthetic/"natural" samples of 3, 4, and 7, authenticity assessment of coffee-flavored products seems to be promising, provided that extended data will be available in the future. In the literature, there were no IRMS data available for the alkylpyrazines (1-8) under study. 3anitrogen 3apyrazines 3aCoffea arabica 3aCoffea canephora 3aroasting 3acoffee beans 3afood composition 3amass spectrometry 3adeuterium 3astable isotopes 0aisotope ratio mass spectrometry 0aalkylpyrazines 0ahydrogen1 aPreston, C.1 aKavvadias, D.1 aKahle, K.1 aHeppel, C.1 aHummel, S.1 aKonig, T.1 aSchreier, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Oct. 5, v. 53, no. 20 p.7925-7930x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05096133Available from publisher's Web site  a20051114b20051202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/02  aOther US 7aarticle03373naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245013300166300001600299520180500315650001802120650001302138650002802151650002002179650002702199650001802226650002302244650002802267650001502295650001302310650001602323650001202339650001602351650001702367650002602384650002102410650002602431650001202457650002302469650002002492650003302512653001502545653001102560653001502571700001802586773007202604852000902676856008702685930003302772945001302805946001302818655001202831IND2060718720221121050745.0971202e199706  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206071872DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO.1997.87.6.6142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, F.10aAntiobiosis and antagonism of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa and Drechslera poae by Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 in vitro and in planta  ap. 614-621.  aPseudomonas fluorescens strain Pf-5, which produces several antifungal metabolites, including the antibiotics pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, was tested for its ability to inhibit Sclerotinia homoeocarpa (causal agent of dollar spot) and Drechslera poae (causal agent of 'melting-out') in vitro and in turfgrass; Tn5 mutants with altered antibiotic production also were tested. Inhibition in vitro differed with the medium used, but both fungi generally were inhibited by Pf-5. In most cases, a mutant deficient in pyoluteorin but not pyrrolnitrin or 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol was as inhibitory as Pf-5, whereas a pyrrolnitrin-deficient mutant was less inhibitory than Pf-5 in most fungus/medium combinations. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of culture extracts showed that bacterial genotype and nutrition have an interactive effect on antibiotic production, such that conditions causing an increase in one antibiotic may increase or decrease another. The purported deficiencies for the pyrrolnitrin- and pyoluteorin-deficient mutants were confirmed. In S. homoecarpa-infested grass clippings incubated in a moist chamber, Pf-5 reduced mycelial growth, whereas the pyrrolnitrin-deficient mutant did not and the pyoluteorin-deficient mutant was intermediate. In greenhouse experiments, Pf-5 reduced dollar spot disease incidence in bentgrass and bluegrass when sprayed over inoculated turf. In grass clippings infested with D. poae and incubated in a moist chamber under favorable conditions for spore production, Pf-5 did not reduce significantly the number of spores produced compared with the nontreated control. However, Pf-5 reduced melting-out disease incidence and severity in bluegrass inoculated with spores of D. poae under greenhouse conditions. 3aPoa pratensis 3aAgrostis 3aSclerotinia homoeocarpa 3aDrechslera poae 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3abiological control 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aantibiosis 3amycelium 3asporulation 3aconidia 3aantibiotics 3abiosynthesis 3aquantitative analysis 3ain vitro culture 3agreenhouse production 3amutants 3astrain differences 3adisease control 3aplant diseases and disorders 0ainhibition 0agrowth 0aantagonism1 aPfender, W.F.0 tPhytopathology.g1997 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.614-621x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.1997.87.6.6143Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02992naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001700182245010400199300001800303500002400321500001500345520130500360650001601665650001401681650001101695650002601706650001801732650002401750650002401774650001301798650002001811650001801831650001301849650002301862650001401885650002001899650001301919650002101932650001501953653001701968653002601985653001602011653001602027700001602043700001402059773009402073852000902167856007202176856008502248930003302333945002502366946001102391655001202402IND4422028920221121050553.0090619e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442202892DNAL7 a224438982pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311080026322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aX1001 aRobinson, N.10aUse of gene expression data for predicting continuous phenotypes for animal production and breeding  ap. 1413-1420.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTraits such as disease resistance are costly to evaluate and slow to improve using current methods. Analysis of gene expression profiles (e.g. DNA microarrays) has potential for predicting such phenotypes and has been used in an analogous way to classify cancer types in human patients. However, doubts have been raised regarding the use of classification methods with microarray data for this purpose. Here we propose a method using random regression with cross validation, which accounts for the distribution of variation in the trait and utilises different subsets of patients or animals to perform a complete validation of predictive ability. Published breast tumour data were used to test the method. Despite the small dataset (n < 100), the new approach resulted in a moderate but significant correlation between the predicted and actual phenotypes (0.32). Binary classification of the predicted phenotypes yielded similar classification error rates to those found by other authors (35%). Unlike other methods, the new method gave a quantitative estimate of phenotype that could be used to rank animals and select those with extreme phenotypic performance. Use of the method in an optimal way using larger sample sizes, and combining DNA microarrays and other testing platforms, is recommended. 3acorrelation 3aphenotype 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3ameta-analysis 3agenetic improvement 3aregression analysis 3avalidity 3agene expression 3adata analysis 3agenomics 3adisease resistance 3alivestock 3aanimal breeding 3aaccuracy 3abreast neoplasms 3aprediction 0aoptimization 0aquantitative genetics 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aGoddard, M.1 aHayes, B.0 tAnimal.g2008 Oct., v. 2, no. 10 p.1413-1420dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.cambridge.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311080026323Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02757naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001900166245009000185300001600275500001500291520163900306650002201945650002001967650001701987650002502004650002802029650000902057650002702066653001702093700001702110700001702127773007202144852000902216856008702225930003302312945001302345946001302358655001202371IND2060720320221121050726.0971202e199706  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206072032DNAL7 a189450842pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.1997.87.6.6492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNtahimpera, N.10aEffect of rain distribution alteration on splash dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum  ap. 649-655.  a2019-12-04  aSplash dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia from infected strawberry fruit was assessed using a rain simulator to determine the properties of rain (e.g., intensity [millimeters/hour] or drop size distribution) most related to dissemination. Dispersal with a simulated rain corresponding to a natural rain of about 11 mm/h was compared with dispersal of three other simulated rains that had larger and smaller drop sizes, on average, than idealized natural rains. Splash droplets were collected in sheltered petri plates with a selective medium for Colletotrichum, and colonies formed from conidia entrained in the droplets were counted and used as the measure of dispersal. Colonies were mostly confined to a 27-cm radius from the source, and density of colonies decreased exponentially with the distance squared, as indicated by the fit of a diffusion-type model to the data. Splash dispersal was more affected by drop size distribution than rain intensity or other properties of the generated rains. That is, there was a direct positive relationship between total colonies over 61 min of rain for a circular area with a 72-cm radius (sigma) and the mass (volume) median diameter of impacting drops (D0') for four rain-simulation treatments. In a separate study, strawberry fruit were exposed to the same four simulated rains at two distances from a point source and for two rain durations. Although the proportion of infected fruit (gamma) increased with time and decreased with distance, rain treatment did not significantly affect gamma, as predicted based on past work with a wide range of intensities of simulated rains. 3aFragaria ananassa 3aspore dispersal 3adroplet size 3adisease transmission 3aColletotrichum acutatum 3arain 3aplant pathogenic fungi 0aepidemiology1 aMadden, L.V.1 aWilson, L.L.0 tPhytopathology.g1997 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.649-655x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.1997.87.6.6493Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01049naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004400133300001400177520018900191650002300380650001300403650001200416653004800428653003000476653003800506653002100544700001800565773008900583852000900672939003300681945000800714946001300722655001200735991609370620742620221121032523.0830307e198202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradley, S.G.10aApproaches to assessing host resistance  ap. 61-69.  amicrobial infections used to assess changes in host resistance upon exposure of animals to environmental chemicals, review, includes information on 3 protozoan parasites and 1 nematode 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aimmunity 3aecology 0aHeligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Nematoda) 0aHexamita muris (Protozoa) 0aHistomonas meleagridis (Protozoa) 0aResistance, Host1 aMorahan, P.S.0 tE.H.P. environmental health perspectives.g1982 Feb., v. 43 p.61-69x0091-67657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830307c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle03806naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100002000200245016000220300001800380500002400398500001500422520204900437650000902486650002302495650002002518650002002538650001302558650002902571650002002600650001702620650001502637650001802652650002502670650002002695650002602715650000702741650002102748650001302769650001602782650001002798653002102808653001202829653001802841653001702859773009302876852000902969856007202978856008503050930003303135945002503168946001103193655001203204IND4422027820221121032713.0090619e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442202782DNAL7 a224437372pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311080025652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL105 0aL300 0aQ5021 aBarton Gade, P.10aEffect of rearing system and mixing at loading on transport and lairage behaviour and meat quality: comparison of free range and conventionally raised pigs  ap. 1238-1246.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFree range pigs, born outdoors and reared after weaning in enriched indoor accommodation, were compared with conventionally raised pigs from a farm, matched for effects on meat quality, with respect to behaviour during transport and lairage, blood chemistry at slaughter and meat quality characteristics. Pigs were either kept in farm pen groups or were mixed at loading and kept in the groups, so formed, until slaughter. Free range pigs tended to settle faster during the 2 1/2 h transport and 2 h lairage than conventionally raised pigs and were more likely to lie as resting posture during transport. Mixing at loading had no effect on posture during transport or during lairage for free range pigs but mixed conventionally raised pigs showed a greater variability in posture during lairage compared to non-mixed conventionally raised pigs, presumably as a result of disturbance from fighting conspecifics. Conventionally raised and free range pigs showed similar levels of aggression during transport but conventionally raised pigs were more aggressive during the lairage (average for mixed groups 12 v. 2 fights, P < 0.001). Aggressive interactions, such as one-way bites, were almost exclusively confined to mixed groups and all fights with mutual biting in mixed groups occurred solely between unfamiliar animals. The frequency of unacceptable skin damage in the middle and shoulder was highest in conventionally raised pigs and in mixed groups. Cortisol concentration and creatine kinase (CK) activity in slaughter blood were not affected by the rearing system. Mixing did not affect cortisol concentrations but led to higher CK activities compared to non-mixing (957 v. 588 U/l, respectively, P < 0.05). The rate of pH fall after slaughter was not affected by the rearing system but muscle temperatures early post mortem were highest in free range pigs. Mixing did not affect pH or temperature early post mortem. Neither rearing system nor mixing at loading affected ultimate pH or internal reflectance (meat quality marbling values). 3apork 3apostmortem changes 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal injuries 3amarbling 3aenvironmental enrichment 3ablood chemistry 3afood animals 3aaggression 3aanimal stress 3afree range husbandry 3acreatine kinase 3aenvironmental factors 3apH 3aanimal transport 3acortisol 3atemperature 3aswine 0aanimal husbandry 0alairage 0aanimal mixing 0ameat quality0 tAnimal.g2008 Aug., v. 2, no. 8 p.1238-1246dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.cambridge.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311080025653Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02096naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001100154245009800165300001800263500001500281520092200296650001401218650002001232650002601252650001501278650002101293650002201314650001101336653001701347653002001364653001201384700001401396700001401410773010501424852000901529856007701538930003301615945002501648946001301673655001201686IND4375283220221121032619.0051018e20051005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437528322DNAL7 a10.1021/jf04824592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aUstadi10aPurification and identification of a protease inhibitor from glassfish (Liparis tanakai) eggs  ap. 7667-7672.  a2019-12-04  aTwo protease inhibitors of 67 and 18 kDa, respectively, were purified from glassfish, Liparis tanakai, eggs by affinity chromatography. The smaller protein was purified with a yield and purity of 0.25% and 49.69-fold, respectively, and was characterized for further study. The glassfish egg protease inhibitor exhibited stability between 50 and 65 degrees C in an alkaline environment (pH 8). It was shown to be a noncompetitive inhibitor against papain, with an inhibitor constant (K(i)) of 4.44 nM. Potent glassfish protease inhibitor with N-Val-Gly Ser-Met-Thr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Thr-Asp-C amino acid residues was synthesized and its inhibitory activity was compared. Moreover, the 18-kDa protein inhibited cathepsin, a cysteine protease, more effectively than did egg white protease inhibitor, whereas the reverse was true for papain. Glassfish egg protease inhibitor is classified as a member of the family I cystatins. 3afish eggs 3afood processing 3aproteinase inhibitors 3acathepsins 3amolecular weight 3aenzyme inhibition 3asurimi 0apurification 0aLiparis tanakai 0aLiparis1 aKim, K.Y.1 aKim, S.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Oct. 5, v. 53, no. 20 p.7667-7672x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf04824593Available from publisher's Web site  a20051114b20051202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/01  aOther US 7aarticle02836naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245013600208300001800344506007600362520159400438506003702032650002002069650001402089650001502103650002202118700001502140700002002155773017302175852000902348856008302357930003302440946001302473655001202486IND4433281320221207122603.0100228e20100223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443328132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09140971072doi7 aPMC28404152pmcid7 a201337272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudowski-Tal, Inbal10aFragBag, an accurate representation of protein structure, retrieves structural neighbors from the entire PDB quickly and accurately  ap. 3481-3486.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFast identification of protein structures that are similar to a specified query structure in the entire Protein Data Bank (PDB) is fundamental in structure and function prediction. We present FragBag: An ultrafast and accurate method for comparing protein structures. We describe a protein structure by the collection of its overlapping short contiguous backbone segments, and discretize this set using a library of fragments. Then, we succinctly represent the protein as a "bags-of-fragments"--a vector that counts the number of occurrences of each fragment--and measure the similarity between two structures by the similarity between their vectors. Our representation has two additional benefits: (i) it can be used to construct an inverted index, for implementing a fast structural search engine of the entire PDB, and (ii) one can specify a structure as a collection of substructures, without combining them into a single structure; this is valuable for structure prediction, when there are reliable predictions only of parts of the protein. We use receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to quantify the success of FragBag in identifying neighbor candidate sets in a dataset of over 2,900 structures. The gold standard is the set of neighbors found by six state of the art structural aligners. Our best FragBag library finds more accurate candidate sets than the three other filter methods: The SGM, PRIDE, and a method by Zotenko et al. More interestingly, FragBag performs on a par with the computationally expensive, yet highly trusted structural aligners STRUCTAL and CE.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aprediction 3aprotein structure1 aNov, Yuval1 aKolodny, Rachel0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Feb. 23, v. 107, no. 8 p.3481-3486dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09140971073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02848naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014900174500002200323520144100345592002801786650002601814650001501840650001001855650001001865650001901875650002701894650002101921650001201942650001301954650000901967650001401976650001401990650001502004653001402019653002202033653001002055653003102065653004302096700002002139700001902159700002302178773008402201856008402285852000902369655001202378IND60564495020221116185946.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056449502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaigneault, Melissa10aAssay Validation of the Cardiac Isoform of Troponin I in Double Crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) Plasma for Diagnosis of Cardiac Damage  aPre-press version  aCardiac abnormalities, initially found in Deepwater Horizon weathered MC252 crude oil exposed Double Crested Cormorants (DCCOs) upon gross necropsy, were further investigated using echocardiography. Clinical and statistically significant changes including decreased ventricular myocardial contractility and arrhythmia were elucidated by echocardiography and interpreted by boarded cardiologists as potentially life threatening. The objective of this investigation was to initiate development of an antemortem, sensitive blood screening test for cardiac damage due to oil exposure of avian species. An assay for the cardiac isoform of troponin I (cTnI) which is known to be highly cross-reactive across mammalian species was chosen and analytically validated in DCCO. This is the first time this test has been analytically validated in avian species. All plasma samples from birds assessed as healthy had trace concentrations (<0.016 ng/mL). The assays was precise and accurate revealing a coefficient of variation <3% and an R2>0.99. Diagnostic investigation revealed that the test appears to have diagnostic potential for the diagnosis of cardiomyocyte damage. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 73% in this laboratory population. Due to an equivocal sample population in which health could not be proven, further investigation is needed to diagnostically validate troponin I in the assessment of oil exposure in DCCO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhalacrocorax auritus 3aarrhythmia 3abirds 3ablood 3acardiomyocytes 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3aechocardiography 3amammals 3anecropsy 3aoils 3apetroleum 3ascreening 3atroponin I 0aBiomarker 0aDeepwater Horizon 0aheart 0aoil-induced cardiomyopathy 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)1 aHarr, Kendal E.1 aDean, Karen M.1 aBursian, Steven J.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245007700206300001800283520117200301592002801473650001401501650001101515650001301526650001301539650002201552650001101574650001801585650001901603650001901622700005701641700002001698700005701718700005301775773017101828856008001999852000902079655001202088IND60687549420221119053108.0200401e20200225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068754942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b066172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Brandon C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1450-971910aBeyond Idealized Models of Nanoscale Metal Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage  ap. 5786-5796.  aMetal hydrides are attractive for compact, low-pressure hydrogen storage, yet a foundational understanding of factors governing their thermodynamics and kinetics is still lacking. Predictive modeling from the atomic to the microstructural scale plays a critical role in addressing these gaps, particularly for nanoscale materials, which promise improved performance but are difficult to probe. Here, we summarize strategies being developed within the Hydrogen Materials—Advanced Research Consortium (HyMARC) for going beyond conventional models to incorporate more complex physics, more realistic structures, and better approximation of operation conditions in simulations of nanoscale metal hydrides. We highlight four beyond-ideal factors that influence predicted performance: (1) surface anharmonic dynamics, (2) interface and surface energy penalties, (3) mechanical stress under confinement, and (4) the presence of native surface oxide. Approaches for addressing these factors are demonstrated on model materials representative of high-capacity hydrogen storage systems, and implications for understanding performance under operating conditions are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aenergy 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3amechanical stress 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3aprocess design 3athermodynamics1 aHeo, Tae Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0765-34801 aKang, ShinYoung1 aWan, Liwen F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5391-08041 aLi, Sichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2565-59060 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 59, no. 13 p.5786-5796dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b066173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001400280520173900294592002802033650002502061650001302086650001802099650001002117650002202127650001002149650002102159650002602180650001402206650001102220650003102231650001902262650001402281650001402295650003002309650002302339650003702362650000902399650001702408650001402425651001602439700001902455700001302474700002102487700001902508700002102527700002502548700001802573773011702591856008102708852000902789655001202798IND60573858720221118060313.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057385872DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-017-6308-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Jae-Young10aEpidemiological relationships of Campylobacter jejuni strains isolated from humans and chickens in South Korea  ap. 13-20.  aThirty-nine human isolates of Campylobacter jejuni obtained from a national university hospital during 2007–2010 and 38 chicken isolates of C. jejuni were collected from poultry farms during 2009–2010 in South Korea were used in this study. Campylobacter genomic species and virulence-associated genes were identified by PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed to compare their genetic relationships. All isolates were highly resistant to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline. Of all isolates tested, over 94% contained seven virulence associated genes (flaA, cadF, racR, dnaJ, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC). All isolates were classified into 39 types by PFGE clustering with 90% similarity. Some chicken isolates were incorporated into some PFGE types of human isolates. MLST analysis for the 39 human isolates and 38 chicken isolates resulted in 14 and 23 sequence types (STs), respectively, of which 10 STs were new. STs overlapped in both chicken and human isolates included ST-21, ST-48, ST-50, ST-51, and ST-354, of which ST-21 was the predominant ST in both human and chicken isolates. Through combined analysis of PFGE types and STs, three chicken isolates were clonally related to the three human isolates associated with food poisoning (VII-ST-48, XXII-ST-354, and XXVIII-ST-51). They were derived from geographically same or distinct districts. Remarkably, clonal spread of food poisoning pathogens between animals and humans was confirmed by population genetic analysis. Consequently, contamination of campylobacters with quinolone resistance and potential virulence genes in poultry production and consumption may increase the risk of infections in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3achickens 3aciprofloxacin 3afarms 3afoodborne illness 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic relationships 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3amultilocus sequence typing 3analidixic acid 3apathogens 3apoisoning 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry production 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arisk 3atetracycline 3avirulence 3aSouth Korea1 aKwon, Yong-Kuk1 aWei, Bai1 aJang, Hyung-Kwan1 aLim, Suk-Kyung1 aKim, Cheon-Hyeon1 aChŏng, Sŏk-chʻan,1 aKang, Min-su,0 tjournal of microbiology.g2017 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.13-20dThe Microbiological Society of Koreax1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-017-6308-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03921naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001000140245011200150300001600262500002000278520224900298592002802547650002902575650001902604650001202623650001702635650001202652650001302664650002102677650002002698650002302718650000902741650001202750650001702762650002002779650001302799650001402812650001002826650001202836650001502848650002402863650002102887650002302908650001902931650001602950651001802966700002702984700001803011700002103029700002103050700001903071700002503090773013303115856007403248852000903322655001203331IND60547882320221122221514.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054788232DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.122932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, E10aHigh‐throughput Cryopreservation of Sperm from Sex‐reversed Southern Flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma  ap. 555-565.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, is a valuable aquaculture fish with established markets in the USA. All‐female production in this species is an important technology for aquaculture because the females usually have body sizes twice those of males at the same age, and sex‐reversed males (genotypic XX neomales) are used for all‐female production by crossing with genetically normal females. However, sperm volume from the neomales is usually small (<0.5 mL) and limits their application for all‐female fish production. Cryopreservation of sperm from these sex‐reversed neomales will provide access on demand with increased efficiency to extend the application of neomales. The goal of this study was to develop a protocol for cryopreservation of sperm from the Southern flounder by using an automated high‐throughput processing system. The objectives were to: (1) determine the effect of osmolality on activation of sperm motility; (2) evaluate the effect of extender solutions on sperm motility capacity; (3) evaluate the acute toxicity of cryoprotectants (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol) on sperm motility, and (4) estimate the effect of cooling rate on sperm cryopreservation and post‐thaw fertilization. Sperm motility was activated when osmolality was 400 mOsmol/kg or higher. Of the three extender buffers tested, HEPES4‐(2‐hydroxyethyl)‐1‐piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) at 300 mOsmol/kg resulted in better protection for sperm motility than did Hanks' balanced salt solution and Mounib solution at 300 mOsmol/kg during 7 d of refrigerated storage. After 30 min equilibration with the cryoprotectant of 15% DMSO, sperm motility was 24 ± 21% (fresh sperm motility without any cryoprotectants was 42%). After cooling at a rate of 20 C/min, post‐thaw sperm motility was 8 ± 5% and fertilization was 63 ± 40% evaluated at the 32–64 cell stage (5 × 10⁵ sperm per egg). Overall, a protocol was developed for sperm cryopreservation in the Southern flounder with high‐throughput processing, which provides a tool to preserve the valuable genetic resources from neomale flounders, and enables germplasm repository development for the Southern flounder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParalichthys lethostigma 3aacute toxicity 3abuffers 3acold storage 3acooling 3acrossing 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aeggs 3afemales 3afish culture 3afish production 3aflounder 3agermplasm 3amales 3amarkets 3aosmolality 3apolyethylene glycol 3apropylene glycol 3asperm capacitation 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3aUnited States1 aCuevas‐Uribe, Rafael1 aYang, Huiping1 aSanderson, Robin1 aGill, Adriane O.1 aDaniels, Harry1 aTiersch, Terrence R.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2016 Aug., v. 47, no. 4 p.555-565dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.122933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011800168300001800286520172500304592002802029650002502057650002802082650003602110650001702146650001202163650002802175650001902203650002102222650002102243650002302264650001302287650001202300650002202312650001602334650001402350650002102364700002002385700002102405700001602426700005602442773011802498856008302616852000902699655001202708IND60598690020221116165020.0180702e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059869002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.7b011442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatsubo, Daiki10aStepwise Mechanism of Temperature-Dependent Coacervation of the Elastin-like Peptide Analogue Dimer, (C(WPGVG)3)2  ap. 1582-1590.  aElastin-like peptides (ELPs) are distinct, repetitive, hydrophobic sequences, such as (VPGVG)ₙ, that exhibit coacervation, the property of reversible, temperature-dependent self-association and dissociation. ELPs can be found in elastin and have been developed as new scaffold biomaterials. However, the detailed relationship between their amino acid sequences and coacervation properties remains obscure because of the structural flexibility of ELPs. In this study, we synthesized a novel, dimeric ELP analogue (H-C(WPGVG)₃-NH₂)₂, henceforth abbreviated (CW3)2, and analyzed its self-assembly properties and structural factors as indicators of coacervation. Turbidity measurements showed that (CW3)2 demonstrated coacervation at a concentration much lower than that of its monomeric form and another ELP. In addition, the coacervate held water-soluble dye molecules. Thus, potent and distinct coacervation was obtained with a remarkably short sequence of (CW3)2. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and optical microscopy revealed that the coacervation of (CW3)2 was a stepwise process. The structural factors of (CW3)2 were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations and circular dichroism spectroscopy. These measurements indicated that helical structures primarily consisting of proline and glycine became more disordered at high temperatures with concurrent, significant exposure of their hydrophobic surfaces. This extreme change in the hydrophobic surface contributes to the potent coacervation observed for (CW3)2. These results provide important insights into more efficient applications of ELPs and their analogues, as well as the coacervation mechanisms of ELP and elastin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3abiocompatible materials 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adissociation 3aelastin 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3alight microscopy 3alight scattering 3amolecular dynamics 3apeptides 3aproline 3asimulation models 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3awater solubility1 aSuyama, Keitaro1 aMiyazaki, Masaya1 aMaeda, Iori1 aNose, Takeru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9771-72670 tBiochemistry.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 57, no. 10 p.1582-1590dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b011443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008200167300001600249500001500265520094500280592002801225650004301253650002101296650001701317650001601334650001101350650002101361650005201382650001201434650002001446650001101466650001401477651001101491653002201502700002301524700002501547700002501572700002301597700002501620700002001645700002401665700003001689773010201719856008101821852000901902655001201911IND60547960620221119064442.0160906e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054796062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12560-016-9241-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiura, Takayuki10aDetection of Hepatitis E Virus in Sewage After an Outbreak on a French Island  ap. 194-199.  a2019-12-06  aA hepatitis E outbreak, which occurred on a small isolated island, provided an opportunity to evaluate the association between the number of hepatitis E cases in the community and the concentration of virus detected in sewage. Samples were collected from the different sewage treatment plants from the island and analyzed for the presence of hepatitis E (HEV) virus using real-time RT-PCR. We demonstrated that if 1–4 % of inhabitants connected to a WWTP were infected with HEV, raw sewage contained HEV at detectable levels. The finding that such a small number of infected people can contaminate municipal sewage works raises the potential of the further distribution of the virus. Indeed, investigating the routes of transmission of HEV, including the potential for sewage effluent to contain infectious HEV, may help us to better understand the epidemiology of this pathogen, which is considered to be an emerging concern in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aepidemiology 3ahepatitis E 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3asewage effluent 3apeople 3apathogens 3aEurope 0aHepatitis E virus1 aLhomme, Sébastien1 aLe Saux, Jean-Claude1 aLe Mehaute, Philippe1 aGuillois, Yvonnick1 aCouturier, Elizabeth1 aIzopet, Jacques1 aAbranavel, Florence1 aLe Guyader, Françoise S.0 tFood and environmental virology.g2016 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.194-199dSpringer USx1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-016-9241-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245012400157300001800281520133100299592002801630650001801658650000801676650001201684650000901696650000901705650001801714650001701732650001201749650001401761650001701775650002501792650001501817650001801832650001401850650001801864650001001882700001901892700001601911700001201927700001901939700001701958700001601975700001801991700002002009700001702029773017802046856007802224852000902302655001202311IND60118171320221122041533.0141126e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011817132DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.047274-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yong10aAcinetobacter puyangensis sp. nov., isolated from the healthy and diseased part of Populus ×euramericana canker bark  ap. 2963-2969.  aTwo Gram-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped strains, BQ4-1T and NHI3-2, isolated respectively from the healthy and diseased part of Populus ×euramericana canker bark, were characterized using a polyphasic approach. Chemotaxonomic characterization supported the inclusion of the two strains in the genus Acinetobacter, with genomic DNA G+C contents (42.5–43 mol%) within the range observed for this genus (38–47 mol%) and 9-octadecenoic acid (C18 : 1ω9c, 39.87 %), hexadecanoic acid (C16 : 0, 11.26 %) and summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1ω7c/C16 : 1ω6c, 18.90 %) as major fatty acids. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA, rpoB and gyrB gene sequences revealed that strains BQ4-1T and NHI3 did not cluster with any species with validly published names, and formed a distinct cluster with 99–100 % bootstrap support on three phylogenetic trees within the genus Acinetobacter. Acid was not produced from d-glucose, and haemolysis was not observed on agar media supplemented with sheep erythrocytes. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the two strains are considered to represent a novel species of the genus Acinetobacter, for which the name Acinetobacter puyangensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BQ4-1T ( = CFCC 10780T = JCM 18011T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aDNA 3aPopulus 3aagar 3abark 3achemotaxonomy 3aerythrocytes 3aglucose 3ahemolysis 3amicrobiology 3anucleotide sequences 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asheep1 aPiao, Chun-gen1 aMa, Yu-chao1 aHe, Wei1 aWang, Haiming,1 aChang, Ju-pu1 aGuo, Li-min1 aWang, Xi-zhuo1 aXie, Shou-jiang1 aGuo, Min-wei0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2013 Aug., v. 63, no.

Chronic pain has wide-ranging impacts which affects the quality of life (QOL) of the individual, whether that is a person or an animal. Accordingly instruments to measure chronic pain are designed to measure its impact on QOL and are called health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments. In veterinary science instruments to measure pain are based on behavioural observation by the veterinary surgeon/nurse in the case of acute pain and by the owner in the case of chronic pain. The development of HRQL instruments is an expanding field in veterinary science, not just for the measurement of pain, but for other chronic diseases, and it has a wide application in pharmaceutical research and clinical practice to improve patient care. This review highlights the challenges involved in creating such measures for dogs and cats, seeking to provide the reader with an understanding of their development process. It then provides an overview of the current status with regard to acute and chronic pain measurement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3achronic diseases 3adogs 3apain 3apain assessment 3apatient care 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary medicine 0aCat 0aDog 0aHealth-related quality of life 0aMeasurement 0aPain1 aNolan, A.M.1 aScott, E.M.0 tveterinary journal.g2018 June, v. 236 p.72-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011500168300001400283520150600297592002801803650002301831650001301854650002901867650001201896650001301908650001101921650001101932650001601943650001201959650001601971650001701987650001702004650001102021650000902032650000902041650001402050650001102064650001102075650003102086650002902117650002902146650001902175650001802194650001202212650002802224650000902252651000902261653001702270653001702287653001602304653000802320653002802328700001702356700002302373700002302396700002002419773008502439856008502524852000902609655001202618IND60542459420221121235350.0190403e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054245942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeili, Ali12aA geochemical survey of heavy metals in agricultural and background soils of the Isfahan industrial zone, Iran  ap. 88-98.  aThere is a growing public concern about the potential accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils of Iran. This is mainly the result of rapid urban, mining and industrial discordant development over the last several decades, which has jeopardized the ecology, food safety, human health, and sustainable development of agriculture. To investigate the soil pollution, a total of 105 agricultural soil samples and 40 background soil samples were collected from the Isfahan industrial zone. Accordingly, total concentrations of 7 heavy metals (including Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, Co and Cr), associated with Al, Fe, Mn and some physicochemical properties of soils were determined. The geochemical background and threshold was predicted using the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method. The median concentrations of heavy metals in agricultural soil were nearly similar to those of background soil, with some outlier data in the vicinity of the industrial and mining areas. Based on correlation coefficient and factor analyses, the primary source of Ni, Co, Cr, Fe and Al was determined to be geogenic, whereas the source of Pb, Zn and Cd is substantially controlled by anthropic activity. Our observations proved that in the Isfahan industrial zone, both human and natural sources affect the concentrations of Cu and Mn. Maps of heavy metal pollution indices in agricultural soils reveal high level of pollution in the vicinity of BamaPb-Zn mining area along with Esfahan and Mobarakeh Iron-Steel plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aaluminum 3aanthropogenic activities 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3acorrelation 3aecology 3afood safety 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amining 3anickel 3aphysicochemical properties 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil physical properties 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3azinc 3aIran 0aGeochemistry 0aHeavy metals 0aAgriculture 0aMAD 0aIsfahan industrial zone1 aMoore, Farid1 aKeshavarzi, Behnam1 aJaafarzadeh, Nemat1 aKermani, Maryam0 tCatena.g2014 Oct., v. 121 p.88-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245013400165300001600299500001100315520112200326592002801448650000901476650001001485650000901495650001301504650001401517650001401531650001001545700002501555773011701580856007301697852000901770655001201779IND60587995220221122045011.0180103e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058799522DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.127922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJandér, K.

Host discrimination mechanisms that reduce the fitness of uncooperative symbionts can stabilise mutualism against collapse, but also present a paradox – if discrimination is effective, why do uncooperative symbionts persist? Here, we test whether mutations or fitness benefits of cheating best explain the prevalence of uncooperative wasps in the fig tree–fig wasp mutualism. By combining theory with field‐collected data we demonstrate that the proportions of pollen‐free wasps of strongly discriminating hosts are reached with reasonable mutation rates. In contrast, in weakly discriminating hosts, the required mutation rates, assuming a single locus, are untenably high, but the required cheater advantages fall within expected ranges. We propose that when discrimination is weak, uncooperative symbionts proliferate until they reach the equilibrium proportion that balances costs and benefits of cheating. Our results suggest that mechanisms that resolve the paradox of uncooperative symbionts differ among host species.  aPublisher supplied data 3afigs 3ahosts 3aloci 3amutation 3amutualism 3asymbionts 3awasps1 aSteidinger, Brian S.0 tEcology letters.g2017 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.922-932dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.127923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03699naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245017300166300001600339520215400355592002802509650002302537650001702560650002502577650000902602650001602611650001602627650003102643650001602674650002102690650001202711650002002723650000902743650001002752650002102762650001602783650001902799653001002818653002302828653001402851653001902865653001602884700001702900700001602917700001302933700001802946700001402964773009502978856008703073852000903160655001203169IND60582124920221121035936.0191025e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058212492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiao10aEffect of water activity and temperature on the growth of Aspergillus flavus, the expression of aflatoxin biosynthetic genes and aflatoxin production in shelled peanuts  ap. 325-332.  aThe contamination of peanuts with Aspergillus flavus and subsequent aflatoxins is considered to be one of the most serious safety problems in the world. Water activity (aw) and temperature are limiting factors for fungal growth and aflatoxins production during storage. To optimize the practical storage parameter, the effect of aw (0.85–0.99) and temperature (15–42 °C) on fungal growth, aflatoxin production and the expression of aflatoxin biosynthetic and regulatory genes in shelled peanuts was investigated. A. flavus grew at a lower rate when temperature ≤20 °C or aw ≤ 0.85. For the growth of A. flavus in shelled peanuts, the optimum conditions were aw was 0.98, and the optimum temperature was 37 °C. The maximum amount of AFB1 in peanuts was obtained at 28 °C and aw 0.96. Real-time analysis showed that 16 of 25 genes had highest expression levels at 28 °C under aw 0.92, while 9 genes had highest expression levels at 37 °C under aw 0.92. Compared with 37 °C, all aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway genes were down-regulated at 42 °C. All the pathway genes and laeA were up-expressed at aw of 0.96 under 28 °C, compared to aw 0.99. Furthermore, there was a good positive correlation between the ratio of aflS/aflR and AFB1 production. The expression of laeA was also positively correlated with AFB1 production while the expression of brlA was correlated with the A. flavus growth. The results of this study suggest that AFB1 production in peanut kernels can occur over a wider range of aw × temperatures levels compared to formula media and peanut media. Previous studies have showed that AFB1 could not be produced on formula media at 37 °C without the expression of most aflatoxin structural genes. But, in the un-autoclaved shelled peanuts, high concentration of AFB1 was produced at 37 °C with up-regulation of some aflatoxin biosynthetic genes. From a food safety point of view, the results can be used to optimize certain food technological processes and develop prevention strategies to control such carcinogenic natural metabolites in grains (such as peanuts, maize and rice) and derived products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aaflatoxin B1 3abiochemical pathways 3acorn 3acorrelation 3afood safety 3agene expression regulation 3ametabolites 3amicrobial growth 3apeanuts 3aregulator genes 3arice 3aseeds 3astructural genes 3atemperature 3awater activity 0aMolds 0aAspergillus flavus 0aAflatoxin 0aWater activity 0aTemperature1 aGuan, Xuanli1 aXing, Fuguo1 aLv, Cong1 aDai, Xiaofeng1 aLiu, Yang0 tFood control.g2017 Dec., v. 82 p.325-332dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013500170300001600305520084200321592002801163650001201191650001301203650001901216650001001235650001301245650001701258650001401275650001301289700001501302700001701317773011301334856008501447852000901532655001201541IND60087248520221118110952.0141102e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008724852DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60469-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Tinglin10aEfficiency of active barriers attaching biofilm as sediment capping to eliminate the internal nitrogen in eutrophic lake and canal  ap. 738-743.  aThree active barrier materials (zeolite, ceramicite and light porous media) were applied for preventing nitrogen (N) release from eutrophic lake sediments. Long term experiment of two different lake sediments were carried out and the effect of zeolite dose was evaluated. The results indicated that about 90%-100% of total N in overlying water was eliminated by using zeolite. While the N removal efficiency by ceramic was lower than that by zeolite, and light porous media present the lowest efficiency of 59%. Long term sediment incubation experiments indicated that two eutrophic sediments were both effective in preventing N release in spite of different release characteristics.

There are multiple different experimental approaches that can be employed in the discovery of anti-TB agents. Notably, inhibitors of MmpL3 are numerous and structurally diverse in Mtb and have been discovered through the generation of spontaneous resistant mutants and subsequent whole genome sequencing studies. However, this approach is not always reliable and can lead to incorrect target assignment and requires orthogonal confirmatory approaches. In fact, many of these inhibitors have also been shown to act as multi-target agents, with secondary targets in Mtb, as well as in other non-MmpL3-containing pathogens. Herein, we have investigated further the cellular targets of the MmpL3-inhibitor BM212 and a number of BM212 analogues. To determine the alternative targets of BM212, which may have been masked by MmpL3 mutations, we have applied a combination of chemo-proteomic profiling using bead-immobilised BM212 derivatives and protein extracts, along with whole-cell and biochemical assays. The study identified EthR2 (Rv0078) as a protein that binds BM212 analogues. We further demonstrated binding of BM212 to EthR2 through an in vitro tryptophan fluorescence assay, which showed significant quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of BM212. Our studies have demonstrated the value of revisiting drugs with ambiguous targets, such as MmpL3, in an attempt to find alternative targets and the study of off-target effects to understand more precisely target engagement of new hits emerging from drug screening campaigns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3agenome 3atranscription factors 3atryptophan 0aMmpL3 0aEthR2 0aEthA2 0aBM2121 aCabanillas, Alejandro1 aBatt, Sarah M.1 aGhidelli-Disse, Sonja1 aUrones, Beatriz1 aSanz, Olalla1 aLelievre, Joel1 aBantscheff, Marcus1 aCox, Liam R.1 aBesra, Gurdyal S.0 tCell surface.g2021 Dec., v. 7 p.100068-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26762x2468-23307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcsw.2021.1000683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245008300204300001400287520179600301592002802097650001702125650002402142650001802166650002802184650002602212650001802238650001902256650001302275650001002288650000902298650001602307650002402323650001002347650001702357650001402374650002402388650001402412650001802426650001702444650001402461650001402475650002802489650001202517650001002529650001602539653002902555653002302584653002202607653002202629653001202651700001802663700005902681773010002740856008302840852000902923655001202932IND60598105820221121015133.0190411e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059810582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Witte, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7632-105X14aThe role of infectious agents in the development of porcine gastric ulceration  ap. 56-61.  aUlceration of the non-glandular part of the stomach is a common disease entity of pigs worldwide, with prevalences of up to 93%. It may result in decreased daily weight gain, decreased feed intake and sudden death, thus leading to significant economic losses, as well as animal welfare issues. The aetiology is multifactorial. Diet particle size, management and infectious agents have been hypothesised to be involved. The exact mechanism behind porcine gastric ulceration is, however, not completely clear. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the role of infectious agents in the development of porcine gastric ulceration. Results of recent studies indicate that Helicobacter suis infection plays an important role in gastric ulceration, probably by affecting gastric acid secretion through alteration of the number and/or function of parietal, D and G cells. In a gastric environment altered by H. suis, higher numbers of Fusobacterium gastrosuis are present and this novel pathogen has a potential role in the development of porcine gastric ulceration. Inoculation of pigs with Lactobacillus sp., Bacillus sp. or Helicobacter pylori-like bacteria in combination with a carbohydrate-rich diet may induce gastric lesions. It has been hypothesised that production of short chain fatty acids by some of these bacteria might be involved in the pathogenesis of porcine gastric ulceration, but the lack of taxonomic characterisation hampers the interpretation of these studies. Severe infectious diseases have also been associated with gastric lesions, probably due to interruption in feed intake and/or histamine release. Other agents, including fungi and parasites such as Hyostrongylus rubidus and Ascaris suum, have occasionally been associated with gastric lesions in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscaris suum 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aFusobacterium 3aHelicobacter heilmannii 3aHyostrongylus rubidus 3aLactobacillus 3aanimal welfare 3abacteria 3adeath 3adiet 3afeed intake 3afinancial economics 3afungi 3agastric acid 3ahistamine 3ainfectious diseases 3aparasites 3aparticle size 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3asecretion 3ashort chain fatty acids 3astomach 3aswine 3aweight gain 0aFusobacterium gastrosuis 0aGastric ulceration 0aHelicobacter suis 0aInfectious agents 0aPorcine1 aDucatelle, R.1 aHaesebrouck, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1709-933X0 tveterinary journal.g2018 June, v. 236 p.56-61dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011500168300002000283520141400303592002801717650001501745650001201760650001801772650001401790650002001804650002001824650001101844650001101855650001901866650002201885650001301907650001901920700002201939700002101961700005901982773017402041856008102215852000902296655001202305IND60793780420221118014443.0220921e20220906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079378042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c010282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantra, Somtirtha10aProcess Simulation and Multiobjective Optimization for High-Purity Hexane Recovery Using Deep Eutectic Solvent  ap. 13929-13943.  aDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) are an experimentally proven and attractive solvent in the field of green chemistry for aromatic extraction from a mixture of aliphatic–aromatic mixtures. The current work reports a multiscale strategy using quantum chemical calculations, thermodynamic models, process simulation, and multiobjective optimization for the simultaneous production of high-purity hexane and aromatic removal using the DES methyl triphenyl phosphonium bromide/ethylene glycol (1:4). Initially the phase equilibrium data have been benchmarked through the continuum solvation-based COSMO-SAC model, which has a root-mean-square deviation of 5.81%. Thereafter, a conceptual multiloop extraction and solvent recovery process has been developed and simulated that incorporates sensitivity analysis to analyze the impact of different process parameters on the system. These parameters, namely, annualized capital cost, benzene content in the hexane product stream, and hexane recovery, have been further formulated as three separate objective functions to be optimized using a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. After optimization, a series of solutions have been obtained from the Pareto front. The results provide 92% hexane recovery with a benzene concentration of less than 50 ppm. This shall enable the industrial production of high-purity hexane using efficient and sustainable green solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abenzene 3acapital costs 3achemistry 3aethylene glycol 3agreen chemistry 3ahexane 3amodels 3aprocess design 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvents 3athermodynamics1 aMaharana, Debasis1 aKotecha, Prakash1 aBanerjee, Tamal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8624-65860 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Sept. 06, v. 61, no. 37 p.13929-13943dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c010283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010000167300002000267520113100287592002801418650001201446650001201458650001101470650001901481700006401500700006301564700002001627700005801647773017401705856008101879852000901960655001201969IND60793780520220921000000.0220921e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079378052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c010862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehlouz, Aghilas10aEntropy Scaling-Based Correlation for Estimating the Self-Diffusion Coefficients of Pure Fluids  ap. 14033-14050.  aA new model for correlating self-diffusion coefficients is proposed here. It is based on the entropy scaling concept and makes it possible to quantitatively estimate self-diffusion coefficients in any fluid state (subcritical gas and liquid as well as supercritical states). A general relationship between a dimensionless form of the self-diffusion coefficient and a function of the Tv-residual entropy is proposed. This relationship involves thermodynamic properties that were straightforwardly estimated using the I-PC-SAFT and tc-PR equations of state (EoSs). First, the proposed model was parameterized using component-specific parameters. To do so, 72 pure components and ∼2400 pieces of experimental data were considered. Second, a chemical-family parametrization method was used. Four chemical families were defined, and parameter sets valid for all of the compounds of a given family were estimated. Regardless of the considered EoS, the component-specific parametrization enables us to describe data with an average deviation of 7.5%, while when using a chemical-family parametrization, this deviation reaches 9.5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3aliquids 3amodels 3aprocess design1 aJaubert, Jean-Noël,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7831-56841 aGalliero, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6393-83871 aBonnissel, Marc1 aPrivat, Romain1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6174-91600 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 61, no. 37 p.14033-14050dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c010863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011300166300001200279520085000291592002801141650001301169650002101182650002701203650001401230650001801244650001101262650001601273650001001289773012401299856008101423852000901504655001201513IND60523873220221119140915.0170717e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052387322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-2945-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudak, Paul F.10aEffect of Hydraulic Conductivity Contrast on Non-Pumped Wells in Backfilled Trenches for Aquifer Remediation  ap. 243.  aA groundwater flow and mass transport model simulated the remediation capability of non-pumped wells with filter media placed in backfilled trenches in homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers.

For each setting, the model also simulated base configurations with backfill hydraulic conductivity one and two orders of magnitude lower and one and two orders of magnitude higher than the mean of the aquifer. In general, backfill with a hydraulic conductivity equal to the mean of the aquifer, or slightly higher, outperformed other scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3agroundwater flow 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amass flow 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aremediation 3awells0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2016 July, v. 227, no. 7 p.243-243dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-2945-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015800153300001800311520130400329592002801633650001501661650001101676650001401687650003001701650002101731650001101752650000901763650001601772650001301788650002201801700001401823700001301837700001801850700001401868700001701882700001801899773012101917856007402038852000902112655001202121IND60631274020221122223757.0190220e20190206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063127402DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra00185a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Jia14aThe identification of active N species in N-doped carbon carriers that improve the activity of Fe electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction  ap. 4806-4811.  aNitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials have become some of the most effective carriers for transition metal-based electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction. However, the specific active nitrogen species in nitrogen-doped carriers remains unclear up to now. To identify the active nitrogen species, herein, we prepare nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres containing different types of nitrogen species and a small amount of Fe atoms. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the Fe/nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres with more graphitic nitrogen exhibit much higher activity for the oxygen evolution reaction than those with more pyridinic nitrogens and pyrrolic nitrogens in alkaline media, revealing that the graphitic nitrogen is the active species that greatly improves the activity of Fe catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the graphitic nitrogen enhances the activity and stability of Fe-based catalysts mainly through increasing the adsorption energy, charge and spin densities of the Fe atoms loaded around it. These findings provide a brand-new perspective for rationally designing more effective transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction through controlling the active graphitic nitrogen distribution in carbon carriers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3airon 3ananospheres 3anitrogen 3aoxygen production1 aLiu, Ziwu1 aHan, Fei1 aKang, Guo-Jun1 aLiu, Ling1 aLiu, Jinlong1 aWang, Quan-De0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 06, v. 9, no. 9 p.4806-4811dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra00185a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245011700206300002000323520155500343592002801898650004401926650003701970650001102007650002102018650002302039650002502062650001602087650004102103650002702144650002302171650002102194650004402215650001402259650002002273700001502293700001602308700001702324700001202341700001802353700001202371700001302383773012202396856008702518852000902605655001202614IND60626276220221122045924.0181220e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062627622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b033072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Shuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5635-642610aMolecular Structure and Electronic Properties of Oil Shale Kerogen: An Experimental and Molecular Modeling Study  ap. 12394-12404.  aIn this study, structural parameters of Longkou oil shale kerogen were examined and identified by the combination of pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Based on the experimental data, a three-dimensional kerogen model was generated using quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics methods. The optimized molecular configuration was discussed, which showed good agreement with the experimental results in terms of structural characteristics. Electron density analysis was performed to examine the bonding characteristics of kerogen, and the bond length distribution of the Longkou kerogen model was analyzed, revealing that the S atom exhibits higher affinity for the H atom compared to the aliphatic carbon from the comparison of the electron density of the C–S and S–H bonding regions. Mulliken charge analysis was carried out to evaluate the partial atomic charges of heteroatoms. The charges on the cyclic structure tended to be equally distributed because of the presence of conjugated π bond, leading to the loss of charges on the N atoms. Besides, the HOMO–LUMO properties of Longkou kerogen were calculated, and a detailed picture of the frontier orbitals of kerogen for the inter- or intramolecular chemical reactions was obtained. This study validated that polycyclic aromatic structures in kerogen play a crucial role in the reactive sites for bond cleavage during the deformation of kerogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adeformation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amolecular conformation 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoil shale 3astable isotopes1 aWang, Qing1 aBai, Jingru1 aChi, Mingshu1 aCui, Da1 aWang, Zhichao1 aLiu, Qi1 aXu, Fang0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 32, no. 12 p.12394-12404dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b033073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245007500177300001800252520119600270592002801466650001201494650001401506650001201520650001401532650001501546653002201561653002601583653001301609653002901622700002501651700001901676700002101695700002401716773014501740856008601885852000901971655001201980IND60772127020221119232907.0220819e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077212702DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.18546742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosibo, Ornella Kongi10aExtrusion cooking of protein-based products: potentials and challenges  ap. 2526-2547.  aExtrusion cooking is receiving increasing attention as technology applied for the production of protein-based products. Researchers in this field showed that proteins from several sources are barely consumed because of their poor functionality and lack of acceptability related to the presence of some antinutritional factors. In this regard, extrusion is becoming of key importance thanks to its ability to improve protein functional properties. Based on this remarkable advantage, several studies have been published so far providing evidence of the enhanced functional, physicochemical and sensory properties of protein-based extruded products. The objective of the present review is to give a detailed overview of the potential of extrusion for the production of protein-based products. More specifically, the work describes all the studies published so far on vegetable and animal proteins including those recently released applying the technology on insect proteins. The aspects related to the functional properties of the extrudates together with the quality changes occurring during the process are also described to highlight the potential of the technology for future applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aextrusion 3ainsects 3anutrition 3avegetables 0aExtrusion cooking 0afunctional properties 0aproteins 0aprotein-based extrudates1 aFerrentino, Giovanna1 aAlam, Md Rizvi1 aMorozova, Ksenia1 aScampicchio, Matteo0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 62, no. 9 p.2526-2547dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.18546743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01279naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245004600161300001800207520039200225592002800617650001200645650002600657650001100683650001400694650001600708650001400724700002200738773013400760856007400894852000900968655001200977IND60638746920221121232924.0190430e20160329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063874692DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc01494a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlank, Taylor N.12aA G₄·K⁺ hydrogel that self-destructs  ap. 5037-5040.  aA G₄-quartet based hydrogel formed by self-assembly of borate esters of 5′-deoxy-5′-iodoguanosine (5′-IG 2) undergoes in situ cyclization to give 5′-deoxy-N3,5′-cycloguanosine (5′-cG 3).

The effect of such events on relief tends to persist for long periods of time and affects the future development of such systems. This paper focuses on changes in middle mountain valleys associated with an extreme hydro-geomorphological event that occurred in the Western Tatra Mountains (Polish Carpathian Mountains) in June of 2007. The geomorphological effects were mapped and an analysis of valley-bottom deposits and dendro-geomorphological data on tree roots and stems was used to identify patterns in the geomorphological transformation taking place during such events. In addition, the organic material obtained from fans was dated by means of carbon-14 dating. The effects of previous extreme events in the study area and their geomorphological outcomes were compared. Four main valley section types were identified in the valley longitudinal profile. Unevenly aged (from 14C 390±30years YBP (1441–1631calAD) to 14C 3760±70 YBP (4318–3962cal BP)) organic material was revealed at different depths of each studied fan. A complex structure with alternating layers of fine and coarse material from the analysed fans was identified. The colluvial-alluvial structure of fans suggests that extreme high-energy events did occur more than once per century during the Holocene. This type of fan structure can be referred to as a patchwork. In the study area, rainfall with high energy potential occurs once in every 6–9 years and extreme hydro-geomorphological events occur every 15years. This type of extreme event may not be exceptional in the history of middle mountain areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amountains 3aradiocarbon dating 3arain 3aroots 3astems 3atopographic slope 3atrees 3avalleys 3aCarpathian region 3aPoland 0aExtreme hydro-geomorphological events 0aGeomorphological effects 0aMiddle mountain valleys 0aColluvial-alluvial fans 0aWestern Tatra Mountains1 aKrzemień, Kazimierz,1 aWrońska-Wałach, Dominika1 aBoniecki, Mariusz0 tCatena.g2014 Oct., v. 121 p.127-141dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2014.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245015700163300002000320520148900340592002801829596009801857596009801955596009502053596007302148650001102221650002102232650003102253650001502284650001702299650001302316650001502329650001802344650002302362650001902385700001302404700001802417700001602435700001902451700005702470700005402527773017402581856008102755852000902836655001202845IND60793780720221118014344.0220921e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079378072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c012562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Kuilin10aMolecular-Level Insights into Interfacial Interaction–Nanostructure Relationships of Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids around Carbon Nanotube Electrodes  ap. 14051-14065.  aHere, we performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to systematically explore the relationships between interfacial interactions and nanostructures of an imidazolium-based ([BMIM][BF₄]) ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte around single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes with various charge densities and nanotube diameters. Our simulation results showed that the aggregation of [BMIM]⁺ cations around the negative electrodes is dominated by the Coulombic interactions. Meanwhile, it is unexpectedly found that a certain amount of [BMIM]⁺ cations is distributed near the positive electrode surface, which is attributed to the combined effect of their attractive Coulombic interactions with anions and π–π stacking interactions with nanotubes. Further analysis reveals that the imidazolium rings of cations around the negative (or positive) electrodes with a lower charge density exhibit more ordered orientations compared to the counterparts with a higher charge density. Such phenomena mainly occur because a lower charge density is favorable to form stronger π–π stacking interactions between cations and nanotube electrodes as well as stronger hydrogen bonds within interfacial cations and anions. Hereto, our findings present a crucial step to interpret complicated interactions and nanostructures at the electrolyte–electrode interface, which would benefit experiments in designing high-performance supercapacitors based on carbon electrodes and IL electrolytes.  aPublisher supplied data  a21863005cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22008096cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aGJJ200337cEducation Department of Jiangxi Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009102  aNAcJiangxi Normal Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012135 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogen 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3amolecular dynamics 3aprocess design1 aLin, Jie1 aYang, Deshuai1 aFu, Fangjia1 aDai, Zhongyang1 aZhou, Guobing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6860-145X1 aYang, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5205-32810 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 61, no. 37 p.14051-14065dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c012563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007800159300001700237500001100254520106200265592002801327650001401355650002201369650002501391650001101416650001401427650002401441650001401465650001301479650000901492700002101501700002901522700002001551773011801571856007301689852000901762655001201771IND60587995720221122045107.0180103e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058799572DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.127972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibert, Jean P.14aThe ecological consequences of environmentally induced phenotypic changes  ap. 997-1003.  aLETTER  aPopulation dynamics and species persistence are often mediated by species traits. Yet many important traits, like body size, can be set by resource availability and predation risk. Environmentally induced changes in resource levels or predation risk may thus have downstream ecological consequences. Here, we assess whether quantity and type of resources affect the phenotype, the population dynamics, and the susceptibility to predation of a mixotrophic protist through experiments and a model. We show that cell shape, but not size, changes with resource levels and type, and is linked to carrying capacity, thus affecting population dynamics. Also, these changes lead to differential susceptibility to predation, with direct consequences for predator‐prey dynamics. We describe important links between environmental changes, traits, population dynamics and ecological interactions, that underscore the need to further understand how trait‐mediated interactions may respond to environmental shifts in resource levels in an increasingly changing world.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody size 3acarrying capacity 3aenvironmental impact 3amodels 3aphenotype 3apopulation dynamics 3apredation 3aprotists 3arisk1 aAllen, Rachel L.1 aHruska, Ron J., IIIcIII1 aDeLong, John P.0 tEcology letters.g2017 Aug., v. 20, no. 8 p.997-1003dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.127973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001200298500001500310520149800325592002801823650001101851650001701862650001401879650002501893650001801918650001501936650002901951650002001980650001602000650001102016650001102027650002302038650001602061650001102077653002502088700002002113700001602133700002302149700002502172700001902197773011302216856008102329852000902410655001202419IND60523873520221119140959.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052387352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-016-2203-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMareri, Lavinia10aHeat stress affects the distribution of JIM8-labelled arabinogalactan proteins in pistils of Solanum lycopersicum cv Micro-Tom  ap. 184.  a2019-12-06  aArabinogalactan-proteins are a family of highly glycosylated hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins widely distributed in the plant kingdom and mainly located at the cell surface. Because of their great heterogeneity, abundance and ubiquitous localization, arabinogalactan-proteins are thought to play important and different roles in plant growth and development. Many evidences also indicate a role of arabinogalactan-proteins during reproduction as well as in response to stress conditions. In the present work, we investigated the distribution of arabinogalactan-proteins recognised by JIM8 antibody in pistils of Solanum lycopersicum cv Micro-Tom heat-stressed for 3 h at 42 °C at different developmental stages (5 and 10 days before anthesis). Our results indicate that high temperature strongly affects the distribution and content of arabinogalactan-proteins in stigma and ovule, particularly in samples heat-stressed 5 days before anthesis. In stigmas, cells exhibited an altered pattern of JIM8-labelled AGPs, dispersed and less abundant. In ovules, the embryo sac-surrounding cells showed a clear reduction in the content of JIM8-labelled arabinogalactan proteins. These evidences suggest that heat stress affects both content and distribution of AGPs. Considering the role of AGPs in plant reproduction, from the acquisition of stigmatic receptivity to pollen guidance into the ovule, we can suppose that high temperature affects all these processes through the alteration of AGPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aovules 3aplant growth 3aflowering 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aglycosylation 3aantibodies 3aarabinogalactan proteins 3astress response 3aheat stress 3astigma 3apistil 3aplant reproduction 3atemperature 3apollen 0adevelopmental stages1 aFaleri, Claudia1 aRomi, Marco1 aMariani, Celestina1 aCresti, M.q(Mauro),1 aCai, Giampiero0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2016 July, v. 38, no. 7 p.184-184dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-016-2203-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009100172300001800263520156800281592002801849650001701877650002501894650001001919650000901929650001201938650001701950650001301967650000901980650002401989650001402013650001602027650001102043650001302054650001102067653001602078653001502094653001502109653001802124700001902142700002202161700003002183700001902213773014502232856008602377852000902463655001202472IND60772127220221119232857.0220819e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077212722DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.18567722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aS, Jeya Krithika10aOptimization of extraction parameters and stabilization of anthocyanin from onion peel  ap. 2560-2567.  aA large amount of onion waste is produced by the food industries. This onion waste contains high-value functional ingredients, since several compounds and nutrients are present in onion peel. The objective of this work is to extract and stabilize the anthocyanin from onion peel waste in various forms. The major component present in onion peel is anthocyanin. The anthocyanin was extracted from onion peel by the microwave-assisted extraction process. A fractional factorial experiment was used to carry out 16 possible extractions instead of 64 possible extractions. The highest yield of total anthocyanin content such as 21.99 attains when using 2 g of onion peel with the extraction time 5 minutes, power as 700 W, ethanol concentration as 75 mL, and solvent feed ratio as 20 g/mL. The anthocyanin was stabilized in three ways such as co-pigmentation, a combination of buffer and hardpan coating. The most stable and colorless anthocyanin was observed by the co-pigmentation method. Stable and red color anthocyanin is obtained using a combination of buffer and dark brown color stable anthocyanin is perceived using hard pan coating. The antioxidant activity of each sample was studied during 3 weeks of storage. Sample A (co-pigmented sample) showed 75% of antioxidant activity, sample B (hardpan coating) exhibited 60% of antioxidant activity and sample C (buffer combination) confirmed 81% of antioxidant activity. This anthocyanin study can be used in future studies for various applications such as the preservation of meat and natural colorant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3adyes 3aethanol 3afood science 3ahardpans 3ameat 3amicrowave treatment 3anutrition 3aonion peels 3aonions 3asolvents 3awastes 0aAnthocyanin 0aextraction 0aonion peel 0astabilization1 aB, Sathiyasree1 aE, Beniz Theodore1 aChithiraikannu, Ramarajan1 aK, Gurushankar0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 62, no. 9 p.2560-2567dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.18567723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014100161300001800302520216500320592002802485650001802513650002102531650001502552650001602567650001002583650002102593650001302614650002302627650001902650650001602669650001902685650001102704650002202715650001202737650001802749650001902767650002002786650001502806650001302821651001202834700001802846700002002864700002002884700002202904700002102926700002002947773014502967856007403112852000903186655001203195IND60662011620221119073750.0190904e20110830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066201162DNAL7 a10.1039/c1em10139k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWindolf, Jørgen12aA distributed modelling system for simulation of monthly runoff and nitrogen sources, loads and sinks for ungauged catchments in Denmark  ap. 2645-2658.  aWe validated an existing physically based 3D MIKE SHE groundwater resource model (DK-model) at 175 Danish gauging stations covering different catchment sizes in order to calculate monthly water runoff in the 50% ungauged part of Denmark. Model performance was in most cases good (61% of gauging stations had a Nash–Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient >0.60) but nevertheless showed a large seasonal and georegion specific bias. Therefore, bias correction factors had to be developed before applying the DK-model simulations of runoff in the ungauged areas. Simulated monthly runoff from ungauged areas and the measured monthly runoff from 178 gauging stations were distributed to 2663 smaller Hydrological Units (ca. 15 km²) and linked with a new empirical model for flow-weighted monthly total nitrogen (TN) concentrations (R² = 0.43; P < 0.0001) developed based on 20 years of observations (1990–2009) in 83 small catchments for calculation of monthly gross diffuse TN-loads from HU's. Nitrogen retention was calculated in streams, lakes and wetlands utilising both lake specific models and rate coefficients to calculate N retention in surface water bodies. The whole model complex was linked in the DK-QN concept for simulation of monthly TN losses from point sources and diffuse sources, TN retention and resulting loadings to Danish coastal waters. The DK-QN model was validated in 118 gauged catchments and the model simulations had for >25% of the observations of monthly discharge weighted TN concentrations a NS larger than 0.26. Catchment specific monthly TN-loadings were modelled with a higher performance as 50% of the catchments had a NS greater than 0.75. The model concept allows calculation of N retention in streams, lakes and wetlands and the average annual model calculated N retention amounted to 21% of the modelled gross riverine TN loadings. The average annual gross TN loading to surface freshwater in Denmark derived from diffuse sources amounted to 97 000 tonnes N (91% of gross TN loadings) which is 54% of the total estimated N-leaching from the root zone on the Danish land area (212 000 tonnes N) during the period 1990–2009.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal water 3aempirical models 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3alakes 3amodel validation 3anitrogen 3anitrogen retention 3apollution load 3arhizosphere 3ariparian areas 3arunoff 3asimulation models 3astreams 3asurface water 3atotal nitrogen 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aDenmark1 aThodsen, Hans1 aTroldborg, Lars1 aLarsen, Søren,1 aBøgestrand, Jens1 aOvesen, Niels B.1 aKronvang, Brian0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2011 Aug. 30, v. 13, no. 9 p.2645-2658dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10139k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245014600177300001600323520145000339592002801789650001501817650001401832650001401846650002301860650001401883650001701897650002001914650002001934650001801954650001801972650001901990650001402009650002802023650001702051650001502068700002802083773012302111856008202234852000902316655001202325IND60523176620221120200532.0200303e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052317662DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-015-0562-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrasekaran, Murugesan10aIn Vitro Selective Anti-Proliferative Effect of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles Against Co-Cultured C2C12 Myoblastoma Cancer and 3T3-L1 Normal Cells  ap. 148-154.  aThe zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle has been widely used in biomedical applications and cancer therapy and has been reported to induce a selective cytotoxic effect on cancer cell proliferation. The present study investigated the cytotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles against co-cultured C2C12 myoblastoma cancer cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results showed that the ZnO nanoparticles could be cytotoxic to C2C12 myoblastoma cancer cells than 3T3-L1 cells. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of p53 and bax were significantly increased 114.3 and 118.2 % in the C2C12 cells, whereas 42.5 and 40 % were increased in 3T3-L1 cells, respectively. The mRNA expression of bcl-2 was reduced 38.2 and 28.5 % in the C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells, respectively, whereas the mRNA expression of caspase-3 was increased 80.7 and 51.6 % in the C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells, respectively. The protein expressions of p53, bax, and caspase-3 were significantly increased 40, 81.8, and 80 % in C2C12 cells, whereas 20.3, 28.2, and 37.9 % were increased in 3T3-L1 cells, respectively. The mRNA expression of bcl-2 was significantly reduced 32.2 and 22.7 % in C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells, respectively. Caspase-3 enzyme activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased in co-cultured C2C12 cells compared to 3T3-L1 cells. Taking all these data together, it may suggest that ZnO nanoparticles severely induce apoptosis in C2C12 myoblastoma cancer cells than 3T3-L1 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3acoculture 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics 3azinc oxide1 aPandurangan, Muthuraman0 tBiological trace element research.g2016 July, v. 172, no. 1 p.148-154dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-015-0562-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009900162300001800261520101200279592002801291650001701319650001801336650002301354650002301377650002301400650001701423650001301440650001501453700001801468700002201486700002801508700002001536700002201556700002901578700002101607700002901628773012701657856008201784852000901866655001201875IND60567752520221116205751.0170425e20170316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056775252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b013142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohan, Minu10aEfficient Organic Photovoltaics with Improved Charge Extraction and High Short-Circuit Current  ap. 5523-5530.  aExciton generation, dissociation, free carrier transport, and charge extraction play an important role in the short-circuit current (Jₛc) and power conversion efficiency of an organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell (SC). Here we study the impact of band offset at the interfacial layer and the morphology of active layer on the extraction of free carriers. The effects are evaluated on an inverted BHJ SC using zinc oxide (ZnO) as a buffer layer, prepared via two different methods: ZnO nanoparticle dispersed in mixed solvents (ZnO A) and sol–gel method (ZnO B). The device with ZnO A buffer layer improves the charge extraction and Jₛc. The improvement is due to the better band offset and morphology of the blend near the ZnO A/active layer interface. Further, the numerical analysis of current–voltage characteristics illustrates that the morphology at the ZnO A/active layer interface has a more dominant role in improving the performance of the organic photovoltaic than the band offset.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3ananoparticles 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aphysical chemistry 3asol-gel processing 3asolar energy 3asolvents 3azinc oxide1 aNandal, Vikas1 aParamadam, Sanish1 aReddy, Kasala Prabhakar1 aRamkumar, Sekar1 aAgarwal, Sumanshu1 aGopinath, Chinnakonda S.1 aNair, Pradeep R.1 aNamboothiry, Manoj A.

Here, we focus on the latter mechanism which usually receives less attention. To better understand the possible advantages of the ‘reduction-first’ approach, we compare the two general strategies according to the kinetics of the CO2-capturing enzymes, and the resource consumption of the subsequent pathways. We show that the best CO2 reducing enzymes can compete with the best carboxylases. We further demonstrate that pathways that fix CO2 by first reducing it to formate could have an advantage over the majority of their carboxylation-only counterparts in terms of ATP-efficiency and hence biomass yield. We discuss and elaborate on the challenges of implementing ‘reduction-first’ pathways, including the thermodynamic barrier of CO2 reduction. We believe that pathways based on CO2 reduction are a valuable addition to nature's arsenal for capturing inorganic carbon and could provide promising metabolic solutions that have been previously overlooked.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarbon monoxide 3acarboxylation 3aenzymes 3aformates 3ametabolites 3athermodynamics1 aEdlich-Muth, Christian1 aBar-Even, Arren0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2018 Feb., v. 49 p.49-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2017.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245013700212300001200349506007600361520152700437592002801964506003701992650002202029650001402051650001402065650001802079650001302097650002002110650002702130650002102157650002402178650003002202650001502232650001202247650001302259650001502272650001302287650001302300650001702313700003002330700002502360700002302385700002602408700002302434700002502457700001802482700002002500773010902520856008202629852000902711655001202720IND60523873820221207110937.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052387382DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0448-02doi7 aPMC49255692pmcid7 a283302202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArun, Muthukrishnan10aInvolvement of exogenous polyamines enhances regeneration and Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation in half-seeds of soybean  ap. 148.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present work demonstrates the participation of polyamines (PAs) to improve direct regeneration and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in soybean half-seeds. The inclusion of PAs to culture medium along with optimal plant growth regulators (PGRs) enhanced shoot induction [98.3 %; 4.44 µM N⁶-benzyladenine (BA) and 103.27 µM spermidine] and elongation [90.0 %; 1.45 µM gibberellic acid (GA₃) and 49.42 µM spermine]. The polyamine putrescine (62.08 µM) alone greatly enriched root induction (96.3 %). The influence of PAs on transformed plant production was assessed by comparing optimized protocol (comprising PAs and PGRs) with a regeneration system involving only PGRs. Plant transformation was performed in half-seeds of cultivar DS 97–12 using strain EHA105 harboring pCAMBIA1301. Transgene expression and integration was confirmed by GUS staining, PCR, and Southern hybridization. The transformed explants/materials successively cultured on co-cultivation (BA and spermidine), shoot induction (BA and spermidine), shoot elongation (GA₃ and spermine), and rooting medium (putrescine) showed enhanced transformation efficiency (29.3 %) compared with its counterparts (14.6 %) with respective PGR alone [BA, GA₃, or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)]. Overall findings of the study suggest that involvement of PAs improved T-DNA transfer during co-cultivation, and delivered most suitable condition for efficient regeneration/survival, which led to enhanced transformation efficiency in soybean.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSouthern blotting 3acoculture 3acultivars 3aculture media 3aexplants 3agene expression 3agenetic transformation 3agibberellic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aputrescine 3arooting 3asoybeans 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3astaining 3atransfer DNA1 aChinnathambi, Arunachalam1 aSubramanyam, Kondeti1 aKarthik, Sivabalan1 aSivanandhan, Ganeshan1 aTheboral, Jeevaraj1 aAlharbi, SulaimanAli1 aKim, ChangKil1 aGanapathi, Andy0 t3 Biotech.g2016 Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.148-148dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-016-0448-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04735naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002800191245014000219506007600359506003100435520216800466592002802634596009502662596006602757596006402823506003702887650002402924650001902948650002002967650001302987650001103000650001703011650001203028650002103040650001503061650001403076650001303090650001903103650002403122650002103146650003103167650001903198650001403217650001303231650001303244650001303257650001903270650002203289650002103311650001003332650001503342650001503357650001603372650001503388650001803403650001303421651001403434653003203448653002803480653003803508653002503546653002803571700002203599700002203621700002403643700002403667700002003691773011603711856008503827961002003912852000903932655001203941IND60679093220221207090345.0200128e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067909322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1177692chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1177692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToczydlowski, Alan J.Z.10aEffect of simulated emerald ash borer infestation on nitrogen cycling in black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands in northern Minnesota, USA  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aBlack ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands are an important economic, cultural, and ecological resource in the northern Great Lake States, USA, and are threatened by the invasive insect, emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmmaire [EAB]). EAB-induced ash mortality can increase air temperatures, alter understory vegetation communities, and modify wetland hydrology by elevating the water table following canopy dieback, which may, in turn, alter nitrogen cycling in wetland soils and affect plant N uptake, N export to watersheds, and N emissions to the atmosphere. We sampled soils in replicated 1.6-ha plots six years after the following treatments were applied: girdling all ash greater than six cm diameter to simulate EAB-induced mortality, clearcutting with removal of all trees, and an unharvested control. In situ samples were collected from soil cores and from adjacent bulk areas influenced by vegetation to measure the concentration and rates of accumulation of inorganic nitrogen over the 2017 growing season. In the soil cores, the greatest nitrogen accumulation occurred in the unharvested control treatment and nitrate/nitrite were the dominant species of inorganic N. In contrast, in bulk soils, the clearcut treatment had greater overall nitrogen mineralization than both the control and girdle treatments, and ammonium had a greater relative abundance than nitrite/nitrate. Potential N mineralization (assessed with a lab incubation) was not affected by treatment, indicating that treatment effects observed in the field were likely due to changes in the microenvironment. Overall, the effect of simulated EAB on net nitrogen mineralization rates was minimal as mineralization was greatly constrained by ecosystem conditions compared to suitable, laboratory conditions, under which potential N mineralization was an order of magnitude greater than measured in the field. However, canopy treatment influenced water table levels, soil temperature, and vegetation communities, all of which influenced the relative abundance of inorganic N species. Our findings indicate limited indirect effects of EAB on net N mineralization in black ash wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100012149  cNorthern Research Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014511  cUniversity of Minnesotadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000072490 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aFraxinus nigra 3aair temperature 3aammonium 3acanopy 3aclearcutting 3adieback 3adominant species 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3agirdling 3agrowing season 3ainsect infestations 3ainvasive species 3alaboratory experimentation 3amineralization 3amortality 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aplant communities 3asoil temperature 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avegetation 3awater table 3awatersheds 3awetland soils 3awetlands 3aMinnesota 0aForested wetland management 0aNitrogen mineralization 0aPotential nitrogen mineralization 0aField lab comparison 0aFoundation species loss1 aSlesak, Robert A.1 aKolka, Randall K.1 aVenterea, Rodney T.1 aD'Amato, Anthony W.1 aPalik, Brian J.0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 458 p.117769-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1177693Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARSUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245010700197300001800304506007600322520041000398592002800808506003700836650002600873650001700899650001900916650001300935650003100948650001900979650001600998650002001014650001501034700001101049700001601060700001601076700001501092700001201107700001801119700002001137700001801157700001801175700001801193700001401211700001501225700002201240773013401262856007401396852000901470655001201479IND60638747320221207112140.0190430e20160331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063874732DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc01508e2doi7 aPMC52715822pmcid7 a269974572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Qiuyan10aDiscovery of a ¹⁹F MRI sensitive salinomycin derivative with high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells  ap. 5136-5139.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalinomycin is a promising anti-cancer agent which selectively targets cancer stem cells.

Average values were between 0.1 and 3.7 mg kg⁻¹ in sediment, and between 0.2 and 37 μg L⁻¹ in water. The sorption of surfactants was dominated by hydrophobic mechanisms, so those homologues having longer alkyl chains (e.g. C₁₈AEO) showed higher relative percentages and concentrations in sediments compared with water. Local and sharply higher concentrations of these compounds were observed at three sampling stations (7, 9 and 12), indicating the occurrence of wastewater discharges into the river. By analysing the distributions of different surfactant homologues and their metabolites we were able to distinguish between sewage contamination from sources discharging treated and untreated wastewaters. Upstream (stations 1–2), LAS concentrations were below 30 μg L⁻¹ and the composition of their degradation intermediates (sulfophenyl carboxylic acids, SPCs) (160 μg L⁻¹) was dominated by short-chain homologues (C₆–C₉SPCs), indicating that the degradation of this surfactant is at an advanced stage. The highest concentration (487 μg L⁻¹) of SPCs was detected near the effluent outlet of a sewage treatment plant (STP) (station 12). Sampling stations (7 and 9) affected by untreated wastewater discharges were the only ones showing the presence of the most reactive and biodegradable SPC isomers and homologues (e.g. C₁₁SPC). Here, LAS reached the highest concentration values measured (>2 mg L⁻¹), and showed a homologue distribution closer to that of commercial mixtures than LAS found at the other stations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acarboxylic acids 3ahydrophobicity 3aisomers 3ametabolites 3anonylphenols 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asediments 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asorption 3asulfonates 3asurfactants 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3aSpain1 aLara-Martín, Pablo A.1 aCandela, Lucila1 aGonzález-Mazo, Eduardo0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2011 July 6, v. 13, no. 7 p.2010-2017dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10150a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010400161300001400265500002000279520170200299592002802001650001902029650001702048650002602065650001102091650001502102650002502117650002702142650002202169650002102191650001502212650003002227650001102257650001202268650003202280650001802312650001502330650001102345650001202356651001702368700002702385773010702412856007302519852000902592655001202601IND60523873920221119141409.0160629e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052387392DNAL7 a10.1111/wbm.120942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuwanza, Sheunesu10aEffects of the invasive shrub, Lantana camara, on soil properties in the Eastern Cape, South Africa  ap. 67-79.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLantana camara L. is an invasive alien shrub of worldwide significance due to its impacts on biodiversity. It can alter the soil properties of invaded ecosystems and, as a result, affect management outcomes. However, knowledge on the impacts of L. camara on soil properties is scanty, especially in South Africa, despite the pervasive presence of the plant in the country. In this comparative study, the soils underneath L. camara were assessed in order to determine if they had different properties (soil physico‐chemical properties, penetration resistance, infiltration, hydraulic conductivity and water repellency) in comparison to the soils in adjacent natural sites in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Soil samples were collected from the top soil beneath the canopy of both L. camara‐invaded and adjacent natural sites in five different locations over three summer months. The soils that were collected from underneath L. camara had a significantly higher total C, total P, gravimetric soil moisture (in November and December) and were repellent, compared to the soils in the adjacent natural sites. Soil penetration resistance was significantly higher in the natural sites than in the L. camara‐invaded sites. The soil hydraulic conductivity, soil infiltration rate, soil pH, exchangeable cations and total N showed no significant difference between the invaded and the natural sites. It appears that the soils underneath L. camara have a high total C and total P, soil moisture and are repellent, thus influencing nutrient cycling, potentially making the soil properties underneath it ideal for its own growth. This could contribute to the success of L. camara as an invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLantana camara 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3aexchangeable cations 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ainfiltration rate 3ainvasive species 3aphosphorus 3aresistance to penetration 3ashrubs 3asoil pH 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3asummer 3atopsoil 3aSouth Africa1 aShackleton, Charlie M.0 tWeed biology and management.g2016 June, v. 16, no. 2 p.67-79dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1444-61627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wbm.120943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00965naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245005300156520015800209592002800367650001800395650001300413650001200426650001300438650002000451650001200471773012100483856007400604852000900678655001200687IND60763604220221120201822.0220120e20211231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076360422DNAL7 a10.3390/v140100682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusi, Petri 10aSpecial Issue: Virus Receptors and Viral Tropism  aCell surface receptors play a key role in a virus’ ability to recognize and invade cells and tissues, which basically defines viral pathogenicity [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3apathogenicity 3asurfaces 3atissues 3atropisms 3avirus receptors 3aviruses0 tViruses.g2021 Dec. 31, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140100683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03938naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015900159300001800318520222300336592002802559650002102587650002002608650001902628650001602647650001602663650001102679650001502690650001202705650000902717650001202726650002102738650002202759650003502781650003002816650003502846650003402881650001402915650002402929650001602953650001602969650001002985651001502995651001103010700001603021700002203037700002703059700002003086700002103106700001803127773014403145856007403289852000903363655001203372IND60662011920221119073639.0190904e20110608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066201192DNAL7 a10.1039/c1em10151j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLignell, Sanna10aLarge variation in breast milk levels of organohalogenated compounds is dependent on mother's age, changes in body composition and exposures early in life  ap. 1607-1616.  aWe identified factors that are important determinants of body burdens (breast milk levels) of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs)) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). PCBs, PCDD/Fs and PBDEs were analysed in breast milk from up to 325 first-time mothers in Uppsala, Sweden, who delivered between 1996 and 2006. Hierarchical clustering was used as a method for identification of groups of compounds with common sources of exposure and similar toxicokinetics. Based on correlations between levels of single compounds/congeners in breast milk, distinctly separated clusters were formed, strongly dependent on structural similarities of the organohalogen molecules. In a multiple regression model, levels of PCBs (except PCB 28), PCDD/Fs and BDE-153 were positively associated with age of the mother and weight loss after delivery and inversely associated with pre-pregnancy BMI (body mass index) and weight gain during pregnancy. Higher levels of mono-ortho PCB TEQ, non-ortho PCB TEQ and BDE-153 in milk were found among women with high physical activity. Women who were breastfed during infancy and grew up on the Baltic coast of Sweden, with high availability of contaminated fish from the Baltic sea, had higher levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in breast milk indicating that exposure early in life from breast milk and contaminated fish may still affect body burdens at the time of pregnancy. The importance of current consumption of fatty Baltic fish as a source of exposure was supported by the positive association with breast milk levels of mono-ortho PCB TEQ, PCDF TEQ and BDE-153. The results show that, in contrast to the lower brominated PBDE congeners, the hexa-brominated BDE-153 resembles the chlorinated compounds with regards to determinants in breast milk. This suggests that some of the PBDEs may have toxicokinetic properties and that are similar to the PCBs and PCDD/Fs. Our results show that a few simple advices to women regarding weight changes in connection with pregnancy and consumption of contaminated fatty fish during the whole lifetime may lower the levels of dioxins in breast milk by up to 60%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3abromination 3acoasts 3afatty fish 3ainfancy 3amilk 3amothers 3apharmacokinetics 3aphysical activity 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 3awomen 3aBaltic Sea 3aSweden1 aAune, Marie1 aDarnerud, Per Ola1 aSoeria-Atmadja, Daniel1 aHanberg, Annika1 aLarsson, Susanna1 aGlynn, Anders0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2011 June 8, v. 13, no. 6 p.1607-1616dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10151j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245021400180300001200394520192900406592002802335650002202363650002302385650001202408650002902420650001202449650001302461650001302474650000902487650003002496650001302526650002002539650001102559650001402570650001902584650000702603650000902610650003302619650000902652650002102661650000902682651001802691651001102709700003002720700003102750700003502781773011502816856008102931852000903012655001203021IND60523177020221121023444.0171213e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052317702DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5755-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Mendiola, Ernesto10aSolid phases controlling the mobility of potentially toxic elements and the generation of acid drainage in abandoned mine gold wastes from San Antonio–El Triunfo mining district, Baja California Sur, México  ap. 969.  aIn many countries of Latin America (Mexico included), As and other toxic elements in water and soils may have a natural geogenic origin; however, the anthropogenic activities (specially in mining areas) trigger the metal(loid)s mobilization (mainly by acid mine drainage) aggravating the environmental pollution problem. In San Antonio–El Triunfo mining district (SA-ET MD), Baja California Sur State, Mexico, 200 years of intermittent mining activities have left around 800,000 tons of mine waste scattered across 400 km² of the SA-ET area. Some environmental studies in the area assume mining wastes as the main source of contamination of groundwater (not considering the geothermal source). Moreover, recent studies have shown that the pollution in the region has occurred as consequence of seasonal erosion caused by winds and irregular episodes of heavy rainfall. Nevertheless, the actual potential to release As and other potentially toxic elements as well as the hazardousness derived from this mine waste and the geochemical-mineralogical mechanism that influence such mobilization has not been assessed yet. Through the detailed physicochemical and mineralogical characterization (X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy), this novel study shows that jarosite and arsenolite are the key mineral phases controlling the potential release and arsenic mobilization and therefore the hazardousness of the mining wastes. What is more, from pH and acid base accounting results, it has been found that 35 % of the analyzed samples maintain basic to near-neutral conditions due to the neutralizing potential of aluminosilicates (feldspar, muscovite, etc.), while in the remaining 65 % of analyzed samples, the mineral composition is not enough to neutralize the generated acidity; hence, those samples present the potential of generating acid mine drainage, and consequently, they are considered hazardous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid mine drainage 3aacidity 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3adrainage 3afeldspar 3agold 3agroundwater contamination 3ajarosite 3amineral content 3amining 3amuscovite 3aneutralization 3apH 3arain 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil 3atoxic substances 3awind 3aLatin America 3aMexico1 aMartín Romero, Francisco1 aGutiérrez-Ruiz, Margarita1 aMagdaleno Rico, Carlos Alberto0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 June, v. 75, no. 11 p.969-969dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5755-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245015500166300001800321520147100339592002801810650000801838650001701846650001401863650002201877650002101899650001101920650002601931650003101957650001501988650001702003650002502020650002402045651001102069700002202080700002402102700002002126700001902146773014402165856007402309852000902383655001202392IND60662012020221119073616.0190904e20110706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066201202DNAL7 a10.1039/c1em10152h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwann, Caroline Berg,10aOrganophosphate and phthalate esters in indoor air: a comparison between multi-storey buildings with high and low prevalence of sick building symptoms  ap. 2001-2009.  aAn extensive study has been conducted on the prevalence of organophosphorous flame retardants/plasticizers and phthalate ester plasticizers in indoor air. The targeted substances were measured in 45 multi-storey apartment buildings in Stockholm, Sweden. The apartment buildings were classified as high or low risk with regard to the reporting of sick building symptoms (SBS) within the project Healthy Sustainable Houses in Stockholm (3H). Air samples were taken from two to four apartments per building (in total 169 apartments) to facilitate comparison within and between buildings. Association with building characteristics has been examined as well as association with specific sources by combining chemical analysis and exploratory uni- and multivariate data analysis. The study contributes to the overall perspective of levels of organophosphate and phthalate ester in indoor air enabling comparison with other studies. The results indicated little or no difference in the concentrations of the target substances between the two risk classifications of the buildings. The differences between the apartments sampled within (intra) buildings were greater than the differences between (inter) buildings. The concentrations measured in air ranged up to 1200 ng m⁻³ for organophosphate esters and up to 11 000 ng m⁻³ for phthalate esters. Results in terms of sources were discerned e.g. PVC flooring is a major source of benzylbutyl phthalate in indoor air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair sampling 3abuildings 3achemical analysis 3aflame retardants 3afloors 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aresidential housing 3aSweden1 aMagnus Åberg, K.1 aSvartengren, Magnus1 aEmenius, Gunnel1 aÖstman, Conny0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2011 July 6, v. 13, no. 7 p.2001-2009dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10152h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009700157520133200254592002801586650005201614650001501666650001501681650001801696650001101714650001701725650001201742700001801754700003601772700002301808700001901831700002001850700002401870700002101894700001801915700002501933700002201958700002501980700002102005700002302026700002702049700002002076773012102096856007402217852000902291655001202300IND60763604420221120201748.0220120e20211221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076360442DNAL7 a10.3390/v140100052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Shilei 10aSARS-CoV-2 Spike Expression at the Surface of Infected Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cells  aDifferent serological assays were rapidly generated to study humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. Due to the intrinsic difficulty of working with SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus, most serological assays use recombinant forms of the Spike glycoprotein or its receptor binding domain (RBD). Cell-based assays expressing different forms of the Spike, as well as pseudoviral assays, are also widely used. To evaluate whether these assays recapitulate findings generated when the Spike is expressed in its physiological context (at the surface of the infected primary cells), we developed an intracellular staining against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) to distinguish infected from uninfected cells. Human airway epithelial cells (pAECs) were infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 D614G or Alpha variants. We observed robust cell-surface expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike at the surface of the infected pAECs using the conformational-independent anti-S2 CV3-25 antibody. The infected cells were also readily recognized by plasma from convalescent and vaccinated individuals and correlated with several serological assays. This suggests that the antigenicity of the Spike present at the surface of the infected primary cells is maintained in serological assays involving expression of the native full-length Spike.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantibodies 3aepithelium 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3anucleocapsid 3aviruses1 aAdam, Damien 1 aBeaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume 1 aTauzin, Alexandra 1 aGong, Shang Yu1 aGasser, Romain 1 aLaumaea, Annemarie 1 aAnand, Sai Priya1 aPrivé, Anik 1 aBourassa, Catherine 1 aMedjahed, Halima 1 aPrévost, Jérémie 1 aCharest, Hugues 1 aRichard, Jonathan 1 aBrochiero, Emmanuelle 1 aFinzi, Andrés 0 tViruses.g2021 Dec. 21, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140100053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002000158245007100178300001600249520128500265592002801550650002401578650002801602650003201630650002601662650003001688650002201718650001801740650001501758650002201773650002701795650001901822650003001841650003101871650002701902650002901929650003301958650002501991650004402016650002902060650002502089650002502114650002402139650002202163700002202185700002002207700002002227700002002247773010102267856007302368852000902441655001202450IND50074154920221118001753.0150206e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007415492DNAL7 a242832122pmid7 a10.1111/pbi.121402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiou, Ming‐Ru12aA dual gene‐silencing vector system for monocot and dicot plants  ap. 330-343.  aPlant virus‐based gene‐silencing vectors have been extensively and successfully used to elucidate functional genomics in plants. However, only limited virus‐induced gene‐silencing (VIGS) vectors can be used in both monocot and dicot plants. Here, we established a dual gene‐silencing vector system based on Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) and its satellite RNA (satBaMV). Both BaMV and satBaMV vectors could effectively silence endogenous genes in Nicotiana benthamiana and Brachypodium distachyon. The satBaMV vector could also silence the green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene in GFP transgenic N. benthamiana. GFP transgenic plants co‐agro‐inoculated with BaMV and satBaMV vectors carrying sulphur and GFP genes, respectively, could simultaneously silence both genes. Moreover, the silenced plants could still survive with the silencing of genes essential for plant development such as heat‐shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and Hsp70. In addition, the satBaMV‐ but not BaMV‐based vector could enhance gene‐silencing efficiency in newly emerging leaves of N. benthamiana deficient in RNA‐dependant RNA polymerase 6. The dual gene‐silencing vector system of BaMV and satBaMV provides a novel tool for comparative functional studies in monocot and dicot plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBamboo mosaic virus 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aplant development 3asatellite RNA 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 2aBrachypodiumxgenetics 2aGene Silencing 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aPlant Leavesxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPotexvirusxgenetics 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexgenetics. 2aRNA, Satellitexgenetics 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSeedlingsxgenetics. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTobaccoxgenetics1 aHuang, Ying‐Wen1 aHu, Chung‐Chi1 aLin, Na‐Sheng1 aHsu, Yau‐Heiu0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2014 Apr., v. 12, no. 3 p.330-343dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.121403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03839naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011200170520225500282592002802537650002602565650001002591650001902601650001302620650001302633650002202646650001302668650001502681650001502696650001502711650001202726650001002738650002302748650001402771650001102785650001802796650001002814650001102824651001202835651002902847653001802876653001702894653002202911653002602933653002602959653002902985700002303014700001803037700002003055773011603075856008503191852000903276655001203285IND60679093620221120163314.0200305e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067909362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1178182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaroni, Daniele10aTree cavity abundance and beyond: Nesting and food storing sites of the pygmy owl in managed boreal forests  aNatural cavities are a critical resource for non-excavating hole-nesting birds, many of which are declining in northern Europe. In the heavily managed boreal forests in Finland, cavities may be a scarce resource, but their availability to different hole-nesters has been examined in only a few studies. We studied the abundance of suitable cavities in two managed forest landscapes 300 km apart for a forest-dwelling predator, the Eurasian Pygmy Owl Glaucidium passerinum, which requires tree cavities for both nesting and food hoarding. We further examined the preferences of the owls for different cavity characteristics in two experiments and several years of monitoring data with nest boxes resembling natural cavities. We found that natural cavities were scarce in the landscape (6.5/km²). However, natural cavity abundance per se does not seem to limit the breeding density of this predator, as suggested by a low occupancy rate in natural cavities and nest boxes. Owls cleaned the cavities that were filled with nest material of other birds, which provides a greater number of possible cavities to choose from. Cavities whose characteristics prevent the nest from being reached by predators were clearly preferred, as the owls select cavities with more than 5 cm width of the front wall and 15–30 cm of entrance-bottom distance within the cavity. The entrance hole orientation or the height of the cavity from the ground did not affect cavity occupancy by pygmy owls for nesting. In addition, none of the characteristics of the cavities that we surveyed affected their use for food hoarding. While the number of cavities per se may not limit the nesting of the owls, they may be limited by suitable habitat with abundant food supply around available cavities, or by lack of cavities in suitable habitats. They also need more cavities in the winter than in the summer, as each individual needs one to six cavities for hoarding food to survive over winter. Effective conservation strategies for this forest specialist should therefore include the maintenance of high-quality habitat that contains suitable cavities, supporting the need for protection of mature and old-growth forests as a whole, and not just of cavity bearing trees alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlaucidium passerinum 3abirds 3aboreal forests 3abreeding 3acleaning 3afood availability 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anest boxes 3anesting 3anests 3aold-growth forests 3apredators 3asummer 3atree cavities 3atrees 3awinter 3aFinland 3aNorthern European region 0aBoreal forest 0aConservation 0aForest management 0aTree cavity occupancy 0aPopulation limitation 0aSecondary cavity nesting1 aKorpimäki, Erkki,1 aSelonen, Vesa1 aLaaksonen, Toni0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 460 p.117818-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1178183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245019100169300001600360520094500376592002801321650001801349650003101367650001101398650001501409700001401424700001401438700001601452700001701468773011401485856008501599852000901684655001201693IND60087249520221118110925.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008724952DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60486-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hongtao10aStepwise superposition approximation approach for analytical solutions with non-zero initial concentration using existing solutions of zero initial concentration in contaminate transport  ap. 923-930.  aAnalytical solutions for contaminant transport are widely used for both theoretical and practical purposes. However, many existing solutions are obtained subject to an initial condition of zero concentration, which is often unrealistic in many practical cases. This article proposed a stepwise superposition approximation approach to solve the non-zero initial concentration problem for first-type and third-type boundary conditions by using the existing zero initial concentration solution. Theoretical examples showed that the approach was highly efficient if a proper superposition scheme with relative concentration increments was constructed. The key parameter that controlled the convergence speed was the time increment (Δt) multiplied by the rate constant (λ). The approach served also as an alternative way to make a convenient concentration calculation even if the non-zero initial concentration solution of a problem was known.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3amathematics and statistics 3amodels 3apollutants1 aHan, Rong1 aZhao, Yan1 aLu, Wenjing1 aZhang, Yaxin0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2011 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.923-930dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60486-X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010300159300002000262520091500282592002801197650002201225650001401247650001201261650002101273650002301294650001801317650001101335650001801346650001601364650003701380700001801417700001301435700001801448700001701466700002301483700001801506700001801524700002001542700002001562773010101582856007501683852000901758655001201767IND60576686420221119201713.0170806e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057668642DNAL7 a10.1021/la303545y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Changchang10aControlling the Particle Size of ZrO2 Nanoparticles in Hydrothermally Stable ZrO2/MWCNT Composites  ap. 17159-17167.  aThe composite of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorated with ZrO₂ nanoparticles, synthesized by a grafting method followed by high-temperature annealing, was studied.

The efficacy experiment showed that the treatments with tank‐mixed adjuvants were approximately twofold more effective than with cyhalofop‐butyl alone at 2% (v/v) (silwet 625 at 0.05%). The surface tension decreased and the droplets could spread automatically on the leaves after adding the adjuvants. The spreading speed increased significantly with the adjuvants. The epidermal cells and wax layer were damaged by the adjuvants. The absorption of cyhalofop‐butyl was increased significantly after adding the tank‐mixed adjuvants. GY‐T12 and silwet 625 were conducive to upward translocation and all six tank‐mixed adjuvants promoted the downward translocation of the herbicide. The results demonstrate that adjuvants can have a considerable influence on the efficiency of cyhalofop‐butyl on barnyardgrass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aabsorption 3aadjuvants 3adroplets 3aherbicides 3aleaves 3aphysicochemical properties 3asurface tension1 aChen, Weitao1 aXu, Yong1 aWu, Xuemin0 tWeed biology and management.g2016 June, v. 16, no. 2 p.80-89dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1444-61627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wbm.120953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009800166300001600264520183300280592002802113650003302141650002402174650001102198650002802209650001302237650002002250650003702270650001202307650001202319650001402331650001602345650002202361700002302383700002302406700003002429700002402459700002002483700001802503700002502521700002002546773008202566856008102648852000902729655001202738IND4400907620221116174339.0151024e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440090762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-007-0179-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidolfi, Barbara10aTat protein vaccination of cynomolgus macaques influences SHIV-89.6Pcy243 epitope variability  ap. 105-115.  aIn a previous study we showed that vaccination with the native Tat protein controlled virus replication in five out of seven monkeys against challenge with the simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-89.6Pcy₂₄₃ and that this protection correlated with T helper (Th)-1 response and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. To address the evolution of the SHIV-89.6Pcy₂₄₃ both in control and vaccinated infected monkeys, the sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Tat protein and the C2-V3 Env region of the proviral-DNA-derived clones were analyzed in both control and vaccinated but unprotected animals. We also performed analysis of the T cell epitope using a predictive epitope model taking into consideration the phylogeny of the variants. Our results suggest that even though the viral evolution observed in both groups of monkeys was directed toward variations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I epitopes, in the control animals it was associated with mutational escape of such epitopes. On the contrary, it is possible that viral evolution in the vaccinated monkeys was linked to mutations that arose to keep high the viral fitness. In the vaccinated animals the reduction of epitope variability, obtained prompting the immune system by vaccination and inducing a specific immunological response against virus, was able to reduce the emergence of escape mutants. Thus the intervention of host’s selective forces in driving CTL escape mutants and in modulating viral fitness appeared to be different in the two groups of monkeys. We concluded that in the vaccinated unprotected animals, vaccination with the Tat protein induced a broad antiviral response, as demonstrated by the reduced ability to develop escape mutants, which is known to help in the control of viral replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aclones 3acytotoxic T-lymphocytes 3aepitopes 3aimmune response 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amonkeys 3amutants 3aphylogeny 3avaccination 3avirus replication1 aGenovese, Domenico1 aArgentini, Claudio1 aMaggiorella, Maria Teresa1 aSernicola, Leonardo1 aButtò, Stefano1 aTitti, Fausto1 aBorsetti, Alessandra1 aEnsoli, Barbara0 tVirus genes.g2008 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.105-115dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-007-0179-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012800167520162800295592002801923650001301951650001201964650001901976650002201995650001402017650002202031650001902053650001402072650001602086650002202102650001102124650001602135650002102151650001102172650001702183651001002200653001302210653003102223653001902254653001402273653002302287700001802310700001602328700001302344700001702357700001402374700001802388700001702406700002202423700001502445773011602460856008502576852000902661655001202670IND60679093720221120142853.0200128e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067909372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1177662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Zhuqiu10aEffects of winter chilling and photoperiod on leaf-out and flowering in a subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest in China  aAccurate forecasting of spring plant phenology is critical for understanding structural and functional changes in plant communities and their ecosystems in light of global warming. To date, the relative importance of winter chilling and photoperiod for leaf-out and flowering phenology remains unknown in subtropical and tropical forests. Here, we established a climate chamber experiment to test the effects of photoperiod and chilling on the timing of leaf-out and flowering for 37 subtropical woody species using dormant twigs. We found that most cuttings reached leaf-out, but only a few cuttings reached flowering. Longer chilling (including both moderate and strong chilling treatments) may improve leaf-out success and advance leaf-out timing, but it showed little effect on flowering. Moderate chilling was enough for the initiation of leaf-out. Photoperiod showed little effect on both leaf-out and flowering. To our knowledge, our study is the first to explore how different winter chilling conditions may lead to tree phenology progressing in various subtropical species in a new order and to show that leaf-out order is largely unpredictable when chilling requirements are not met. Our experiment indicates that dormant twigs of subtropical woody species can be successfully applied to leaf-out rather than flowering. Our results suggest that lack of chilling not only led to a considerable delay in leaf-out for subtropical species, but it also caused substantial changes in the order of species leaf-out. Thus, warmer winter temperatures might impact subtropical forest ecosystems more than formerly believed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3aclimate 3acold treatment 3adeciduous forests 3aflowering 3aforest ecosystems 3aglobal warming 3aphenology 3aphotoperiod 3aplant communities 3aspring 3atemperature 3atropical forests 3awinter 3awoody plants 3aChina 0aChilling 0aClimate chamber experiment 0aClimate change 0aDaylength 0aSubtropical forest1 aSong, Xiqiang1 aPan, Yuanqi1 aDai, Kui1 aShou, Jiajun1 aChen, Qin1 aHuang, Jiaxin1 aTang, Xinran1 aHuang, Zhongliang1 aDu, Yanjun0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 458 p.117766-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.1177663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024003700111024002300148024003400171024004100205024001200246040001800258100002200276245009100298300001800389506017300407506007600580506003100656520118300687596008801870596004501958506003702003650001302040650001702053650001202070650001102082650002102093650000702114650001602121650001502137650001402152700001802166700002202184700002002206700002402226700002702250700002102277773016202298856011402460856008102574956012602655961001702781852000902798655001202807IND60523177420221207132409.0160606e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052317742DNAL7 a3254912aris7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b003312chorus7 a10113/52317742hdl7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b003312doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b003312chorusOpen8 ans15777  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liangliang10aPolyphenol–Aluminum Complex Formation: Implications for Aluminum Tolerance in Plants  ap. 3025-3033.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aNatural polyphenols may play an important role in aluminum detoxification in some plants. We examined the interaction between Al3+ and the purified high molecular weight polyphenols pentagalloyl glucose (940 Da) and oenothein B (1568 Da), and the related compound methyl gallate (184 Da) at pH 4 and 6. We used spectrophotometric titration and chemometric modeling to determine stability constants and stoichiometries for the aluminum–phenol (AlL) complexes. The structures and spectral features of aluminum–methyl gallate complexes were evaluated with quantum chemical calculations. The high molecular weight polyphenols formed Al3L2 complexes with conditional stability constants (β) ∼ 1 × 10(23) at pH 6 and AlL complexes with β ∼ 1 × 10(5) at pH 4. Methyl gallate formed AlL complexes with β = 1 × 10(6) at pH 6 but did not complex aluminum at pH 4. At intermediate metal-to-polyphenol ratios, high molecular weight polyphenols formed insoluble Al complexes but methyl gallate complexes were soluble. The high molecular weight polyphenols have high affinities and solubility features that are favorable for a role in aluminum detoxification in the environment.  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaluminum 3achemometrics 3aglucose 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyphenols 3asolubility 3atitration1 aLiu, Ruiqiang1 aGung, Benjamin W.1 aTindall, Steven1 aGonzalez, Javier M.1 aHalvorson, Jonathan J.1 aHagerman, Ann E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 64, no. 15 p.3025-3033dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/52317743Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b003313Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/325491%20Gonzalez%20J%20of%20Agric%20and%20Food.pdf  aUSDAUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012700155300001800282520119600300592002801496650001101524650001101535650001301546650003401559650002501593650001901618650001501637650001101652700001801663700001301681700001301694700001501707700001101722700001701733700001901750773014101769856007401910852000901984655001201993IND60631275120221122223815.0190220e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063127512DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta00141g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jing10aUltrasmall-sized SnS nanosheets vertically aligned on carbon microtubes for sodium-ion capacitors with high energy density  ap. 4047-4054.  aSodium ion hybrid capacitors (SHCs) using battery-type and capacitor-type electrodes are designed to obtain both high energy and power densities. However, anode materials commonly cannot meet the high capacity and rapid charging/discharging stability requirements. With the help of sandwiched design, herein novel porous carbon microtubes are sandwiched by vertical ultrasmall-sized SnS nanosheets (SnS/aCMT) via combined solvothermal and thermal-treatment approaches. The three-dimensional interconnected SnS nanosheet network grown on both sides of the hollow carbon microtubes could greatly prevent their aggregation and facilitate ion transport, which endows the anode material with improved specific capacity and structural stability. As a result, the SnS/aCMT electrode presents high capacity (517 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹) and remarkable rate capability (306 mA h g⁻¹ even at 5 A g⁻¹) as well as long-term cycling stability with 88.7% retention over 500 cycles. Furthermore, a SHC, assembled by using SnS/aCMT as the anode and aCMT as the cathode, presents a high energy density of 115 W h kg⁻¹ in the voltage range of 0.5–4.0 V and stable long-term cycling performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrical equipment 3aenergy density 3ananosheets 3asodium1 aWang, Guiling1 aHu, Rong1 aZhu, Kai1 aCheng, Kui1 aYe, Ke1 aCao, Dianxue1 aFan, Zhuangjun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Feb. 19, v. 7, no. 8 p.4047-4054dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00141g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013400164300001400298520161500312592002801927650001001955650001901965650001901984650001102003650002302014650001402037650002802051653001902079653001102098653001802109653001702127653001802144700001502162700002002177773010002197856008302297852000902380655001202389IND60598107020221122215153.0190411e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059810702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrefz, F.M.10aEvaluation of a portable ion-selective electrode meter for measuring potassium concentrations in whole blood and plasma of calves  ap. 10-14.  aAn ion-selective electrode (ISE) handheld meter (LAQUAtwin B-731; Horiba) has recently become available for the measurement of potassium concentrations [K+] in biological fluids. The ISE meter has the potential to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of potassium balance disorders of critically ill cattle. The objective of this study was to characterise the analytical performance of the ISE meter in a study sample of hospitalised calves with a broad range of plasma [K+]. For the purpose of the study, whole blood and plasma samples from 125 calves (age≤3months) were used for analysis. The accuracy of the meter against the reference method (indirect ISE, Cobas c 311, Roche) was assessed using Passing–Bablok regression and Bland–Altman plots.The [K+] in whole blood as measured by the ISE meter in direct mode ranged from 2.4 to 9.9mmol/L. The meter measured whole blood [K+] as 3.8% higher than plasma [K+]. Passing–Bablok regression for whole blood [K+] measured by the meter against plasma [K+] determined by indirect potentiometry revealed a linear relationship that was almost identical to the line of identity. However, the Bland–Altman plot indicated that the meter measured plasma [K+] 5.1% lower than the reference method. This result was consistent with analytical differences of direct and indirect ISE methods in respect to variation in the plasma protein concentration. In conclusion, the LAQUAtwin B-731 meter provides an accurate, rapid and low-cost tool for the diagnosis of potassium derangements in critically ill calves, particularly when whole blood samples are analysed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood proteins 3ablood sampling 3acalves 3ameters (equipment) 3apotassium 3aspecific ion electrodes 0aCalf-side test 0aCalves 0aHyperkalaemia 0aHypokalaemia 0aPoint-of-care1 aLorenz, I.1 aConstable, P.D.0 tveterinary journal.g2018 Aug., v. 238 p.10-14dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009300166300001800259520108000277592002801357650001501385650002401400650001901424650001401443650001901457650001901476650001701495650001601512650002101528700002001549700001701569700002101586700001901607773012701626856008201753852000901835655001201844IND60567753220221116210240.0170425e20170323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056775322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b110052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Cheng-Yen10aSynthesis of a SnO2/TNT Heterojunction Nanocomposite as a High-Performance Photocatalyst  ap. 6050-6059.  aIn this study, high-performance SnO₂/TiO₂ nanotube (TNT) nanocomposites were prepared through a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The samples retained a high BET surface area because they were calcination-free. The BET surface area of all of the samples was over 300 m²/g, and the length was within 100–200 nm. During the hydrothermal reaction, a heterojunction between the SnO₂ and TNTs through oriented attachment was achieved. Additionally, we demonstrate that the introduction of cassiterite SnO₂ as a precursor in the hydrothermal process can induce the growth of anatase TiO₂. A SnO₂/TNT nanocomposite photocatalyst not only facilitated dye adsorption at a high concentration around the surface of the nanocomposites but also exhibited efficient charge separation properties and achieved outstanding photocatalytic performance. This study proposes a simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly synthetic strategy for fabrication of TNT-based heterostructures as high-performance photocatalysts through adding precursors in the proper amounts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ahot water treatment 3ananocomposites 3ananotubes 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asurface area 3atin dioxide 3atitanium dioxide1 aLiu, Chen-Wuing1 aFan, Chihhao1 aHsi, Hsing-Cheng1 aZhang, Dingyu,0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Mar. 23, v. 121, no. 11 p.6050-6059dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b110053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245011200204300001600316520164900332592002801981650001602009650001002025650002002035650002402055650001402079650001802093650001202111650001102123650001202134650001202146650001902158650001102177650001402188650002002202650001402222700006402236700002502300700001902325700002002344700001802364700001502382700002202397700007002419700006202489700002002551700002602571700001902597700002102616773013502637856008302772852000902855655001202864IND60763774220221121215641.0220123e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076377422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-021-02666-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoss, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8469-820410aShort-term fasting in glioma patients: analysis of diet diaries and metabolic parameters of the ERGO2 trial  ap. 477-487.  aPURPOSE: The prospective, randomized ERGO2 trial investigated the effect of calorie-restricted ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting (KD-IF) on re-irradiation for recurrent brain tumors. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival in comparison to standard diet (SD). We here report the results of the quality of life/neurocognition and a detailed analysis of the diet diaries. METHODS: 50 patients were randomized 1:1 to re-irradiation combined with either SD or KD-IF. The KD-IF schedule included 3 days of ketogenic diet (KD: 21–23 kcal/kg/d, carbohydrate intake limited to 50 g/d), followed by 3 days of fasting and again 3 days of KD. Follow-up included examination of cognition, quality of life and serum samples. RESULTS: The 20 patients who completed KD-IF met the prespecified goals for calorie and carbohydrate restriction. Substantial decreases in leptin and insulin and an increase in uric acid were observed. The SD group, of note, had a lower calorie intake than expected (21 kcal/kg/d instead of 30 kcal/kg/d). Neither quality of life nor cognition were affected by the diet. Low glucose emerged as a significant prognostic parameter in a best responder analysis. CONCLUSION: The strict caloric goals of the ERGO2 trial were tolerated well by patients with recurrent brain cancer. The short diet schedule led to significant metabolic changes with low glucose emerging as a candidate marker of better prognosis. The unexpected lower calorie intake of the control group complicates the interpretation of the results.

Here, an offset-free zone model predictive control (ZMPC) strategy with artificial variables that automatically adjust its penalty parameters is developed by means of new adaptation rules to reduce both types of episodes. The online adaptive tuning is carried out according to the estimation of the plant–model mismatch, the blood glucose value, and its rate of change, producing an aggressive or conservative action depending on the actual situation. In addition, the MPC formulation considers the input of insulin as an impulse instead of a discrete one. The developed method is evaluated in 30 virtual patients of the UVA/Padova simulator and it is compared with an offset-free ZMPC without the adaptation rule. A significant reduction of hypoglycemia episodes is obtained and, for adults, adolescents, and children, a time in normoglycemia range of 87.0%, 67.9%, and 66.1%, respectively, is achieved in a simulation scenario without meal announcement, 30% of parameter variations (simultaneously in several parameters), and sensor noise. The proposed method shows the potential of using information about the estimated mismatch for the MPC tuning rules to compensate the physiological variations. This without requiring complex modifications of the MPC formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3achemistry 3achildren 3ahealth status 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3amathematical models 3aoverdose 3apatients 3aprocess design1 aRivadeneira, Pablo S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8392-45560 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Feb. 24, v. 59, no. 13 p.5865-5876dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b059793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245008500209300001600294500001100310506007600321520112800397592002801525506003701553650000801590650001401598650002001612650002101632650002301653700002501676700002001701700001701721773011801738856008101856852000901937655001201946IND60575409820221207074951.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057540982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-017-1288-22doi7 aPMC54298812pmcid7 a281500402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaleki, Parastoo12aA practical guide to studying G-quadruplex structures using single-molecule FRET  ap. 483-498.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this article, we summarize the knowledge and best practices learned from bulk and single-molecule measurements to address some of the frequently experienced difficulties in single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements on G-quadruplex (GQ) structures. The number of studies that use smFRET to investigate the structure, function, dynamics, and interactions of GQ structures has grown significantly in the last few years, with new applications already in sight. However, a number of challenges need to be overcome before reliable and reproducible smFRET data can be obtained in measurements that include GQ. The annealing and storage conditions, the location of fluorophores on the DNA construct, and the ionic conditions of the experiment are some of the factors that are of critical importance for the outcome of measurements, and many of these manifest themselves in unique ways in smFRET assays. By reviewing these aspects and providing a summary of best practices, we aim to provide a practical guide that will help in successfully designing and performing smFRET studies on GQ structures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aannealing 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescent dyes 3astorage conditions1 aBudhathoki, Jagat B.1 aRoy, William A.1 aBalci, Hamza0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2017 June, v. 292, no. 3 p.483-498dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-017-1288-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245012200180300001800302520157100320592002801891650002001919650001301939650001801952650001101970650001301981650001201994650001102006650002702017650002302044650002502067650001402092700002502106700002602131700002902157700003102186773010302217856008102320852000902401655001202410IND60547957620221119070630.0160905e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054795762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-016-1736-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayorga-Martínez, Arturo A.10aNon-destructive Assessment of Guava (Psidium guajava L.) Maturity and Firmness Based on Mechanical Vibration Response  ap. 1471-1480.  aStorage potential and eating quality of guava (Psidium guajava L.) fruit depend on its maturity. Segregation of guava according to maturity and firmness measured using non-destructive technologies would help the industry to designate ripe fruit to immediate market and less ripe fruit for distant market (e.g., exportation). This research was conducted to evaluate the potential of experimental resonant frequency (f ₑ) and elasticity index (EI) to estimate fruit firmness, which has been reported to be inversely correlated to its maturity. A maturity index (I ₘ) was calculated as the ratio of total soluble solids/titratable acidity (TSS/TA). It was proved that TSS, TA, and I ₘ were significantly correlated (P < 0.05) to skin firmness (F ₛ), flesh firmness (F f), stiffness (S), and analytical resonant frequency (ω ₙ), being S the attribute best fitted to I ₘ (R ² = 0.77). Since it was observed that f ₑ and EI were sensitive to changes in fruit firmness, both of them were explored as alternatives to predict F ₛ, F f, S, and ω ₙ of guava fruit. In some cases, EI improved the models to predict guava firmness traits (e.g., F ₛ vs f ₑ had a coefficient of determination of R ² = 0.58, whereas for F ₛ vs EI, it was R ² = 0.62). The best model occurred when plotting ω ₙ vs f ₑ (R ² = 0.86), followed by S vs EI (R ² = 0.84), making these promising features for the development of a new practical application using frequency response measurement as a non-destructive method to assess guava maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsidium guajava 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3aguavas 3aindustry 3amarkets 3amodels 3anondestructive methods 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3avibration1 aOlvera-Trejo, Daniel1 aElías-Zúñiga, Alex1 aParra Saldivar, Roberto,1 aChuck-Hernández, Cristina0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2016 Sept., v. 9, no. 9 p.1471-1480dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-016-1736-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010900162300001600271520180900287592002802096650002402124650001902148650002702167650001102194650001002205650001302215650001202228650001802240650001002258650001802268650000902286651001102295700002002306700002702326773011802353856007302471852000902544655001202553IND60080507920221120040940.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008050792DNAL7 a10.1111/afe.120572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiegert, Nathan W.10aSubmersion as a tactic to prevent emergence of emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis from black ash logs  ap. 321-325.  aBlack ash (Fraxinus nigra Marshall) trees are an important cultural resource and provide the wood used for traditional contemporary basketry by numerous Native American and First Nation tribes in the U.S.A. and Canada. The invasion and subsequent spread of emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) threatens the ash resource in North America and the basketry tradition. Submersion of infested ash logs has been proposed as a potential tactic to control A. planipennis emergence, although the duration of submergence required to prevent adult beetle emergence is unknown. We assessed the survivorship of A. planipennis prepupae through adult beetle emergence in green ash (F. pennsylvanica Marshall) bolts submerged at weekly intervals for up to 6 weeks and in black ash bolts submerged at 4‐week intervals for up to 24 weeks. The moisture content of sapwood at depths where prepupal chambers are commonly found was quantified in the black ash bolts after 0, 12 and 24 weeks of submergence. Mortality of A. planipennis from prepupa to adult was low (5.7 ± 2.3%) for the first 6 weeks of submersion but rapidly increased to 100% in green ash and black ash bolts submerged for 8 weeks or longer. In black ash, the outer 1.3 cm of wood became highly saturated after submersion for 12 weeks (81.0 ± 4.5%) and moisture increased only slightly after 24 weeks (83.9 ± 2.8%). The results obtained in the present study indicate that A. planipennis prepupae in green ash and black ash bolts can survive complete submersion for extended periods of time (i.e. at least 6 weeks) and successfully emerge as adults afterwards. Logs submerged for at least 8 weeks, however, produced no live A. planipennis beetles, indicating that submersion represents an efficacious control option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aFraxinus nigra 3aFraxinus pennsylvanica 3aadults 3abolts 3aprepupae 3asapwood 3asurvival rate 3atrees 3awater content 3awood 3aCanada1 aSecord, Theresa1 aMcCullough, Deborah G.0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2014 Aug., v. 16, no. 3 p.321-325dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-95557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.120573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01831naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008800171300001800259520087000277592002801147650001501175650002101190650002401211650001601235650001001251700002101261700001801282700001701300773011001317856008101427852000901508655001201517IND60547879120221120065340.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054787912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-016-1407-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzizipour, Mohammad10aOptimal Operation of Hydropower Reservoir Systems Using Weed Optimization Algorithm  ap. 3995-4009.  aThe optimal hydropower operation of reservoir systems is known as a complex nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem. This paper presents the application of invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm, which is a novel evolutionary algorithm inspired from colonizing weeds, for optimal operation of hydropower reservoir systems. The IWO algorithm is used to optimally solve the hydropower operation problems for both cases of single reservoir and multi reservoir systems, over short, medium and long term operation periods, and the results are compared with the existing results obtained by the two most commonly used evolutionary algorithms, namely, particle swam optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that the IWO is more efficient and effective than PSO and GA for both single reservoir and multi reservoir hydropower operation problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ainvasive species 3asystem optimization 3awater power 3aweeds1 aGhalenoei, Vahid1 aAfshar, M.

By contrast to other frugivorous Drosophila species, D. suzukii lays eggs on ripening fruits, heavily reducing fruit production. Although cultivated host plants of D. suzukii are well documented, very little is known about wild hosts in the invaded areas. The American black cherry Prunus serotina Ehrh., a tree species native to North America, became one of the main woody forest invaders in Europe. One cause of its invasion success is the huge amount of fruit produced by P. serotina trees. A field survey showed that P. serotina is a suitable reservoir for the development and persistence of D. suzukii populations in European natural systems (on the forest area investigated, up to 70% of all the fruits of P. serotina were infested in one of the sampling sites). Laboratory tests demonstrated that D. suzukii prefers ripening cherries to ripe ones, therefore increasing the chance of the larvae to fully develop and reach maturity before the mesocarp of the fruit totally decays. Infestation of P. serotina cherries could reduce the life span of fruits, as well as their attractiveness to seed consumers and dispersers, yet P. serotina could represent a suitable plant reservoir promoting D. suzukii invasion in Europe and North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aDrosophila suzukii 3aPrunus serotina 3acherries 3acolonizing ability 3aeggs 3aforests 3afrugivores 3afruit growing 3ahost plants 3aindigenous species 3alaboratory techniques 3alarvae 3alongevity 3amesocarp 3apests 3aripening 3asurveys 3atrees 3avinegars 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aEslin, Patrice1 aHéraude, Marie1 aLe Roux, Vincent1 aPrévost, Geneviève,1 aGibert, Patricia1 aChabrerie, Olivier0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2014 Aug., v. 16, no. 3 p.251-259dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-95557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.120523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01309naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010800157300001300265500001900278520019000297592002800487650001900515650001400534650001400548650001700562700001700579700001400596700002000610700001900630700001400649700001500663700001400678700001900692773014100711856007400852852000900926655001200935IND60740703420221122201352.0210604e20210603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074070342DNAL7 a10.1039/d1tb90082j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Weicong10aCorrection: Recent advances in cell membrane coated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for tumor therapy  ap. 4411.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCorrection for ‘Recent advances in cell membrane coated metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for tumor therapy’ by Weicong Liu et al., J.

Vaccines can control MD but cannot block the viral infection; they are considered imperfect vaccines, which carry the risk of recombination. In this study, six natural recombinant MDV strains were isolated from infected chickens in commercial flocks in China. We sequenced and analysed the genetic characteristics of the isolates (HC/0803, CH/10, SY/1219, DH/1307, DH/1504 and Hrb/1504). We found that the six strains resulted from recombination between the vaccine CVI988/Rispens (CVI988) strain skeleton and the virulence strain's partial unique short region. Additionally, a pathogenicity study was performed on recombinant strains (HC/0803 and DH/1307) and reference strains (CVI988 and LHC2) to evaluate their virulence. LHC2 induced 84.6% mortality in infected chickens; however, no mortality was recorded in chickens inoculated with HC/0803, DH/1307 or CVI988. However, HC/0803 and DH/1307 induced a notable spleen enlargement, and mild thymus and bursa atrophy at 11–17 days post‐challenge (dpc). The viral genome load in the HC/0803‐ and DH/1307‐challenged chickens peaked at approximately 10⁷ viral copies per million host cells at 17 dpc and was similar to that in LHC2‐challenged chickens, but significantly higher than that of CVI988‐challenged chickens. In summary, HC/0803 and DH/1307 displayed mild virulence with temporal damage to the immune organs of chicken and a higher reproduction capability than the vaccine strain CVI988. Our study provides direct evidence of the emergence of recombinant MDV strains between vaccine and virulence strains in nature. The emergence of natural recombinant strains suggests that live vaccines can act as genetic donors for genomic recombination, and recombination may be a safety concern when administering live vaccines. These findings demonstrate that recombination promotes genetic diversity and increases the complexity of disease diagnosis, prevention and control.  aPublisher supplied data  a32170170cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU21A20260cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU20A2061cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCARS‐41‐G15cChina Agriculture Research System 3aMardivirus 3aMarek disease 3aatrophy 3achickens 3adisease diagnosis 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3alight harvesting complex 3amortality 3aoncogenic viruses 3areproduction 3arisk 3askeleton 3aspleen 3avaccines 3aviral genome 3avirulence 3aChina1 aLan, Xingge1 aWang, Yanan1 aLin, Yumeng1 aYu, Zhenghao1 aGuo, Rongrong1 aLi, Kai1 aCui, Hongyu1 aQi, Xiaole1 aWang, Yongqiang1 aGao, Li1 aPan, Qing1 aLiu, Aijing1 aGao, Yulong1 aWang, Xiaomei1 aLiu, Changjun0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 Sept., v. 69, no. 5 p.e1702-e1709dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.145063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245008500161300001800246520123300264592002801497650000801525650001901533650001301552650001601565650001101581650001701592650003101609650002501640650000701665650001901672650001401691650001801705650000901723650001201732651001001744700001701754700001601771700001801787700002201805700002201827700001701849773017801866856007802044852000902122655001202131IND60118168320221116154320.0141126e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011816832DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.047258-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhta, Yukari10aMicrobacterium saccharophilum sp. nov., isolated from a sucrose-refining factory  ap. 2765-2769.  aA Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain K-1T, was isolated from soil at a sucrose refinery in Japan. The strain grew at 9–37 °C (optimum, 30 °C) and at pH 6–11 (optimum, pH 7.0). Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain K-1T revealed that it was a member of the genus Microbacterium. High 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities were found between strains K-1T and both Microbacterium pumilum NBRC 101279T (99.7 %) and Microbacterium deminutum NRRL B-24453T (99.5 %). However, the DNA–DNA hybridization values between strain K-1T and M. pumilum NBRC 101279T and M. deminutum NRRL B-24453T were only 12 % and 10 %, respectively. The DNA G+C content of strain K-1T was 73 mol%. The major fatty acids of strain K-1T were anteiso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0, and the major menaquinones were MK-12 and MK-13. The diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan was lysine. On the basis of these results, strain K-1T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Microbacterium, for which the name Microbacterium saccharophilum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is K-1T ( = NBRC 108778T = NCIMB 14782T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMicrobacterium 3abacteria 3afatty acids 3alysine 3amenaquinones 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3apeptidoglycans 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3asucrose 3aJapan1 aIto, Tetsuya1 aMori, Kozue1 aNishi, Shinro1 aShimane, Yasuhiro1 aMikuni, Katsuhiko1 aHatada, Yuji0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2013 Aug., v. 63, no.

Moreover, in these studies the cheliceral morphology of phytoseiids was not associated with their ability to feed on plants. In the present study, we monitored the plant-feeding behavior of Euseius scutalis and Amblyseius swirskii. Only E. scutalis was observed penetrating the leaf surface with the movable digit and feeding. Second, using a dye and coloring the gut as an indicator for feeding, we found that E. scutalis pierced an artificial membrane and fed whereas A. swirskii did not. Finally, to identify morphological characteristics typical of plant feeders versus non-plant feeders, we used scanning electron microscopy to examine the adaxial (inner) profile of the chelicerae in 13 phytoseiid species. The only parameter that distinguished between plant- and non-plant feeders was the ratio of the dorsal perimeter length of the fixed digit to the ventral perimeter length of the movable digit. Plant-feeders were characterized by ratio values greater than one whereas the values for non plant-feeders were lower than one. We suggest that a shorter and less curved movable digit, expressed by a high ratio, will facilitate the penetration of the leaf surface. Cheliceral traits proposed here as typical of plant feeders, were observed for five genera, indicating that plant-feeding may be more common in the Phytoseiidae than previously reported. We propose that the ability to feed on plants be added as a cross type trait of phytoseiid life-style types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyseius swirskii 3aEuseius 3adigestive system 3adyes 3afeeding behavior 3aleaves 3ascanning electron microscopy 2aAcarixphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behavior 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPlants 2aSpecies Specificity1 aInbar, Moshe1 aGal, Shira1 aDoron, Noam1 aZhang, Zhi-Qiang1 aPalevsky, Eric0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2012 Dec., v. 58, no. 4 p.341-357dSpringer-Verlagx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-012-9589-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245018900213300001800402506007600420520171500496592002802211506003702239650002602276650001802302650001102320650002802331650002002359650002002379650002402399650000902423650001502432650001602447650002702463650002802490650001702518650002002535650002102555650001902576650001902595650001802614650001802632650001802650650001602668650000902684700002402693700001502717700002102732700001902753700001602772700002102788700001702809773011702826856008102943852000903024655001203033IND60517805520221207135707.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051780552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-015-0928-82doi7 aPMC48199482pmcid7 a260031852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerheijden, K.

This study investigated the effects of different mixtures of non-digestible oligosaccharides combined with Bifidobacterium breve M-16V (BB) on the development of allergic airway inflammation in an animal model for house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic asthma. METHODS: BALB/c mice were sensitized intranasally (i.n.) with HDM and subsequently challenged (i.n.) with PBS or HDM while being fed diets containing different oligosaccharide mixtures in combination with BB or an isocaloric identical control diet. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) inflammatory cell influx, chemokine and cytokine concentrations in lung homogenates and supernatants of ex vivo HDM-restimulated lung cells were analyzed. RESULTS: The HDM-induced influx of eosinophils and lymphocytes was reduced by the diet containing the short-chain and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides and BB (FFBB). In addition to the HDM-induced cell influx, concentrations of IL-33, CCL17, CCL22, IL-6, IL-13 and IL-5 were increased in supernatants of lung homogenates or BALF and IL-4, IFN-γ and IL-10 were increased in restimulated lung cell suspensions of HDM-allergic mice. The diet containing FFBB reduced IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations, whereas the combination of galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides with BB was less potent in this model. CONCLUSION: These findings show that synbiotic dietary supplementation can affect respiratory allergic inflammation induced by HDM. The combination of FFBB was most effective in the prevention of HDM-induced airway inflammation in mice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium breve 3aanimal models 3aasthma 3acell suspension culture 3achemokine CCL17 3achemokine CCL22 3adietary supplements 3adust 3adust mites 3aeosinophils 3afructooligosaccharides 3agalactooligosaccharides 3ainflammation 3ainsoluble fiber 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-5 3ainterleukin-6 3alymphocytes 3amice1 aWillemsen, L.

Theresa10aImpacts of short-term germination delay on fitness of the annual weed Agrostemma githago (L.)  ap. 93-100.  aTime of seedling emergence is an important step in the life cycle of annual plants because it may determine subsequent performance and success. Timing of emergence is especially critical to plant performance in habitats like arable fields which are subject to frequent disturbances. Within-season variation in timing of germination in the range of only a few days is typical for many arable weeds. However, since it is unclear whether such small deviations in germination date translate into fitness differences in the course of the life cycle, the aim of this paper was to quantify the effects of short germination delays on plant performance. We conducted two generalized randomized block experiments in an unheated greenhouse to study the impact of delayed germination (1, 2, 3 and 7 d) with and without competition, respectively, on the fitness of the arable weed species Agrostemma githago (L.). We expected that delayed germination significantly reduces fitness in terms of several life-history traits, and that the decrease of fitness is higher in the presence of competition. Under realistic conditions with competition through barley, Agrostemma plants with delayed germination of 7 d produced 54% fewer shoots, 57% less biomass, 52% fewer flowers, 36% lighter seeds and were 23% shorter as compared to control plants without delayed germination. Without additional stress through competition with barley this pattern was less pronounced. Thus, in the situation of interspecific competition, early emerging seedlings have biologically significant fitness advantages over later emerging seedlings of the same species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostemma githago 3aannual weeds 3aannuals 3abarley 3abiomass 3aflowers 3agermination 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific competition 3alife history 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 0aarable weeds 0aasynchronous germination 0ainterspecific competition 0alife-history traits1 aDonath, Tobias W.1 aOtte, Annette1 aEckstein, R.

The strain was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of members of the genus Streptomyces. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain KLBMP 1284T revealed that the strain formed a distinct clade within the phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and the highest sequence similarity (99.43 %) was to Streptomyces sulphureus NRRL B-1627T. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to other species of the genus Streptomyces was lower than 97 %. Based on DNA–DNA hybridization values and comparison of morphological and phenotypic data, KLBMP 1284T could be distinguished from the closest phylogenetically related species, Streptomyces sulphureus NRRL B-1627T. Thus, based on these data, it is evident that strain KLBMP 1284T represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces halophytocola sp. nov. is proposed.

In this work, the ACTF as new adsorbent was synthesized based on rice straw, then its structure and properties were taken into consideration to study its ability to adsorb sodium ions from synthetic water. The influence of pH, contact time, and temperature of the ion adsorption on ACTF was also studied using batch tests. We found that the contact time of sodium adsorption and its isothermal adsorption studied were described by pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm, respectively. Our results indicated that the adsorption of sodium ions on ACTF become be stronger and depends on pH, furthermore, the maximum adsorption capacities of sodium on ACTF recorded 107, 120 and 135 mg g⁻¹ at 35, 45, and 65 °C. The thermodynamic parameters explain that the adsorption of sodium ions on ACTF is a spontaneous process and endothermic reaction. According to adsorption studies, we found that the ACTF can be used effectively for ion chromatography or desalinate sodium ion using ion exchange process in the hybrid desalination process with insignificant loss of adsorption capacity. However, the ACTF has better properties than any other carbon materials obtained from an agricultural byproduct.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3adesalination 3aendothermy 3aion exchange 3aion exchange chromatography 3aions 3akinetics 3apH 3arice straw 3asodium 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aMousa, Mahmoud Ahmed1 aMoghny, Th.

Characterization of the synthesized sorbent was done using different instrumental techniques, i.e., SEM, BET and point of zero charge. Sorptive uptake of As(V) over steam activated MBH as a function of pH (3–9), agitation speed (40–200 rpm), dosage (50–1000 mg) and temperature (298–313 K) was studied by batch process at arsenic concentration of 2 mg L⁻¹. Lower pH increases the arsenic removal over the pH range of 3–9. Among three adsorption isotherm models examined, Langmuir model was observed to show superior results over Freundlich model. The mean sorption energy (E) estimated by Dubinin–Radushkevich model suggested that the process of adsorption was chemisorption. Thermodynamic parameters confer that the sorption process was spontaneous, exothermic and feasible in nature. The pseudo-second-order rate kinetics of arsenic gave better correlation coefficients as compared to pseudo-first-order kinetics equation. Three process parameters, viz. adsorbent dosage, agitation speed and pH were opted for optimizing As(V) elimination using central composite design matrix of response surface methodology (RSM). The identical design setup was used for artificial neural network (ANN) for comparing its prediction capability with RSM towards As(V) removal. Maximum arsenic removal was observed to be 98.75% at sorbent dosage 0.75 gm L⁻¹, pH 3.0, agitation speed 160 rpm and temperature 308 K. The study concluded that SAC-MBH could be a competent adsorbent for As(V) removal and ANN model was better in arsenic removal predictability results than RSM model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3aarsenic 3abatch systems 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3aequations 3aheat production 3ahulls 3amung beans 3aneural networks 3apH 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asteam 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aAikat, Kaustav1 aHalder, Gopinath0 tApplied water science.g2017 Dec., v. 7, no. 8 p.4479-4495dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-017-0596-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011200162300001600274520144500290592002801735650002401763650002301787650001401810650001301824650001801837650001901855650001401874650001501888650001401903650001401917650002601931650002601957650001301983650002501996650002402021650001102045650002302056650000802079650001102087700001802098700002302116700002002139700002402159773011802183856007302301852000902374655001202383IND60080508420221120075756.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008050842DNAL7 a10.1111/afe.120552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Geraldine D.10aPhloem phytochemistry and aphid responses to elevated CO₂, nitrogen fertilization and endophyte infection  ap. 273-283.  aRising atmospheric CO₂ has been shown to alter plant nitrogen metabolism, growth and secondary chemistry. We hypothesized that altered aphid performance under elevated CO₂ is linked to phloem nitrogen chemistry. Rhopalosiphum padi performance on endophyte‐infected or uninfected tall fescue was examined under three levels of CO₂ (ambient, 800 and 1000 p.p.m.) and high and low nitrogen fertilization. Ethylenediaminetetracetic acid‐facilitated exudation was used to sample phloem sap, followed by quantification of relative amino acid concentrations using reverse‐phase high‐performance liquid chromatography. Aphid abundance was reduced at 800 p.p.m. relative to ambient CO₂ but returned to baseline at 1000 p.p.m. The density of aphids was reduced in both the elevated CO₂ treatments. Aphids were unsuccessful at colonizing endophyte‐infected plants, possibly as a result of the presence of loline alkaloids. Multivariate analysis showed that certain groups of phloem amino acids were altered by nitrogen fertilization and CO₂. We found that four amino acids (valine, arginine, glutamine and aspartate) were correlated with aphid performance. These findings partially explained the effect of plant nitrogen fertilization and elevated CO₂ on aphids. The present study represents a first step toward providing a mechanistic explanation of the aphid performance changes that may result from rising atmospheric CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3aalkaloids 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3acarbon dioxide 3achemistry 3aendophytes 3aexudation 3aglutamine 3aliquid chromatography 3amultivariate analysis 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen metabolism 3aphloem 3aplant biochemistry 3asap 3avaline1 aShukla, Kruti1 aRasmussen, Susanne1 aShelp, Barry J.1 aNewman, Jonathan A.0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2014 Aug., v. 16, no. 3 p.273-283dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-95557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.120553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245014400205300001800349506007600367520173300443592002802176506003702204650002102241650001402262650001402276650002102290650001902311650002002330650002002350650001802370650002302388650002002411650001702431650001902448650002702467650000902494650001402503650001002517700003602527700002902563773011702592856008102709852000902790655001202799IND60517805820221207135704.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051780582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-015-0930-12doi7 aPMC48199542pmcid7 a260148092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawlik, Anna10aSensitization of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines to 4-hydroxytamoxifen by isothiocyanates present in cruciferous plants  ap. 1165-1180.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE: Tamoxifen has been used for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers and in women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Acquired resistance to this drug and its toxicity still pose a clinically significant problem, especially in the prevention setting. Isothiocyanates present in cruciferous plants, such as sulforaphane or erucin, have been shown to reduce growth of breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we explored their ability to sensitize cancer cells to 4-hydroxytamoxifen. METHODS: We used three ER-positive breast cancer cell lines, T47D, MCF-7 and BT-474, as well as the drug-resistant T47D and MCF-7 derivatives. We examined the effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, isothiocyanates and their combinations on cell viability by MTT and clonogenic assays. Impact of treatments on the levels of proteins engaged in apoptosis and autophagy was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Isothiocyanates act in a synergistic way with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and co-treatment reduces breast cancer cell viability and clonogenic potential more effectively than treatment with any single agent. This is connected with a drop in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the level of survivin as well as increased PARP cleavage, and elevation in ADRP, the mitochondrial stress marker. Moreover, isothiocyanates sensitize 4-hydroxytamoxifen-resistant T47D and MCF-7 cells to the drug. CONCLUSION: Isothiocyanates enhance response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which allows for reduction of the effective drug concentration. Combinatorial strategy may hold promise in development of therapies and chemoprevention strategies against ER-positive breast tumors, even those with acquired resistance to the drug.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abreast neoplasms 3acell viability 3achemoprevention 3adrug resistance 3adrug toxicity 3aestrogen receptors 3aisothiocyanates 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3arisk 3atamoxifen 3awomen1 aSłomińska-Wojewódzka, Monika1 aHerman-Antosiewicz, Anna0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2016 Apr., v. 55, no. 3 p.1165-1180dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-015-0930-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011500162300001600277500001500293520148100308592002801789650002501817650001301842650002401855650002901879650001401908650001201922650001401934650001001948650001201958650001501970650001301985650002201998650001802020650001802038650001102056650001502067653001402082700002502096700003002121700002302151700002302174700002402197773011802221856007302339852000902412655001202421IND60080508520221120075826.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008050852DNAL7 a10.1111/afe.120592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Renata R.10aInsecticide toxicity and walking response of three pirate bug predators of the tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta  ap. 293-301.  a2019-12-06  aThe tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta is a key pest of the tomato and is of global significance. Insecticide is the primary method for controlling this pest, requiring a search for compounds with a low toxicity to nontarget organisms. We assessed the toxicity of eight insecticides to T. absoluta and its pirate bug predators Orius tristicolor, Amphiareus constrictus and Blaptostethus pallescens (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Anthocoridae). We also assessed the effect of insecticide synergists on their toxicity to the predators, as well as their walking response to insecticide exposure. All insecticides, with the exception of methamidophos, exhibited the minimum efficacy threshold required by the Brazilian legislation (80% efficacy) at concentrations lower than the registered label rates. Indoxacarb and chlorantraniliprole exhibited a lower toxicity to the pirate bug predators than to the tomato leaf miner. The results obtained with the synergized insecticides suggest the involvement of cytochrome P450‐dependent monooxygenases as the primary detoxification enzymes minimizing insecticide toxicity in the pirate bug predators. The insecticides led to a reduction in predator walking activity, especially abamectin and indoxacarb, which significantly minimized predator exposure. The results of the present study indicate that novel insecticides, especially chlorantraniliprole, are better suited to sustainable integrated management programmes of the tomato leaf miner.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaws and regulations 3atomatoes 3anontarget organisms 3aBlaptostethus pallescens 3aabamectin 3aenzymes 3apredators 3apests 3awalking 3asynergists 3atoxicity 3aOrius tristicolor 3aTuta absoluta 3amethamidophos 3aleaves 3aindoxacarb 0aHemiptera1 aPicanço, Marcelo C.1 aSantana, Paulo A., JrcJr1 aMoreira, Suzana S.1 aGuedes, Raul N.

To analyze chemical looping processes, it is essential to include process conditions that are realistic and comparable to those that are expected in industrial systems. Relevant variations in these conditions as occurred in bench versus industrial-scale systems include isothermal versus adiabatic operation of the reactors and local versus global process heat integration. Naturally, the types of reactors employed dictate how the reactor operation is to be conducted from the heat integration viewpoint in the overall process arrangement. As an example, in industrial applications, a fluidized bed reactor is operated near uniform temperature conditions. A fixed bed or a moving bed reactor, on the other hand, is typically operated adiabatically, and thus under the autothermal operation, the nonisothermal condition prevails, leading to different strategies for process simulations and heat integration requirements. This study presents the chemical looping process simulation based on a moving bed reactor used as a reducer for two H₂ generation process configurations under autothermal operating conditions. The two process configurations are represented by the two-reactor (reducer–combustor followed by the water–gas shift reaction) and the three-reactor (reducer–oxidizer–combustor with water splitting for H₂ generation in the oxidizer) chemical looping systems with each configuration producing H₂ in a different operating scheme. The simulation results are compared with the conventional steam methane reforming (SMR) system as a baseline case to underscore the attractiveness of the chemical looping configurations. Specifically, for each configuration, the parametric study under the adiabatic conditions is used to optimize the operating conditions that can satisfy the heat balance requirements and can achieve a maximum H₂ yield. The exergy analysis indicates that the two-reactor chemical looping and three-reactor chemical looping systems can achieve, respectively, a 4.0 and 11.4% increase in relative percentage in the overall process exergy efficiency over the conventional steam methane reforming system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexergy 3afluidized beds 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aindustrial applications 3amethane 3aoxidants 3aprocess design 3asteam 3atemperature1 aKong, Fanhe1 aTong, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4281-13171 aFan, Liang-Shih1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2075-65050 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Mar. 05, v. 59, no. 13 p.5877-5890dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b061303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010300164300001600267520138100283592002801664650002701692650002101719650002501740650002601765650001701791650001001808650000901818650001401827650001101841650001401852650000701866650003901873650002201912650002601934650001601960700001601976700001401992700002002006700001402026700001202040700001502052773011002067856008102177852000902258655001202267IND60547958420221119070426.0160903e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054795842DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-016-2043-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Xianghui10aExpression and Characterization of a Novel 1,3-Propanediol Dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis  ap. 959-972.  a1,3-Propanediol dehydrogenase (PDOR) is important in the biosynthesis of 1,3-propanediol. In the present study, the dhaT gene encoding PDOR was cloned from Lactobacillus brevis 6239 and expressed in Escherichia coli for the first time. Sequence analysis revealed that PDOR containing two Fe²⁺-binding motifs and a cofactor motif belongs to the type III alcohol dehydrogenase. The purified recombinant PDOR exhibited a single band of 42 kDa according to SDS-PAGE. Optimal temperatures and pH values of this dehydrogenase are 37 °C, 7.5 for reduction and 25 °C, 9.5 for oxidation, respectively. We found that PDOR was more stable in acid buffer than in alkaline condition, and 60 % of its relative activity still remained after a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. The activity of PDOR can be enhanced in the presence of Mn²⁺ or Fe²⁺ iron and inhibited by EDTA or PMSF by different degrees. The K ₘ and V ₘₐₓ of this dehydrogenase are 1.25 mM, 64.02 μM min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ for propionaldehyde and 2.26 mM, 35.05 μM min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ for 1,3-PD, respectively. Substrate specificity analysis showed that PDOR has a broad range of substrate specificities. The modeling superposition indicated that the structural differences may account for the diversity of PDORs’ properties. Thus, our PDOR is a potential candidate for facilitating the 1,3-PD biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3airon 3amanganese 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asequence analysis 3asubstrate specificity 3atemperature1 aYun, Junhua1 aQi, Yilin1 aZhang, Huanhuan1 aWang, Fei1 aGuo, Qi1 aCao, Zheng0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 July, v. 179, no. 6 p.959-972dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-016-2043-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007700171300001800248520125400266592002801520650001501548650001501563650001001578650001601588650001301604650002301617700002001640700001701660773011001677856008101787852000901868655001201877IND60547879920221120065410.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054787992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-016-1372-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBragalli, Cristiana10aEnhancing Knowledge in Water Distribution Networks via Data Assimilation  ap. 3689-3706.  aThis paper deals with uncertainty estimation and knowledge enhancement in water distribution networks (WDNs). A new three steps data assimilation approach is introduced, which in combination with multi-objective optimization, allows selecting effective and affordable monitoring networks. An innovative cascade of Ensemble Kalman Filters is used to assimilate the information deriving from sensors measuring pressure heads, flow in pipes and demands, with the objective of increasing knowledge while preserving at the same time the structural relationships among state variables. Selection of the most appropriate and economically affordable measurement network, is then based on the derivation of a Pareto front using the NSGA-II algorithm in conjunction with the data assimilation approach. The front is obtained by compromising between the overall sensors cost and the uncertainty reduction (or knowledge enhancement), which is expressed as a function of the Total Variance of state variables. The operational use of the proposed data assimilation approach as well as the effectiveness of the chosen observation network is also demonstrated by showing the reduction of uncertainty deriving from successive assimilations of real-time observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amonitoring 3apipes 3auncertainty 3avariance 3awater distribution1 aFortini, Matteo1 aTodini, Ezio0 tWater resources management.g2016 Sept., v. 30, no. 11 p.3689-3706dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-016-1372-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008900164300002000253500002000273520126900293592002801562650002201590650001001612650002001622650001201642650002501654650002301679650001501702650001801717650001401735650001601749650001101765700001801776700002101794700002001815700002001835700002401855700002001879700002301899700002401922700005701946700005702003773014002060856007502200852000902275655001202284IND60794582620221120143536.0220926e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079458262DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.146392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalil, Ahmed Magdy10aImproved method for avian influenza virus isolation from environmental water samples  ap. e2889-e2897.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnvironmental water‐targeted surveillance of migratory aquatic birds at overwintering sites is potentially one of the most effective approaches for understanding the ecology of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). In this study, we improved the method for AIV isolation from environmental water samples by making a minor modification to our previously reported process. We experimentally demonstrated that the AIV recovery efficiency of the modified method was 10–100‐fold higher than that of the original method. This improved isolation method allowed us to isolate a considerably larger number of AIV isolates from environmental water samples collected at an overwintering site for tens of thousands of migratory aquatic birds in Japan during the 2018/2019 winter season, compared with those during previous winter seasons. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that AIVs of the same subtypes with multiple genetic constellations were circulating in a single overwintering site during a single winter season. These findings indicate that our improved isolation method contributes to enhance environmental water‐targeted surveillance and to a better understanding of AIV ecology in migratory aquatic bird populations by monitoring ongoing AIV circulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aJapan 3aavian influenza 3aecology 3aisolation techniques 3amigratory behavior 3amonitoring 3aoverwintering 3aphylogeny 3awater birds 3awinter1 aKojima, Isshu1 aFukunaga, Wataru1 aOkajima, Misuzu1 aMitarai, Sumire1 aFujimoto, Yoshikazu1 aMatsui, Tsutomu1 aKuwahara, Masakazu1 aMasatani, Tatsunori1 aOkuya, Kosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7987-98841 aOzawa, Makoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7731-53210 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 Sept., v. 69, no. 5 p.e2889-e2897dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.146393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245011000167300001800277520165400295592002801949650000801977650002001985650001802005650002702023650001602050650003102066650002502097650001902122650003002141650001402171650001602185650001802201650002202219650003102241651001102272700001802283700001802301700001602319700001902335700002102354700001602375700001902391700001802410700002202428773017802450856007802628852000902706655001202715IND60118169020221116154150.0141126e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011816902DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.045831-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḤamīd, Āṣif,10aCohnella formosensis sp. nov., a xylanolytic bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of Medicago sativa L  ap. 2806-2812.  aA Gram-positive, spore-forming, aerobic, rod-shaped, xylanolytic bacterium designated strain CC-Alfalfa-35T was isolated from the rhizosphere of Medicago sativa L. in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain CC-Alfalfa-35T was affiliated to the genus Cohnella. Strain CC-Alfalfa-35T shared 95.3 % pairwise 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the type strain of the type species of the genus Cohnella (Cohnella thermotolerans DSM 17683T) besides showing a similarity of 97.4–93.6 % with other recognized species of the genus Cohnella. The DNA–DNA hybridization value between CC-Alfalfa-35T and Cohnella thailandensis KCTC 22296T was 37.7 %±1.7 % (reciprocal value, 55.7 %±3.0 %). Predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0. The polar lipid profile constituted diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol, three unidentified phospholipids and three unidentified aminophospholipids. The major respiratory quinone was MK-7 and the DNA G+C content was 58.3 mol%. Strain CC-Alfalfa-35T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the major diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Based on the polar lipid and fatty acid profiles, which were in line with those of C. thermotolerans DSM 17683T, coupled with additional distinguishing genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic features, strain CC-Alfalfa-35T is proposed to represent a novel species within the genus Cohnella, for which the name Cohnella formosensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CC-Alfalfa-35T ( = JCM 18405T = BCRC 80428T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMedicago sativa 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptidoglycans 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3axylanolytic microorganisms 3aTaiwan1 aHong, Meihua,1 aLin, Shih-Yao1 aHsu, Yi-Han1 aLiu, You-Cheng1 aShahina, Mariyam1 aLai, Wei-An1 aHuang, Xinjie,1 aYoung, Li-Sen1 aYoung, Chiu-Chung0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2013 Aug., v. 63, no.

The differences of body measurements in captive Sumatran elephant on different captivity management and sex. Biodiversitas 22: 2619-2624. Sumatran elephants are one of wild animals in Indonesia that currently received critically endangered status. This study aimed to measure the body size of both sexes of Sumatran elephants in the semi-captive (ECCs) and full captive (Zoo) management for conservation purposes. This study was conducted in ECCs in Sumatran island and Zoo on Java island. Body measurements (Chest Girth, Length, Height, Tarsal and Carpal Circumference) were collected from a total of 49 samples of captive Sumatran elephants (25 from EECs and 24 from Zoo). Data were analyzed using a completely randomized factorial design with different management and sex as the factors. The results showed that BL (304.92 vs 311.13) and TC (76.44 vs 77.50) were significantly different (P<0.05) across captivity managements. Sex categories (male and female) showed significant results (P<0.01) on CG (321.71 vs 302.46), BL (303.50 vs 272.49), BH (230.14 vs 208.23) and TC (82.29 vs 74.83). No interaction was identified between captive management and sex on body measurements. In conclusion, there were significant differences in body size of male and female elephants. This result contributed well-researched information to evaluate the conservation management based on body size and for further research on Sumatran elephant conservation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achest 3afemales 3amales 3azoos 3aIndonesia 0abody measurement 0acaptivity 0aconservation 0asumatran elephant1 aIBRAHIM, ALEK 1 aWIDAYANTI, RINI 1 aNURCAHYO, WISNU 1 aWahyu, Muhammad,1 aMICHAUX, JOHAN R.1 aWIJAYANTO, HERY 0 tBiodiversitas.g2021 June, v. 22, no. 7dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2207093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010700168300001100275520111200286592002801398650001701426650001201443650001901455650002501474650001201499650001001511650001801521650001501539650001101554650001501565650002301580650001601603651001001619700002401629700001801653773009801671856008101769852000901850655001201859IND60573856420221118060335.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057385642DNAL7 a10.1186/s40066-016-0077-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandanaa, Joseph10aCocoa farming households in Ghana consider organic practices as climate smart and livelihoods enhancer  ap. 29.  aBACKGROUND: Several state and non-state organizations are promoting organic agriculture as a climate smart option among cocoa farmers in the Ashanti region of Ghana. In this study, flora diversity and livelihoods position in organic and conventional farming were measured and compared. The experiment included 32 households with young plantations. Jaccard similarity, Shannon (H′) and Simpson (D) diversity indices were measured to assess species similarity, abundance, evenness and dominance. The sustainable livelihoods indicators were food security, income, vulnerability and well-being. RESULTS: The results showed that the species are quite similar. The H′ index for organic farms was slightly higher (0.808) than that of conventional farms (0.762); the D index (0.051) for organic was better than the conventional (0.084). The organic farmers studied had better sustainable livelihoods outcomes than the conventional farmers. CONCLUSION: Since organic farming has more biodiversity, farmers should be encouraged to practise it to improve livelihoods outcomes and enhance climate change mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconventional farming 3afarmers 3aflora 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alivelihood 3aorganic production 3aplantations 3aGhana1 aEgyir, Irene Susana1 aAsante, Isaac0 tAgriculture & food security.g2016 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.29-29dBioMed Centralx2048-70107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40066-016-0077-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245007900175500002200254520115300276592002801429650002401457650002601481650002501507650001501532650001101547650002901558650001201587650001501599650001701614650002001631650001501651653002301666653002401689653002501713653003001738653002901768700002001797700002001817700002101837700001701858773006501875856008801940852000902028655001202037IND60564493220221116190242.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056449322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2017.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTulipani, Svenja10a1-Chloro-n-alkanes: Potential mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation biomarkers  aPre-press version  aChlorinated hydrocarbons with biological sources occur in high abundance and diversity in living organisms as well as in sedimentary environments. Although some of these compounds are potentially highly source-specific and sufficiently degradation-resistant, their capacity as sedimentary biomarkers remains under-investigated. Distinct series of long-chain 1-chloro-n-alkanes have previously been reported in three species of European saltmarsh vegetation; however, these compounds have never been further investigated in a more diverse plant population. Here we report the presence of similar series with a typical higher plant odd/even carbon number predominance in species of Australian mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation, including the black mangrove Lumnitzera racemosa, the grass Sporobolus virginicus and samphire, supporting the potential use of long-chain 1-chloro-n-alkanes as halophyte biomarkers. Based on carbon stable isotope values, which were reported here for the first time, and similarities in their distributions, we propose that the biosynthetic pathway of chloroalkanes is linked to that of other n-alkyl plant wax components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLumnitzera racemosa 3aSporobolus virginicus 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3agrasses 3ahalophytes 3asalt marshes 3astable isotopes 3avegetation 0a1-Chloro-n-alkanes 0aMangrove biomarkers 0aHalophyte biomarkers 0aChloro-n-alkane synthesis 0aBiogenic organo-halogens1 aSchwark, Lorenz1 aHolman, Alex I.1 aBush, Richard T.1 aGrice, Kliti0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2017.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245013500167300001800302520195900320592002802279596004102307650001502348650001702363650002202380650002202402650002602424650001502450650001102465650001502476651001002491700002102501700002302522700002502545773015702570856007702727852000902804655001202813IND60772704820221119132412.0220904s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077270482DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.121792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnhart, Bradley L.10aMOESHA: A Genetic Algorithm for Automatic Calibration and Estimation of Parameter Uncertainty and Sensitivity of Hydrologic Models  ap. 1259-1269.  aCharacterization of the uncertainty and sensitivity of model parameters is an essential facet of hydrologic modeling. This article introduces the multi-objective evolutionary sensitivity handling algorithm (MOESHA) that combines input parameter uncertainty and sensitivity analyses with a genetic algorithm calibration routine to dynamically sample the parameter space. This novel algorithm serves as an alternative to traditional static space-sampling methods, such as stratified sampling or Latin hypercube sampling. In addition to calibrating model parameters to a hydrologic model, MOESHA determines the optimal distribution of model parameters that maximizes model robustness and minimizes error, and the results provide an estimate for model uncertainty due to the uncertainty in model parameters. Subsequently, we compare the model parameter distributions to the distribution of a dummy variable (i.e., a variable that does not affect model output) to differentiate between impactful (i.e., sensitive) and non-impactful parameters. In this way, an optimally calibrated model is produced, and estimations of model uncertainty as well as the relative impact of model parameters on model output (i.e., sensitivity) are determined. A case study using a single-cell hydrologic model (EXP-HYDRO) is used to test the method using river discharge data from the Dee River catchment in Wales. We compare the results of MOESHA with Sobol’s global sensitivity analysis method and demonstrate that the algorithm is able to pinpoint non-impactful parameters, demonstrate the uncertainty of model results with respect to uncertainties in model parameters, and achieve excellent calibration results. A major drawback of the algorithm is that it is computationally expensive; therefore, parallelized methods should be used to reduce the computational burden.

The effects of wood species, rate of temperature rise, and carbonization temperature on the electromagnetic shielding efficiency (ESE) of the electric field were investigated. The wood species used in this study were Japanese cedar, China fir, western hemlock, red oak, fortune paulownia, and Taiwan acacia. Tested materials were carbonized in a high-temperature oven under the following conditions: rate of temperature rise 1°–5°C/min; carbonization temperature 500°–1100°C, with temperature intervals of 100°C; maximum temperature maintained for 1 h; and flow rate of nitrogen 300 ml/min. The electromagnetic insulation strength system was used to detect the ESE of the electric field of charcoal. It was found that western hemlock and fortune paulownia charcoal showed maximum ESE values of of 36 and 61 dB generated at a carbonization temperature of 1000°C. The charcoals derived from four other wood species showed maximum ESE values of 28 dB for Japanese cedar, 23 dB for China fir, 32 dB for red oak, and 38 dB for Taiwan acacia, respectively, at a carbonization temperature of 1100°C. The ESE value for fortune paulownia charcoal was similar to those of metal nets. The relations between ESE and logarithmic values of resistivity (log ρ) could be represented by a negatively exponential formula.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia confusa 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aPaulownia 3acarbonization 3acharcoal 3aelectric field 3ainsulating materials 3anitrogen 3aovens 3atemperature 3awood1 aHung, Chung-Pin0 tJournal of wood science.g2003 Oct., v. 49, no. 5 p.450-454dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-002-0506-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015000165300001800315520180500333592002802138650003402166650003002200650001102230650001502241650001302256650001502269650001402284650001102298650000802309650001802317650001502335650001202350650001002362650001002372700001402382700001602396700001402412773011702426856008102543852000902624655001202633IND60517806320221118054146.0160405e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051780632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-015-0941-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohner, S. A.10aExamination of iodine status in the German population: an example for methodological pitfalls of the current approach of iodine status assessment  ap. 1275-1282.  aPURPOSE: Preliminary iodine concentration (UIC) measurements in spot urines of the representative German adult study DEGS indicated a severe worsening of iodine status compared to previous results in German children (KiGGS study). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate adult iodine status in detail and to investigate the impact of hydration status on UIC. METHODS: UIC and creatinine concentrations were measured in 6978 spot urines from the German nationwide DEGS study (2008–2011). Twenty-four-hour iodine excretions (24-h UIE) were estimated by relating iodine/creatinine ratios to age- and sex-specific 24-h creatinine reference values. Urine osmolality was measured in two subsamples of spot urines (n = 100 each) to determine the impact of hydration status on UIC. RESULTS: In DEGS, median UIC was 69 µg/L in men and 54 µg/L in women, lying clearly below the WHO cutoff for iodine sufficiency (100 µg/L). Estimated median 24-h UIE was 113 µg/day, accompanied by 32 % of DEGS adults, lying below the estimated average requirement (EAR) for iodine. Comparative analysis with the KiGGS data (>14,000 spot urines of children; median UIC 117 µg/L) revealed a comparable percentage <EAR (33 %). In two DEGS subsamples with significantly different UIC but similar median 24-h UIE, osmolality was twofold higher in the high- versus the low-UIC group. CONCLUSION: Over 30 % of participants in the two German surveys had an estimated iodine intake less than the respective age-group-specific EAR. Our data strongly suggest that even in large surveys, hydration status can considerably interfere with the epidemiological iodine assessment parameter UIC. The present data can serve as an example how to evaluate population-based spot urine data on a 24-h basis, independent of hydration status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEstimated Average Requirement 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3abody water 3achildren 3acreatinine 3aexcretion 3aiodine 3amen 3anormal values 3aosmolality 3asurveys 3aurine 3awomen1 aThamm, M.1 aSchmitz, R.1 aRemer, T.0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2016 Apr., v. 55, no. 3 p.1275-1282dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-015-0941-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011600170300001800286500001500304520180200319592002802121650002302149650001102172650001002183650001202193650002602205650001302231650002602244653001802270700001802288700002002306700002302326700002302349773011002372856008102482852000902563655001202572IND60547880220221123012731.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054788022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-016-1382-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattar, Mohamed A.10aEvaluating and Calibrating Reference Evapotranspiration Models Using Water Balance under Hyper-Arid Environment  ap. 3745-3767.  a2019-12-06  aThis research investigates five reference evapotranspiration models (one combined model, one temperature-based model, and three radiation-based models) under hyper-arid environmental conditions at the operational field level. These models were evaluated and calibrated using the weekly water balance of alfalfa by EnviroSCAN to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Calibration models were evaluated and validated using wheat and potatoes, respectively, on the basis of weekly water balance. Based on the results and discussion, the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model proved to be superior in estimating ETc with a slight underestimation of 2 %. Meanwhile, the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model (temperature-based) underestimated ETc by 20 % and the Priestley-Taylor (PT) and Makkink (MK) models (radiation-based) had similar performances underestimating by up to 35 % of the measured ETc. The Turc (TR) model had the lowest performance compared with other models, demonstrating values underestimated by up to 60 % of the measured ETc. Local calibration based on alfalfa evapotranspiration measurements was used to rectify these underestimations. The surprisingly good performance of the calibrated simple HS model, with a new coefficient 0.0029, demonstrated its favorable potential to improve irrigation scheduling. The MK and PT models were in third and fourth rank, respectively, reflecting minor differences between one another. The new coefficients obtained for the MK and PT models were 1.99 and 0.963, respectively. One important observation was that the calibrated TR model performed poorly, with an increase in its coefficient from 0.013 to 0.034 to account for hyper-arid environmental conditions; moreover, it required additional seasonal calibration to adequately improve its performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3amodels 3awheat 3aalfalfa 3aenvironmental factors 3apotatoes 3airrigation scheduling 0awater balance1 aAlazba, A.

The aim was to provide background information for producing butt-jointed, glued, laminated timber. Three butt-jointed lamination models were prepared from spruce-pine-fir (S-P-F) dimension lumber with glued and nonglued butt joints, with different placements of the butt joints in the models. The axial stiffness and strength properties were assessed using both compressive and tensile tests. The results of the study indicated that for the compressive lamination model the application of glue at the butt joint gave more stiffness than the nonglued butt joint. Neither glue application nor placement of the joint had a statistically significant effect on the compressive strength. There were no significant differences between the glued and nonglued butt joint for either tensile strength or stiffness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3alumber 3amodels 3atensile strength1 aKoizumi, Akio1 aHirai, Takuro0 tJournal of wood science.g2003 Oct., v. 49, no. 5 p.405-410dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-002-0508-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245007600163300001600239500001400255520038100269592002800650650001200678650001600690650001600706650001700722650002200739650001300761653003000774653003100804653004200835700002600877700002900903773011300932856008601045852000901131655001201140IND60719529520221121005829.0210118e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071952952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2020.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Bin10aPedospheric Microbial Nitric Oxide Production Challenges Root Symbioses  ap. 104-107.  aNAL-light  aRecent studies indicate that a multitude of microbial processes are involved in nitric oxide production and consumptions in the pedosphere.

Large conjugative plasmids in Gram-negative bacteria are associated with multi-drug resistance and have been implicated in the spread of these phenotypes to pathogenic organisms. A/C plasmids often carry genes that confer resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. Recently, transcription factors were characterized that regulate A/C conjugation. In this work, we expanded the regulon of the negative regulator Acr2. We developed an A/C variant, pARK01, by precise removal of resistance genes carried by the plasmid in order to make it more genetically tractable. Using pARK01, we conducted RNA-Seq and ChAP-Seq experiments to characterize the regulon of Acr2, an H-NS-like protein. We found that Acr2 binds several loci on the plasmid. We showed, in vitro, that Acr2 can bind specific promoter regions directly and identify key amino acids which are important for this binding. This study further characterizes Acr2 and suggests its role in modulating gene expression of multiple plasmid and chromosomal loci.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUniversity of Minnesotadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000072490 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aamino acids 3aantibiotics 3agenetic resistance 3aloci 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphenotype 3aplasmids 3apromoter regions 3aregulon 3asequence analysis 3atranscription factors1 aJohnson, Timothy J.0 tPlasmid.g2016 Sept.,  Nov., v. 87-88 p.17-27dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27593x0147-619X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2016.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245015400168506002800322520199600350592002802346506003702374650002702411650001102438650002602449650001602475650002302491650003002514650001302544650001602557650002502573650002302598650002202621653002702643653002402670653003002694653001602724653002802740700003402768700001802802700001902820700002202839700002102861700002602882773009202908856008003000852000903080655001203089IND60764663520221207143406.0211122e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076466352DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2103442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFagundes, Marcilio10aDiversity of gall-inducing insect associated with a superhost plant species: Plant architecture, resource availability and interspecific interactions  aResource is Open Access  aFagundes M, Santos EML, Duarte KLR, Santos LM, Vieira JS, Oliveira CHD, Silva PS. 2020. Diversity of gall-inducing insect associated with a superhost plant species: Plant architecture, resource availability and interspecific interactions. Biodiversitas 21: 1182-1189. The role of interspecific competition in the organization of herbivorous insect communities may vary depending on resource availability. Trees are structurally more complex and have greater resource availability for herbivorous insects than shrubs. In this study, we evaluated the roles of plant architecture and interspecific interactions on community organization of the gall-inducing insect associated with trees (adult plants) and shrubs (young plants) of Copaifera langsdorffii. Our results showed that the species composition of gall-inducing insect communities associated with C. langsdorffii differed statistically between trees and shrubs. In addition, the trees presented greater diversity of gall-inducing insects than the shrubs, corroborating the hypothesis of plant architecture. The results of the analysis of null models showed that the co-occurrence of gall-inducing insect species associated with trees not differ from the co-occurrence predicted by chance. Thus, interspecific interactions cannot be used to explain the community organization of the gall-inducing insects on C. langsdorffii trees. On the other hand, the co-occurrence of gall-inducing insect species differed from the co-occurrence predicted by chance when shrubs plants were analyzed, indicating that biotic interactions can shape the structure of the gall-inducing insect community on shrubs. The lower availability of oviposition sites probably generates a dispute for these resources among females of different species of gall-inducing insects only in the shrubs. Therefore, the role of competition in the organization of herbivore insect communities on their host plant may vary depending on the ontogenetic stage of the host plant.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCopaifera langsdorffii 3aadults 3agall-inducing insects 3ahost plants 3ainsect communities 3ainterspecific competition 3aontogeny 3aoviposition 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant architecture 3aspecies diversity 0acopaifera langsdorffii 0aherbivorous insects 0ainterspecific competition 0anull models 0aontogenetic development1 aSantos, ÉLLEN MARIANE SANTOS1 aDuarte, Karen1 aSantos, Larisa1 aVieira, Jaqueline1 aOliveira, Cirilo1 aSilva, Priscila Souza0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Feb., v. 21, no. 3dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2103443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245008400158300001800242520138400260592002801644650001101672650001101683650001101694650001401705650002101719650001201740650001501752650002001767650002201787650001401809650001001823650001601833650002101849650002001870700001401890700001701904700001401921773012701935856008202062852000902144655001202153IND60567750120221116205847.0170425e20170316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056775012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b127202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Wei10aInterfacial and Alloying Effects on Activation of Ethanol from First-Principles  ap. 5603-5611.  aWe present a first-principles density-functional theory study of ethanol activation at oxide/Rh(111) interface and the alloying effect on mitigating carbon deposition, which are essential to direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) anode reaction and steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) reaction. Our calculated results show that charge can transfer from Rh(111) substrate to MOₓ chain (e.g., MoO₃ and MnO₂), or from MOₓ chain (e.g., MgO, SnO₂, ZrO₂, and TiO₂) to Rh(111) substrate. The OH-binding strength is increased exponentially with Mᵟ⁺ charge ranging from 1.4 to 2.2, which renders MnO₂/Rh(111) and MgO/Rh(111) interfaces weaker OH-binding, and thereby enhanced oxidizing functionality of OH* for promoting ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) at DEFC anode. For efficient C–C bond breaking, a large number of Rh ensemble sizes are critically needed at the interface of MOₓ/Rh(111). We found that Rh₁Au₃ near surface alloy has the weakest C* and CO* binding, followed by Rh₁Cu₃ and Rh₁Pd₃ near surface alloys, while Rh₁Ir₃ and Rh₁Ru₃ surface alloys have C* and CO* binding strength similar to that of pure Rh metal. The general implication of this study is that by engineering alloyed structure of weakened C* and CO* binding complemented with metal oxides of weakened OH-binding, high-performance DEFC anode or SRE catalysts can be identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3aethanol 3afuel cells 3amagnesium oxide 3amanganese dioxide 3aoxidation 3asteam 3atin dioxide 3atitanium dioxide 3azirconium oxide1 aMen, Yong1 aWang, Jinguo1 aLiu, Ping0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Mar. 16, v. 121, no. 10 p.5603-5611dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b127203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006200160300001800222500001100240520113100251592002801382596004701410596004401457596004401501596009501545596006601640650001501706650001501721650001601736650002801752650001701780700002501797700002201822700002401844700005701868773011901925856007502044852000902119655001202128IND60793778320221122004754.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079377832DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.161912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZoccarato, Anna14aThe nexus between redox state and intermediary metabolism  ap. 5440-5462.  aREVIEW  aReactive oxygen species (ROS) are not just a by‐product of cellular metabolic processes but act as signalling molecules that regulate both physiological and pathophysiological processes. A close connection exists in cells between redox homeostasis and cellular metabolism. In this review, we describe how intracellular redox state and glycolytic intermediary metabolism are closely coupled. On the one hand, ROS signalling can control glycolytic intermediary metabolism by direct regulation of the activity of key metabolic enzymes and indirect regulation via redox‐sensitive transcription factors. On the other hand, metabolic adaptation and reprogramming in response to physiological or pathological stimuli regulate intracellular redox balance, through mechanisms such as the generation of reducing equivalents. We also discuss the impact of these intermediary metabolism–redox circuits in physiological and disease settings across different tissues. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating these intermediary metabolism–redox circuits will be crucial to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aCH/1999001/11735cBritish Heart Foundation  aRE/18/2/34213cBritish Heart Foundation  aRM/17/3/33381cBritish Heart Foundation  aIS‐BRC‐1215‐20006cNational Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre  a17CVD04cFondation Leducq Transatlantic Network of Excellence 3abyproducts 3aglycolysis 3ahomeostasis 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics1 aNabeebaccus, Adam A.1 aOexner, Rafael R.1 aSantos, Celio X.

Quadruplicate samples of Radiello® passive tubes were taken for 3, 4, 7 and 14 days. Samples were taken indoors during February and March 2010 and outdoors during July 2010 in La Canonja (Tarragona, Spain). The analysis was performed by automatic thermal desorption (ATD) coupled with capillary gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry detection (MS). The results show significant differences (t-test, p < 0.05) between the amounts of VOCs obtained from the sum of two short sampling periods and a single equivalent longer sampling period for 65% of all the data. 17% of the results show significantly larger amounts of pollutant in the sum of two short sampling periods. Back diffusion due to changes in concentrations together with saturation and competitive effects between the compounds during longer sampling periods could be responsible for these differences. The other 48% of the results that are different show significantly larger amounts in the single equivalent longer sampling period. The remaining 35% of the results do not show significant differences. Although significant differences are observed in the amount of several VOCs collected over two shorter sampling intervals compared to the amount collected during a single equivalent longer sampling period, the ratios obtained are very close to unity (between 0.7 and 1.2 in 75% of cases). We conclude that Radiello® passive samplers are useful tools if their limitations are taken into account and the manufacturer's recommendations are followed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3acapillary gas chromatography 3adesorption 3aexposure duration 3amass spectrometry 3asamplers 3at-test 3avolatile organic compounds 3aSpain1 aRoca, F.

This study identified recent dietary trends over a 4-year period in terms of overall dietary patterns and organic foods consumption and associated socio-demographic determinants. METHODS: Food intakes were assessed among 18,108 participants of the NutriNet-Santé cohort in 2014 and 2018. A food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate organic and conventional food consumption. Change in food consumption, quality of the diet (assessed by the adherence to the French national guidelines), plant-based diet using published scores, organic food intake were evaluated in regard with various socio-demographic factors. The paired student t test to compare dietary intake and the Kruskal–Walllis test to consider socio-demographic characteristics were used. RESULTS: Consumption of meat and processed meat decreased respectively by 5.09 g/day (SD 51.15) and 1.12 g/day (SD 26.05). The average total consumption of organic products increased by 12% (+ 93 g/day) while consumption of organic fish and seafood (− 1.4 g/day), poultry (− 1 g/day), processed meat (− 0.3 g/day) and meat (− 3.3 g/day) decreased. The dietary towards healthier diets was more pronounced in certain population subgroups. For example, females, young individuals and postgraduate participants were more likely to increase their consumption of healthful plant and animal-based foods, organic foods and to improve the overall nutritional quality of their diets during the follow-up period than their counterparts. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a slight inflexion towards healthier and plant-based diets over a 4-year period at least in some segments of the population. A decrease in the consumption of animal products and an increase in the consumption of healthful plant-based foods and organic foods suggests a potential trend towards more sustainable diets among certain subgroups. The environmental impacts of these changes need to be assessed in further works as well as the way to sustain and improve them, in particular those who do not initiate sustainable transition.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-13-ALID-0001cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3afish 3afood consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3anutritive value 3aorganic foods 3aplant-based diet 3apoultry 3aprocessed meat 3aseafoods 3at-test1 aPointereau, Philippe1 aAllès, Benjamin1 aTouvier, Mathilde1 aHercberg, Serge1 aLairon, Denis1 aBaudry, Julia1 aKesse-Guyot, Emmanuelle0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2022 Feb., v. 61, no. 1 p.141-155dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-021-02631-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012900163300001600292500001100308520105800319592002801377650001301405650001501418650001201433650002501445650001501470650001101485650001101496650001301507650001501520650001501535650002501550650002001575650001601595650001701611700002601628700002301654700002201677700001901699700001801718700002201736700002701758700001901785700002401804700002701828700001701855700002301872700001801895700002101913700001901934700001801953700002801971700003101999700002802030773011702058856007302175852000902248655001202257IND60587993620221122060054.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058799362DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.127712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFyllas, Nikolaos M.10aSolar radiation and functional traits explain the decline of forest primary productivity along a tropical elevation gradient  ap. 730-740.  aLETTER  aOne of the major challenges in ecology is to understand how ecosystems respond to changes in environmental conditions, and how taxonomic and functional diversity mediate these changes. In this study, we use a trait‐spectra and individual‐based model, to analyse variation in forest primary productivity along a 3.3 km elevation gradient in the Amazon‐Andes. The model accurately predicted the magnitude and trends in forest productivity with elevation, with solar radiation and plant functional traits (leaf dry mass per area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, and wood density) collectively accounting for productivity variation. Remarkably, explicit representation of temperature variation with elevation was not required to achieve accurate predictions of forest productivity, as trait variation driven by species turnover appears to capture the effect of temperature. Our semi‐mechanistic model suggests that spatial variation in traits can potentially be used to estimate spatial variation in productivity at the landscape scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aecosystems 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3awood density1 aBentley, Lisa Patrick1 aShenkin, Alexander1 aAsner, Gregory P.1 aAtkin, Owen K.1 aDíaz, Sandra1 aEnquist, Brian J.1 aFarfan‐Rios, William1 aGloor, Emanuel1 aGuerrieri, Rossella1 aHuasco, Walter Huaraca1 aIshida, Yoko1 aMartin, Roberta E.1 aMeir, Patrick1 aPhillips, Oliver1 aSalinas, Norma1 aSilman, Miles1 aWeerasinghe, Lasantha K1 aZaragoza‐Castells, Joana1 aMalhi, Y.q(Yadvinder),0 tEcology letters.g2017 June, v. 20, no. 6 p.730-740dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.127713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010200167300001600269520141400285592002801699650003701727650001201764650001501776650001301791650001601804650002101820650001501841650001201856650000901868650001801877650001301895650001501908650001101923650003001934650001401964650001501978653001301993653001802006653003302024653002302057653002202080700002402102700001602126700002502142700002702167773011102194856008302305852000902388655001202397IND60582123320221119053532.0201202e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058212332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhawan, Sameer10aNovel peptidylated surfaces for interference-free electrochemical detection of cardiac troponin I  ap. 486-492.  aNovel peptidylated surfaces were designed to minimise interferences when electrochemically detecting cardiac troponin I in complex biological samples. Disulfide-cored peptide dendrons featuring carbomethoxy groups were self-assembled on gold electrodes. The carbomethoxy groups were deprotected to obtain carboxylic groups used to immobilise antibodies for cardiac troponin I marker. The chemisorption of two types of peptides, one containing triazole and the other with native peptide bonds, on a gold substrate was studied by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Peptides formed ordered self-assembled monolayers, contributing to a more efficient display of the subsequently immobilised antibodies towards their binding to the antigen. As a result, electrochemical immunosensors prepared by self-assembly of peptides afforded higher sensitivities for cardiac troponin I than those prepared by the chemisorption of alkane thiolated compounds. Triazolic peptide-modified immunosensors showed extraordinary sensitivity towards cardiac troponin I [1.7µA/(ng/mL) in phosphate buffer], but suffered from surface fouling in 10% serum. Modification with non-triazolic peptides gave rise to anti-fouling properties and still enabled the detection of cardiac troponin I at pg/mL concentrations in 10% serum without significant matrix effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkanes 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afouling 3agold 3aimmunosensors 3apeptides 3aphosphates 3aquartz 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atriazoles 3atroponin I 0aPeptides 0aSelf-assembly 0aElectrochemical immunosensor 0aCardiac troponin I 0aInterference free1 aSadanandan, Sandhya1 aHaridas, V.1 aVoelcker, Nicolas H.1 aPrieto-Simón, Beatriz0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 99 p.486-492dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013400158300001800292520167600310592002801986650001602014650002302030650001102053650002302064650002802087650001502115650001602130650001802146650001102164650001902175650001302194650000902207650001302216700002702229700001802256700001902274773014102293856007402434852000902508655001202517IND60631272420221122223858.0190220e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063127242DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta12396a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Haj, Yazan10aNitrogen-doped graphene encapsulated cobalt iron sulfide as an advanced electrode for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors  ap. 3941-3952.  aTo develop supercapacitors (SCs) with high energy and power densities, a new type of electrode material with unique properties is strongly required. Metal sulfides (MSs) have been recently studied as promising electrode materials for high-performance SCs because they have excellent redox properties, outstanding electrical conductivity, exceptional catalytic activity, and ultra-high specific capacity. However, their large volume changes and poor rate performances seriously hinder their commercial applications. Herein, a novel nitrogen-doped graphene encapsulated cobalt iron sulfide core–shell (Co₈FeS₈@NG) hybrid was successfully synthesized through a facile, scalable, and single-step in situ hydrothermal technique. The hierarchical core–shell Co₈FeS₈@NG hybrid was employed as an advanced electrode material for high-performance solid-state asymmetric SCs (ASCs). The Co₈FeS₈@NG electrode delivers an ultra-high specific capacitance of ∼1374 F g⁻¹ at a current density of 2 A g⁻¹, with tremendous rate capability (∼71.69% of capacitance retention at 40 A g⁻¹) and excellent cycling stability (∼96.1% of capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles). Furthermore, the assembled Co₈FeS₈@NG//FeS@NG ASC device exhibits an ultra-high energy density of ∼70.4 W h kg⁻¹ at a power density of 0.598 kW kg⁻¹, exceptional power density (∼22.55 kW h kg⁻¹ at 49.5 W h kg⁻¹), and outstanding cycling stability (∼93.7% of initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles). Therefore, these results demonstrate a simple and cost-effective route for the development of new types of NG encapsulated ternary MSs for future electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3airon 3asulfides1 aBalamurugan, Jayaraman1 aKim, Nam Hoon1 aLee, Joong Hee0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Feb. 19, v. 7, no. 8 p.3941-3952dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta12396a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011300207300001600320520165500336592002801991650002302019650002302042650005202065650001602117650002302133650001002156650002202166650001202188650001102200650002602211650001402237650001302251650003102264650002602295650001702321653001302338653001402351653001702365653001202382700001902394700002402413700001802437700001902455700002102474700001902495700006102514700002302575700001802598773016002616856008502776852000902861655001202870IND60758513920221120023457.0220531e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075851392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenei, Tímea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5963-181710aCOVID-19 mortality is associated with low vitamin D levels in patients with risk factors and/or advanced age  ap. 410-413.  aAlthough conclusive evidence is yet lacking, it has been suggested that vitamin D deficiency (VD) may be associated with a more severe course of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19). In this retrospective study we assessed the association of VD deficiency with mortality in a group of COVID-19 patients treated in a tertiary referral center. Data of 257 Covid-19 patients hospitalized between 30th September 2020 and 2nd March 2021 have been collected retrospectively. The following parameters were collected: age, gender, serum level of 25-OH-Vitamin D₃, outcome (survival/death), comorbidities (cancer, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Serum VD measurement was done within 3 days of admission. VD levels were significantly lower in patients who did not survive, however, in this patients’ group the average age was significantly higher than among those, who survived. After age-matching, in a subgroup of patients with risk factors and/or 60 years of age or older who survived had significantly higher VD level in their serum than those who deceased. Serum C-reactive protein, lactate-dehydrogenase and creatinin-kinase were significantly higher in the group in which the patients died, however these laboratory parameters did not correlate with the VD levels. We found that in COVID-19 infection, when old age as risk factor (60 years of age or older) was pooled with risk factors (cancer, diabetes and/or COPD), the VD levels were significantly lower in the patient group, in which the patients did not survive. We suggest further, prospective studies in similar subgroups to explore a possible causal relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3ablood serum 3aclinical nutrition 3adeath 3adiabetes mellitus 3aelderly 3agender 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amortality 3apatients 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aretrospective studies 3arisk factors 0aCovid-19 0aVitamin D 0aRisk factors 0aElderly1 aJenei, Sándor1 aTamás, László T.1 aPutics, Ákos1 aKnausz, Márta1 aHegedűs, Irén,1 aDinnyés, Imre1 aSzalai, Zsuzsanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7012-20601 aMolnár, Tamás F.1 aBüki, Béla,0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 Feb., v. 47 p.410-413dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245009600185300001600281520142900297592002801726650002001754650002001774650000801794650001801802650001401820650001601834650001501850650001001865650002501875650001101900650001901911650001801930650003301948650001301981650001601994650001502010651001002025700001502035700002602050700001502076700002602091773011302117856008502230852000902315655001202324IND60087247120221118223012.0141102e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008724712DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60453-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, Ningombam Linthoingambi10aPassive air sampling of organochlorine pesticides in a northeastern state of India, Manipur  ap. 808-815.  aThirty-six polyurethane foam disk passive air samplers (PUF-PAS) were deployed over a year during January to December, 2009 at three locations, i.e., Imphal (urban site), Thoubal (rural site) and Waithou (alpine site) of Manipur, to assess the seasonal local atmospheric emission of selected organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The average concentration of HCHs monitored at mountain site during hot season (Mar, Apr, and May) and rainy seasons (Jun, Jul, Aug, and Sep) were 403 and 349 pg/m³, respectively. DDTs had a high concentration with 384 pg/m³ at rural site and 379 pg/m³ at urban site during hot seasons. Endosulfans and chlordane were found high in concentration during hot seasons (260 pg/m³) and low during retreating monsoon seasons (44 pg/m³) at rural site. Most of the OCPs concentrations were high during cultivation period. The OCP concentrations of rainy season were highly correlated (p < 0.01) with OCPs of hot seasons. Further, positive correlation (p < 0.05) was also obtained between cold seasons and retreating monsoon. Principal component analysis showed a significant correlation among the four seasons and distribution pattern of OCPs in air. Back trajectory analysis by using HYPSLIT model showed a long range air transport of OCPs to the present study area. Present OCP levels at Manipur is an outcome of both local emission and also movement of air mass by long range atmospheric transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aair 3aair pollution 3achlordane 3acold season 3aendosulfan 3afoams 3ainsecticide residues 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3apolyurethanes 3aprincipal component analysis 3asamplers 3awarm season 3awet season 3aIndia1 aQi, Shihua1 aChakraborty, Paromita1 aZhang, Gan1 aYadav, Ishwar Chandra0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2011 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.808-815dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60453-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01532naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245011300204300001800317520041100335592002800746650002300774650002300797650002300820650001300843700001800856700003100874700001500905700001600920700002000936700002100956773013400977856007401111852000901185655001201194IND60638745020221121232752.0190430e20160419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063874502DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc01426g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParkThese authors contributed equally to this work., Hankum10aNonspecific protein labeling of photoaffinity linkers correlates with their molecular shapes in living cells  ap. 5828-5831.  aHerein we report molecular shape-dependent nonspecific labeling of photoaffinity linkers (PLs) in the cellular proteome.

These microscopic asexually reproductive structures are small enough to reach the lungs. Germination of conidia followed by hyphal growth inside human lungs is a key step in the establishment of infection in immunocompromised patients. RNA-Seq was used to analyze the transcriptome of dormant and germinating A. fumigatus conidia. Construction of a gene co-expression network revealed four gene clusters (modules) correlated with a growth phase (dormant, isotropic growth, polarized growth). Transcripts levels of genes encoding for secondary metabolites were high in dormant conidia. During isotropic growth, transcript levels of genes involved in cell wall modifications increased. Two modules encoding for growth and cell cycle/DNA processing were associated with polarized growth. In addition, the co-expression network was used to identify highly connected intermodular hub genes. These genes may have a pivotal role in the respective module and could therefore be compelling therapeutic targets. Generally, cell wall remodeling is an important process during isotropic and polarized growth, characterized by an increase of transcripts coding for hyphal growth and cell cycle/DNA processing when polarized growth is initiated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aDNA 3acell cycle 3acell walls 3aconidia 3adevelopmental stages 3afungi 3agermination 3ahumans 3ahyphae 3aisotropy 3alungs 3amultigene family 3apatients 3asaprophytes 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence analysis 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptome 0aA. fumigatus 0aGermination 0aRNA-Seq 0aIsotropic growth 0aPolarized growth 0aCI 0aDE 0aWGCNA 0aGO 0aqRT-PCR 0aSDE 0aMM 0aGS1 aCoolen, Jordy P.M.1 aZoll, Jan1 aVerweij, Paul E.1 aMelchers, Willem J.G.0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2018 July, v. 116 p.62-72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2018.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011500208300001600323520137900339592002801718650001901746650002301765650000901788650001101797650001501808650001301823650002001836650002201856653001901878653002501897653002101922653002001943653000801963653000801971653001001979653000801989653000801997653000802005653000802013653001002021653000802031700002902039700002102068700001602089700006102105700002502166700001702191700005502208700006002263700001502323700005402338700002402392773016002416856008502576852000902661655001202670IND60758514020221120023435.0220531e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075851402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngland, Clare1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0685-069010aLow iodine diet advice and differentiated thyroid cancer treatment: A historic exploration in three UK centres  ap. 315-320.  aPatients with differentiated thyroid cancer are often advised to follow a low iodine diet (LID) one to two weeks before radioiodine remnant ablation (RRA). We describe treatment practices and ablation success rates in centres (C1, C2, C3) in the UK with different approaches to LID advice. Historic cohort of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated with RRA in 2015/16 in C1 (n = 50, 1-week LID), C2 (n = 59, 2-week LID) and C3 (n = 108, no LID advice). Response to RRA was stratified as excellent, indeterminate, or incomplete by the adapted American Thyroid Association Dynamic Risk Stratification Score. There was little difference in age, sex and staging between centres, but the percentage receiving 1.1 GBq vs higher administered activities differed (C1:22%, C2:44%, C3:15%, p < 0.001). Excellent response was recorded for: C1:48%, C2:36%, C3:49% (p = 0.61). Differences in RRA preparation and outcome assessment at C3 precluded comparison across all centres. Adjusted odds ratio for excellent response at C2 vs C1 was 0.57 (95%CI: 0.25,1.32), p = 0.19. There was no evidence that advising a LID for 2-weeks before RRA improves outcomes compared to 1-week. For definitive recommendations on LIDs prior to RRA, a prospective multi-centre study with a more homogenous approach to patient management or, randomised controlled trial, is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3aclinical nutrition 3adiet 3aiodine 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3arisk assessment 3athyroid neoplasms 0aThyroid cancer 0aRadioiodine ablation 0aHistoric studies 0aLow iodine diet 0aDTC 0aLID 0arhTSH 0aRRA 0aTHW 0aTSH 0aUIC 0aUI/Cr 0aUIE1 aIngarfield-Herbert, Kate1 aBeasley, Matthew1 aMoss, Laura1 aVinjamuri, Sobhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3571-32731 aHaupt-Schott, Ingrid1 aMcKane, Gail1 aHunt, Linda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8651-83661 aHerbert, Georgia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0422-826X1 aLeary, Sam1 aNess, Andy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3548-95231 aAtkinson, Charlotte0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 Feb., v. 47 p.315-320dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010700168300001600275520094400291592002801235650002101263650002701284650001801311650002101329650001901350650001201369650001101381650001901392650001001411650001201421650002501433650001801458650002201476700001901498700001801517700001501535700001601550700001901566773011301585856008501698852000901783655001201792IND60087247220221118223027.0141102e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008724722DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60458-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Beihai10aBiodegradation of geosmin in drinking water by novel bacteria isolated from biologically active carbon  ap. 816-823.  aThree strains of Gram-negative bacteria capable of removing geosmin from drinking water were isolated from biologically active carbon and identified to be Chryseobacterium sp., Sinorhizobium sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp. based on physio-biochemistry analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Removal efficiencies of 2 mg/L geosmin in mineral salts medium were 84.0%, 80.2% and 74.4% for Chryseobacterium sp., Sinorhizobium sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp., respectively, while removal efficiencies of 560 ng/L geosmin in filter influent were 84.8%, 82.3% and 82.5%, respectively. The biodégradation of geosmin was determined to be a pseudo first-order reaction, with rate constants at 2 mg/L and 560 ng/L being 0.097 and 0.086 day⁻¹, 0.089 and 0.084 day⁻¹, 0.074 and 0.098 day⁻¹ for the above mentioned degraders, respectively. The biomass of culture in the presence of geosmin was much higher than that in the absence of geosmin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChryseobacterium 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aSinorhizobium 3aStenotrophomonas 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adrinking water 3agenes 3ageosmin 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis1 aYuan, Rongfang1 aShi, Chunhong1 aYu, Liying1 aGu, Junnong1 aZhang, Chunlei0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2011 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.816-823dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60458-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001400189245009600203300001600299506007600315520146800391592002801859506003701887650001301924650001301937650001501950650002001965650002601985650002302011650002202034650002202056650001102078650002402089650001802113650001402131650002602145650001002171650001302181653001602194653002502210653003702235653002502272653001302297700001602310700001702326700002002343700001502363773011102378856008302489852000902572655001202581IND60582123520221207050757.0201202e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058212352DNAL7 a288187852pmid7 aPMC71276952pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Fei12aA single-tube approach for in vitro diagnostics using diatomaceous earth and optical sensor  ap. 443-449.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVersatile, simple and efficient sample preparation is desirable for point-of-care testing of emerging diseases such as zoonoses, but current sample preparation assays are insensitive, labour-intensive and time-consuming and require multiple instruments. We developed a single-tube sample preparation approach involving direct pathogen enrichment and extraction from human specimens using diatomaceous earth (DE). Amine-modified DE was used to directly enrich a zoonotic pathogen, Brucella, in a large sample volume. Next, a complex of amine-modified DE and dimethyl suberimidate was used for nucleic acid extraction from the enriched pathogen. Using our single-tube approach, the pathogen can be enriched and extracted within 60min at a level of 1 colony formation unit (CFU) from a 1ml sample volume in the same tube. The performance of this approach is 10–100 times better than that of a commercial kit (10² to 10³CFU/ml) but does not require a large centrifuge. Finally, we combined the single-tube approach with a bio-optical sensor for rapid and accurate zoonotic pathogen detection in human urine samples. Using the combination system, Brucella in human urine can be efficiently enriched (~ 8-fold) and the detection limit is enhanced by up to 100 times (1CFU/ml bacteria in urine) compared with the commercial kit. This combined system is fast and highly sensitive and thus represents a promising approach for disease diagnosis in the clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella 3abacteria 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3adiatomaceous earth 3adisease diagnosis 3aemerging diseases 3ahumans 3amicrobial detection 3anucleic acids 3apathogens 3apoint-of-care testing 3aurine 3azoonoses 0aBio-sensing 0aIn vitro diagnostics 0aSample enrichment and extraction 0aSingle tube approach 0aZoonosis1 aKoo, Bonhan1 aLiu, Huifang1 aEun Jin, Choong1 aShin, Yong0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 99 p.443-449dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
