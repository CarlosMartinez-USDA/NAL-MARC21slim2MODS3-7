If native and feral populations are overlapping, the local status of a species remains often questionable. The musk strawberry (Fragaria moschata) is such an example: It is native to Central Europe but has been extensively cultivated until the end of 19th century. The border between native and synanthropic distribution runs presumably from Northeastern to Southwestern Germany. To analyse the relationship between native and synanthropic populations of F. moschata, we performed a population genetic analysis using seven microsatellite markers: We compared native populations from Germany and the Czech Republic, proposed synanthropic occurrences from Germany and cultivars of F. moschata from the germplasm repository “Professor Staudt Collection”. Synanthropic populations were genetically less diverse than native ones and consisted often of one clone only. The results revealed four clones frequently found in synanthropic populations across Germany and moreover, we detected a clear genetic separation between synanthropic and native populations. Furthermore, synanthropic populations were differentiated in a Northern and a Southern German cluster, each comprising cultivars of Northern or Southern European origin as well. We conclude that the synanthropic populations in Germany were actively spread by humans. Dispersal of these populations is extremely limited due to fragmentation and the lack of mating partners. Synanthropic populations were not established by collecting nearby native occurrences but are rather related to different cultivation centres in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria moschata 3acultivars 3aflora 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation genetics 3astrawberries 3asynanthropes 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic 3aGermany 0aGermplasm collection 0asynanthropic populations 0astrawberry1 aSchriefer, Janne1 aBölke, Nadine1 aHerklotz, Veit1 aNeinhuis, Christoph1 aOlbricht, Klaus1 aRitz, Christiane Maria0 tFlora.g2021 Feb., v. 275 p.151762-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2021.1517623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001500159245012700174520129000301592002801591650002201619650001401641650001701655650001601672650002001688650001501708650001301723650002101736650001101757650001301768650002501781650002201806650003701828653002001865653001701885653001401902653001501916653002101931700001701952700001701969700001801986700001702004700005302021700001602074773011402090856009402204961001302298852000902311655001202320IND60781381920221119172709.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078138192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1100392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenbin10aThermal-induced self-healing bio-based vitrimers: Shape memory, recyclability, degradation, and intrinsic flame retardancy  aThe structure of epoxy resin determines its flammable property, non-reprocessing, unrecyclable, and nondegradable, which limits their application. Thus, a novel disulfide bond-containing dynamic covalent thiol-ene crosslinked epoxy vitrimers (TECEVs) as covalently adaptable networks were synthesized. Also, the structure-property relationship of polymeric compounds was investigated. The insoluble vitrimers networks demonstrated faster stress relaxation with 107 s at 200 °C, and obtained lower activation energy between 70.52 and 110.57 kJ·mol⁻¹. In addition, the dynamic nature of the disulfide bond allowed the damaged TECEVs to be thermal-induced self-repairing and self-healing materials with efficiencies 100% at 160 °C. It was discovered that TECEVs can be reprocessed at 160 °C with the recovery of mechanical strength above 80% and be completely decomposed in an ethanol-acid catalyst solution. Moreover, typical TECEVs can function with excellent flame retardancy and illustrated a high limit oxygen index (LOI, 27.45–28.36%), and UL-94 V-0 rating was achieved. This work could provide an efficient strategy for the synthesis of “biobased self-repairing flame retardant” networks and contribute to the development of high-performance sustainable polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acatalysts 3acrosslinking 3adegradation 3adisulfide bonds 3adisulfides 3aepoxides 3aflame retardants 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3astrength (mechanics) 3astress relaxation 3astructure-activity relationships 0aEpoxy vitrimers 0aSelf-healing 0aRecycling 0aDegradable 0aFlame retardancy1 aXiao, Laihui1 aWang, Yigang1 aHuang, Jinrui1 aLiu, Zengshe1 aChen, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0717-01601 aNie, Xiaoan0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2022 Aug., v. 202 p.110039-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1100393Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010200164520146600266592002801732650001501760650001101775650001801786650001701804650003001821650001501851650002001866650001201886650001301898650000901911700002601920700002101946700003101967700002401998700002302022700002402045773012302069856007502192852000902267655001202276IND60754328520221121212347.0211023e20211017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075432852DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131036372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMertowska, Paulina 12aA Link between Chronic Kidney Disease and Gut Microbiota in Immunological and Nutritional Aspects  aChronic kidney disease (CKD) is generally progressive and irreversible, structural or functional renal impairment for 3 or more months affecting multiple metabolic pathways. Recently, the composition, dynamics, and stability of a patient’s microbiota has been noted to play a significant role during disease onset or progression. Increasing urea concentration during CKD can lead to an acceleration of the process of kidney injury leading to alterations in the intestinal microbiota that can increase the production of gut-derived toxins and alter the intestinal epithelial barrier. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the role of intestinal microbiota and the development of inflammation within the symbiotic and dysbiotic intestinal microbiota showed significant changes in kidney dysfunction. Several recent studies have determined that dietary factors can significantly influence the activation of immune cells and their mediators. Moreover, dietary changes can profoundly affect the balance of gut microbiota. The aim of this review is to present the importance and factors influencing the differentiation of the human microbiota in the progression of kidney diseases, such as CKD, IgA nephropathy, idiopatic nephropathy, and diabetic kidney disease, with particular emphasis on the role of the immune system. Moreover, the effects of nutrients, bioactive compounds on the immune system in development of chronic kidney disease were reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3apatients 3aurea1 aMertowski, Sebastian 1 aWojnicka, Julia 1 aKorona-Głowniak, Izabela 1 aGrywalska, Ewelina 1 aBłażewicz, Anna 1 aZałuska, Wojciech 0 tNutrients.g2021 Oct. 17, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131036373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010100169300001600270520127200286592002801558650002701586650001701613650001801630650002901648650001501677650001301692650001301705651001901718653002301737653002101760653003001781653002901811653001901840653002601859700001801885700001701903700001801920773009501938856008402033852000902117655001202126IND60565765620221119111927.0180911e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056576562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurrant, Daniel10aWater use of the UK thermal electricity generation fleet by 2050: Part 2 quantifying the problem  ap. 859-874.  aThe increasing demand for energy is expected to predominantly be met from a global expansion of water intensive thermal electricity generation. Most countries will in future have less freshwater available when inevitability the cost of thermal generation depends on water availability. A country's future energy costs will directly affect its future global competiveness. Many studies have identified that the solution to the UK's future energy policy's mismatch between thermal generation and freshwater availability is for the UK to make greater use of its seawater resource. The fact the UK with a long learning curve of successful nuclear coastal generation is not progressing coastal generation more enthusiastically raises fundamental policy questions. This paper considers the issues involved. A methodology is developed to assess how the UK's electricity generation portfolio will change in terms of the technologies adopted, and their cost, as access to seawater is varied under Q70 and Q95 freshwater conditions. It was found the emphasis UK energy policy gives to the competing demands of low cost electricity generation and environmental protection will have significant impacts on the cost and make-up of the UK's future electricity generation portfolio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy costs 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental protection 3afreshwater 3alearning 3aseawater 3aUnited Kingdom 0aWater-energy nexus 0aUK energy policy 0aWater resource management 0aWater abstraction reform 0aClimate change 0aPower station cooling1 aQuinn, Andrew1 aChapman, Lee1 aHeaton, Chris0 tEnergy policy.g2017 Sept., v. 108 p.859-874dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006400144245009500208300002000303520159900323592002801922650001801950650001101968650002201979650001602001650002502017650001102042653002202053653003702075653001202112653003702124653002702161653002302188700003702211700006002248700002302308700002002331700002502351700002302376700002302399700001902422700002402441700006102465700002302526773014202549856007902691852000902770655001202779IND60753423320220218000000.0211015e20211004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075342332DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c118672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLudwiczak, Katarzyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7279-466910aHeteroepitaxial Growth of High Optical Quality, Wafer-Scale van der Waals Heterostrucutres  ap. 47904-47911.  aTransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are materials that can exhibit intriguing optical properties like a change of the bandgap from indirect to direct when being thinned down to a monolayer. Well-resolved narrow excitonic resonances can be observed for such monolayers although only for materials of sufficient crystalline quality and so far mostly available in the form of micrometer-sized flakes. A further significant improvement of optical and electrical properties can be achieved by transferring the TMD on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To exploit the full potential of TMDs in future applications, epitaxial techniques have to be developed that not only allow the growth of large-scale, high-quality TMD monolayers but also allow the growth to be performed directly on large-scale epitaxial hBN. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate that MoSe₂ of high optical quality can be directly grown on epitaxial hBN on an entire 2 in. wafer. We developed a combined growth theme for which hBN is first synthesized at high temperature by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and as a second step MoSe₂ is deposited on top by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at much lower temperatures. We show that this structure exhibits excellent optical properties, manifested by narrow excitonic lines in the photoluminescence spectra. Moreover, the material is homogeneous on the area of the whole 2 in. wafer with only ±0.14 meV deviation of excitonic energy. Our mixed growth technique may guide the way for future large-scale production of high quality TMD/hBN heterostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3aenergy 3aphotoluminescence 3atemperature 3avan der Waals forces 3avapors 0alayered materials 0atransition metal dichalcogenides 0aepitaxy 0ametalorganic vapor phase epitaxy 0amolecular beam epitaxy 0aRaman spectroscopy1 aDa̧browska, Aleksandra Krystyna1 aBinder, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0461-77161 aTokarczyk, Mateusz1 aIwański, Jakub1 aKurowska, Bogusława1 aTurczyński, Jakub1 aKowalski, Grzegorz1 aBożek, Rafał1 aStȩpniewski, Roman1 aPacuski, Wojciech1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8329-52781 aWysmołek, Andrzej0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 04, v. 13, no. 40 p.47904-47911dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c118673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01595naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007100171300001600242520060100258592002800859650001600887650001100903650001600914650001400930651001200944653001900956653003200975653001401007653002201021700002001043773009801063856008701161852000901248655001201257IND60564922820221122030012.0180830e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056492282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStenzel, Peter10aConcept and potential of pumped hydro storage in federal waterways  ap. 486-493.  aIn future energy systems with high shares of non-dispatchable renewable generation, the storage of electricity will play a key role.

With the recent changes (in June 2014) in the Spanish regulatory framework, investors' returns might be significantly affected. Further, as the Spanish and the Portuguese electricity systems are integrated, a change in the regulatory framework of Spain might also affect renewable energy policies and investment strategies in Portugal. This study is a projection of business risk under the assumption that the Portuguese government may adopt similar regulatory changes. Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the data under different scenarios. Applying Net Present Value and Real Options approaches, a 50 MW wind power project is evaluated. This study has considered the delay option to study five regulatory scenarios. A higher value for the delay option suggests that a high financial loss is expected if new wind power projects of similar capacity are implemented under the new regulatory framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abusiness enterprises 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3afinancial economics 3arisk 3awind power 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aRisk modeling 0aInvestment modeling 0aRenewable energy business risk 0aRegulation revision 0aRegulation uncertainty 0aIberian market 0aRenewable energy project1 aSoares, Isabel1 aFerreira, Paula0 tRenewable energy.g2016 Sept., v. 95 p.303-313dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01677naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245016000175300001400335520059000349592002800939653002000967653002200987653002801009700002301037700002301060700002401083700002001107700002101127773011801148856008801266852000901354655001201363IND60602458520221122144815.0180711e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060245852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jorganchem.2015.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChmielewska, Ewa10aReaction of benzolactams with triethyl phosphite prompted by phosphoryl chloride affords benzoannulated monophosphonates instead of expected bisphoshonates  ap. 84-91.  aIn contrast to aliphatic lactams, which gave cyclic aminomethylene-gem-bisphosphonates in reaction with triethyl phosphite and phosphoryl chloride, the corresponding benzoannulated lactams usually provide monophosphonates of variable structures, which depend on size of the substrate aliphatic ring.

However, effective co-delivery of therapeutic genes and drugs into target cells and tissues remains a major challenge. In this work, a GSH-responsive cationic fluoropolymer PSSF was designed as a co-delivery platform and synthesized by introducing a perfluorinated chain into a low–molecular weight PEI-based cationic polymer through a disulfide bond. PSSF exhibits good ability for drug and gene loading, as well as fast drug release in a GSH-rich environment. Gene transfection assay revealed that PSSF could deliver both model genes and the p53 gene into tumor cells smoothly with good protein expression, while maintaining good biocompatibility. It was also demonstrated that PSSF could simultaneously deliver the p53 gene and DOX into the HeLa cells efficiently and realize fast release of DOX. In vitro and in vivo anti-tumor assays both demonstrated that the co-delivery system could inhibit tumor growth more effectively than individual gene or drug therapy. Histopathological analysis of major organs indicated negligible systemic toxicity of such synergistic therapy systems. This rationally designed co-delivery vector provides an effective platform for the development of gene–drug synergistic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3adisulfide bonds 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3aneoplasms 3apolymers 3aprotein synthesis 3atoxicity 3atransfection1 aTan, Juan1 aHei, Meng-Wei1 aZhang, Shi-Yong1 aZhang, Ji1 aYu, Xiao-Qi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Feb. 23, v. 10, no. 8 p.1308-1318dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1tb02602j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245013300162300001800295520051000313592002800823650001600851650001300867650001600880650001400896650002300910650002300933650002300956650001000979650002200989650001301011700001301024700001801037700001701055700005501072773013301127856007901260852000901339655001201348IND60632308520221122035554.0190314e20190206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063230852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b002702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wenbo10aLewis Acid-Catalyzed Synthesis of Benzofurans and 4,5,6,7-Tetrahydrobenzofurans from Acrolein Dimer and 1,3-Dicarbonyl Compounds  ap. 2941-2950.  a2,3-Disubstituted benzofurans were synthesized from acrolein dimer and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds by using N-bromosuccinimide as an oxidizing agent.

The present paper deals with the size optimization of Integrated Renewable Energy System (IRES) for a cluster of villages of Uttarakhand state in India. The proposed IRES consists of locally available renewable energy resources of Micro Hydro Power (MHP), biogas, biomass, wind and solar energy in order to meet the electrical and cooking demands of the study area. A system operation strategy has been developed in the paper for size optimization of IRES. Also, the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) has been used as the reliability criteria in order to ensure the continuous supply of power without any failure problems. Further, in order to utilize renewable energy resources in different contributions, four different resource scenarios are considered for the study area. Finally, the total net present cost (NPC) of the considered scenarios has been optimized using discrete harmony search (DHS) algorithm. Among different scenarios, MHP-biogas-biomass-wind-solar-battery based IRES offers the lowest net present cost of INR 49.0309 million at the estimated LCOE of INR 5.47/kWh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acooking 3acost effectiveness 3apower generation 3aprobability 3arural areas 3asolar energy 3avillages 3awater power 3awind 3aIndia 0aRenewable energy 0aNet present cost 0aDiscrete harmony search 0aLevelized cost of energy 0aLoss of power supply probability1 aSaini, R.P.0 tRenewable energy.g2016 Aug., v. 94 p.587-604dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245010600179300001600285520105300301592002801354650005601382650001501438650001701453650003801470650001301508650002001521650001101541650001201552650001701564650001801581650001001599650001301609650001201622650002401634650001201658650003401670650002301704650002801727650001401755650003301769650003801802650002201840650001901862650002801881650001601909650004901925650002401974650003601998650007302034650010602107650003002213650001002243650001702253650002302270650002202293700001702315700001702332700001702349700001602366700001602382700001702398700001602415700001702431700001402448700001902462700001802481773008602499856004802585852000902633655001202642IND50061412220221118062411.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006141222DNAL7 a229364972pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-012-0812-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Tao10aUse of reverse genetics to develop a novel marker porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  ap. 548-555.  aNucleocapsid (N) protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most abundant viral structural protein with high immunogenicity. Previously, the nonessential sequences for virus infectivity were identified at both N and C terminal ends of N protein. Here, by means of reverse genetics, a marker virus (v7APMa) was generated with a mutant N protein that differs from the wild-type strains (vAPRRS, type 2 PRRSV). v7APMa shows stable inheritance in cell culture and the virologic characteristics of the marker virus in vitro showed that v7APMa replicates well as its parental strain. In the pig model, the v7APMa marker virus induced a similar level of anti-N protein antibodies and robust antibodies against the marker peptide, from 14 days post infection. In addition, a peptide-based ELISA was developed to detect the specific antibodies for the introduced 7APMa peptide. This approach, using a rationally designed marker virus, provides a new potential mutant basis for further development of PRRSV novel vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aantibodies 3acell culture 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenetics 3aimmune response 3amodels 3amutants 3anucleocapsid 3apathogenicity 3aswine 3avaccines 3aviruses 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralximmunology 2aAntibody Formation 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCell Line 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aImmunity, Humoral 2aModels, Animal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis 2aNucleocapsid Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPeptidesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPorcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndromeximmunologyxvirology. 2aPorcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virusxgeneticsximmunologyxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aReverse Geneticsxmethods 2aSwine 2aTransfection 2aViral Plaque Assay 2aVirus Replication1 aLi, Xiangrui1 aYao, Huochun1 aWei, Zuzhang1 aTan, Feifei1 aLiu, Runxia1 aSun, Lichang1 aZhang, Rong1 aLi, Wenliang1 aLu, Jiaqi1 aTong, Guangzhi1 aYuan, Shishan0 tVirus genes.g2012 Dec., v. 45, no. 3 p.548-555dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-012-0812-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245006500212300001600277520162500293592002801918650001501946650001401961650003101975650001002006650002502016650002002041650001602061653000902077653000902086653000902095653000802104653000902112653000902121653000702130653000702137653000702144653000802151653000902159653000802168653000802176653000702184653000902191653000802200653000802208653000702216653000802223653000902231653000902240653000802249653002202257653002002279653001802299653001702317653002002334653002202354700001702376700002202393700001802415773009802433856008702531852000902618655001202627IND60564923120221122051739.0180830e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056492312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImperato, Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7840-465X10aSplit fuel injection and Miller cycle in a large-bore engine  ap. 289-297.  aThe upcoming emission legislation for sea-going vessels issued by the international marine organization requires drastic reduction in nitric oxides. A well-known approach for meeting these requirements is to reduce the in-cylinder temperature prior to combustion by using the so-called Miller cycle. However, the mere use of this technique presents the actual limits due to long ignition delay, which occurs when the compression temperature is very low. As a consequence, premixed combustion develops quickly, increasing the local temperature in the combustion chamber and favoring NOx formation. Splitting the fuel injection into a small pilot and a main injection can reduce the magnitude of the premixed combustion and the local in-cylinder temperatures. The work presented here is divided in two parts and is novel by being the first systematic study of split injection combined with Miller cycle in large-bore engines. In its first stage, an extensive study of the injection dwell with two intake valve closings and three timings of the main injection are analyzed. In the second stage, both injection events are shifted later in the power stroke with fixed injection dwell. Overall, the pilot injection reduced the ignition delay but dropped the peak of the premixed combustion only with the most advanced intake valve closing. This improved fuel economy, but provided no advantages as far as emissions are concerned. In addition, while increasing injection dwell reduced NOx emissions, it also increased fuel consumption. The highest achieved NOx reduction was close to 60%, with a small drawback in fuel economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuels 3alaws and regulations 3anitrogen oxides 3atemperature 0a°CA 0aATDC 0aBBDC 0aBDC 0aBMEP 0aBTDC 0aCI 0aCO 0aHR 0aHRR 0aIMEP 0aIVC 0aLTO 0aMI 0aNDIR 0aNOx 0aNTC 0aPI 0aSFC 0aSOMI 0aSOPI 0aTDC 0aLarge-bore engine 0aSplit injection 0aNOx reduction 0aMiller cycle 0aPilot injection 0aDiesel combustion1 aKaario, Ossi1 aSarjovaara, Teemu1 aLarmi, Martti0 tApplied energy.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 162 p.289-297dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245014200163300001600305520138300321592002801704650002101732650002701753650002301780650002101803650002401824650001901848650001701867650001001884650001301894650004201907650001601949650001701965650002601982653002402008653002802032653002102060653002102081700001902102700002002121700001402141700001402155700001702169700001802186773009802204856008602302852000902388655001202397IND60599954020221118002909.0180702e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059995402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yi10aIdentification of Himetobi P virus in the small brown planthopper by deep sequencing and assembly of virus-derived small interfering RNAs  ap. 235-240.  aProfiling and assembly of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) using next-generation sequencing technologies have been very useful for identification and diagnosis of a number of plant and invertebrate viruses. In this work, we have conducted high-throughput pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus), and these analyses unexpectedly showed that the Himetobi P virus (HiPV) was present in our laboratory cultures. HiPV was also found to infect our brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and the white-backed planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera) cultures. The majority of the HiPV-derived siRNAs (Hd-siRNAs) were 21 and 22 nucleotides in length and nearly two-thirds of the siRNAs originated from the HiPV genomic RNA strand. The Hd-siRNAs were evenly distributed across the genome and this indicates that the HiPV genome contributes uniformly to production of Hd-siRNAs. Although HiPV infection appeared to be innocuous to the SBPH, alterations of gene expressions involved in reproduction, cytoskeleton structure and defense responses such as RNA interference pathways (RNAi) genes were observed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that silencing Agronaute 2 in L. striatellus enhanced HiPV accumulation, and this observation provides evidence for the existence of RNAi defenses against HiPV in the SBPH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHimetobi P virus 3aLaodelphax striatellus 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aRNA interference 3aSogatella furcifera 3abioinformatics 3acytoskeleton 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3anucleotides 3areproduction 3asmall interfering RNA 0aTransmitting vector 0aSmall blown planthopper 0aHimetobi P virus 0aRNA interference1 aHuang, Lingzhe1 aWang, Zhencheng1 aFu, Shuai1 aChe, Jing1 aQian, Yajuan1 aZhou, Xueping0 tVirus research.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 179 p.235-240dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013900165300001300304500001500317520143700332592002801769650001501797650002001812650001301832650001401845650002301859650001301882650002101895653000701916653000701923653000801930653003601938653000901974653000901983653000801992653000802000653000802008653000902016653000902025653000702034653001202041653000902053653000902062653000802071653000802079653000902087653001302096653000802109653000802117653001602125653002602141653001702167653001102184653000702195653000802202653001102210653001102221653000702232653000702239653001202246653000802258653000802266700002902274773008902303856008102392852000902473655001202482IND60085881020221123045247.0160901e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008588102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.07.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubáň, Petr10aExhaled breath condensate: Determination of non-volatile compounds and their potential for clinical diagnosis and monitoring. A review  ap. 1-18.  a2019-12-06  aExhaled breath condensate is a promising, non-invasive, diagnostic sample obtained by condensation of exhaled breath. Starting from a historical perspective of early attempts of breath testing towards the contemporary state-of-the-art breath analysis, this review article focuses mainly on the progress in determination of non-volatile compounds in exhaled breath condensate. The mechanisms by which the aerosols/droplets of non-volatile compounds are formed in the airways are discussed with methodological consequences for sampling. Dilution of respiratory droplets is a major problem for correct clinical interpretation of the measured data and there is an urgent need for standardization of EBC. This applies also for collection instrumentation and therefore various commercial and in-house built devices are described and compared with regard to their design, function and collection parameters. The analytical techniques and methods for determination of non-volatile compounds as potential markers of oxidative stress and lung inflammation are scrutinized with an emphasis on method suitability, sensitivity and appropriateness. The relevance of clinical findings for each group of possible non-volatile markers of selected pulmonary diseases and methodological recommendations with emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration that is essential for future development into a fully validated clinical diagnostic tool are given.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonitoring 3ainstrumentation 3aaerosols 3apneumonia 3aanalytical methods 3adroplets 3aoxidative stress 0aPE 0aSI 0aPLS 0aExhaled breath condensate (EBC) 0aPTFE 0aGSSG 0aFDA 0aNMR 0aROS 0a8-IP 0aIons 0aCF 0a5-HPETE 0a3-NT 0a5-LO 0aGSH 0aVOC 0aCOPD 0aProteins 0aCOX 0aPCA 0aMetabolites 0aAnalytical techniques 0acondensation 0aPLS-DA 0aPP 0aALF 0aTNF-α 0aINF-γ 0aLT 0aPG 0aRS–NO 0aBAL 0aEBC1 aForet, F.q(František),0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 805 p.1-18dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.07.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04286naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003500152245009500187300001600282520241300298592002802711650002202739650002002761650001902781650001102800650000902811650001002820650001502830650002102845650002302866650001502889650001802904650001202922650005202934650000902986650001002995650001203005650001403017650001503031651001203046651001403058651001803072653002603090653001503116653001703131653001203148653001403160700003003174700002103204700002603225700002803251700002803279700001903307700002003326700002503346700002203371700002803393773011803421856008803539852000903627655001203636IND60125144120221122231739.0151102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012514412DNAL7 a10.1637/10190-041012-ResNote.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHjulsager, Charlotte Kristiane10aSurveillance for Avian Influenza Viruses in Wild Birds in Denmark and Greenland, 2007–10  ap. 992-998.  aIn Denmark and Greenland, extensive surveillance of avian influenza (AI) viruses in wild bird populations has been conducted from 2007 through 2010. In Denmark, the surveillance consisted of passive surveillance of wild birds found dead or sick across Denmark and active surveillance of apparently healthy live birds in waterfowl reservoirs and along migratory flyways, birds living in proximity to domestic poultry, and hunted game birds. Dead birds were sampled by oropharyngeal swabbing. Healthy live wild birds were captured with nets, traps, or by hand and were sampled by swabbing of the oropharyngeal and cloacal tracts, or swabs were collected from fresh fecal droppings. Hunted game birds were delivered to game-handling establishments, where each bird was sampled by oropharyngeal and cloacal swabbing. During the 2007–10 period, a total of 11,055 wild birds were sampled in Denmark, of which 396 were birds that were found dead. In Greenland, samples were collected mainly from fecal droppings in breeding areas. Samples from 3555 live and apparently healthy wild birds were tested. All swab samples were tested by pan-influenza reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR), and the positive samples were further tested by H5/H7 specific RT-PCRs. H5/H7-positive samples were subjected to hemagglutination cleavage site sequencing for pathotyping. In addition, all RT-PCR–positive samples were subjected to virus isolation, and the virus isolates were subsequently subtyped. In Denmark, low pathogenic (LP) H5 viruses were detected throughout the period, in addition to a few LPAI H7 and several other subtypes. In Greenland, very few samples were positive for AI. None of them were found to be of the H5 or H7 subtypes by RT-PCR. Isolation of these viruses in eggs was unsuccessful; thus, they were not subtyped further. The findings did, however, demonstrate the presence of LPAI viruses in Greenland. For several water bird species overwintering in North America and northwest Europe, respectively, Greenland constitutes a common breeding area. This raises the possibility that viruses could be transmitted to North America via Greenland and vice versa. In Denmark, the screenings for AI showed LPAI viruses to be naturally occurring in the wild bird population, particularly in waterfowl. The occurrence of AI viruses in the wild bird population may pose a risk for AI infections in Danish poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aavian influenza 3abreeding sites 3acloaca 3aeggs 3afeces 3agame birds 3ahemagglutination 3amigratory behavior 3amonitoring 3aoverwintering 3apoultry 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3atraps 3aviruses 3awaterfowl 3awild birds 3aDenmark 3aGreenland 3aNorth America 0aavian influenza virus 0awild birds 0asurveillance 0aDenmark 0aGreenland1 aBreum, Solvej Østergaard1 aTrebbien, Ramona1 aHandberg, Kurt Jensen1 aTherkildsen, Ole Roland1 aMadsen, Jesper Johannes1 aThorup, Kasper1 aBaroch, John A.1 aDeLiberto, Thomas J.1 aLarsen, Lars Erik1 aJørgensen, Poul Henrik0 tAvian diseases.g2012 Dec., v. 56, no. 4s1 p.992-998dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637%2F10190-041012-ResNote.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012900169300001800298520143200316592002801748650002301776650001301799650001301812650000901825650001101834650001901845650001601864650001901880650001001899650001301909650001101922650001601933700001801949700007101967700001902038773013402057856008302191852000902274655001202283IND60731632420221119183154.0220528e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073163242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-020-00728-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Arashdeep10aInfluence of supplementation with pangas protein isolates on textural attributes and sensory acceptability of semolina pasta  ap. 1317-1326.  aSuitability of protein isolates recovered from pangas processing waste was explored for supplementing pasta and influence of supplementation was evaluated on the protein digestibility, textural, morphological and sensory characteristics. Results showed that addition of pangas protein isolates (PPI) significantly (p < 0.05) improves the protein digestibility of pasta from 68.45 to 78.80 g 100 g⁻¹. Protein pasta supplemented with 5.0 g 100 g⁻¹ PPI exhibited highest firmness and toughness values. The microstructure obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a compact, homogeneous and dense network of starch and protein in control pasta whereas non-uniform network of starch and protein was observed in supplemented pasta because of the presence of non-gluten protein in PPI. The PPI incorporation resulted in higher onset (100.74 °C to 117.97 °C), peak (109.34°C to 122.91 °C) and conclusion (115.06°C to 130.64 °C) temperature but, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the enthalpy of gelatinization (2.75 to 2.41 J g⁻¹). A non-significant (p > 0.05) change in the sensory attributes of PPI supplemented pasta was observed. However, intensity of fish flavour increased in the pasta from 1.5 to 4.4 with increased PPI levels. Among different level tested, pasta supplemented with 5.0 g 100 g⁻¹ isolates gave better sensory scores and low fish flavour intensity in pasta.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestible protein 3aenthalpy 3afirmness 3afish 3aflavor 3agelatinization 3ameasurement 3amicrostructure 3apasta 3asemolina 3astarch 3atemperature1 aGupta, Antima1 aSurasani, Vijay Kumar Reddy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3038-34231 aSharma, Savita0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2021 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.1317-1326dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-020-00728-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245020800167300001400375520178300389592002802172650001702200650002602217650001302243650002102256650000902277650002602286650001202312650001602324650001402340650002702354650001302381650001102394650002402405650002902429650003302458650001402491650001602505653005602521653002202577653002102599653002302620653001802643653001902661700001902680700001802699700001602717700001602733700001602749700001702765700001202782700001202794773010402806856008702910852000902997655001203006IND60644222020221119072056.0190726e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064422202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiang, Jun10aSynergistic effect of water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration on rates of fertilization, hatching and deformity of hybrid yellow catfish (Tachysurus fulvidraco♀×Pseudobagrus vachellii♂)  ap. 47-53.  aIn the process of selecting and developing freshwater aquaculture species, yellow catfish (Tachysurus fulvidraco) have received widespread attention from Chinese farmers, fishery scientists and technologists. Achieving full artificial breeding of yellow catfish would help improve the quantity and quality of fingerlings supplied for large-scale production of this species. Temperature (T) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are the most important abiotic factors affecting the breeding efficiency of aquatic organisms. In this study, the synergistic effects of T and DO on fertilization rate (FR, %), hatching rate (HR, %) and deformity rate (DR, %) of hybrid yellow catfish (T. fulvidraco♀ × Pseudobagrus vachellii♂) were studied by central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology. A quadratic regression model for the effects of T and DO on FR, HR and DR was established, and the combination of T and DO was optimized. The first and second order effects of T and DO on FR and HR were significant under the conditions of this experiment (P < 0.05). The first and second order effects of T on DR were significant (P < 0.05) but there was no significant effect of DO on DR (P > 0.05). T and DO had significant interaction effects on FR (P < 0.05). High T and high DO environments reduced FR and HR of yellow catfish eggs and increased DR of the newly hatched larvae. The optimal combination of T and DO was 26.0 °C and 8.3 mgL−1, respectively. Maximum FR and HR coincided with minimal DR whose predicted values were 87.2%, 89.1% and 2.7%, respectively, with reliability of 0.979. Maintaining T and DO in the best combination will help to improve breeding efficiency and ensure production of the highest quantity and quality of fingerlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudobagrus 3aTachysurus fulvidraco 3abreeding 3adissolved oxygen 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afarmers 3afingerlings 3afisheries 3afreshwater aquaculture 3ahatching 3alarvae 3aregression analysis 3areproductive performance 3aresponse surface methodology 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aTachysurus fulvidraco♀×Pseudobagrus vachellii♂ 0aWater temperature 0aDissolved oxygen 0aFertilization rate 0aHatching rate 0aDeformity rate1 aZhong, Chun Yi1 aBao, Jing Wen1 aLiang, Ming1 aLiang, Cong1 aTao, Yi Fan1 aLi, Hong Xia1 aHe, Jie1 aXu, Pao0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2019 July, v. 83 p.47-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03785naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245020300175300001400378520222600392592002802618650001302646650002502659650001002684650002402694650001602718650001702734650001502751650001102766650001802777650002602795650001502821650001302836650002002849650002902869650001602898653001802914653002902932653003502961653002602996700001903022700002103041700001703062700003203079773009003111856008103201852000903282655001203291IND60085881120221123043508.0160901e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008588112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.10.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJourdil, Jean-François10aUltra-fast cyclosporin A quantitation in whole blood by Laser Diode Thermal Desorption – Tandem Mass Spectrometry; comparison with High Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. 80-86.  aIn the last decade the quantitation of immunosuppressive drugs has seen vast improvements in analytical methods, optimizing time, accuracy of analysis and cost. Laser Diode Thermal Desorption (LDTD) coupled to Atmospheric Pressure Chemical ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (APCI-MS/MS) represents a technological breakthrough that removes the chromatographic separation step and thereby significantly increases the analytical throughput for the quantitation of cyclosporin A (CsA) in whole blood for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).A simple protein precipitation step was used prior to depositing 5μL of the extract on a 96-well LazWell™ plate and CsA was quantified by LDTD-APCI-MS/MS.The laser pattern was set to ramp from 0 to 45% laser power within 2s. The APCI parameters were set to negative needle voltage (−2μA), carrier gas temperature (30°C) and air flow rate (3Lmin−1). The negative ion single reaction monitoring transitions for CsA and its internal standard cyclosporin D (CsD) were respectively m/z 1201.1/1088.9 and m/z 1214.8/1102.8; obtained with a collision energy of −40V.The analysis was achieved within 9s from sample to sample.The extraction procedure yielded high recovery (92%; RSD=9.4%, n=6). The lower limit of quantitation was fixed at the first level of calibration: 23.5ngmL−1 (accuracy=112.3%; RSD=9.6%; n=6) and a blank+6 point linear regression up to 965ngmL−1 was used. Using 4 levels of quality control (QC), intra-day assays (n=6) ranged from 93.5 to 95.7% (bias) and from 3.4 to 13.1% (RSD) while inter-day assays (n=6) ranged from 92.9 to 105.3% (bias) and from 4.9 to 7.5% (RSD). An inter-sample contamination of CsA of 2.3% was calculated that was considered negligible with respect to the range of CsA concentrations. Whole blood samples (120) from patients under CsA treatment were analyzed by LDTD-APCI-MS/MS and HPLC–ESI-MS/MS, the gold standard reference method for CsA quantification. Both methods agreed (P≥0.99), with a coefficient of correlation of 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.982–0.991). The Passing–Bablok regression revealed no significant deviation from linearity (Cusum test, P=0.11). This method seems suitable for use in TDM of CsA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aatmospheric pressure 3ablood 3aconfidence interval 3acorrelation 3acyclosporine 3adesorption 3aenergy 3alinear models 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aquality control 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 0aCyclosporin A 0aTandem mass spectrometry 0aLaser diode thermal desorption 0aLiquid chromatography1 aPicard, Pierre1 aMeunier, Cécile1 aAuger, Serge1 aStanke-Labesque, Françoise0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 805 p.80-86dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.10.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245006500177300001300242520095500255592002801210650001401238650001301252650001001265650001101275650001201286650001001298650001201308650001301320651001501333700002301348773012101371856005501492852000901547655001201556IND50064461320221120221334.0130330e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006446132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2005.00042.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Elisabeth,10aPeelability and yield of processing tomatoes by steam or lye  ap. 3-14.  aApproximately 25% of the processed tomatoes grown in California are made into value‐added foods such as whole peeled and diced tomatoes. Peel removal is the first step in this process, and it must be optimized for both quality and yield. The effect of peeling conditions on tomato cultivars Halley 3155 and Heinz 8892 (H 8892) was evaluated. Considerable texture loss results from peeling; however, firmness was greater for cv. Halley 3155 than for cv. H 8892 regardless of peeling conditions utilized. Peeling under low steam pressures (12 psig) was insufficient to adequately peel either cultivar. While high pressure steam (18 psig) was more efficient at peel removal, increasing vacuum level from 20 in. to 24 in. did not improve peelability of either cultivar. Because cultivar affected peelability and yield, specific tomato cultivars should be evaluated and directed to either paste or whole peeled and diced tomatoes as appropriate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3afirmness 3afoods 3apastes 3apeeling 3asteam 3atexture 3atomatoes 3aCalifornia1 aBarrett, Diane M.,0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2006 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.3-14dBlackwell Science Incx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2005.00042.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001700190245012200207300001400329506007600343520127700419592002801696506003701724650002001761650002301781650000901804650001001813650001901823650001201842650002301854650001101877650002601888650001601914650002901930653001701959653001801976653002301994653001202017700002702029700001802056700002002074700002102094773008902115856008302204852000902287655001202296IND60559586520221207120434.0161216e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055958652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.10.0122doi7 aPMC50966532pmcid7 a264775592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabin, Keith10aDynamic membrane depolarization is an early regulator of ependymoglial cell response to spinal cord injury in axolotl  ap. 14-25.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalamanders, such as the Mexican axolotl, are some of the few vertebrates fortunate in their ability to regenerate diverse structures after injury. Unlike mammals they are able to regenerate a fully functional spinal cord after injury. However, the molecular circuitry required to initiate a pro-regenerative response after spinal cord injury is not well understood.To address this question we developed a spinal cord injury model in axolotls and used in vivo imaging of labeled ependymoglial cells to characterize the response of these cells to injury. Using in vivo imaging of ion sensitive dyes we identified that spinal cord injury induces a rapid and dynamic change in the resting membrane potential of ependymoglial cells. Prolonged depolarization of ependymoglial cells after injury inhibits ependymoglial cell proliferation and subsequent axon regeneration. Using transcriptional profiling we identified c-Fos as a key voltage sensitive early response gene that is expressed specifically in the ependymoglial cells after injury. This data establishes that dynamic changes in the membrane potential after injury are essential for regulating the specific spatiotemporal expression of c-Fos that is critical for promoting faithful spinal cord regeneration in axolotl.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal injuries 3acell proliferation 3adyes 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3amammals 3amembrane potential 3amodels 3asalamanders and newts 3aspinal cord 3atranscription (genetics) 0aRegeneration 0aEpendymoglial 0aMembrane potential 0aAxolotl1 aSantos-Ferreira, Tiago1 aEssig, Jaclyn1 aRudasill, Sarah1 aEcheverri, Karen0 tDevelopmental biology.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 408 p.14-25dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009000170300001400260520159600274592002801870650000801898650002101906650001301927650002001940650001501960650000901975650001101984650001701995650001602012650002202028653001602050653001602066653002202082653003302104653002502137700002102162700001302183773010402196856008702300852000902387655001202396IND60644222120221119071913.0190726e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064422212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByun, Seongsu10aAir-conditioning characteristics in nasal cavity models exhibiting nasal cycle states  ap. 60-68.  aThe air-conditioning characteristics in nasal cavity models obtained from two subjects exhibiting different degrees of the nasal cycle states in terms of the airflow partition were investigated using computational fluid dynamics. A constant inspiratory flow rate of approximately 250 mL/s was considered, and the air temperature and relative humidity at the inlet were assumed to be 25 °C and 35%, respectively. The air-conditioning capacities of the congested and decongested sides were assessed by the amounts of epithelial heat and water vapor transferred to the inhaled air through the airway from the nostrils to the end of the septum. The results revealed that the air temperature and relative humidity near the end of the septum, respectively, reached approximately 31.4–32.5 °C and 81.4–88.0% in the decongested sides and 34.0–35.9 °C and 95.3–100% in the congested sides. The differences seen in the air temperatures and relative humidity between the congested and decongested sides were found to be larger in the cavity model that showed a larger degree of reciprocal change in the airflow rate. From a fluid mechanics perspective, while the congested side is in a rest period during the nasal cycle such that a lower amount of airflow is transported through it, this side, in effect, works to provide assistive air-conditioning capacity to the nasal cavity and aids when insufficiently conditioned airflow passes through the decongested side so that the inhaled air merging after the septum can approach the alveolar condition favorably through the nasopharynx.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aair flow 3aair temperature 3aepithelium 3aheat 3amodels 3anasal cavity 3anasopharynx 3arelative humidity 0aNasal cycle 0aTemperature 0aRelative humidity 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aWater vapor transfer1 aChung, Seung-Kyu1 aNa, Yang0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2019 July, v. 83 p.60-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245015700157300001800314500002000332520139700352592002801749650001501777650001601792650002001808650001401828650004301842650002501885650001301910650001901923650001301942650003301955650001401988650002702002650001702029700001202046700001702058700001602075700001902091700002102110700001702131773011402148856007802262852000902340655001202349IND60523299820221121091630.0160610e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052329982DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015013052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Hao10aPreparation of dummy‐imprinted polymers by Pickering emulsion polymerization for the selective determination of seven bisphenols from sediment samples  ap. 2188-2195.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe dummy molecularly imprinted polymers were prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerization. 4,4′‐(1‐Phenylethylidene) bisphenol was selected as the dummy template to avoid the leakage of the target bisphenols. The microsphere particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements, demonstrating that the regular‐shaped and medium‐sized particles (40–70 μm) were obtained with a specific surface area of 355.759 m²/g and a total pore volume of 0.561 cm³/g. The molecular imprinting properties of the particles were evaluated by static adsorption and chromatographic evaluation experiments. The association constant and maximum adsorption amount of bisphenol A were 0.115 mmol/L and 3.327 μmol/g using Scatchard analysis. The microsphere particles were then used as a solid‐phase extraction sorbent for selective extraction of seven bisphenols. The method of dummy molecularly imprinted solid‐phase extraction coupled with high‐performance liquid chromatography and diode array detection was successfully established for the extraction and determination of seven bisphenols from environmental sediment samples with method detection limits of 0.6–1.1 ng/g. Good recoveries (75.5–105.2%) for sediment samples at two spiking levels (500 and 250 ng/g) and reproducibility (RSDs < 7.7%, n = 3) were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abisphenol A 3adetection limit 3aemulsions 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amolecular imprinting 3anitrogen 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asediments 3asolid phase extraction 3asurface area1 aLi, Yun1 aYang, Jiajia1 aSun, Xiaoli1 aHuang, Chaonan1 aZhang, Xiangdong1 aChen, Jiping0 tJournal of separation science.g2016 June, v. 39, no. 11 p.2188-2195dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015013053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04485naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245016200171300001800333520288300351592002803234650002203262650001803284650001003302650002803312650002403340650001103364650001503375650002603390650003003416650001703446650001203463650001503475651001203490651001103502653002603513653002503539653002703564653001503591653001503606653001203621653001103633653001703644700002203661700001903683700001903702700002103721773012003742856008403862852000903946655001203955IND60125144320221122231808.0151102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012514432DNAL7 a10.1637/10192-041012-Reg.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlkhamis, Mohammad10aAlternative Scan-Based Approaches to Identify Space-Time Clusters of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5N1 in Wild Birds in Denmark and Sweden in 2006  ap. 1040-1048.  aThe objective of this study was to demonstrate the effects of the nature of the information collected through passive surveillance on the detection of space-time clusters of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 cases reported among dead wild birds in Denmark and Sweden in 2006. Data included 1469 records (109 cases, 1360 controls) collected during the regional epidemic between February and June by passive surveillance of dead wild birds. Laboratory diagnoses were obtained by PCR methods and/or virus isolation. The nature of available information influences both the type of model suitable for analysis and its parameterization. Here, we explored four alternative scan-based methods, suitable for detection of clusters only when case data (univariate permutation model), case and hypothesized epidemiological variables (multivariate permutation model), case and control data (univariate Bernoulli model), and case, control, and hypothesized epidemiological variables (multivariate Bernoulli model) are available. Tufted ducks were particularly common among infected wild bird species detected in Denmark and Sweden during the initial phases of this epidemic, and species group (tufted ducks [62 cases, 57 controls] vs. other wild bird species [47 cases, 1303 controls]) was considered in the multivariate models as a covariate potentially associated with clustering. Bernoulli and permutation scan analyses both detected multiple significant (P < 0.01) clusters with similar locations, but with certain differences in their numbers and sizes. The observed-to-expected case ratios in the two clusters detected by the multivariate Bernoulli scan model were substantially heterogeneous. However, the permutation model detected only one of the Swedish clusters and only pinpointed the heterogeneity between species on clustering in the same Danish cluster as detected by the Bernoulli model. The output of the methods described here were shown to be highly sensitive to the choice of the probability model for cases and the choice of plausible assumptions to parameterize the scan statistic tests. The results of the multivariate Bernoulli suggest that with noncase information regarding a potential risk factor, such as species of birds, this method is sensitive and efficient in identifying high-risk areas and time periods for regional occurrence of HPAIV and potentially for similar infectious diseases. Results here demonstrate the impact that the nature of the collected information has on the epidemiological investigation of outbreaks. Results show the importance of collecting information on control data and on variables hypothesized to influence disease risk on the identification of periods of time and locations at high risk for the disease and risk factors associated with clustering as part of the national and international surveillance systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3abird diseases 3aducks 3aepidemiological studies 3ainfectious diseases 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3aviruses 3awild birds 3aDenmark 3aSweden 0aspace-time clustering 0aBernoulli scan model 0apermutation scan model 0aHPAIV H5N1 0awild birds 0aDenmark 0aSweden 0asurveillance1 aWilleberg, Preben1 aCarlsson, Ulla1 aCarpenter, Tim1 aPérez, Andrés,0 tAvian diseases.g2012 Dec., v. 56, no. 4s1 p.1040-1048dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637%2F10192-041012-Reg.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015600166300001400322520108900336592002801425650003701453650001701490650002001507650002001527650001101547650001301558650001201571650001801583650002201601650001001623650001401633650003301647650002801680650003701708650001801745700001501763700001501778700001801793773010801811856008601919852000902005655001202014IND60533687020221119182556.0190409e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053368702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlasco, L.10aApplication of 16S-ARDRA and RFLP-PFGE for improved genotypic characterisation of dairy propionibacteria and combination with characteristic phenotypes  ap. 66-71.  aPropionic acid bacteria (PAB) are important for the manufacture of Swiss-type cheeses since they are involved in the formation of eyes and are responsible for the characteristic flavour and aroma of these cheeses. Propionibacterium freudenreichii is most commonly encountered in Swiss-type cheeses and is the sole Propionibacterium species used as a cheese starter. Aspartase activity determined in PAB is strain-dependent and it is important to find a usable way to identify the specific strains involved in cheese making. In this work, 16S-amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used to differentiate 107 PAB strains. Consequently, the presence and persistence of inoculated Propionibacterium starter strains can be monitored during cheese ripening. The studied metabolic features of lactose utilisation, nitrate reductase activity and aspartase activity could not be directly associated with particular genotypes, but principal component analysis (PCA) suggested a linkage between related PFGE patterns and aspartase activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPropionibacterium freudenreichii 3aSwiss cheese 3acheese ripening 3acheese starters 3aflavor 3agenotype 3alactose 3amanufacturing 3anitrate reductase 3aodors 3aphenotype 3aprincipal component analysis 3apropionic acid bacteria 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aribosomal DNA1 aKahala, M.1 aJatila, H.1 aJoutsjoki, V.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2015 Nov., v. 50 p.66-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245011800215300001600333506007600349520066500425592002801090506003701118650001701155650001501172650001101187650002101198650002001219650002101239650001701260650001801277650001801295650001301313650001401326653001101340653002901351653001701380653000801397653003301405653002201438700002201460700003001482700002101512700002101533700002801554700002001582700002901602700002601631773009801657856008601755852000901841655001201850IND60599954320221207114911.0180702e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059995432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0072doi7 aPMC39468572pmcid7 a242463042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouradinha, Bruno10aC1q binding to dengue virus decreases levels of infection and inflammatory molecules transcription in THP-1 cells  ap. 231-234.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDengue virus infection elicits a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease. The mechanisms leading to severe dengue are not known, however it has been reported that the complement system is hyper-activated in severe dengue. Screening of complement proteins demonstrated that C1q, a pattern recognition molecule, can bind directly to dengue virus envelope protein and to whole dengue virus serotype 2. Incubation of dengue virus serotype 2 with C1q prior to infection of THP-1 cells led to decreased virus infectivity and modulation of mRNA expression of immunoregulatory molecules suggesting reduced inflammatory responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDengue virus 3acomplement 3adengue 3adisease severity 3agene expression 3aimmunomodulation 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3apathogenicity 3aproteins 3ascreening 0aDengue 0aDengue hemorrhagic fever 0aDengue fever 0aC1q 0aClassical complement pathway 0aViral persistence1 aMcBurney, Sean P.1 aSoares de Melo, Klecia M.1 aSmith, Amanda P.1 aKrishna, Neel K.1 aBarratt-Boyes, Simon M.1 aEvans, Jared D.1 aNascimento, Eduardo J.M.1 aMarques, Ernesto T.A.0 tVirus research.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 179 p.231-234dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012100172300001400293520100500307592002801312650001801340650001601358650001601374650001201390650001701402650002001419650001901439650001701458650001801475650001301493650002001506650000701526650001201533650002301545650001401568650001101582650001901593773010801612856008601720852000901806655001201815IND60533687120221119182616.0190409e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053368712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnema, Skelte G.14aThe effect of hexametaphosphate addition during milk powder manufacture on the properties of reconstituted skim milk  ap. 58-65.  aSkim milk powders with various levels of sodium hexametaphosphate (NaHMP) were prepared. Reconstituted skim milk samples were prepared from these powders. NaHMP slightly reduced the pH, markedly reduced the serum and ionic calcium and markedly increased the serum phase orthophosphate levels of the milks. This shift in the mineral equilibrium resulted in a drastic reduction in casein micelle integrity, with a marked dissociation of casein from the micelles. κ-Casein was the predominant casein dissociated, although significant levels of αS-casein and β-casein were also transferred to the serum phase. This dissociation of the casein micelles caused a marked decrease in size and scattering properties of the casein micelles. In addition, a small decrease in the zeta potential of the casein micelles in the milk was observed. Heat treatment of the milks with added NaHMP induced further dissociation of κ-casein, although much of the αS-casein and β-casein re-associated with the micelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalphaS-casein 3abeta-casein 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3adissociation 3adried skim milk 3aheat treatment 3akappa-casein 3amanufacturing 3amicelles 3aorthophosphates 3apH 3apowders 3areconstituted milk 3askim milk 3asodium 3azeta potential0 tInternational dairy journal.g2015 Nov., v. 50 p.58-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04036naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013900167300001400306520236200320592002802682650001702710650005602727650002102783650002502804650001502829650001402844650001802858650001602876650005002892650001802942650001402960650005202974650001003026650001403036650002403050650001303074650001503087653005603102653002803158653002903186653002203215700001303237700001303250700001703263700001603280700001903296773009603315856008603411852000903497655001203506IND60599954420221118002535.0180702e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059995442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yang10aAdditive inhibition of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection with the soluble sialoadhesin and CD163 receptors  ap. 85-92.  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important swine disease to the swine industry worldwide. Current PRRS vaccines are only partially effective and new vaccine development faces great challenges. Sialoadhesin (Sn) and CD163 are the two essential receptors for PRRSV infection of porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM). To investigate the feasibility of the soluble viral receptors for PRRS control, in the present study we generated recombinant adenovirus (rAd) expressing the four N-terminal Ig-like domains of porcine Sn (Sn4D), the fifth SRCR domain (SRCR5) or domains 5–9 (SRCR59) of porcine CD163 as porcine Fc (pFc) fusion proteins. Efficient expression of the soluble viral receptors in the rAd-transduced cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting.To detect their antiviral activities, the soluble viral receptors were purified from the media of rAd-transduced cells and identified by Western blotting. The viral binding assay showed that the soluble receptors Sn4D-Fc and SRCR59-Fc, but not SRCR5-Fc and the control pFc, were able to bind to PRRSV particles. The viral infection blocking assays showed that co-treatment of PRRSV with different concentrations of Sn4D-Fc and SRCR59-Fc proteins resulted in a much higher (72.1%–77.6%) reduction in PRRSV-positive cell number than the single protein treatment (45.1%–60.0% or 44.0%–56.2%).To investigate the feasibility of delivering the soluble viral receptors to PAM, two pig cell lines were transduced with rAd-Sn4D-Fc and/or rAd-SRCR59-Fc using a transwell culture system. PAM cells were infected with PRRSV and then co-cultured with the rAd-transduced cells. Viral titration assay showed that co-cultivation of the infected PAM with rAd-Sn4D-Fc- and rAd-SRCR59-Fc-transduced cells resulted in much higher (by ∼3.5log) reduction in the viral titers (TCID50) than that of co-cultivation with the single vector-transduced cells (by ∼1.0log). Further studies showed that the rAd co-delivered soluble receptors Sn4D-Fc and SRCR59-Fc had dose-dependent and temporal antiviral effect against three different PRRSV strains.Since the data presented indicate an additive anti-PRRSV activity between the soluble receptors Sn4D-Fc and SRCR59-Fc, we conclude that the two rAd vectors generated will be useful for development a novel reagent for PRRS control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aWestern blotting 3aantiviral properties 3acell lines 3acoculture 3adose response 3amacrophages 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apork industry 3areceptors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aswine 3atitration 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aviral load 0aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 0aSoluble viral receptors 0aRecombinant adenoviruses 0aAntiviral effects1 aGuo, Rui1 aHe, Shan1 aZhang, Xinyu1 aXia, Xiaoli1 aSun, Huaichang0 tVirus research.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 179 p.85-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245006100202300001800263520096800281592002801249596007501277596005901352596006301411596006301474596010201537596010101639596009501740650003401835650001001869650001801879650001401897650001601911650000901927650001301936700001701949700001501966700001401981700001601995700001802011773013402029856008302163852000902246655001202255IND60731632920221119181512.0220528e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073163292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-020-00733-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shilin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7060-935410aAssessment of milk fat based on signal-to-ground voltage  ap. 1385-1394.  aThis study proposes an electromagnetic method for assessing fat content by measuring the signal-to-ground voltage in milk.

Over the last years, many studies have focused on total and bioaccessible concentrations while few have assessed the bioaccessibility of size-fractionated elements in RD. Therefore, the distribution and bioaccessibility of Fe, Mn, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn in size fractions of RD and roadside soils (<2.5μm, 2.5–10μm and 10–200μm) have been studied using aqua regia extraction and the Simple Bioaccessibility Extraction Test.Concentrations of metals in soils are higher than legislative limits for Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn. Fine fractions appear enriched in Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn, and 2.5–10μm particles are the most enriched. In RD, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn derive primarily from non-exhaust sources, while Zn is found in greater concentrations in the <2.5μm fraction, where it most likely has an industrial origin.Elemental distribution across soils is dependent on land use, with Zn, Ni, Cu and Pb being present in higher concentrations at traffic sites. In addition, Fe, Ni and Cr feature greater bioaccessibility in the two finer fractions, while anthropic metals (Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn) do not.In RD, only Zn has significantly higher bioaccessibility at traffic sites compared to background, and the finest particles are always the most bioaccessible; >90% of Pb, Zn and Cu is bioaccessible in the <2.5μm fraction, while for Mn, Ni, Sb, Fe and Cr, values vary from 76% to 5%. In the 2.5–10μm fraction, the values were 89% for Pb, 67% for Zn and 60% for Cu.These results make the evaluation of the bioaccessibility of size-fractionated particles appear to be a necessity for correct estimation of risk in urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adust 3airon 3aland use 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3apollutants 3arisk 3aroadside soils 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3azinc 0aSBET 0aBioavailability 0aBrake wear 0aHeavy metals 0aPM10 0aNon-exhaust1 aRomè, Chiara1 aAjmone-Marsan, Franco0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 601-602 p.89-98dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.1803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245019700173300001400370520179100384592002802175650001802203650003102221650003102252650001902283650002002302650001402322650001602336650001502352650002502367650001302392650001602405650001302421650001402434650002002448650002002468650004002488650001602528650003702544650001802581650000902599650002202608650001102630650002302641653000802664653000802672653000802680653001402688653003402702653004002736653002602776653002402802653003202826653002102858700002302879700002302902700002402925773009602949856008603045852000903131655001203140IND60599954520221118002451.0180702e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059995452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPane, Jessica A.10aRotavirus acceleration of murine type 1 diabetes is associated with increased MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation by B cells and elevated proinflammatory cytokine expression by T cells  ap. 73-84.  aRotavirus infection has been proposed to enhance progression towards type 1 diabetes in at-risk children. Rhesus monkey rotavirus (RRV) accelerates diabetes onset in non-obese diabetic (NOD) and T cell receptor transgenic NOD8.3 mice. Infected NOD mice show virus spread to pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), induction of a serum T helper 1-biased specific antibody response and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in PLN and islets. Here, we analysed the effects of RRV infection on intestinal responses and the activation of antigen presenting cells (APC), T cells and B cells in PLN, MLN, spleen and islets. Diabetes acceleration by RRV was associated with minimal immune activation in Peyer's patches. Increased proinflammatory cytokine expression by APC, including dendritic cells, was observed exclusively in the PLN, while cytokine expression by T cells was detected in islets, PLN, MLN and spleen. RRV infection of NOD8.3 mice increased IFNγ expression by CD8⁺ T cells, which primarily recognise an islet autoantigen. A peptide corresponding to RRV VP7 amino acids 5–13, with sequence similarity to this islet autoantigen, did not induce activation or proliferation of NOD8.3 mouse T cells. RRV infection of NOD mice elevated B cell MHC I expression in PLN and MLN, and increased the B cell-mediated proliferation of islet antigen-specific CD8⁺ T cells. These studies demonstrate that RRV infection of NOD mice activates APC, T cells and B cells at sites where autoreactive lymphocytes accumulate, in association with proinflammatory cytokine expression and an increased capacity to present antigen. Taken together with previous findings, these data support a possible role for bystander activation in type 1 diabetes acceleration by RRV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aMacaca mulatta 3aPeyer's patches 3aRotavirus 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3aantigen presentation 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3achildren 3acytokines 3adendritic cells 3agene expression 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3alymph nodes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3asequence homology 3aspleen 3atransgenic animals 0aRRV 0aPLN 0aMLN 0aRotavirus 0aNon-obese diabetic (NOD) mice 0aT cell receptor transgenic NOD mice 0aLymphocyte activation 0acytokine expression 0aB cell antigen presentation 0aIGRP autoantigen1 aWebster, Nicole L.1 aZufferey, Christel1 aCoulson, Barbara S.0 tVirus research.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 179 p.73-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154024002200173024001900195040001800214100002000232245009200252300001600344520096700360592002801327650001301355650002301368650001401391650001901405650000901424650003301433650001001466650001201476700002901488700002401517700002701541700002201568700002801590773009101618856008401709990002301793852000901816655001201825IND60083803320221120062927.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008380332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.acthis.2011.03.0102doi7 aPMC31589522pmcid7 a215298982pmid7 aPMC31589522pmcid7 a215298982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrisch, Kayt E.10aQuantification of collagen organization using fractal dimensions and Fourier transforms  ap. 140-144.  aCollagen fibers and fibrils that comprise tendons and ligaments are disrupted or damaged during injury. Fibrillogenesis during healing produces a matrix that is initially quite disorganized, but remodels over time to resemble, but not replicate, the original roughly parallel microstructure. Quantification of these changes is traditionally a laborious and subjective task. In this work we applied two automated techniques, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and fractal dimension analysis (FA) to quantify the organization of collagen fibers or fibrils. Using multi-photon images of collagen fibers obtained from rat ligament we showed that for healing ligaments, FA differentiates more clearly between the different time-points during healing. Using scanning electron microscopy images of overstretched porcine flexor tendon, we showed that combining FFT and FA measures distinguishes the damaged and undamaged groups more clearly than either method separately.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollagen 3afractal dimensions 3aligaments 3amicrostructure 3arats 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aswine 3atendons1 aDuenwald-Kuehl, Sarah E.1 aKobayashi, Hirohito1 aChamberlain, Connie S.1 aLakes, Roderic S.1 aVanderby, Ray, Jr.cJr.0 tActa histochemica.g2012 Feb., v. 114, no. 2 p.140-144dElsevier GmbHx0065-12817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acthis.2011.03.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003000146245015900176520188300335592002802218650001502246650001802261650001002279650002902289650002202318650001402340650001902354650001602373650002402389650002802413650001902441650001402460650001402474650000902488653001702497653003002514653002702544653002802571653001802599700002002617700001702637700002302654700005902677773010102736856008102837852000902918655001202927IND60793180520221120144611.0220920e202302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079318052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2022.1041392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerra-Castelló, Cristina10aHigh pressure processing to control Salmonella in raw pet food without compromising the freshness appearance: The impact of acidulation and frozen storage  aThe trend of feeding dogs and cats with raw pet food claiming health benefits poses health concerns due to the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria. High pressure processing (HPP) allows the non-thermal inactivation of microorganisms, preserving the nutritional characteristics with minimal impact on organoleptic traits of food. The present study aimed to evaluate and model the effect of HPP application (450–750 MPa for 0–7 min) on the inactivation of Salmonella, endogenous microbiota and colour of raw pet food formulated with different concentrations of lactic acid (0–7.2 g/kg) as natural antimicrobial. Additionally, the effect of a subsequent frozen storage of pressurized product was assessed. Salmonella inactivation ranged between 1 and 9 log, depending on the combination of conditions. According to the polynomial model obtained, the effect of pressure was linear, while a quadratic term was also included for holding time (depicting the occurrence of a resistant tail at ca. 4–6 min). The effect of lactic acid was dependent on the pressure level, being most relevant for treatments below 600 MPa. Frozen storage after HPP prevented the pathogen recovery and caused a further Salmonella inactivation enhanced by lactic acid in most of the treatments. Endogenous microbial groups were significantly reduced by HPP to below the detection level in several conditions. In general, little effect of HPP on the instrumental colour parameters was observed, except for a slight increase in lightness, which was hardly appreciable from visual observation. High pressure processing emerges as a relevant technology for the control of Salmonella spp. and to manage the microbiological safety of raw pet food. The mathematical model can be used as decision support tool to design safer raw pet food, while keeping the desired freshness appearance of the products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aacidification 3acolor 3adecision support systems 3afood microbiology 3afreshness 3afrozen storage 3alactic acid 3amathematical models 3amicrobiological quality 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3apet foods 3atail 0aRaw pet food 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure 0aMathematical modelling 0aPredictive microbiology 0aSalmonellosis1 aPossas, Arícia1 aJofré, Anna1 aGarriga, Margarita1 aBover-Cid, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5219-671X0 tFood microbiology.g2023 Feb., v. 109 p.104139-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2022.1041393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245016500165300001600330520143800346592002801784650002301812650000801835650001301843650000901856650002701865650001101892650001001903650003201913650001901945650001201964700001801976700001801994700001802012700001802030700001902048700001702067700002002084773011202104856008802216852000902304655001202313IND4478050720221120063228.0150812e20120511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447805072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Bo10aEffects of dietary non-ionic surfactant and forage to concentrate ratio on bacterial population and fatty acid composition of rumen bacteria and plasma of goats  ap. 167-176.  aThis study was conducted to investigate effects of alkyl polyglycoside (APG) in diets that varied in forage to concentrate ratio (F:C) on ruminal microbial and plasma fatty acid (FA) composition and bacterial population in goats. A 2Ã2 factorial experiment was arranged within a 4Ã4 Latin square design using four wether goats fitted with permanent ruminal fistulae. Treatments included two levels of dietary F:C (40:60 vs. 60:40, on an air dry basis) and APG (no APG vs. 6.5g APG per day per animal). Dietary APG inclusion increased the proportion of iso-14:0 (P=0.03), and decreased the proportions of anteiso-17:0 (P=0.04) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (P=0.04) in solid associated bacteria (SAB), but had no effect on FA in liquid associated bacteria (LAB) or in plasma. In addition, APG decreased (P<0.05) the Ruminococcus albus population. The major effects of APG were independent of F:C ratio. High dietary F:C decreased the proportions of 17:0 (P=0.01) and 9c12c18:2 (P=0.05) in LAB, decreased iso-13:0 (P=0.04) in SAB and 9c12c18:2 (P=0.05) in plasma, increased the proportions of anteiso-13:0 (P=0.04) in LAB, and 17:0 (P=0.0003) and 9c18:1 (P=0.03) in plasma, but had no effect on the ruminal bacterial population. These results indicate that, in both low and high F:C diets, dietary APG alter the FA composition of ruminal bacteria, which further imply a change in function and survival of rumen bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuminococcus albus 3aair 3abacteria 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3aforage 3agoats 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3arumen bacteria 3awethers1 aTan, Zhiliang1 aZeng, Junying1 aTang, Shaoxun1 aTan, Chuanyan1 aZhou, Chuanshe1 aHan, Xuefeng1 aZhong, Rongzhen0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 May 11, v. 173, no. 3-4 p.167-176dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009700167300001600264520130300280592002801583650002201611650002201633650002001655650002001675650001001695650002101705650001201726653000901738653003801747653001201785653001601797653001501813653001601828773011801844856008701962852000902049655001202058IND60125144820221122221750.0151102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012514482DNAL7 a10.1637/10198-041012-Review.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSims, L. D.10aProgress in Control of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and the Future for Eradication  ap. 829-835.  aThree broad factors, occurring concurrently, prevent elimination of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by viruses of the H5N1 subtype (H5N1 HPAI) in countries and subregions where infection has remained endemic. These factors are the nature of the poultry sector, the quality of veterinary and animal production services (both public and private) serving the poultry industry, and the extent and level of commitment at all levels to virus elimination. Most of these countries have developed and adopted programs for progressive control of H5N1 HPAI, focused on the local factors hindering elimination of the viruses. Based on the rate of implementation of these measures over the last 5 to 7 yr (during which time there has been unprecedented financial and technical support from the international donor community), it is not expected that global eradication of H5N1 HPAI viruses can be achieved within the next 10 yr. If the “classical” approach to control, based around early case detection and culling, were adopted in a zone containing millions of free-running ducks, the work load required to complete even the first round of testing would exceed existing capacity. There would be no guarantees of sustained success locally, especially if the viruses are not eradicated regionally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aanimal production 3aavian influenza 3adisease control 3aducks 3apoultry industry 3aviruses 0aH5N1 0ahighly pathogenic avian influenza 0acontrol 0aeradication 0aprevention 0avaccination0 tAvian diseases.g2012 Dec., v. 56, no. 4s1 p.829-835dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637%2F10198-041012-Review.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011300173300001400286520149700300592002801797650002201825650002901847650001501876650000901891650001301900650000901913650001801922650001401940650001801954650001801972650001901990650001802009650001102027650000902038650001702047651002102064653002602085653002302111653001702134653001702151653002802168700001802196700002002214700005702234773010402291856008702395852000902482655001202491IND60582998720221123035559.0171008e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058299872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Soo-kyung10aIdentifying the source of Zn in soils around a Zn smelter using Pb isotope ratios and mineralogical analysis  ap. 66-72.  aThe contribution by anthropogenic sources to abnormally high Zn concentrations in soils with naturally abundant Zn was investigated at a contaminated site surrounding a Zn smelter in eastern Korea. Nineteen soil samples were collected within a 2km radius of the smelter, and analyzed for metal concentrations and Pb isotope ratios using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer and -mass spectrometer, respectively. Higher Zn concentrations in locations closer to the smelter implied that the smelter was the source of the Zn pollution. Lead isotope ratios (206/207Pb) from soil samples assumed to be unaffected by the smelter were higher than those found in the contaminated area, suggesting that the raw materials of Zn concentrates (ZnS, sphalerites) and smelting by-products from the smelter with low 206/207Pb ratios were the anthropogenic Zn source impacting the area. To verify this finding, the mineralogical forms of Zn found in the different soil fractions were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning-electron-microscope energy-dispersive spectrometer analysis, and sulfur element analysis. Since approximately 50% of Zn concentrates have particle sizes less than 0.044 mm, the observation of sphalerites and elevated sulfur concentrations in the finer soil fraction (<0.044mm) provide substantial support to the hypothesis that the deposition of airborne Zn-containing dust from the smelter is responsible for the high Zn concentration in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanthropogenic activities 3abyproducts 3adust 3aisotopes 3alead 3aparticle size 3apollution 3araw materials 3asoil sampling 3asoil separates 3aspectrometers 3asulfur 3azinc 3azinc sulfide 3aKorean Peninsula 0aSource identification 0aZinc contamination 0aZinc smelter 0aLead isotope 0aEnvironmental forensics1 aKwon, Man Jae1 aYang, Jung-seok1 aLee, Seunghak1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7174-22370 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 601-602 p.66-72dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.1813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008000161300001600241520201400257592002802271650001602299650001302315650001402328650002902342650001702371650001502388650001402403650001302417650002702430650001502457650002002472651001602492700002202508700002302530700001902553700002302572700002302595700002402618773012402642856007502766852000902841655001202850IND60523300320221117172908.0160711e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052330032DNAL7 a10.1643/CG-13-1502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevine, Brenna A.10aPopulation Genetics of the Copperhead at Its Most Northeastern Distribution  ap. 448-457.  aPopulation genetic data are an important standard with which to gauge demography and gene flow within and among biodiversity units, and are often gathered on species of conservation concern. Yet an exclusive focus on ‘conservation immediacy' can also have negative consequences. For example, it can shift monitoring efforts away from more abundant and/or widely distributed clades and, by so doing, promote a more myopic approach to conservation and management. A current example concerns North American pitvipers (Viperidae: Crotalinae), within which listed species of Crotalus and Sistrurus receive considerable population genetic attention whereas broadly distributed Agkistrodon is largely overlooked. To address this disparity, we used 22 polymorphic tetra-nucleotide microsatellite loci to explore genetic structure, diversity, and relatedness in a Connecticut population of Copperhead (A. contortrix). Three admixed genetic clusters were identified across five winter dens, with overall and sex-specific relatedness similar among dens and across the population. First- and second-order relationships were identified within the population, then juxtaposed against known den associations. Values for genetic structure, diversity, and effective population size are similar to those reported for populations of North American Crotalus and Sistrurus. However, the study population did not sustain a genetic bottleneck following recent anthropogenic habitat alterations, and this may reflect a potential resilience to environmental change, particularly when compared with North American Crotalus and Sistrurus. Our results underscore the importance of (1) quantifying population-level parameters in non-threatened crotalines so as to broaden and extend our understanding of anthropogenic impacts, and (2) evaluating population genetics in taxa that appear superficially resilient to anthropogenic modifications. The latter may also promote valuable comparative analyses with threatened and endangered taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgkistrodon 3aCrotalus 3aSistrurus 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3ademography 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonitoring 3apopulation size 3aConnecticut1 aSmith, Charles F.1 aDouglas, Marlis R.1 aDavis, Mark A.1 aSchuett, Gordon W.1 aBeaupre, Steven J.1 aDouglas, Michael E.0 tCopeia.g2016 July, v. 104, no. 2 p.448-457dThe American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologistsx0045-85117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1643%2FCG-13-1503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245013700152300002000289500001900309520140800328592002801736650001501764650002401779650001101803650001401814650001101828650001401839650001301853650003001866650003401896650002101930650001601951650001901967650001201986650001501998650001102013650002202024650001402046650002402060700001202084700001402096700001602110700001902126700001402145700001702159773014402176856007402320852000902394655001202403IND60714809920221121114857.0201024e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071480992DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta08114k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qi10aN-Doped carbon coating enhances the bifunctional oxygen reaction activity of CoFe nanoparticles for a highly stable Zn–air battery  ap. 21189-21198.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe construction of a high performance and stable non-precious metal–air-cathode is of great significance for a Zn–air battery (ZAB). Herein, 3D nanosheets consisting of N-doped carbon conglutinated CoFe alloy nanoparticles grown on carbon cloth (CoFe@NC/CC) have been prepared through simple electrodeposition and subsequent thermal decomposition. The cathode showed excellent activity and stability for the bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due to the synergic effect of the CoFe alloy and the N-doped carbon conglutinated structures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the introduction of the N-doped carbon structures can greatly weaken the O₂ adsorption energy on the CoFe alloy nanoparticles, thus enhancing the bifunctional ORR/OER activity of the catalyst. As a binder-less self-supporting electrode, the assembled liquid ZAB showed a high open circuit voltage of 1.469 V, and it could be stably cycled for more than 400 cycles with a charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.77 V at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻², surpassing the performance of Pt/C + RuO₂/C benchmarks and other reported CoFe-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the all-solid-state ZAB was shown to be a battery with good flexibility for wearable electronics, satisfying the requirements of next-generation sustainable active electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectronics 3aelectroplating 3aliquids 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3asynergism 3athermal degradation1 aLiu, Xu1 aXie, Ying1 aSun, Fanfei1 aLiang, Zhijian1 aWang, Lei1 aFu, Honggang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 8, no. 40 p.21189-21198dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta08114k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245016600215300001600381520181100397592002802208650001102236650002202247650000902269650001902278650001302297650001202310650002102322650001402343650001802357650001802375650001102393650001702404650002502421650001102446650001902457651001802476651001102494653001702505653002302522653001702545653002502562653001502587653001902602700006702621700002802688700001602716700002102732700001702753700002702770773010602797856008702903852000902990655001202999IND60582998820221123035605.0171008e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058299882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.1832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Jong, Margje E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4941-832310aIndices of stress and immune function in Arctic barnacle goslings (Branta leucopsis) were impacted by social isolation but not a contaminated grazing environment  ap. 132-141.  aIn many areas around the Arctic remains and spoil heaps of old mines can be found, which have been abandoned after their heydays. Runoff from tailings of these abandoned mines can directly contaminate the local environment with elevated concentrations of trace metals. Few studies have investigated the possible negative effects of contaminants on Arctic terrestrial animals that use these areas. Trace metals can accumulate in animals and this accumulation has been linked to negative effects on fitness. Both, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and/or the immune system have been named as possible underlying causes for these observations. Free-living animals are often exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously, however, and this is often not considered in studies on the effects of contaminants on animal physiology. Here, we performed a study on Spitsbergen (Svalbard) taking both potential effects of trace metal contamination and social stress into account. We investigated experimentally effects of exposure to contaminants from a historic coal mine area on plasma corticosterone levels and on four innate immune parameters (haemolysis, haemagglutination, haptoglobin-like activity and nitric oxide) before and after social isolation in human-raised barnacle goslings (Branta leucopsis). Baseline corticosterone and immune parameters were not affected by mine-exposure. After social isolation, mine goslings tended to show decreased haemagglutination in comparison with control goslings, but we detected no difference in the other measures. Social isolation increased corticosterone and decreased haptoglobin-like activity in all goslings. Immunology and corticosterone levels of barnacle goslings thus seem unaffected, at least on the short term, by Arctic coal mining contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBranta 3aanimal physiology 3acoal 3acorticosterone 3agoslings 3agrazing 3ahemagglutination 3ahemolysis 3aimmune system 3amine tailings 3amining 3anitric oxide 3apsychosocial factors 3arunoff 3atrace elements 3aArctic region 3aNorway 0aHeavy metals 0aNatural antibodies 0aNitric oxide 0aAcute phase proteins 0aComplement 0aCorticosterone1 aScheiber, Isabella B.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3438-18361 aBrink, Nico W. van den,1 aBraun, Anna1 aMatson, Kevin D.1 aKomdeur, J.,1 aLoonen, Maarten J.J.E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 601-602 p.132-141dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.1833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008300170300001800253520143500271592002801706650001101734650001501745650002201760650001401782650001001796650002301806700002701829700002101856700003301877700001901910773011301929856004802042852000902090655001202099IND50060856520221120143340.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006085652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-012-1842-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusse-Valverde, N.10aInfluence of skin maceration time on the proanthocyanidin content of red wines  ap. 1117-1123.  aThis paper studies the influence of different maceration times (5, 10 and 20 days) during the elaboration of Monastrell, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon wines on the proanthocyanidin composition and sensory characteristics of the resulting wines. Significant differences were found between wines elaborated with different maceration times. The different maceration times affected the qualitative and quantitative proanthocyanidin composition of the resulting wines, the total proanthocyanidin content increasing with the maceration time. The percentage of skin-derived proanthocyanidins was always higher than that of seed-derived proanthocyanidins for all the maceration time assayed, although the contribution of seed proanthocyanidins to wine composition increased for the longest maceration time. However, the study also shows that differences exist between wines elaborated with the same maceration time but with different varieties, indicating the importance of two factors, the initial concentration of grape phenolic compounds and their extractability, on the final concentration of wine proanthocyanidins. In this way, the wines obtained from Syrah had the highest proanthocyanidin content compared with the corresponding wines from Cabernet Sauvignon or Monastrell, even though Syrah grapes presented the lowest proanthocyanidin content in skins and similar seed proanthocyanidin content to Cabernet and Monastrell grapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrapes 3amaceration 3aproanthocyanidins 3ared wines 3aseeds 3asensory properties1 aBautista-Ortín, A.

However, solid-state polymer electrolytes still cannot meet the requirements of high mechanical strength, satisfactory ionic conductivity and extended electrochemical window at room temperature. To solve these issues, a novel ionic liquid composite polymer electrolyte (ILCPE) was synthesized via solvent tape-casting technique, consisting of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)-based composite polymer electrolytes, filled with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), Al₂O₃ particles and [BMIM]BF₄. With good fire resistance and excellent mechanical performances, the ILCPE exhibits an improved electrochemical stability window of 5.6 V versus Li/Li⁺ potential, as well as a high ionic conductivity of 5.26 × 10⁻³ S cm⁻¹ at 25 °C. The Li|ILCPE|Li symmetric battery can operate stably for more than 800 h. At 2C rate, Li|ILCPE|LiFePO₄ cell delivered a high specific discharge capacity of 156.5 mA h g⁻¹ and 130 mA h g⁻¹ at 55 °C and 25 °C, respectively, and obtained high capacity retention of 95.5% after 300 charge–discharge cycles at 25 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3afire resistance 3aionic liquids 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3astrength (mechanics)1 aWang, Yanyi1 aMi, Hongwei1 aMa, Dingtao1 aYong, Bo1 aZhang, Peixin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Oct. 13, v. 8, no. 39 p.20593-20603dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta08169h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245011800208300001600326520237200342592002802714650003902742650002602781650001102807650001202818650001902830650002002849650001402869650002002883650001202903650001002915650001102925650002602936650002202962650001902984650002903003650000903032650001903041650001003060651001703070653001903087653001503106653001203121653001803133653001903151700001903170700001903189700001503208773010703223856008703330852000903417655001203426IND60793180920221120144518.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079318092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheron, S.N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8895-946410aExploring farmers' perceptions and lessons learned from the 2015–2018 drought in the Western Cape, South Africa  ap. 208-222.  aThe agricultural sector is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the impacts of climate change. Between 2015 and 2018, the Western Cape Province of South Africa experienced a multi-year severe drought. Projections show that the Western Cape is likely to experience hotter and drier conditions, with more frequent droughts. Without appropriate adaptation actions, climate change is likely to increasingly constrain agricultural activities in the province. Commercial farmers represent a considerable population of decision-makers, which are fundamental to climate change adaptation. Understanding farmers' perceptions is important to develop effective policy, support structures, and communications. This study aimed to understand wheat farmers' and apple producers' perceptions of climate change and adaptation in the Western Cape, South Africa, and establish whether the recent drought offered lessons for adaptation. Study methods included the use of an online questionnaire as well as several in-depth interviews with farmers and producers. Results showed that most farmers and producers agree that climate change is real and is caused by human activities. Most farmers and producers in the region are already actively (or intend to start) preparing for climate change (69%). In response to climate change, apple producers view on-farm water management (such as irrigation management and water recycling) as the most important strategy. Wheat farmers strategies are focused on crop management (including cultivar selection and conservation agriculture). Many farmers and producers further agreed that they had learnt from the past 2015–2018 drought. Notably, results showed that farmers and producers who rely a great deal on weather forecasts were more likely to feel that their farm's response was effective. Furthermore, it was found that farmers and producers who felt they learned from the drought were also more likely to be actively preparing for climate risks. It is recommended that investments into climate change adaptation focus on research and development, particularly with regard to cultivar development, irrigation management, tailored weather forecasting, and localised risk assessments. Policy should prioritise the more vulnerable farmers and producers while focusing on integrated risk reduction measures which account for multiple stressors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aagricultural industry 3aapples 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop management 3acultivars 3adecision making 3adrought 3afarms 3ahumans 3airrigation management 3aissues and policy 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch and development 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3awheat 3aSouth Africa 0aClimate change 0aAdaptation 0aDrought 0aRandom forest 0aRisk reduction1 aArcher, E.R.M.1 aMidgley, S.J.E1 aWalker, S.0 tJournal of rural studies.g2022 Oct., v. 95 p.208-222dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010800176300001800284500001900302520185800321592002802179650002502207650002902232650001702261650002202278650001502300700002302315700006102338700005902399700006002458773012802518856008402646852000902730655001202739IND60740288720221118223310.0210601e20210517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074028872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c054682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeffernick, Justin T.10aPrediction of Protein Complex Structure Using Surface-Induced Dissociation and Cryo-Electron Microscopy  ap. 7596-7605.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA variety of techniques involving the use of mass spectrometry (MS) have been developed to obtain structural information on proteins and protein complexes. One example of these techniques, surface-induced dissociation (SID), has been used to study the oligomeric state and connectivity of protein complexes. Recently, we demonstrated that appearance energies (AE) could be extracted from SID experiments and that they correlate with structural features of specific protein–protein interfaces. While SID AE provides some structural information, the AE data alone are not sufficient to determine the structures of the complexes. For this reason, we sought to supplement the data with computational modeling, through protein–protein docking. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the scoring of structures generated from protein–protein docking could be improved with the inclusion of SID data; however, this work relied on knowledge of the correct tertiary structure and only built full complexes for a few cases. Here, we performed docking using input structures that require less prior knowledge, using homology models, unbound crystal structures, and bound+perturbed crystal structures. Using flexible ensemble docking (to build primarily subcomplexes from an ensemble of backbone structures), the RMSD₁₀₀ of all (15/15) predicted structures using the combined Rosetta, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and SID score was less than 4 Å, compared to only 7/15 without SID and cryo-EM. Symmetric docking (which used symmetry to build full complexes) resulted in predicted structures with RMSD₁₀₀ less than 4 Å for 14/15 cases with experimental data, compared to only 5/15 without SID and cryo-EM. Finally, we also developed a confidence metric for which all (26/26) proteins flagged as high confidence were accurately predicted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acryo-electron microscopy 3adissociation 3amass spectrometry 3aprediction1 aCanfield, Shane M.1 aHarvey, Sophie R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0763-81731 aWysocki, Vicki,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0495-25381 aLindert, Steffen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3976-34730 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 May 17, v. 93, no. 21 p.7596-7605dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c054683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009300168300001600261520101200277592002801289650002401317650001501341650001701356650002801373650003201401650001101433650002401444650003101468650001901499650001101518650001401529650001401543650001501557653002101572653003101593653001501624653001501639653001701654653001401671653001401685653002901699773009101728856008301819852000901902655001201911IND60559587520221120052637.0161216e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055958752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartfeld, Sina10aModeling infectious diseases and host-microbe interactions in gastrointestinal organoids  ap. 262-270.  aAdvances in stem cell research have allowed the development of 3-dimensional (3D) primary cell cultures termed organoid cultures, as they closely mimic the in vivo organization of different cell lineages. Bridging the gap between 2-dimensional (2D) monotypic cancer cell lines and whole organisms, organoids are now widely applied to model development and disease. Organoids hold immense promise for addressing novel questions in host-microbe interactions, infectious diseases and the resulting inflammatory conditions. Researchers have started to use organoids for modeling infection with pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori or Salmonella enteritica, gut-microbiota interactions and inflammatory bowel disease. Future studies will broaden the spectrum of microbes used and continue to establish organoids as a standard model for human host-microbial interactions. Moreover, they will increasingly exploit the unique advantages of organoids, for example to address patient-specific responses to microbes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aSalmonella 3acell culture 3agastrointestinal system 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3apathogens 3astem cells 0aOrganoid culture 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aMicrobiota 0aSalmonella 0aHelicobacter 0aRotavirus 0aNorovirus 0aGastrointestinal disease0 tDevelopmental biology.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 420 p.262-270dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04157naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009500172300001300267520246500280592002802745650001202773650001902785650001902804650002102823650001502844650002202859650002502881650001602906700002602922700002202948700002202970700002502992700002703017700002403044700001903068700002503087700002403112700002203136700002203158700002103180700002003201700001903221700002103240700002503261700002403286700002403310700002503334700002303359700002503382773009103407856008403498852000903582655001203591IND60085882220221122001247.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008588222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2010.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStock, Charles A.10aOn the use of IPCC-class models to assess the impact of climate on Living Marine Resources  ap. 1-27.  aThe study of climate impacts on Living Marine Resources (LMRs) has increased rapidly in recent years with the availability of climate model simulations contributed to the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Collaboration between climate and LMR scientists and shared understanding of critical challenges for such applications are essential for developing robust projections of climate impacts on LMRs. This paper assesses present approaches for generating projections of climate impacts on LMRs using IPCC-class climate models, recommends practices that should be followed for these applications, and identifies priority developments that could improve current projections. Understanding of the climate system and its representation within climate models has progressed to a point where many climate model outputs can now be used effectively to make LMR projections. However, uncertainty in climate model projections (particularly biases and inter-model spread at regional to local scales), coarse climate model resolution, and the uncertainty and potential complexity of the mechanisms underlying the response of LMRs to climate limit the robustness and precision of LMR projections. A variety of techniques including the analysis of multi-model ensembles, bias corrections, and statistical and dynamical downscaling can ameliorate some limitations, though the assumptions underlying these approaches and the sensitivity of results to their application must be assessed for each application. Developments in LMR science that could improve current projections of climate impacts on LMRs include improved understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that link climate and LMRs and better representations of these mechanisms within more holistic LMR models. These developments require a strong baseline of field and laboratory observations including long time series and measurements over the broad range of spatial and temporal scales over which LMRs and climate interact. Priority developments for IPCC-class climate models include improved model accuracy (particularly at regional and local scales), inter-annual to decadal-scale predictions, and the continued development of earth system models capable of simulating the evolution of both the physical climate system and biosphere. Efforts to address these issues should occur in parallel and be informed by the continued application of existing climate and LMR models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3amarine resources 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty1 aAlexander, Michael A.1 aBond, Nicholas A.1 aBrander, Keith M.1 aCheung, William W.L.1 aCurchitser, Enrique N.1 aDelworth, Thomas L.1 aDunne, John P.1 aGriffies, Stephen M.1 aHaltuch, Melissa A.1 aHare, Jonathan A.1 aHollowed, Anne B.1 aLehodey, Patrick1 aLevin, Simon A.1 aLink, Jason S.1 aRose, Kenneth A.1 aRykaczewski, Ryan R.1 aSarmiento, Jorge L.1 aStouffer, Ronald J.1 aSchwing, Franklin B.1 aVecchi, Gabriel A.1 aWerner, Francisco E.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2011 , v. 88, no. 1-4 p.1-27dElsevier Ltdx0079-66117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2010.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001500193245013200208300001400340506007600354520137500430592002801805506003701833650003101870650003401901650000801935650000901943650001001952650002201962650001301984650001701997650002102014650002202035650003002057650002902087653001202116653001302128653000802141653001502149653003402164653000802198700001602206700001702222773009602239856008602335852000902421655001202430IND60599955320221207115114.0180702e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059995532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0172doi7 aPMC40387162pmcid7 a242912882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, B.10aPeripheral immunophenotype and viral promoter variants during the asymptomatic phase of feline immunodeficiency virus infection  ap. 34-43.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats enter a clinically asymptomatic phase during chronic infection. Despite the lack of overt clinical disease, the asymptomatic phase is characterized by persistent immunologic impairment. In the peripheral blood obtained from cats experimentally infected with FIV-C for approximately 5 years, we identified a persistent inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. We cloned and sequenced the FIV-C long terminal repeat containing the viral promoter from cells infected with the inoculating virus and from in vivo-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4 T cells isolated at multiple time points throughout the asymptomatic phase. Relative to the inoculating virus, viral sequences amplified from cells isolated from all of the infected animals demonstrated multiple single nucleotide mutations and a short deletion within the viral U3, R and U5 regions. A transcriptionally inactivating proviral mutation in the U3 promoter AP-1 site was identified at multiple time points from all of the infected animals but not within cell-associated viral RNA. In contrast, no mutations were identified within the sequence of the viral dUTPase gene amplified from PBMC isolated at approximately 5 years post-infection relative to the inoculating sequence. The possible implications of these mutations to viral pathogenesis are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3aRNA 3acats 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3amutation 3apathogenesis 3apromoter regions 3asequence analysis 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 0aLatency 0aPromoter 0aLTR 0aLentivirus 0aFeline immunodeficiency virus 0aFIV1 aHillman, C.1 aMcDonnel, S.0 tVirus research.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 179 p.34-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001900185245007100204300001100275500001100286506007600297520185900373592002802232506003702260650001802297650002002315650001402335650002302349650001502372700001502387700002102402700002102423773015802444856007802602852000902680655001202689IND60515729120221207093835.0160319e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051572912DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-7-662doi7 aPMC29459872pmcid7 a208256822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinkley, Trina10aCorrelates of sedentary behaviours in preschool children: a review  ap. 66.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Sedentary behaviour has been linked with a number of health outcomes. Preschool-aged children spend significant proportions of their day engaged in sedentary behaviours. Research into the correlates of sedentary behaviours in the preschool population is an emerging field, with most research being published since 2002. Reviews on correlates of sedentary behaviours which include preschool children have previously been published; however, none have reported results specific to the preschool population. This paper reviews articles reporting on correlates of sedentary behaviour in preschool children published between 1993 and 2009. METHODS: A literature search was undertaken to identify articles which examined correlates of sedentary behaviours in preschool children. Articles were retrieved and evaluated in 2008 and 2009. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria. From those studies, 63 potential correlates were identified. Television viewing was the most commonly examined sedentary behaviour. Findings from the review suggest that child's sex was not associated with television viewing and had an indeterminate association with sedentary behaviour as measured by accelerometry. Age, body mass index, parental education and race had an indeterminate association with television viewing, and outdoor playtime had no association with television viewing. The remaining 57 potential correlates had been investigated too infrequently to be able to draw robust conclusions about associations. CONCLUSIONS: The correlates of preschool children's sedentary behaviours are multi-dimensional and not well established. Further research is required to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the influences on preschool children's sedentary behaviours to better inform the development of interventions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaccelerometry 3abody mass index 3aeducation 3apreschool children 3atelevision1 aSalmon, Jo1 aOkely, Anthony D1 aTrost, Stewart G0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.66-66dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-7-663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245016400214300001600378520104200394592002801436650001601464650001101480650001401491650002001505650001601525650004301541650003901584650002901623650000801652650004401660653003501704653004401739653001301783653002901796653001101825653002301836653001601859700002101875700002201896700002301918700001901941700005801960773010002018856008702118852000902205655001202214IND60644223220221117211022.0190530e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064422322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshioka, Toshiaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4099-013612aA highly sensitive determination method for acrylamide in beverages, grains, and confectioneries by supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 486-492.  aAcrylamide (AA) analysis is an important topic in food safety. However, it is difficult to rapidly and accurately analyze low concentrations of AA with currently available methods. In the present study, we introduce a highly sensitive method that enables the determination of AA in beverages, grains, and confectioneries by supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SFC/MS/MS). The sensitivity of the SFC/MS/MS technique is 11-times higher than that obtained by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We demonstrated that the highly sensitive SFC/MS/MS method was able to quantify low concentrations of AA in beverages (i.e., roasted barley tea and coffee) extracts at less than 10 µg kg−1 level without solid-phase purification. Furthermore, the simplification of the sample preparation procedure provided an improvement in data acquisition time (60 samples per 12 h). In conclusion, the developed analytical system is a potentially useful tool for practical AA determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3abarley 3abeverages 3adata collection 3afood safety 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asupercritical fluid chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atea 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aAcrylamide (PubChem CID: 6579) 0aAcrylamide-13C3 (PubChem CID: 71308872) 0aQuEChERS 0aHigh-throughput analysis 0aCoffee 0aRoasted barley tea 0aCoffee bean1 aIzumi, Yoshihiro1 aNagatomi, Yasushi1 aMiyamoto, Yasuhisa1 aSuzuki, Kōji,1 aBamba, Takeshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7442-27380 tFood chemistry.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 294 p.486-492dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245012100161300001800282520140400300592002801704650002401732650002501756650002101781650001601802650001701818650002601835650001901861650002101880650001101901650002301912650001101935650000701946650002001953700001901973700005301992700001702045700005602062773014002118856007902258852000902337655001202346IND60600829620221117165112.0180704e20180612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060082962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b062182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Binbin10aConcentration Dependent Effects of Bovine Serum Albumin on Graphene Oxide Colloidal Stability in Aquatic Environment  ap. 7212-7219.  aThe impacts of a model globular protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) on aggregation kinetics of graphene oxide (GO) in aquatic environment were investigated through time-resolved dynamic light scattering at pH 5.5. Aggregation kinetics of GO without BSA as a function of electrolyte concentrations (NaCl, MgCl₂, and CaCl₂) followed the traditional Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory, and the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) was 190, 5.41, and 1.61 mM, respectively. As BSA was present, it affected the GO stability in a concentration dependent manner. At fixed electrolyte concentrations below the CCC values, for example 120 mM NaCl, the attachment efficiency of GO increased from 0.08 to 1, then decreased gradually and finally reached up to zero as BSA concentration increased from 0 to 66.5 mg C/L. The low-concentration BSA depressed GO stability mainly due to electrostatic binding between the positively charged lysine groups of BSA and negatively charged groups of GO, as well as double layer compression effect. With the increase of BSA concentration, more and more BSA molecules were adsorbed on GO, leading to strong steric repulsion which finally predominated and stabilized the GO. These results provided significant information about the concentration dependent effects of natural organic matters on GO stability under environmentally relevant conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abovine serum albumin 3acalcium chloride 3acoagulation 3aelectrolytes 3aenvironmental science 3agraphene oxide 3alight scattering 3alysine 3amagnesium chloride 3amodels 3apH 3asodium chloride1 aZhang, Yinqing1 aChen, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2106-42841 aWang, Kunkun1 aZhu, Lingyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9318-79400 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 June 12, v. 52, no. 13 p.7212-7219dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b062183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245017000207300001800377520154000395592002801935596003801963650002502001650001302026650001002039650001902049650001102068650001302079650001602092650000702108650001502115650002102130700002802151773013402179856008302313852000902396655001202405IND60731634120221119183411.0220528e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073163412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-020-00745-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemircan, Bahar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6983-384X10aEffects of lemon essential oil and ethyl lauroyl arginate on the physico-chemical and mechanical properties of chitosan films for mackerel fillet coating application  ap. 1499-1508.  aIn this study, we aimed to determine the effects of lemon essential oil (LEO) and ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE) on the physico-chemical, mechanical and morphological properties of chitosan (C) films (2%, w/w) for mackerel fillet coating application. The highest film solubility was found as 54.02% in chitosan films incorporated with LAE. Mechanical properties of films were found between 1.90 MPa and 3.32 MPa for tensile strength (TS) and between 16.75% and 32.30% for elongation at break (E). The highest total phenolic content and antioxidant activity was found as 1069.05 µg/g and 39.89% in chitosan film incorporated with LEO, respectively. In general, the physico-chemical properties of the films formed by adding LEO and LAE to the chitosan film solution were improved compared to the films obtained only from chitosan. These film-forming solutions were applied to mackerel fillets as coating materials and their effects on the physico-chemical parameters including pH, color, total dry matter, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content were analyzed during storage at 2 °C for 9 days (0, 3, 6, and 9 days). The highest antioxidant activity was found as 8.59% in fish samples coated with chitosan. It is observed that the coatings applied provide a safer and better storage of the fish. The use of additive-added coatings has more protective effects on quality parameters. LEO was added at 1% (v/v), while LAE was added at 0.1% (w/v) in the chitosan solution and these additives exhibited similar effects on films and fish.  aPublisher supplied data  aFYL-2019-20497cEge Üniversitesi 3aantioxidant activity 3achitosan 3acolor 3aessential oils 3alemons 3amackerel 3ameasurement 3apH 3asolubility 3atensile strength1 aÖzdestan-Ocak, Özgül0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2021 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.1499-1508dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-020-00745-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245019000181300001600371520187300387592002802260650002002288650004702308650001502355650002302370650001102393650002802404650002402432650002602456650001502482650001402497650002602511651001102537653002002548653001602568653001702584653001802601653001702619700002702636700003302663700003302696773015502729856008602884852000902970655001202979IND60523301320221117160347.0160610e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052330132DNAL7 a10.2987/moco-32-02-103-116.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Rojas, Jorge J.10aComparative Field Evaluation of Different Traps for Collecting Adult Phlebotomine Sand Flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in an Endemic Area of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Quintana Roo, Mexico  ap. 103-116.  aPhlebotominae are the vectors of Leishmania parasites. It is important to have available surveillance and collection methods for the sand fly vectors. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate and compare traps for the collection of sand fly species and to analyze trap catches along months and transects. Field evaluations over a year were conducted in an endemic area of leishmaniasis in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. A randomized-block design was implemented in study area with tropical rainforest vegetation. The study design utilized 4 transects with 11 trap types: 1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap with incandescent bulb (CDC-I), 2) CDC light trap with blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (CDC-B), 3) CDC light trap with white LEDs (CDC-W), 4) CDC light trap with red LEDs (CDC-R), 5) CDC light trap with green LEDs (CDC-G), 6) Disney trap, 7) Disney trap with white LEDs, 8) sticky panels, 9) sticky panels with white LEDs, 10) delta-like trap, and 11) delta-like trap with white LEDs. A total of 1,014 specimens of 13 species and 2 genera (Lutzomyia and Brumptomyia) were collected. There were significant differences in the mean number of sand flies caught with the 11 traps; CDC-I was (P = 0.0000) more effective than the other traps. Other traps exhibited the following results: CDC-W (17.46%), CDC-B (15.68%), CDC-G (14.89%), and CDC-R (14.30%). The relative abundance of different species varied according to trap types used, and the CDC-I trap attracted more specimens of the known vectors of Leishmania spp., such as like Lutzomyia cruciata, Lu. shannoni, and Lu. ovallesi. Disney trap captured more specimens of Lu. olmeca olmeca. Based on abundance and number of species, CDC light traps and Disney traps appeared to be good candidates for use in vector surveillance programs in this endemic area of Mexico.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCDC light traps 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aLeishmania 3aLutzomyia cruciata 3aadults 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3aexperimental design 3aincandescent lighting 3amonitoring 3aparasites 3atropical rain forests 3aMexico 0aCDC light traps 0adelta traps 0aDisney traps 0aPhlebotominae 0asticky traps1 aArque-Chunga, Wilfredo1 aFernández Salas, Ildefonso,1 aRebollar-Téllez, Eduardo A.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2016 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.103-116dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Inc.x8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2Fmoco-32-02-103-116.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002400185245014200209300001100351506007600362520195700438592002802395506003702423650002802460650001202488650002602500650002002526650000802546650001102554650001902565650002402584650002502608650001202633650001202645650001002657651001102667700002002678700002102698773015802719856007802877852000902955655001202964IND60515729220221207090816.0160319e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051572922DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-7-672doi7 aPMC29549482pmcid7 a208464552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvador, Emanuel P10aPractice of walking and its association with perceived environment among elderly Brazilians living in a region of low socioeconomic level  ap. 67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was analyze associations between the practice of walking and environmental perception among elderly Brazilians in a region of low socioeconomic level. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 385 elderly people aged 60 years and over. To evaluate walking, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), long version (leisure and transport modules) was used. The environment was evaluated by means of the Neighborhood Environmental Walkability Scale (NEWS) (adapted Brazilian version). For the statistical analysis, multiple logistic regression models were created separately for men and women. The practice of at least 150 minutes a week of walking was the dependent variable, and the variables of environmental perception were the independent variables. All the models were controlled for schooling level and age. RESULTS: The proportion of elderly people active in walking was 56.9% for the men and 26.4% for the women. The perception of the presence of soccer fields (OR = 4.12) and their proximity, within ten minutes' walk from home (OR = 3.43), were associated with the practice of walking among the men. The perception of the presence of public squares (OR = 4.70) and the proximity of primary healthcare units, within ten minutes' walk from home (OR = 3.71), were associated with the practice of walking among the women. An association with adequate perception of vehicle traffic remained at the threshold of significance for the women. CONCLUSION: Accessibility of leisure structures such as football fields and public squares and of health services such as primary healthcare units were important environmental variables associated with the practice of walking among elderly people living in a region of low socioeconomic level in Brazil. These variables need to be taken into consideration when aiming to promote the practice of walking among elderly people living in similar regions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3across-sectional studies 3aelderly 3aenvironmental factors 3ahealth services 3amen 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic status 3atraffic 3awalking 3awomen 3aBrazil1 aReis, Rodrigo S1 aFlorindo, Alex A0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.67-67dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-7-673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012900164300001800293500001900311520194000330592002802270650001402298650002502312650001502337650002402352650002002376650002202396650001902418650001502437650001902452650002002471650001802491650001802509650000902527650001702536650001102553700002402564700005402588700002002642700005602662773012802718856008402846852000902930655001202939IND60740289220221118223526.0210601e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074028922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c003122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yupan10aLabel-Free Multitarget Separation of Particles and Cells under Flow Using Acoustic, Electrophoretic, and Hydrodynamic Forces  ap. 7635-7646.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMultiplex separation of mixed biological samples is essential in a considerable portion of biomedical research and clinical applications. An automated and operator-independent process for the separation of samples is highly sought after. There is a significant unmet need for methods that can perform fractionation of small volumes of multicomponent mixtures. Herein, we design an integrated chip that combines acoustic and electric fields to enable efficient and label-free separation of multiple different cells and particles under flow. To facilitate the connection of multiple sorting mechanisms in tandem, we investigate the electroosmosis (EO)-induced deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) separation in a combined pressure- and DC field-driven flow and exploit the combination of the bipolar electrode (BPE) focusing and surface acoustic wave (SAW) sorting modules. We successfully integrate four sequential microfluidic modules for multitarget separation within a single platform: (i) sorting particles and cells relying on the size and surface charge by adjusting the flow rate and electric field using a DLD array; (ii) alignment of cells or particles within a microfluidic channel by a bipolar electrode; (iii) separation of particles based on compressibility and density by the acoustic force; and (iv) separation of viable and nonviable cells using dielectric properties via the dielectrophoresis (DEP) force. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the sorting of multiple cell and particle types (polystyrene (PS) particles, oil droplets, and viable and nonviable yeast cells) with high efficiency. This integrated microfluidic platform combines multiple functional components and, with its ability to noninvasively sort multiple targeted cells in a label-free manner relying on different properties, is compatible with high-definition imaging, showing great potential in diverse diagnostic and analysis applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanalytical chemistry 3aautomation 3abiomedical research 3acompressibility 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3aelectroosmosis 3aelectrophoresis 3afractionation 3ahydrodynamics 3aoils 3apolystyrenes 3ayeasts1 aChattaraj, Rajarshi1 aRen, Yukun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0167-12741 aJiang, Hongyuan1 aLee, Daeyeon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6679-290X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 May 20, v. 93, no. 21 p.7635-7646dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c003123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010700171300001400278520250100292592002802793650001202821650001602833650001402849650001702863650002002880650001102900650001902911650001802930650001302948650001102961650001102972650001602983651001502999700001803014700001703032700001403049700002703063773009203090856008403182852000903266655001203275IND60085882620221122033446.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008588262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2010.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Walker O.10aSurface layer variability in the Ross Sea, Antarctica as assessed by in situ fluorescence measurements  ap. 28-45.  aPhytoplankton fluorescence, temperature and salinity were measured from December through February using in situ instruments deployed at two locations in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica during the austral summers of three consecutive years (2003–2004, 2004–2005, and 2005–2006) to assess the short-term, seasonal and interannual variations in phytoplankton biomass and oceanographic conditions. The seasonal climatologies of physical forcing variables were also determined from satellite measurements, and the data from the two sites compared to the 2000–2009 mean. In situ fluorometers were deployed at three depths at 77°S, 172.7°E and 77.5°S, 180°. Significant differences between the two sites were consistently observed, confirming the anticipated high level of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Chlorophyll fluorescence was maximal in late December, and generally decreased rapidly to modest levels in January and February. However, during 1year (2003–2004) a secondary bloom was found, with summer maxima being similar to those observed during spring. Fluorescence displayed a strong diel cycle, with strong quenching during periods of maximum irradiance. The magnitude of this reduction was large (the minimum average fluorescence was 25% of the daily mean) and decreased with depth. Fluorescence varied interannually, with the absolute levels and temporal patterns being different among years. The two sites had different temperature/salinity properties as measured at 24m, and both variables changed with time. During 2004–2005 we were able to continuously measure the photosynthetic quantum efficiency of PSII (Fᵥ/Fₘ) at 11m, which revealed a minimum in December, and an increase in January, whereas the absolute fluorescence (Fₒ) decreased simultaneously. We suggest that this reflected a mixing event, whereby available irradiance increased, allowing a short period of growth in a more favorable optical environment. While substantial variations from the mean physical forcing were observed, the linkage of these physical variations with fluorescence was not always clear. Short-term (over 24-h) changes in fluorescence occurred, and were likely related to advective events. Wind events altered fluorescence in the surface layer, and these redistributed phytoplankton in the surface. The variability in chlorophyll fluorescence and physical forcing over a variety of scales in the Ross Sea provides insights into temporal–spatial coupling of phytoplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aequipment 3afluorescence 3alight intensity 3amixing 3aphotosystem II 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aAntarctica1 aAsper, Vernon1 aTozzi, Sasha1 aLiu, Xiao1 aStammerjohn, Sharon E.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2011 , v. 88, no. 1-4 p.28-45dElsevier Ltdx0079-66117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2010.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03856naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245008600201300001800287500001900305500002000324520243700344592002802781596004402809596005402853596006402907650001802971650001402989650001903003650002403022650001403046650001503060700006003075700006003135700006003195773012703255856007903382852000903461655001203470IND60740771420221119212047.0210608e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074077142DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.134732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMocq, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4492-881510aDisentangling the nonlinear effects of habitat complexity on functional responses  ap. 1525-1537.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStructural complexity of habitats modifies trophic interactions by providing refuges and altering predator and prey behaviour. Nonlinear effects on trophic interaction strengths driven by these mechanisms may alter food web dynamics and community structure in response to habitat modifications. However, changes in functional response, the relationship between prey density and feeding rate, along habitat complexity (HC) gradients are little understood. We quantified functional responses along a HC gradient from an entirely unstructured to highly structured habitat in a freshwater system, using dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea) preying on Chaoborus obscuripes larvae. To disentangle mechanisms by which changes in HC affect functional responses, we used two different approaches—a population‐level and a behavioural experiment—applied an information theoretic approach to identify plausible links between HC and functional response parameters, and compared our results to previous studies. Functional response shape did not change, but we found strong evidence for nonlinear dependence of attack rate and handling time on HC in our study. Combined results from both experiments imply that attack rate increased stepwise between the unstructured and structured habitats in line with the threshold hypothesis, because the predators gained better access to the prey. Handling time was lowest at an intermediate HC level in the population‐level experiment while the direct estimate of handling time did not vary with HC in the behavioural experiment. These differences point towards HC‐driven changes in foraging activity and other predator and prey behaviour. Most previous studies reported stepwise decrease in attack rate in line with the threshold hypothesis or no change with increasing HC. Moreover, changes in the handling time parameter with HC appear to be relatively common but not conforming to the threshold hypothesis. Overall, increased HC appears to, respectively, weaken and strengthen trophic links in 2D and 3D predator–prey interactions. We conclude that detailed understanding of HC effects on food webs requires complementary experimental approaches across HC gradients that consider predator foraging strategies and predator and prey behaviour. Such studies can also help guide conservation efforts as addition of structural elements is frequently used for restoration of degraded aquatic habitats.  aPublisher supplied data  aLM2015075cSoWa Research Infrastructure  a14‐29857ScGrantová Agentura České Republiky  a158/2016/PcGrant Agency of the University of South Bohemia 3aAeshna cyanea 3aChaoborus 3aanimal ecology 3acommunity structure 3afood webs 3afreshwater1 aSoukup, Pavel R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8864-95301 aNäslund, Joacim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1091-22251 aBoukal, David S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8181-74580 tjournal of animal ecology.g2021 June, v. 90, no. 6 p.1525-1537dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.134733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245018100167300001800348500001900366520157800385592002801963650002501991650001402016650001102030650002102041650001902062650001602081650000902097650001502106650001702121700001302138700001402151700001702165700005202182700001302234700001802247700001402265700005102279773012802330856008402458852000902542655001202551IND60740289320221118223003.0210601e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074028932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c003422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chenchen10aFacile Electrochemical Microbiosensor Based on In Situ Self-Assembly of Ag Nanoparticles Coated on Ti₃C₂Tₓ for In Vivo Measurements of Chloride Ions in the PD Mouse Brain  ap. 7647-7656.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChloride ion (Cl–), one of the most important anions in the brain, has been confirmed to participate in the pathological process of Parkinson’s disease (PD). As such, the development of a reliable method for in vivo measurements of Cl– is extremely appealing, especially for understanding the pathogenesis of PD. We herein designed a facile electrochemical microbiosensor (ECMB), based on in situ self-assembly of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) coated on Ti₃C₂Tₓ. The uniform nanosized Ag NPs were reduced by Ti₃C₂Tₓ by a simple dipping process, endowing the ECMB with excellent specificity toward Cl– detection and remarkably reproducible preparation process. Meanwhile, electro-oxidized graphene oxide was introduced as an inner reference, thus avoiding the environmental interference of the complicated brain systems to increase the determination accuracy. An extensive in vitro study revealed that the proposed ECMB would be a robust candidate for real-time monitoring of Cl– in the PD mouse brain with high selectivity, accuracy, and reproducibility. Moreover, the availability and reliability toward in vivo Cl– monitoring of the designed ECMB were well confirmed by comparing with the standard Volhard’s method. Finally, by virtue of the successful employment of the developed detecting platform in the in vivo measurement of Cl– in the PD mouse brain, systematic analysis and comparison of the average levels of Cl– in the three regions including cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of brains from normal and PD model mice have been achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3achlorides 3acortex 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene oxide 3ahippocampus 3amice 3ananosilver 3apathogenesis1 aZhuo, Yi1 aXiao, Xia1 aLi, Shuangfu1 aHan, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7713-29661 aLu, Ming1 aZhang, Jiaxin1 aChen, Shu1 aGu, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2964-35310 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 May 20, v. 93, no. 21 p.7647-7656dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c003423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010500170300001600275520102000291592002801311650002101339650002301360650001101383650001401394650001201408650001101420650001401431650002101445650001501466650002301481650002001504653002101524653001301545653001501558653003401573700002101607700002201628700001901650700001601669773015501685856008601840852000901926655001201935IND60523301620221117160323.0160610e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052330162DNAL7 a10.2987/moco-32-02-163-166.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamelio, Kinsey10aEvaluation of Three Commercial Handheld Ultra-Low-Volume Foggers with Aqualure® 20-20 Against Adult  ap. 163-166.  aThe Anastasia Mosquito Control District (AMCD) tests all equipment before field use to determine if machines are suitable for the needs of the district. Three handheld ultra-low-volume (ULV) foggers—the American LongRay (ULV) Fogger Model 3600B with rechargeable lithium battery (DC model), American LongRay ULV Fogger Model 3600E with 110V or 220V AC power (AC model), and Boston Fog Battery Motorized Fogger (Boston Fogger)—were compared to determine which fogger would be most suitable for use by AMCD. Mortality of caged Aedes albopictus was analyzed after 24 h to determine the success of a single application. All 3 foggers resulted in 100% mortality after 24 h using the insecticide Aqualuer 20-20 (active ingredients permethrin 20.6% and piperonyl butoxide 20.6%) 1:5 dilution with reverse osmosis water. Based on operator safety, robustness, and operational performance, the American LongRay DC model was found to be the most suitable at administering Aqualuer 20-20 against caged adult Ae. albopictus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3aactive ingredients 3aadults 3abatteries 3alithium 3amodels 3amortality 3amosquito control 3apermethrin 3apiperonyl butoxide 3areverse osmosis 0aAedes albopictus 0aAqualuer 0apermethrin 0aultra-low-volume (ULV) fogger1 aGibson, Jennifer1 aSmith, Michael L.1 aDrake, Lisa L.1 aXue, Rui-De0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2016 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.163-166dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Inc.x8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2Fmoco-32-02-163-166.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002500185245013500210300001100345506007600356520197000432592002802402506003702430650002202467650001102489650002202500650001902522650002202541650001502563650001802578650001202596650002802608650001602636651001302652651001202665700002402677700002202701773015802723856007802881852000902959655001202968IND60515729420221207093958.0160319e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051572942DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-7-692doi7 aPMC29549502pmcid7 a208685032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrukowski, Rebecca A10aDifferences in home food availability of high- and low-fat foods after a behavioral weight control program are regional not racial  ap. 69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Few studies, if any, have examined the impact of a weight control program on the home food environment in a diverse sample of adults. Understanding and changing the availability of certain foods in the home and food storage practices may be important for creating healthier home food environments and supporting effective weight management. METHODS: Overweight adults (n = 90; 27% African American) enrolled in a 6-month behavioral weight loss program in Vermont and Arkansas. Participants were weighed and completed measures of household food availability and food storage practices at baseline and post-treatment. We examined baseline differences and changes in high-fat food availability, low-fat food availability and the storage of foods in easily visible locations, overall and by race (African American or white participants) and region (Arkansas or Vermont). RESULTS: At post-treatment, the sample as a whole reported storing significantly fewer foods in visible locations around the house (-0.5 ± 2.3 foods), with no significant group differences. Both Arkansas African Americans (-1.8 ± 2.4 foods) and Arkansas white participants (-1.8 ± 2.6 foods) reported significantly greater reductions in the mean number of high-fat food items available in their homes post-treatment compared to Vermont white participants (-0.5 ± 1.3 foods), likely reflecting fewer high-fat foods reported in Vermont households at baseline. Arkansas African Americans lost significantly less weight (-3.6 ± 4.1 kg) than Vermont white participants (-8.3 ± 6.8 kg), while Arkansas white participants did not differ significantly from either group in weight loss (-6.2 ± 6.0 kg). However, home food environment changes were not associated with weight changes in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the home food environment and how best to measure it may be useful for both obesity treatment and understanding patterns of obesity prevalence and health disparity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aadults 3afood availability 3ahigh fat foods 3ahome food storage 3ahouseholds 3alow fat foods 3aobesity 3aweight control programs 3aweight loss 3aArkansas 3aVermont1 aHarvey-Berino, Jean1 aWest, Delia Smith0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.69-69dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-7-693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011100210500001900321520164100340592002801981650002002009650001102029650001002040650001502050650001102065650001202076650001602088650000902104650001502113653003402128653001602162653002002178653002702198653002102225773009002246856008502336852000902421655001202430IND60722799920221118222118.0210226e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072279992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1196912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, Sohail R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6882-973712aA machine learning approach for modeling irregular regions with multiple owners in wind farm layout design  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWind farm development projects require a detailed survey of the eligible land. The land selected is often segmented into different region, each owned by different landowners with different land pricing. These regions are often complex shaped with irregular boundaries. Therefore, an efficient method for numerically modeling such irregular domains is needed. This work uses support vector data description (SVDD) to generate an analytical, continuous description of the irregular regions. Whereas other methods typically work well for modeling convex domains, the SVDD approach can be used to model irregular regions as a spherical boundary using various kernel mapping. It was demonstrated that the SVDD approach can be used to model any number of complex regions. An error analysis showed that the SVDD approach can construct accurate descriptions using a relatively small data set. The applicability of SVDD method in wind farm layout optimization is also demonstrated. The wind farm optimization study considered that the terrain is divided into several regions each owned by a different owner offering the land at a different price. Two different methods for considering the cost of the land are presented. The differences in optimal farm layouts using the two land cost models were also presented. In each case, the optimized wind farm layouts resulted in lower cost-of-energy relative to the reference wind farm. It was shown that the SVDD approach can also be used to restrict the placement of wind turbines in infeasible/restricted regions. The library for support vector data description was also made available to the public.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenergy 3afarms 3alandscapes 3aprices 3asurveys 3avector data 3awind 3awind farms 0aWind farm layout optimization 0aWind energy 0aComplex terrain 0aSupport vector machine 0aMachine learning0 tEnergy.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 220 p.119691-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1196913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245007300207300001800280520124000298592002801538650002301566650001101589650001001600650001301610650002201623650003001645650001301675700002501688700002401713700002101737700002201758700002301780773013301803856007901936852000902015655001202024IND60632305520190426000000.0190314e20190130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063230552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b030532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJasiak, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0122-132610aSolvent-Free Michaelis–Arbuzov Rearrangement under Flow Conditions  ap. 2619-2625.  aThe first solvent- and catalyst-free procedure for the Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction under flow conditions was developed. A variety of alkylphosphonic esters could be obtained using this protocol starting from the corresponding trialkyl phosphites and even catalytic amounts of alkyl halides with very short reaction times (8.33–50 min) and excellent conversions. In general, this protocol works effectively when the alkyl halide is used in catalytic amounts as low as 5–10% only if it concerns the synthesis of homo alkylphosphonates. One equivalent and an excess of alkyl halides should be used in the reaction with alkyl phosphite if the alkyl group of the selected substrates differ. Thus, it provides a sustainable, fast alternative to the existing methods for the preparation of alkylphosphonates. The isolation of the reaction products is straightforward due to the lack of solvents and a high purity of the obtained products (conv ≥ 99%), and notably, in the catalytic procedures there are only traces of alkyl halides formed after the reaction is complete. The reactions conducted using a glass microreactor chip with an internal volume of 250 μL allow the production of 1.6–1.95 g of organophosphorus esters per hour.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aesters 3aglass 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic halogen compounds 3asolvents1 aMielniczak, Grażyna1 aOwsianik, Krzysztof1 aKoprowski, Marek1 aKrasowska, Dorota1 aDrabowicz, Józef,0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Jan. 30, v. 84, no. 5 p.2619-2625dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b030533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245012700185300001600312520149800328592002801826650002101854650002301875650001901898650000901917650002201926650003801948650001001986650001801996650001602014650001402030650001902044650001402063650001502077650001202092650004402104650001102148650006002159650005402219650005902273650001102332650001102343650001402354650002102368650005202389650003002441650001402471650007702485650001402562650002902576650002402605650003202629650003002661700001902691700001602710700001902726700001902745773010202764856008402866852000902950655001202959IND50058847820221119044027.0141111e20121123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005884782DNAL7 a227708892pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByrem, T.M.10aPerformance of a commercial serum ELISA for the detection of antibodies to Neospora caninum in whole and skim milk samples  ap. 249-253.  aControl of Neospora caninum infection in cattle depends on specific, ante-mortem detection of infected animals and limiting their use as breeding stock or by culling. The objective of the present study was to determine appropriate cut-off values and diagnostic performance of a milk ELISA test using whole and skim milk in a commercial serum ELISA test (IDEXX Neospora Ab). Serum and milk samples were obtained from a total of 475 lactating cows from two herds with and two herds without a previous history of N. caninum-associated abortion. Overall seroprevalence determined by the ELISA was 18.3%. Compared to serum ELISA values, correlation and overall performance assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis was higher when either whole or skim milk samples were diluted 1:2 compared to undiluted or 1:5 diluted samples. Diagnostic performance for analysis of whole and skim milk was compared at cut-off values that achieved a desired operating characteristic of at least 95% specificity. For whole milk diluted 1:2 and a cut-off of 0.14 (S/P ratio), sensitivity and kappa values were 74.7% (95% CI 64.3–83.4) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.61–0.78), respectively. For skim milk diluted 1:2 and a cut-off of 0.30, sensitivity and kappa values were 77.0% (95% CI 66.8–85.4) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.64–0.80), respectively. Using the selected cut-offs, the IDEXX Neospora Ab Test is equally suited for the analysis of whole and skim milk as a screening tool in neosporosis control programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeospora caninum 3aantibody detection 3abreeding stock 3acows 3adisease diagnosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherds 3amilk analysis 3aneosporosis 3ascreening 3aseroprevalence 3askim milk 3awhole milk 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxanalysisxblood. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aCoccidiosisxdiagnosisxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethodsxstandards. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLactation 2aMilkximmunology 2aNeosporaximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Parasiticxdiagnosisxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aROC Curve 2aReagent Kits, Diagnostic 2aReference Standards 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies1 aBartlett, P.C.1 aDonohue, H.1 aVoisinet, B.D.1 aHouseman, J.T.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2012 Nov. 23, v. 190, no. 1-2 p.249-253dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010000158300001800258520146900276592002801745650002001773650001001793650002101803650001801824650001601842650003101858650001101889650001901900650001301919650001101932650001601943700001501959700001401974700001601988700001502004700001802019700001702037700002002054773014202074856007502216852000902291655001202300IND60768136020221119211209.0220225e20220222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076813602DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta10097a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Chenghao12aA highly temperature- and pressure-sensitive soft sensor self-powered by a galvanic cell design  ap. 4408-4417.  aAs mimics of human skin, soft sensors have profound implications for wearable electronics, biomedical diagnosis and environmental monitoring. However, the applications of soft electronic devices or soft sensors are limited by the integration of bulky external power supplies and low response sensitivity. Here, we report the use of water-saturated Ni²⁺- and Zn²⁺-containing elastomers consisting of interpenetrated carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber (XNBR)/poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) networks and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electrolytes for assembling a self-powered polymeric soft sensor. The hydrophilic PDMA phases segregated by the XNBR phases in the polymer matrix acted as highly pressure-sensitive conductive paths, while the Arrhenius relationship between current density and temperature enabled a soft sensor with excellent temperature sensitivity. It can be used for the contactless detection of tiny temperature fluctuations and identification of sophisticated and tiny differences in human pronunciation and blood pulses. We also demonstrated the integration of the soft sensor arrays as an artificial skin for real-time monitoring of the variation in spatial distribution of pressure. The pixel-like sensor (5 × 5 mm²) had a maximum power consumption of only ∼5 μW. Our work provides new concepts and ideas for the fabrication of next-generation self-powered sensing devices for use in soft biomedical and wearable applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial skin 3ablood 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarboxylation 3aelectronics 3aenergy use and consumption 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3apolymers 3arubber 3atemperature1 aChen, Huan1 aWang, Lei1 aLiu, Yongqi1 aYin, Qiyan1 aJiang, Jintao1 aZhou, Qiyang1 aWeng, Gengsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 8 p.4408-4417dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta10097a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245020600165300001600371520164100387592002802028650001902056650001302075650001302088650001102101650001302112650001002125650002502135650001102160650001702171650002102188650001802209650001702227650001302244650001202257650001302269650001902282653001302301653003302314653003302347653003002380653002702410653002902437700001602466700001602482700001702498700001902515700001602534773010802550856008602658852000902744655001202753IND60525349620221122222318.0190318e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052534962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.03.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinyu12aA comparative study on the efficiency of chitosan-N-acetylcysteine, chitosan oligosaccharides or carboxymethyl chitosan surface modified nanostructured lipid carrier for ophthalmic delivery of curcumin  ap. 435-444.  aTo develop a potential nanocarrier for the topical ocular administration of curcumin (CUR), a novel thiolated chitosan was synthesized by the covalent binding between N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and chitosan (CS) to surface modify the nanostructured lipid carrier loaded CUR (CUR-NLC). And the superiorities of the CS-NAC co polymer coated CUR-NLC over chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) or carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) modification were also verified in detail. As expected, the increment in particle size and the reversal of zeta potential occurred after surface decorating, and the most prominent electropositivity was obtained for the CS-NAC-CUR-NLC group. Additionally, the utilization of the CS-NAC coating demonstrated an effectively controlled release over 72h and attained a 6.4 and 18.8 fold increase in apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) compared with the CUR-NLC and the self-made eye drops, respectively. Meanwhile, the clearance rate of the NLC labeled with Rhodamine B was significantly delayed in the presence of CS-NAC. By contrast, CS-NAC-CUR-NLC was superior to the COS and CMCS coated ones in view of in vitro release, drug permeability and corneal retention. Moreover, the results of the in-vivo and in-vitro characteristics demonstrated that the promoting effect of CMCS coating was relatively weaker than COS coated ones. Ocular irritation test was executed on the CS-NAC-CUR-NLC, neither a sign of toxicity nor irritation to the external ocular tissues was observed. In conclusion, CS-NAC-CUR-NLC possesses a greater potential as an ocular drug-delivery system comparing with the COS-CUR-NLC and CMCS-CUR-NLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcysteine 3achitosan 3acoatings 3acornea 3acurcumin 3adrugs 3aeye irritation tests 3alipids 3ananocarriers 3aoligosaccharides 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3apolymers 3atissues 3atoxicity 3azeta potential 0aCurcumin 0aChitosan-N-acetyl-l-cysteine 0aNanostructured lipid carrier 0aChitosan oligosaccharides 0aCarboxymethyl chitosan 0aOphthalmic drug delivery1 aLiu, Dandan1 aTan, Guoxin1 aZhao, Zhinan1 aYang, Xinggang1 aPan, Weisan0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 146 p.435-444dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.03.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245012600177520213000303592002802433650002302461650001602484650001202500650001102512650001502523650001102538650002102549650002102570650002502591650002002616650002302636650001202659650001502671650001602686650002602702650001502728650002402743650001302767650002202780653002302802653001502825653002802840653002202868653002202890700002202912700002402934700002202958773011602980856008403096961001303180852000903193655001203202IND60684466320221117214808.0200405e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068446632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1060912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnapalli, Saseendran S.10aQuantifying evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) using an eddy covariance approach  aAccurate quantification of consumptive water requirements (ETc, evapotranspiration) of cropping systems is a critical prerequisite for sustainable irrigation water management applications. For applying the ETc for irrigation scheduling across soils and climates other than the location in which it was measured, it is also critical to develop crop coefficients (Kc) that link a reference crop evapotranspiration computed from local weather data to ETc. A systematic study for deriving Kc for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) - representing its growth stages from planting to harvest - in humid climates is lacking in the literature. In this study, we used an eddy covariance (EC) method to quantify ETc from irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in a 250 ha field with a Tunica clay soil, in 2017 and 2018. In the EC experiment, an open-path infrared gas analyzer and a sonic 3-D anemometer were deployed in the constant flux layer above the cotton canopy for collecting crop-canopy water flux data. Using the measured ETc, Kc were derived for alfalfa (Kcᵣ) and grass (Kcₒ) reference crop ET computed from weather data. Cotton cv. Delta Pine Land 1522 was planted in the first week of May and harvested in the second week of September in both the years. Lint yield was 1269 kg ha⁻¹ in 2017 and 1569 kg ha⁻¹ in 2018. Measured monthly averaged daily ETc ranged between 2.5 mm in May/September to 4 mm in July in 2017, and between 2.9 mm in May and 4.4 mm in August in 2018. Maximum daily ETc in 2017 and 2018 crop seasons were 5.6 and 6.7 mm, respectively. Seasonal total ETc was 367 mm and 439 mm (on average 402 mm), respectively. Alfalfa (ETᵣ) and grass reference crop ET (ETₒ) computed were 664 and 546 mm, respectively. Averaged across the two years, average daily Kcᵣ ranged between 0.45 in May to 0.80 in August, and Kcₒ ranged from 0.54 in May and 0.99 in August. On average, seasonal ETᵣ was 18 % more than ETₒ. Seasonal ETᵣ and ETₒ were, respectively, 39 % and 22 % more than ETc. The Kc data developed will be useful for irrigation scheduling in cotton grown in similar climates and soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aPetrorhagia 3aalfalfa 3acanopy 3aclay soils 3acotton 3acrop coefficient 3acropping systems 3adevelopmental stages 3aeddy covariance 3aevapotranspiration 3agrasses 3aharvesting 3ahumid zones 3airrigation scheduling 3alint yield 3ameteorological data 3aplanting 3awater requirement 0aEvapotranspiration 0aIrrigation 0aCrop water requirements 0aCrop coefficients 0aReference crop ET1 aFisher, Daniel K.1 aPinnamaneni, S.

Nineteen experts participated in the conjoint analysis. The sample comprised researchers and practitioners with local knowledge of grassy ecosystems. The survey involved repeated pairwise ranking of the relevance of attributes of seven ecological criteria. The relative weightings of the attributes were then used to generate the 50 top‐ranked species for each of the three scenarios. Overall phosphorus tolerance was considered the most important criterion, followed by grazing tolerance. Species favoured for high‐level conservation management included nutrient‐ and grazing‐intolerant plants with narrower distributions and some species of threatened status. The two scenarios with histories of fertilization and varying levels of ongoing grazing were most similar in that their lists were dominated by graminoids and did not contain any shrubs or geophytes. The ranking of species provides an initial list that could be tailored to take into account specific site conditions and additional knowledge of species. This approach to the selection of species shows promise as either a repeatable process to select species for particular sites, or to generate a classification of species that could be used generically for a small number of common situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aexperts 3ageophytes 3agraminoids 3agrasses 3agrazing 3aindigenous species 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3aplant ecology 3aresearchers 3aselection criteria 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3athreatened species 3awoodlands1 aMcIntyre, Sue0 tAustral ecology.g2014 Dec., v. 39, no. 8 p.907-917dBlackwell Science Asiax1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.121563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002500158245015900183300001600342520152200358592002801880650001001908650002001918650002201938650001501960650001601975650003001991650002802021650000902049653001002058653002302068653001302091653000802104653001602112653001602128653001102144653000802155653001002163653000902173653000902182653000802191653000702199653000802206653000802214653001002222653000802232700001602240700002002256700001502276700002002291700001802311700001602329700001902345700001602364700001202380700001902392700005702411773010202468856009302570852000902663655001202672IND60781379520221119172608.0220726e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078137952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhatayeva, Zhanerke10aNewly reported 90-bp deletion within the ovine BMPRIB gene: Does it widely distribute, link to the famous FecB (p.Q249R) mutation, and affect litter size?  ap. 222-229.  aThe study of the BMPRIB gene polymorphisms has become of great importance in sheep, because it provides critical genetic tools to improve reproductive efficiency in ewes. The purposes of this study were: to assess the genetic diversity of the 90-bp deletion polymorphism within the BMPRIB gene in 52 various sheep breeds; to examine its linkage to the p.Q249R variant in the same gene, as well as to analyze its association with litter size. Herein, a total of 2313 various sheep individuals were used to detect the presence of the 90-bp deletion, among them the six breeds (Australian White (AUW), Small-Tail Han (STH), Guiqian semi-fine wool (GQSFW) sheep, etc.) were genotyped using PCR-based genotyping technology (n = 1636), and 47 breeds worldwide (including STH sheep) were genotyped via whole genome sequencing (WGS) method (n = 677). Genotyping outcomes revealed that the polymorphism was segregated in 45 of 52 breeds with varying frequencies (0.05–0.93). It is pertinent to note that the 90-bp deletion is not linked to the famous p.Q249R SNP in population of interest, except in high prolific Hu sheep. The association analysis indicated that the Del-90-bp variant showed no significant association (P > 0.05) with litter size in AUW (n = 625), GQSFW (n = 75) and STH (n = 38) ewes. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed on the importance of the Del-90-bp variant as a DNA marker that could possibly serve as an additional selection criterion in breeding ewes with high productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3alitter size 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areproductive efficiency 3awool 0aSheep 0aBMPRIB (FecB) gene 0aDeletion 0aSNP 0aAssociation 0aLitter size 0aBMPRIB 0aAUW 0aGQSFW 0aLZFT 0aLXBH 0aSTH 0aWN 0aMAS 0aPCR 0aInDel 0aWGS1 aCao, Chunna1 aHuang, Yangming1 aZhou, Qian1 aZhang, Qingfeng1 aGuo, Zhengang1 aTan, Shijie1 aYue, Xiangpeng1 aXu, Hongwei1 aLi, Ran1 aPan, Chuanying1 aLan, Xianyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-29040 tTheriogenology.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 189 p.222-229dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012000156300001800276520141400294592002801708650001501736650001101751650001901762650002301781650002101804650001801825650001101843650001401854650002201868650001701890650001601907700001701923700001401940700001801954700001201972700001501984700001901999700001602018773014202034856007502176852000902251655001202260IND60768136320221119211102.0220225e20220222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076813632DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta10163c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Wu-Bin10aIntermetallic Cu₁₁In₉in situ formed on hierarchical nanoporous Cu for highly selective CO₂ electroreduction  ap. 4333-4343.  aDeveloping highly selective and cost-effective electrocatalysts is crucial for the efficient conversion of CO₂ to value-added carbon products. Here, we report intermetallic Cu₁₁In₉ nanoparticles that are in situ formed on nanoporous Cu skeleton (Cu₁₁In₉/Cu) as highly selective and electroactive catalysts to mediate CO₂ electroreduction to CO. Owing to the high oxophilicity of surface indium atoms, their spontaneous hydroxylation results in the formation of heterogeneous Cu–In(OH)ₓ surface on monoclinic Cu₁₁In₉ nanoparticles, which selectively boosts reaction kinetics of CO₂-to-CO conversion as a result of weakening adsorption energies of *CO and H* intermediates on surface Cu atoms. Associated with hierarchical nanoporous Cu architecture to offer a high specific surface area for full use of electroactive sites and facilitate electron and mass transports along interconnective Cu ligaments and interpenetrative nanopores, nanoporous Cu₁₁In₉/Cu hybrid electrodes exhibit exceptional electrocatalysis for CO product, with a high partial current density of 12.6 mA cmgₑₒ⁻² and high faradaic efficiency of 92.8%, as well as excellent stability for more than 240 h at an overpotential of 0.49 V. These outstanding electrochemical properties make them attractive alternatives to precious Au- and Ag-based electrocatalysts for high-performance CO₂ electrolysers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydroxylation 3aindium 3ananopores 3areaction kinetics 3asurface area 3avalue added1 aDai, Tian-Yi1 aShi, Hang1 aZeng, Shu-Pei1 aWen, Zi1 aZhang, Wei1 aLang, Xing-You1 aJiang, Qing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 8 p.4333-4343dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta10163c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010600181300001400287520117600301592002801477650001501505650001401520650002201534650001401556650001701570650001501587650001601602650001101618650001801629650001401647650002101661650001801682650003701700650000901737653003601746653001501782653001801797653001601815653001701831700002601848700002301874700001901897773010601916856008602022852000902108655001202117IND60525349920221120124336.0190318e20161005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052534992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordli, Henriette Rogstad10aProducing ultrapure wood cellulose nanofibrils and evaluating the cytotoxicity using human skin cells  ap. 65-73.  aWood cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) have been suggested as a potential wound healing material, but its utilization is limited by FDA requirements regarding endotoxin levels. In this study a method using sodium hydroxide followed by TEMPO mediated oxidation was developed to produce ultrapure cellulose nanofibrils, with an endotoxin level of 45 endotoxin units/g (EU/g) cellulose. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (S(T)EM) revealed a highly nanofibrillated structure (lateral width of 3.7±1.3nm).Assessment of cytotoxicity and metabolic activity on Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts and Human Epidermal Keratinocytes was done. CNF-dispersion of 50μg/ml did not affect the cells. CNF-aerogels induced a reduction of metabolic activity by the fibroblasts and keratinocytes, but no significant cell death. Cytokine profiling revealed no induction of the 27 cytokines tested upon exposure to CNF. The moisture-holding capacity of aerogels was relatively high (∼7500%), compared to a commercially available wound dressing (∼2500%), indicating that the CNF material is promising as dressing material for management of wounds with a moderate to high amount of exudate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell death 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3acytokines 3acytotoxicity 3aendotoxins 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3akeratinocytes 3aoxidation 3asodium hydroxide 3atissue repair 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awood 0aUltrapure cellulose nanofibrils 0aEndotoxins 0aKeratinocytes 0aFibroblasts 0aCytotoxicity1 aChinga-Carrasco, Gary1 aRokstad, Anne Mari1 aPukstad, Brita0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Oct. 05, v. 150 p.65-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04344naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011200172500001400284520242100298592002802719650002302747650002402770650002402794650002602818650002702844650002302871650002602894650003102920650001302951650001102964650001202975650001502987650000903002650002703011650001603038650001803054650001603072650001603088650001903104650001803123650001503141650001303156650001203169650002103181650001303202650001303215650000903228650001703237650001103254650001103265650002103276650001703297650001203314651001003326653001303336653001003349653001903359700002403378700002503402700002003427773010803447856008203555852000903637655001203646IND60684466620221117214519.0200318e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068446662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2020.1077622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso-Ayuso, María10aInterseeding cover crops into maize: Characterization of species performance under Mediterranean conditions  aNAL-light  aCover crop (CC) benefits and adoption in crop rotations may be limited by the short planting window after the cash crop. Interseeding or relay intercropping of CC is a technique that could overcome short planting windows constraints and allow CC establishment and growth. However, in Mediterranean regions this technique has been poorly implemented.Field experiments were established in Central Spain during two consecutive growing seasons to assess the performance of different species as interseeded crops into irrigated maize (Zea mays L.). The treatments included annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and eight legumes: burr medic (Medicago polymorpha L.), barrel medic (Medicago truncatula L.), yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis L.), berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), balansa clover (Trifolium michelanium L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.), and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.). A bare soil was included as control treatment. After the maize harvest, the four species with the best performance were planted as autumn cover crops in adjacent plots. The ground cover was studied throughout the experimental period, and biomass and N content for each species were determined in the autumn and in the following spring prior to the cover crop termination. The soil inorganic N content was determined in spring.Barrel medic, yellow sweetclover, common vetch and annual ryegrass were the species with the best performance in terms of soil coverage during the summer. Red clover and Persian clover had good establishment in one out of two years. None of the interseeded species impaired maize grain yield or quality. Interseeded species achieved better soil coverage and increased the biomass accrued at autumn compared to cover crops sown in October. Therefore, interseeded species ensured longer ground coverage, increasing the potential for soil quality improvement or weed suppression. Moreover, the higher biomass achieved by interseeded species ensured the survival of yellow sweetclover, which was winter killed when planted in the autumn. Interseeded cover crops enhanced the potential of N leaching reduction compared to autumn cover crops.This experiment confirms the suitability of different species interseeded in summer into irrigated maize in Mediterranean regions, and highlights the extra benefits of this practice in annual rotations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aMedicago polymorpha 3aMedicago truncatula 3aMelilotus officinalis 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium resupinatum 3aVicia sativa subsp. sativa 3aZea mays 3aautumn 3abiomass 3acash crops 3acorn 3acover crop termination 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3afield crops 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3aintercropping 3airrigation 3aleaching 3alegumes 3anitrogen content 3aplanting 3aresearch 3asoil 3asoil quality 3aspring 3asummer 3avegetation cover 3aweed control 3awindows 3aSpain 0aRyegrass 0aVetch 0aCrop diversity1 aGabriel, José Luis1 aPancorbo, José Luis1 aQuemada, Miguel0 tField crops research.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 249 p.107762-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2020.1077623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002200158245010400180300001600284520204800300592002802348650002402376650001902400650001002419650002302429650001902452650001002471650002202481650002202503650001002525650003502535650002002570650001602590650002902606650002602635653002302661653001002684653002602694653001302720700001702733700002502750700005902775773010202834856009302936852000903029655001203038IND60781379720221119172535.0220726e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078137972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMańkowska, Anna,10aPromoter polymorphisms in STK35 and IFT27 genes and their associations with boar sperm freezability  ap. 199-208.  aWe have shown that STK35 and IFT27 genes are differentially expressed in spermatozoa from boars with good and poor semen freezability (GSF and PSF, respectively). STK35 is a stress-related gene that is implicated in spermatogenesis, whereas IFT27 is a motility-related gene that is mainly involved in intracellular protein transport. In this study we hypothesized that polymorphic variants in the 5′-flanking regulatory regions of STK35 and IFT27 genes could contribute to differences in semen freezability. We also predicted the interactions of the polymorphic variants with transcription factors on the gene promoter activity, using bioinformatics. The 5′-flanking region sequences of the STK35 and IFT27 were PCR amplified and analyzed by Sanger sequencing method. Protein expression in STK35 and IFT27 was determined in pre-freeze (PF) and frozen-thawed (FT) spermatozoa, using western blotting analysis. Sanger sequencing revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs327863835 (C > T) in STK35 promoter, while two SNPs (rs337563873, A > T; rs331520020, T > C) were detected in IFT27 promoter. STK35 and IFT27 promoter polymorphisms showed significant allele frequency differences between the GSF and PSF groups. Using bioinformatics approaches, we predicted that SNPs resulted in the generation of additional transcription factor binding sites for NFATC2, ELK1 and GR-β, which appeared to enhance or repress the promoter activity of STK35 or IFT27 in either freezability group. Wide variations in STK35 and IFT27 protein expression were observed among the boars, however, significantly higher protein expression was detected in IFT27 in FT spermatozoa of the GSF group. We suggest that the upstream variants, detected in STK35 and IFT27 promoters, might regulate the transcriptional activity of the genes by affecting their potential binding of transcription factors.

With a sample of more than 2,000 German electricity consumers, we tested the proposition of a “lemon market” for renewable energy in a discrete choice experiment. Specifically, we found that, compared to investor-owned firms, additional willingness-to-pay for renewable energy is approximately double when offered by cooperatives or municipally-owned electricity utilities. Consumers who are experienced with switching suppliers have an additional willingness-to-pay of one Eurocent per kilowatt hour for cooperatives and two Eurocents for public enterprises. The results demonstrate that organizational transformation in dynamically-changing electricity markets is not only driven by political initiatives but also by consumers' choices on the market. Public policy may reduce information asymmetries by promoting government labeling of green energy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer preferences 3acooperatives 3aelectricity 3amarkets 3apolitics 3apublic enterprises 3apublic policy 3arenewable energy sources 3auncertainty 3awillingness to pay 0aCooperatives 0aDiscrete choice experiment 0aEnergy transition 0aGermany 0aWillingness-to-Pay1 aSagebiel, Julian1 aMüller, Jakob R.0 tRenewable energy.g2016 Aug., v. 94 p.106-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010900160300001600269520206500285592002802350650001802378650001202396650001502408650001002423650001302433650000902446650001602455650001102471650001002482650001302492650001702505650001202522650000902534650001102543650001602554650001502570700002602585700002102611700002302632773009702655856007302752852000902825655001202834IND60137738820221120190114.0150523e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013773882DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.121582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcock, Joanne F.10aFrogs during the flood: Differential behaviours of two amphibian species in a dryland floodplain wetland  ap. 929-940.  aFlow regimes structure biotic processes and communities of floodplain wetlands. Most current understanding of the influence of the flood pulse on vertebrates is based on knowledge of relationships between flow regimes and fish and bird populations. Its influence on amphibian populations is poorly known, and possibly difficult to disentangle due to the strong influence of weather on amphibian movement and breeding. We predicted that the behaviour of two functionally different amphibian species would vary due to different physiological constraints and life histories driving habitat use and activity periods. We radio‐tracked 52 frogs, 27 barking marsh frogs (Limnodynastes fletcheri, Limnodynastidae) and 25 green tree frogs (Litoria caerulea, Hylidae), to investigate the influence of weather and flooding on habitat use, size of activity area and nightly movement. Activity area sizes and nightly distances of the species were highly variable. Limnodynastes fletcheri had a greater area of activity during floods (mean area: 5237 ± 2556 (SE) m²cf. 639 ± 247 m²post flood) while the tree frog had a greater area after flooding (207 ± 68 m²cf. 1946 ± 530 m²). Limnodynastes fletcheri movement was little influenced by weather or inundation, with distances slightly restricted by increasing wind speed. However, use of floodplain habitat and coincidental breeding behaviour indicated responsiveness by L. fletcheri to flooding. Litoria caerulea moved further with increasing rainfall and nightly temperatures, seldom used flooded areas and there was no evidence of breeding. Although the flood pulse is the dominant structuring force on the floodplain, its influence varies on amphibian species. Consequently for conservation, L. fletcheri populations may be negatively affected by river regulatory activities, but would respond to environmental flow management, whereas L. caerulea appears unlikely to be affected by river regulation, though the confounding effects of rain and preferred habitat inundation needs exploring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLimnodynastes 3aLitoria 3aarid lands 3abirds 3abreeding 3afish 3afloodplains 3afloods 3afrogs 3ahabitats 3alife history 3amarshes 3arain 3arivers 3atemperature 3awind speed1 aKingsford, Richard T.1 aPenman, Trent D.1 aRowley, Jodi J.

The study has found that non-farm income contributed 65 per cent, while on-farm income contributed 30 per cent to the total income. Rice, which is the dominant kharifseason crop accounted for only 16 per cent of the total income. Across non-farm income sources, activities like construction, transportation, crusher labour, vegetable business, repairing works, shop-keeping, etc. contributed the highest share (29%), followed by salaried jobs (23%) and remittances (14%). The income inequality analysis has revealed that non-farm sources contributed more than 90 per cent of the inequality in income of different categories of farmers. The generation of more non-farm employment opportunities in the study area, development of tube-well irrigation and flood-tolerant rice varieties will help in increasing and stabilizing the income of farmers in the flood-prone areas of Odisha in the long-run. The government should popularize crop insurance in the flood-prone areas with enhanced subsidy premium to attract farmers, which will help in stabilizing farm income.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop insurance 3aecosystems 3afarm income 3aflooding tolerance 3airrigation 3alabor 3alivelihood 3aoff-farm employment 3aresearch 3arice 3asocial inequality 3atransportation 3avegetables 0aFlood-prone ecosystem 0alivelihood security 0aOdisha1 aSadangi, Biswanath0 tAgricultural economics research review.g2013, v. 26, no. conf p.234-234dAgricultural Economics Research AssociationwJournal:2081x0974-02797nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009100175300001800266520065800284592002800942650001900970650001600989650001701005650001201022650002201034650001701056650001201073650001101085650002901096650002201125653001401147653001001161653002101171653002001192700002101212700001701233700001701250700001601267773010001283856008701383852000901470655001201479IND60564920620221120025808.0180830e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056492062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlumberga, Dagnija10aModelling the Latvian power market to evaluate its environmental long-term performance  ap. 1593-1600.  aIn this paper we study development patterns of Latvian electricity market.

Conventional wastewater treatment plants are normally not equipped with advanced technologies for the elimination of bacteria. Molecular biology analyses were combined with live-dead discrimination analysis of wastewater population using Propidium monoazide (PMA) to study population shifts during ozonation (1 g ozone/g DOC) at a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were quantified by polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the whole wastewater population was analyzed by metagenomic sequencing. The PMA-qPCR experiments showed that the abundances of P. aeruginosa didn't change by ozone treatment, whereas a reduction was observed for E. coli and enterococci. Results comparing conventional cultivation experiments with PMA-qPCR underlined the presence of viable but not culturable cells (VBNC) and their regrowth potential after ozone treatment. Illumina HiSeq sequencing results with and without PMA treatment demonstrated high population similarities in water samples originating from ozone inflow sampling sides. Upon using PMA treatment after ozonation, population shifts became visible and also underlined the importance of PMA treatment for the evaluation of elimination and selection processes during ozonation at WWTPs. Amongst a number of 14 most abundant genera identified in the inflow samples, 9 genera were found to be reduced, whereas 4 genera increased in relative abundance and 1 genus almost remained constant. The strongest increase in relative abundance after ozonation was detected for Oscillatoria spp., Microcoleus spp. and Nitrospira spp. Beside this, a continuous release of Pseudomonas spp. (including P. aeruginosa) to the downstream receiving body was confirmed. Regrowth experiments demonstrated a high prevalence of P. aeruginosa as part of the surviving bacterial population. Summing up, molecular biology analyses in combination with live-dead discrimination are comprehensive methods to evaluate the elimination processes targeting specific species and/or whole microbial populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aMicrocoleus 3aOscillatoria 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abacteria 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiological quality 3amolecular biology 3amunicipal wastewater 3aozonation 3aozone 3apropidium 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregrowth 3asecondary infection 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse1 aAlexander, Johannes1 aKirchen, Silke1 aDötsch, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9086-25841 aWieland, Arne1 aHiller, Christian1 aSchwartz, Thomas0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Jan., v. 232 p.571-579dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04253naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024001700132024002300149024003500172024002300207024004000230024002500270040001800295100005900313245017800372506007600550506003100626520196300657592002802620596003402648506003702682650002302719650001402742650002302756650001802779650001402797650001402811650002102825650001602846650001502862650002002877650001902897650002302916650001302939650001802952650002302970650002302993650001703016651001003033653000903043653001103052653001103063653002603074653002203100653001003122653001503132653001303147700002003160700002403180700002103204773010803225856008203333856011403415961001703529852000903546655001203555IND60684466820221207101232.0200318e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068446682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2020.1077592chorus7 a3691262aris7 a10113/68446682hdl7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2020.1077592doi7 a3691262seq_no_1157 a3070-21610-003-00D2aris_project_no7 a4364662aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitt, Travis W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4501-423010aResponse to deficit irrigation of morphological, yield and fiber quality traits of upland (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and Pima (G. barbadense L.) cotton in the Texas High Plains  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aCotton (Gossypium spp.) production around the world often occurs in water limiting environments. Although Upland (G. hirsutum) and Pima (G. barbadense) cottons have been evaluated under conditions of water stress before; these two species are rarely compared to each other. This may be due to differences in irrigation management and environmental constraints (i.e. season length). In 2014 and 2015, two Upland cultivars and two Pima germplasm lines were evaluated at Lubbock, TX, USA. Plant architecture, boll retention, lint yield and fiber quality were assessed under three deficit subsurface drip irrigation levels. Crop water use was evaluated using soil water balance in conjunction with neutron probe soil water content measurements. In 2014 during flowering at the high irrigation rate, Upland cultivars extracted significantly (p<0.01) more water from the soil profile compared with Pima lines resulting in 30 mm greater water use during this period. However, in 2015 water use did not vary significantly between species. In both years the Pima species had greater boll retention, especially at nodes eight and above, and higher fiber quality compared to Upland, confirming previous reported quality differences between these two species. In addition, Pima’s fiber traits were observed to be less impacted by water deficit, and in some instances slight increases in quality were observed. While Uplands had negative impact to deficit irrigation especially for fiber length, strength, and uniformity under the highest water deficit. The Upland cultivars produced significantly greater lint yields compared with Pima with differences averaged across years of 1154 kg ha⁻¹ and 504 kg ha⁻¹ at the high and low irrigation levels, respectively. New, high yield-Pima cultivars are needed to create premium cotton lint to encourage producers evaluating Pima cotton as an alternative to Upland cotton production, as water availability declines.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3afiber quality 3agermplasm 3ahighlands 3airrigation rates 3alint cotton 3alint yield 3amicroirrigation 3aneutron probes 3aplant architecture 3aresearch 3asoil profiles 3asoil water balance 3asoil water content 3awater stress 3aTexas 0aPima 0aUpland 0aCotton 0aNeutron moisture gage 0aTexas High Plains 0aYield 0aBarbadense 0aHirsutum1 aUlloa, Mauricio1 aSchwartz, Robert C.1 aRitchie, Glen L.0 tField crops research.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 249 p.107759-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2020.1077593Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/68446683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDAUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005100147245009100198300001600289520110600305592002801411650001101439650002501450650001201475650001101487650001301498650001101511650000901522650001901531650001001550650000901560650001201569650002601581650001001607650001101617650002001628650001501648651001101663700002501674700001701699773008501716856008101801852000901882655001201891IND50066869620221118155220.0150209e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006686962DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-013-0194-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillanueva G., Rogelq(Villanueva Gutiérrez),10aPollen diets of two sibling orchid bee species, Euglossa, in Yucatán, southern Mexico  ap. 440-446.  aWe investigated pollen diets of Euglossa viridissima Friese and its recently described sibling species, Euglossa dilemma Bembé & Eltz, in a degraded dry forest locality near Merida, Yucatán, Mexico. Pollen samples were obtained from nests collected in the rainy season of three consecutive years (2006–2008). Solanum sp. (Solanaceae), Physalis sp. (Solanaceae), Ocimum sp., Ocimum micranthum (both Lamiaceae), and Senna sp. (Fabaceae) were the dominant taxa, accounting for 88 % of pollen volume across species. Other important pollen taxa were Croton spp. (Euphorbiaceae), Ipomoea sp. (Convolvulaceae), Solanum torvum, Vigna sp. (Fabaceae), Sida sp. (Malvaceae), and Randia aculeata (Rubiaceae). The predominantly buzz-pollinated family Solanaceae alone represented more than 77 % of total pollen volume. Multivariate analysis revealed significant effects of year but not of bee species on nest pollen composition. We conclude that pollen resources overlap substantially among these sibling species, with resource partitioning apparently absent or confined to periods of severe pollen scarcity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCroton 3aEuglossa viridissima 3aIpomoea 3aOcimum 3aPhysalis 3aRandia 3aSida 3aSolanum torvum 3aVigna 3adiet 3aforests 3amultivariate analysis 3anests 3apollen 3asibling species 3awet season 3aMexico1 aQuezada-Euan, Javier1 aEltz, Thomas0 tApidologie.g2013 July, v. 44, no. 4 p.440-446dSpringer-Verlagx0044-84357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-013-0194-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245011700175520156000292592002801852650001501880650001801895650002401913650001601937650001201953650002101965650001201986650002301998650001402021650001802035650002502053650001702078700002202095700002202117700001902139700002502158773012302183856007502306852000902381655001202390IND60754326520221120231946.0211023e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075432652DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131036192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMałodobra-Mazur, Małgorzata 10aPhospholipid Derivatives of Cinnamic Acid Restore Insulin Sensitivity in Insulin Resistance in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes  aBackground: Insulin resistance (IR) is a condition in which the physiological amount of insulin is insufficient to evoke a proper response of the cell, that is, glucose utilization. Metformin is the first choice for therapy, thanks to its glycemic efficacy and general tolerability. In addition, various natural compounds from plant extracts, spices, and essential oils have been shown to provide health benefits regarding insulin sensitivity. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of phospholipid derivatives of selected natural aromatic acids on insulin action and their potential use to overcome insulin resistance. Methods: The 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into mature adipocytes; next, insulin resistance was induced by palmitic acid (16:0). Cells were further cultured with phenophospholipids at appropriate concentrations. To assess insulin sensitivity, we measured the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, using a glucose uptake test. Results: We showed that cinnamic acid (CA) and 3-methoxycinnamic acid (3-OMe-CA) restored the proper insulin response. However, 1,2-dicinnamoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1,2-diCA-PC) and 1-cinnamoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-CA-2-PA-PC) improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant adipocytes even stronger, exhibiting more beneficial effects. Conclusions: The binding of aromatic acids to phosphatidylcholine increases their beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity in adipocytes and expands their potential practical application as nutraceutical health-promoting agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3acinnamic acid 3adietary supplements 3afibroblasts 3aglucose 3ahealth promotion 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ametformin 3apalmitic acid 3aphosphatidylcholines 3atherapeutics1 aLewoń, Dominika 1 aCierzniak, Aneta 1 aOkulus, Marta 1 aGliszczyńska, Anna 0 tNutrients.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131036193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100001900182245006700201300001300268506007600281520172700357592002802084506003702112650002702149650002502176650001702201650001202218650001802230650001202248650001502260650001602275650001802291650001202309650001102321650002902332650002602361650002002387650002302407650001402430700002402444700002202468700002502490700001802515700002202533773011602555856007502671852000902746655001202755IND60118436020221207075858.0141126e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011843602DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.01055-132doi7 aPMC39111412pmcid7 a240979532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHampel, Ken J.10aCharacterization of the GbdR Regulon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ap. 7-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPseudomonas aeruginosa displays tremendous metabolic diversity, controlled in part by the abundance of transcription regulators in the genome. We have been investigating P. aeruginosa's response to the host, particularly changes regulated by the host-derived quaternary amines choline and glycine betaine (GB). We previously identified GbdR as an AraC family transcription factor that directly regulates choline acquisition from host phospholipids (via binding to plcH and pchP promoters), is required for catabolism of the choline metabolite GB, and is an activator that induces transcription in response to GB or dimethylglycine. Our goal was to characterize the GbdR regulon in P. aeruginosa by using genetics and chemical biology in combination with transcriptomics and in vitro DNA-binding assays. Here we show that GbdR activation regulates transcription of 26 genes from 12 promoters, 11 of which have measureable binding to GbdR in vitro. The GbdR regulon includes the genes encoding GB, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, glycine, and serine catabolic enzymes and the BetX and CbcXWV quaternary amine transport proteins. We characterized the GbdR consensus binding site and used it to identify that the recently characterized acetylcholine esterase gene, choE (PA4921), is also regulated by GbdR. The regulon member not directly controlled by GbdR is the secreted lipase gene lipA, which was also the only regulon member repressed under GbdR-activating conditions. Determination of the GbdR regulon provides deeper understanding of how GbdR links bacterial metabolism and virulence. Additionally, identification of two uncharacterized regulon members suggests roles for these proteins in response to choline metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abacteriology 3abetaine 3abinding sites 3acholine 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aphospholipids 3aregulon 3aserine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3atransport proteins 3avirulence1 aLaBauve, Annette E.1 aMeadows, Jamie A.1 aFitzsimmons, Liam F.1 aNock, Adam M.1 aWargo, Matthew J.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 196, no. 1 p.7-15dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.01055-133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010600208500001900314520130700333592002801640650002301668650001101691650001201702650002401714650002401738650000901762650001001771650001601781653003601797653002801833653002201861653003601883653002101919653001901940700001801959700001601977700001701993700002102010773009002031856008502121852000902206655001202215IND60722800720221118042915.0210226e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072280072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1197372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei-Hsin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5009-396010aReaction and hydrogen production phenomena of ethanol steam reforming in a catalytic membrane reactor  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEthanol steam reforming (ESR) can be performed efficiently using catalytic membrane reactors (CMR) to enhance H₂ production. To investigate the reaction of ESR and the effect of membrane on H₂ production, a numerical model was developed to predict the chemical reaction phenomena. The simulations suggested that lower Reynolds numbers were conducive to ethanol conversion and H₂ recovery. The H₂ yield could be increased by recovering H₂ from the ESR product gas using the Pd membrane, and the membrane had a better performance at low Reynolds numbers. Alternatively, total H₂ production increased at higher Reynolds numbers, but H₂ recovery decreased due to shorter residence time in the reactor. Increasing the S/E ratio enhanced the ESR performance to produce H₂ due to the excessive steam supplied to the reaction, but the H₂ recovery declined slightly and more energy would be required. Although a high inlet temperature increased the H₂ concentration on the retentate side, it also caused the membrane to experience a higher risk of melting. An increase in pressure facilitated both the ethanol conversion and H₂ recovery, scribing to more H₂ permeating through the membrane. Overall, the obtained results in this study are beneficial to ESR operation for H₂ production.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aenergy 3aethanol 3ahydrogen production 3amathematical models 3arisk 3asteam 3atemperature 0aPalladium (Pd) membrane reactor 0aEthanol steam reforming 0aHydrogen recovery 0aWater gas shift reaction (WGSR) 0aParameter design 0aCFD simulation1 aLi, Shu-Cheng1 aLim, Steven1 aChen, Zih-Yu1 aJuan, Joon Ching0 tEnergy.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 220 p.119737-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1197373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04698naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016200160500001400322520267800336592002803014650003003042650000803072650001503080650002503095650000903120650002003129650001603149650002603165650002703191650000903218650001603227650001803243650002203261650001503283650002503298650001303323650001303336650001503349650002103364650001503385650002303400650002503423650002203448650002403470650002303494650001803517650002003535650001003555650001603565651001003581653003303591653001803624653001703642700001603659700001303675700001703688700001503705700001403720700001503734700001603749700002403765773010803789856008203897852000903979655001203988IND60684467020221117214445.0200318e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068446702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2020.1077582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Wen10aStraw and plastic management regulate air-soil temperature amplitude and wetting-drying alternation in soil to promote intercrop productivity in arid regions  aNAL-light  aSoil coverage with straw and plastic mulch is a valuable and useful strategy for enhancing crop production in arid regions. However, a better understanding of the mechanism by which this innovative practice drives spatial and temporal variation in soil temperature and water content and improves crop production could guide cropping system optimization. A three-year field experiment was performed with four wheat-maize strip-intercropping treatments: 1) no-tillage with 25−30 cm tall wheat straw standing in wheat strips and residual plastic mulching in maize strips (NTS), 2) no-tillage with 25−30 cm tall wheat straw mulching in wheat strips and residual plastic mulching in maize strips (NTM), 3) conventional tillage with 25−30 cm tall wheat straw incorporation in wheat strips and annual new plastic mulching in maize strips (CTS), and 4) conventional tillage without wheat straw retention in wheat strips and annual new plastic mulching in maize strips (CT). The temporal and spatial variation in soil temperature and soil water content was assessed. NTM had the greatest soil water retention, and increased soil water content in the 0−120 cm soil depth by 6.4, 5.2, and 5.4 % at the wheat independent growing period, intercrops co-growing period, and maize independent growing period, respectively, compared with CT. In the 0−15 cm soil depth, compared with CT, NTS decreased soil temperature by 0.73, 1.18, and 0.85 °C, NTM decreased it by 1.35, 1.95, and 1.38 °C, during the three aforementioned crop growing periods. With the intercropping treatment, soil temperature in the 0−15 cm soil depth of maize strips was higher than that of wheat strips with NTS by 1.13, 3.67, and 1.44 °C, and with NTM higher by 1.32, 2.97, and 1.75 °C, especially higher as 1.38, 4.00,and 1.68 °C with CT, during the three aforementioned crop growing periods. According to the value of difference between air and soil temperatures, NTM maintained soil heat in the low temperature season and reduced soil temperature in the high temperature season. These allowed the intercrops to grow in a collaborative state with the NTM treatment during their growing period, it is an important regulation mechanism for growth and development of intercropped wheat and maize. NTM improved total grain yield of wheat plus maize by 14.9 % in comparison to CT. The optimized soil temperature and increased soil moisture for the intercrops’ strips with NTM indicates that the integrated set of practices in this treatment can be used as a superior technique to overcome simultaneous water shortage and heat stress in arid irrigated areas of northwestern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair 3aarid zones 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acrop production 3afield crops 3afield experimentation 3agrowth and development 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aintercropping 3airrigated farming 3ano-tillage 3aplastic film mulches 3aplastics 3aresearch 3asoil depth 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water retention 3aspatial variation 3asystem optimization 3atemporal variation 3awater content 3awater shortages 3awheat 3awheat straw 3aChina 0aStraw and plastic management 0aSoil moisture 0aArid regions1 aChai, Qiang1 aGuo, Yao1 aFan, Zhilong1 aHu, Falong1 aFan, Hong1 aZhao, Zai,1 aYu, Aizhong1 aCoulter, Jeffrey A.0 tField crops research.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 249 p.107758-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2020.1077583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169506011700264506007600381520096500457592002801422506003701450650001201487650001401499650002301513650002001536650002201556650001901578650000901597650002001606650001701626650001301643653001901656653002501675653001401700653001801714653001001732653001001742700001801752700002001770700002101790700002101811773009301832856008601925852000902011655001202020IND60766515920221207060415.0220706e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076651592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e088742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConte, Stella10aDevelopment and validation of the smartphone addiction risk children questionnaire (SARCQ)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSmartphone abuse interferes with all activities in daily life.

An exploratory factor analysis before and a confirmatory factor analysis after were performed in order to establish the factorial structure of the questionnaire. Results showed a two-factor structure explaining 49.30% of total variance. The outstanding dimensions are: “I'm not afraid with you” (INAWY) and “Linus blanket” (LB). SARCQ will be useful to assess the risk of SA in childhood in order to operate early effective therapeutic interventions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanxiety 3achildhood 3aelementary schools 3afactor analysis 3amobile telephones 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atherapeutics 3avariance 0aNew technology 0aSmartphone addiction 0aChildhood 0aQuestionnaire 0aSARCQ 0aC.F.A1 aGhiani, Carla1 aNicotra, Eraldo1 aBertucci, Andrea1 aTruzoli, Roberto0 tHeliyon.g2022 Feb., v. 8, no. 2 p.e08874-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e088743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010500164300001600269520150400285592002801789650004401817650001201861650002401873650002201897650002301919650001101942650001701953650002401970650001001994650002102004650001502025650001802040650004402058650001802102650001302120650002102133650001702154650000902171650001902180653002602199653002302225653002702248653001802275700001302293700001702306700001802323700001702341700001802358700001602376700001302392773010802405856008602513852000902599655001202608IND60525350320221120132231.0190318e20161005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052535032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Na10aHomogeneous synthesis of quaternized chitin in NaOH/urea aqueous solution as a potential gene vector  ap. 180-186.  aWater-soluble quaternized chitins (QCs) were homogeneously synthesized by reacting chitin with (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (CHPTAC) in 8wt% NaOH/4wt% urea aqueous solutions. The chemical structure and solution properties of the quaternized chitins were characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR, elemental analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements. The results demonstrated that the water-soluble QCs, with a degree of substitution (DS) values of 0.27–0.54, could be obtained by varying the concentration of chitin, the molar ratio of CHPTAC to chitin unit, and the reaction time at room temperature (25°C). Two QCs (DS=0.36 and 0.54) were selected and studied as gene carriers. Agarose gel retardation assay revealed that both QCs could condense DNA efficiently when N/P ratio>3. The results of particle size and zeta potential indicated that both QCs had a good ability of condensing plasmid DNA into compact nanoparticles with the size of 100–200nm and zeta potential of +18 to +36mV. Compared to polyethylenimine (PEI, 25kDa), the QCs exhibited outstanding low cytotoxicity. Transfection efficiencies of the QCs/DNA complexes were measured using pGL-3 encoding luciferase as the foreign DNA, and the QCs/DNA complexes showed effective transfection efficiencies in 293T cells. These results revealed that the QCs prepared in NaOH/urea aqueous solutions could be used as promising non-viral gene carriers owing to their excellent characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagarose 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical structure 3achitin 3acytotoxicity 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3alight scattering 3aluciferase 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size 3aplasmids 3asodium hydroxide 3atransfection 3aurea 3azeta potential 0aHomogeneous synthesis 0aQuaternized chitin 0aDegree of substitution 0aGene delivery1 aAi, Ziye1 aFang, Zehong1 aWang, Yanfeng1 aXia, Zhiping1 aZhong, Zibiao1 aFan, Xiaoli1 aYe, Qifa0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Oct. 05, v. 150 p.180-186dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245025100165520158600416592002802002650001502030650001602045650001702061650001002078650002002088650002002108650001602128650001602144650000902160650001202169650001202181650001302193650001102206650001002217650001002227650002302237650001302260650000902273651001602282700002502298700002802323700002002351700003002371700002502401700002102426700001802447700002502465700001902490700002302509700001902532700002302551773012302574856007502697852000902772655001202781IND60754326820221121004303.0211023e20211016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075432682DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131036212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanielewski, Maciej 10aCornelian Cherry (Cornus mas L.) Iridoid and Anthocyanin Extract Enhances PPAR-α, PPAR-γ Expression and Reduces I/M Ratio in Aorta, Increases LXR-α Expression and Alters Adipokines and Triglycerides Levels in Cholesterol-Rich Diet Rabbit Model  aCornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) fruits possess potential cardiovascular, lipid-lowering and hypoglycemic bioactivities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of resin-purified cornelian cherry extract rich in iridoids and anthocyanins on several transcription factors, intima/media ratio in aorta and serum parameters, which determine or are valuable indicators of the adverse changes observed in the course of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. For this purpose, male New Zealand rabbits were fed a diet enriched in 1% cholesterol for 60 days. Additionally, one group received 10 mg/kg b.w. of cornelian cherry extract and the second group 50 mg/kg b.w. of cornelian cherry extract. PPAR-α and PPAR-γ expression in the aorta, LXR-α expression in the liver; cholesterol, triglycerides, adipokines, apolipoproteins, glucose and insulin levels in serum; the intima and media diameter in the thoracic and abdominal aorta were determined. Administration of cornelian cherry extract resulted in an enhancement in the expression of all tested transcription factors, a decrease in triglycerides, leptin and resistin, and an increase in adiponectin levels. In addition, a significant reduction in the I/M ratio was observed for both the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The results we have obtained confirm the potential contribution of cornelian cherry extract to mitigation of the risk of developing and the intensity of symptoms of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders such as atherosclerosis or metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCornus mas 3aadiponectin 3aanthocyanins 3aaorta 3aapolipoproteins 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adiet 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3airidoids 3aleptin 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolic syndrome 3aresistin 3arisk 3aNew Zealand1 aKucharska, Alicja Z.1 aMatuszewska, Agnieszka 1 aRapak, Andrzej 1 aGomułkiewicz, Agnieszka 1 aDzimira, Stanisław 1 aDziegiel, Piotr,1 aNowak, Beata 1 aTrocha, Małgorzata 1 aMagdalan, Jan 1 aPiórecki, Narcyz 1 aSzeląg, Adam,1 aSozański, Tomasz 0 tNutrients.g2021 Oct. 16, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131036213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005200151245008000203300001600283520151800299592002801817650002201845650001901867650001401886650001501900650001801915650001501933650001801948650001301966650001401979650001001993650002202003650001002025650001602035653002802051653000902079653002302088653003402111653001302145700001502158700001802173700001702191700001502208773011402223856008602337852000902423655001202432IND60557564120221123034044.0190412e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055756412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLecq, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4842-921510aImportance of ground refuges for the biodiversity in agricultural hedgerows  ap. 615-626.  aIn most agro-ecosystems, hedgerows provide important habitat for many species. Unfortunately, large scale destruction of hedges has stripped this structure from many landscapes. Replanting programs have attempted to restore hedgerow habitats, but the methods employed often fail to replace the unique microhabitats (complex matrix of stones, logs and roots found along the base of the hedge) that provided key refuges to an array of animal species. We examined the influence of ground refuges on animal diversity in an agricultural landscape. We used non-lethal rapid biodiversity assessments to sample invertebrate and vertebrate taxa in 69 hedges having different levels of herbaceous cover, tree cover, and refuge availability. Co-inertia analyses compared hedge characteristics with the animal biodiversity sampled. We also used a functional index (accounting for body mass, trophic level, and metabolic mode of the species sampled) to compare hedges. In addition, large sedentary predators (e.g. snakes) were used as indicators of shelter presence/quality and as bio-indicators of food web structures. Finally we used unbiased Chao-estimates to evaluate species richness. All results were convergent and show that complexity of the base of the hedge (e.g., bank size and stone abundance) positively influenced biodiversity and predator abundance. Guidelines to restore hedgerows should integrate refuges that can be constructed by retaining the materials that are extracted during the planting of the hedges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagroecosystems 3afood webs 3aguidelines 3ainvertebrates 3alandscapes 3amicrohabitats 3aplanting 3apredators 3aroots 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3avertebrates 0aAgricultural landscapes 0aBank 0aHabitat management 0aRapid biodiversity assessment 0aReptiles1 aLoisel, A.1 aBrischoux, F.1 aMullin, S.J.1 aBonnet, X.0 tEcological indicators.g2017 Jan., v. 72 p.615-626dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003100132024001100163040001800174100001900192245012000211300001600331500000900347506017300356520148500529592002802014650002302042650002202065650001102087650001902098650001602117650002702133650001602160650001502176650002402191650001502215650001402230650001302244650001402257650001902271650001902290650000902309650001102318650001102329650001702340651001602357700002102373700001902394700002002413700002002433700001602453773013302469856011202602856007802714956010002792961000902892852000902901655001202910IND60006091420221214225005.0191122e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000609142DNAL7 a3051972aris7 a10113/609142hdl7 a10.2134/agronj14.02662doi8 ans7324  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTewolde, Haile10aEnhancing Management of Fall-Applied Poultry Litter with Cover Crop and Subsurface Band Placement in No-Till Cotton  ap. 449-458.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWhether the yield reduction risk in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fertilized with fall-applied poultry litter, relative to spring-applied litter, in regions with warm falls or winters can be minimized by applying the litter in subsurface bands along with a winter cover crop is unknown. A field study was conducted in Mississippi to determine whether litter applied in fall can be as effective as litter applied in spring for no-till cotton if applied in narrow subsurface bands (SSB) in the presence of a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover crop (WCC). The study compared 5.6 Mg ha⁻¹ litter applied in the fall vs. spring, in SSB vs. surface broadcast (BC), with a WCC vs. no cover crop (NCC) in a 2 × 2 × 2 treatment structure. An unfertilized control and a treatment fertilized with conventional inorganic fertilizers were included. The results showed that planting wheat as a WCC, relative to NCC, increased cotton lint yield by as much as 18% in the driest season. Applying litter in fall leads to loss of litter-derived nutrients if applied by BC, but the losses are reduced if it is applied as SSB. Applying litter as SSB in conjunction with a WCC increased cotton lint yield relative to BC application with NCC by as much as 22%. The combined benefit of cover crop and subsurface banding suggests that poultry litter may be applied in fall in these soils without yield penalty, with potential to reduce the litter rate and minimize environmental contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aautumn 3aband placement 3acover crops 3afertilizer application 3alint cotton 3alint yield 3amineral fertilizers 3ano-tillage 3anutrients 3aplanting 3apollution 3apoultry manure 3arisk reduction 3asoil 3aspring 3awinter 3awinter wheat 3aMississippi1 aShankle, Mark W.1 aWay, Thomas R.1 aAdeli, Ardeshir1 aBrooks, John P.1 aHe, Zhongqi0 tAgronomy journal.g2015 Mar., v. 107, no. 2 p.449-458dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/609143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj14.02663Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/305197%20-%20Tewolde.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245007800131300001200209520110700221592002801328650002001356650001501376650001001391650001101401650001501412650002101427650001501448650001801463650001301481650001401494650001601508650001001524651001001534653002401544653001701568653001701585653001601602700001601618700002001634773015301654852000901807655001201816IND60709673220221122221906.0200908s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070967322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaghmare, M.N.10aLand Degradation and its Impact on Livelihood Security of Farm Households  ap. 239.  aThe study has examined land degradation and its impact on livelihood security of farm households.

The study conducted in area under canal irrigation in the Pune district of western Maharashtra, is based on the data collected from 40 affected and 40 non-affected sample farm households. The cost of cultivation, productivity, and profitability of sugarcane and wheat crops have been found higher in non-affected farms than affected farms. The average gross income from crop production has been found higher on non-affected farms than affected farms. The livelihood dependence for both employment and income of sample farms has been revealed high on non-farm activities in the affected farms. The study has suggested that in the degraded land areas, activity diversification for reducing uncertainty, would increase employment and income for better livelihood opportunities in the rural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aemployment 3afarms 3aincome 3airrigation 3aland degradation 3alivelihood 3aprofitability 3aresearch 3asugarcane 3auncertainty 3awheat 3aIndia 0alivelihood security 0asaline soils 0aproductivity 0aMaharashtra1 aPawar, B.N.1 aShendage., P.N.0 tAgricultural economics research review.g2013, v. 26, no. conf p.239-239dAgricultural Economics Research AssociationwJournal:2081x0974-02797nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245006000167506011700227506007600344520116600420592002801586506003701614650002001651650002101671650002001692650001401712650001701726650002201743650002101765650002801786650002601814650001501840650001701855653003401872653001401906653001401920653002701934653003401961653003401995653004302029773009302072856008602165852000902251655001202260IND60766516320221207060423.0220706e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076651632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e088782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMima, Akira10aMitochondria-targeted drugs for diabetic kidney disease  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDiabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most frequent causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the United States. Chronic hyperglycemic conditions are thought to be the primary cause of DKD. However, it is clinically difficult to achieve glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. Recent advances in mitochondrial biology have provided a new understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in DKD. Studies have revealed impaired mitochondrial function in a variety of diabetic complications, including DKD; moreover, abnormal mitochondrial fission may be involved in the progression of DKD. It has been reported that metformin or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may provide renal protection by improving mitochondrial dynamics and reducing oxidative stress. Thus, drugs that target the restoration of mitochondrial function may become novel therapeutic agents for DKD. Imeglimin is the first in a new class of oral antidiabetic drugs that can reduce reactive oxygen species production and increase mitochondrial DNA synthesis. This review outlines the potential therapeutic interventions that affect mitochondrial function and prevent DKD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA replication 3aglycemic control 3akidney diseases 3ametformin 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3arenoprotective effect 3asymporters 3atherapeutics 0aDiabetic kidney disease (DKD) 0aImeglimin 0aMetformin 0aMitochondrial function 0aNFE-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS) 0aSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)0 tHeliyon.g2022 Feb., v. 8, no. 2 p.e08878-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e088783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245017800170300001500348520053700363592002800900650001200928650001000940650001600950650002200966650002500988650001301013650002001026650002101046773011101067856008201178852000901260655001201269IND60594869220221120170136.0180620e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059486922DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n11.1993.a72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, E.

The available data set was curated to remove salts, mixtures and compounds without having a definite structure. A k-fold double cross validation technique was employed for variable selection prior to development of the final model. The final model was developed using partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis and selected based on a mean absolute error (MAE) based criteria for the validation sets. The model was validated extensively using different internal and external validation strategies in accordance with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. This work presented development of a validated quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model obtained from k-fold double cross-validation technique in order to find out the key structural information required to enhance the sweet potency of the molecules. Finally, we have designed and proposed 13 new molecules based on the insights obtained from the QSPR model. The designed compounds showed good in silico predicted sweetness potency with acceptable ADMET profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3adata collection 3aguidelines 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3asalts 3asweeteners 3asweetness 3atoxicology 0aSweetener 0aQSPR 0aK-fold double cross-validation 0aPLS1 aRoy, Kunal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4486-80740 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Feb., v. 112 p.551-562dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017100173300001600344520198700360592002802347650001502375650001702390650002402407650002302431650001302454650001102467650002202478650001802500650001702518650002202535650001202557650002102569653001502590653002402605653001702629653002002646653001502666700002202681700003602703700001802739700001802757773010002775856008602875852000902961655001202970IND60557564520221117160229.0190412e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055756452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.08.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitworth, Andrew10aMethods matter: Different biodiversity survey methodologies identify contrasting biodiversity patterns in a human modified rainforest — A case study with amphibians  ap. 821-832.  aUnderstanding how well tropical forest biodiversity can recover following habitat change is often difficult due to conflicting assessments arising from different studies. One often overlooked potentially confounding factor that may influence assessments of biodiversity response to habitat change, is the possibility that different survey methodologies, targeting the same indicator taxon, may identify different patterns and so lead to different conclusions. Here we investigated whether two different but commonly used survey methodologies used to assess amphibian communities, pitfall trapping and nocturnal transects, indicate the same or different responses of amphibian biodiversity to historic human induced habitat change. We did so in a regenerating rainforest study site located in one of the world’s most biodiverse and important conservation areas: the Manu Biosphere Reserve. We show that the two survey methodologies tested identified contrasting biodiversity patterns in a human modified rainforest. Nocturnal transect surveys indicated biodiversity differences between forest with different human disturbance histories, whereas pitfall trap surveys suggested no differences between forest disturbance types, except for community composition. This pattern was true for species richness, diversity, overall abundance and community evenness and structure. For some fine scale metrics, such as species specific responses and abundances of family groups, both methods detected differences between disturbance types. However, the direction of differences was inconsistent between methods. We highlight that for assessments of rainforest recovery following disturbance, survey methods do matter and that different biodiversity survey methods can identify contrasting patterns in response to different types of historic disturbance. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence that arboreal species might be more sensitive indicators than terrestrial communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3acase studies 3acommunity structure 3aconservation areas 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3apitfall traps 3arain forests 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atropical forests 0aAmphibians 0aHabitat disturbance 0aRegeneration 0aTropical forest 0aIndicators1 aVillacampa, Jaime1 aSerrano Rojas, Shirley Jennifer1 aDownie, Roger1 aMacLeod, Ross0 tEcological indicators.g2017 Jan., v. 72 p.821-832dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.08.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245012800212506011700340506007600457520158600533592002802119506003702147650002302184650001002207650001002217650001302227650001302240650001302253650002802266650002002294650001202314650001502326650001002341650001502351650001002366650001402376650001802390653003202408653002402440653002602464653002102490700002102511700002702532700002102559700002002580773009302600856008602693852000902779655001202788IND60766516620221207060231.0220706e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076651662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e088812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawiset, Thaneeya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7728-926610aAnxiolytic and antidepressant-like activities of aqueous extract of Azadirachta indica A.

Juss. (A. indica) flower had anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects in the stressed rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to one of two experimental groups: control or stress. The stress groups were received restraint stress for 3 h. The stressed rats were administered a vehicle, diazepam, fluoxetine, and A. indica at doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg BW for 30 days. The elevated plus-maze test (EPMT), the forced swimming test (FST), and the open field test (OFT) were used to assess anxiolytic and antidepressant-like behaviors. In the EPMT, the percentage of the number of open arm entries and the duration spent in open arms were measured. These measurements were considerably enhanced in the stressed rats treated with diazepam and A. indica flower extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg BW. Furthermore, the stressed rats given fluoxetine and A. indica flower extract at all doses employed in this study showed a significant reduction in the amount of time the rats were immobilized in the FST. However, there was no significant difference in spontaneous locomotor activity between any of the groups. Additionally, the stressed rats treated with either positive control medications or A. indica flower extract exhibited significantly higher brain dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels, but lower blood cortisol levels as compared to the stressed rats treated with vehicle. Moreover, A. indica flower extract had no harmful effect on the stressed rats’ liver tissue.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAzadirachta indica 3ablood 3abrain 3acortisol 3adiazepam 3adopamine 3aelevated plus-maze test 3aflower extracts 3aflowers 3afluoxetine 3aliver 3alocomotion 3amales 3aserotonin 3atranquilizers 0aAzadirachta indica A.

The objective of this study was to compare prececal, cecal, and colonic mean retention time (MRT) with model-derived compartment MRT. A cecally fistulated gelding was fed indigestible particulate and liquid markers to determine TTMRT and dosed with different pairs of particulate and liquid markers into the cecum (hindgut MRT) and into the right ventral colon through the cecocolic orifice (colon MRT). Fecal marker concentrations were fit to stochastic and mechanistic models using nonlinear least squares methods (MATLAB). Total tract MRT and MRT for each GIT segment were compared with model-derived compartment MRT using paired t-test to determine differences and two one-sided tests to determine equivalence. All models resulted in parameter estimates and an acceptable fit to fecal marker excretion curves, but some parameter estimates did not differ from zero (95% CI included 0). Model-derived TTMRT were equivalent (P < .05) to arithmetically calculated MRT. Most GIT segment MRT differed (P < .05) from model-derived compartment MRT. Differences ranged from −26.1 hours to 25.8 hours. In these exploratory data, model derived compartment retention times failed to pair with MRT in different GIT segments. Significant methodological and analytical challenges remain to describe retention time in individual segments of the equine GIT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarithmetics 3acecum 3acolon 3adigesta 3adigestive tract 3aexcretion 3ageldings 3ahindgut 3aleast squares 3aliquids 3amechanistic models 3at-test 0aHorse 0aMathematical modeling 0aMean retention time 0aRate of passage1 aBobel, Jill M.1 aRankins, Ellen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3093-00601 aSanchez, L.

The membrane showed a maximum Cu(II) adsorption capacity of 87.5mg/g in static adsorption, and the adsorption fitted pseudo-second order kinetics and Toth adsorption isotherm. The membranes were then stacked in layers as an adsorber to remove small concentration Cu(II) from water dynamically. At feed concentration of 5mg/L, the adsorber could retain Cu(II) effectively when its thickness reached over 200μm, and the performance was further improved by using more membranes layers. Within a certain limit, the adsorber showed a ‘flow-independent’ loading behavior, an indication of fast mass transfer inside the membrane. The adsorption process was correlated well with bed depth service time (BDST) model, Thomas model and Yoon and Nelson model, and the adsorber was also found to be regenerable and re-usable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achitosan 3acopper 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aporosity 3asilica 3asorption isotherms 0aMembrane adsorber 0aSymmetric structure 0aCopper ions 0aWater treatment 0aBreakthrough curves1 aLi, Yanxiang1 aLi, Haigang1 aYang, Chuanfang0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 146 p.274-281dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011200164300001800276520186400294592002802158650002102186650003802207650001902245650001602264650001502280650001702295650001302312650001702325650001402342650001802356650001702374650001902391650001902410650001502429650001102444650001202455650001402467650001302481650000902494650001202503650001302515650001202528651001802540700002402558700002002582700006102602700006102663773014002724856007902864852000902943655001202952IND60609147720221119145033.0180821e20180724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060914772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b030052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomaki, Yukako10aChlorotyrosines versus Volatile Byproducts from Chlorine Disinfection during Washing of Spinach and Lettuce  ap. 9361-9369.  aFollowing the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 in the U.S., guidelines for disinfection washes in food packaging facilities are under consideration to control pathogen risks. However, disinfectant exposures may need optimization because the high concentrations of chlorine disinfectant promote the formation of high levels of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). When chlorine doses up through the 200 mg/L as Cl₂ range relevant to the current practice were applied to spinach and lettuce, significant DBP formation was observed, even within 5 min at 7 °C. Concentrations of volatile chlorinated DBPs in washwater were far higher than typically observed in disinfected drinking water (e.g., 350 μg/L 1,1-dichloropropanone). However, these DBPs partitioned to the aqueous phase and so represent a greater concern for the disposal or reuse of washwater than for consumer exposure via food. The volatile DBPs represent the low-yield, final products of chlorination reactions with multiple biomolecular precursors. The initial, high-yield transformation products of such reactions may represent a greater concern for consumer exposure because they remain bound within the biopolymers in food and would be liberated during digestion. Using protein-bound tyrosine as an example precursor, the concentrations of the initial 3-chlorotyrosine and 3,5-dichlorotyrosine transformation products from this one precursor in the leaf phase were comparable to, and, in the case of some lettuces, exceeded, the aggregate aqueous concentration of volatile DBPs formed from multiple precursors. Chlorotyrosine formation increased when spinach was shredded due to the greater accessibility of chlorine to proteins in the leaf interiors. The cytotoxicity of chlorotyrosines to Chinese hamster ovary cells was higher than any of the trihalomethanes regulated in drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aFDA Food Safety Modernization Act 3aanimal ovaries 3abiopolymers 3abyproducts 3achlorination 3achlorine 3acytotoxicity 3adigestion 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3afood packaging 3aguidelines 3aleaves 3alettuce 3apathogens 3aproteins 3arisk 3aspinach 3atyrosine 3awashing 3aUnited States1 aSimpson, Adam M.-A.1 aChoe, Jong Kwon1 aPlewa, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8307-16291 aMitch, William A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4917-09380 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 July 24, v. 52, no. 16 p.9361-9369dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b030053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245017600161300001800337520239300355592002802748650001402776650002602790650002302816650002102839650001502860650001502875650001402890650001502904650001302919650001702932700002102949700001902970773014202989856007503131852000903206655001203215IND60768134220221119210855.0220225e20220222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076813422DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta09424f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Baghendra10aRealizing electrochemical transformation of a metal–organic framework precatalyst into a metal hydroxide–oxy(hydroxide) active catalyst during alkaline water oxidation  ap. 3843-3868.  aThe facile and cost-effective designing of electrocatalysts still remains a challenge for electrochemical water oxidation. In the last three decades, a series of earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been explored for electrochemical water oxidation. In this regard, metal–organic framework (MOF) derived catalysts (metal oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides, etc.) with various compositions, desired morphologies, high porosity, large electrochemical surface areas, and tunable properties have been explored for electrochemical water oxidation. MOF-derived catalysts produce excellent electrochemical water oxidation activity in alkaline medium. However, the direct utilization of MOFs for anodic water oxidation has been overlooked for a long time due to their poor stability under electrochemical conditions. Recently, the instability of MOFs has been successfully utilized to produce ultrathin metal hydroxide–(oxy)hydroxide [M(OH)₂–M(O)ₓ(OH)y] nanosheets by electrochemical transformation. The MOF plays the role of a precatalyst and undergoes a series of structural reconstructions like hydrolysis, metal ion leaching, oxidation of the metal ions during alkaline anodic water oxidation and forms the active catalyst M(OH)₂–M(O)ₓ(OH)y. The electrochemically synthesized ultrathin nanosheets demonstrate excellent water oxidation activity and stability because of their atomic-level thickness, large electrochemical surface area, optimum inter-layer distance, and tuned electronic structure. Recently, this strategy has been explored to attain high-quality ultrathin M(OH)₂–M(O)ₓ(OH)y nanosheets for water oxidation. Although tremendous progress has been made in using MOFs as a precatalyst for electrochemical water oxidation, no dedicated review is available in this field. Looking at this point, this review describes a strategy of designing ultrathin M(OH)₂–M(O)ₓ(OH)y nanosheets by the electrochemical transformation of MOFs, the structural and electronic structure modulation of the ultrathin M(OH)₂–M(O)ₓ(OH)y nanosheets, morphological development and their application for electrochemical water oxidation. Moreover, the structure–activity–stability relationship has been established with suitable examples and the recent progress and challenges have also been addressed focusing on the future perspective in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acoordination polymers 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrolysis 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aphosphides 3aporosity 3asurface area1 aYadav, Abhimanyu1 aIndra, Arindam0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 8 p.3843-3868dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta09424f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013200157300001800289520111500307592002801422650001101450650002101461650001401482650001201496700001401508700001801522700001501540700001601555700001401571700001601585700001701601700001401618773014201632856007501774852000901849655001201858IND60768134320221119210937.0220225e20220222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076813432DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta09433e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiubei10aIn situ construction of redox-active covalent organic frameworks/carbon nanotube composites as anodes for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 3989-3995.  aCovalent–organic frameworks (COFs) with reversible redox-active sites showed great potential application in constructing electrode materials of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), whereas their further application is largely restricted by the poor electronic conductivity and sluggish lithium diffusion kinetics. Herein, a new redox-active COF was synthesized and further in situ grown on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with different COF thicknesses as the anode for LIBs. Compared with bulk COFs, COF@CNT composites can provide more exposed and accessible redox-active sites, which is beneficial for obtaining fast Li⁺ diffusion kinetics and the corresponding large capacity. The experimental results demonstrated that COF@CNT composite based anodes achieved a quite good capacity and their capacity can be further enhanced by using COF@CNT with a higher CNT content. The few-layered structure of COF@CNT-2 exhibits larger reversible capacities of 570 mA h g⁻¹ after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g⁻¹ and 373 mA h g⁻¹ after 2000 cycles at 1 A g⁻¹, which is comparable to most previously reported COF electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemistry 3alithium1 aLin, Chao1 aHan, Diandian1 aLi, Gaojie1 aHuang, Chao1 aLiu, Jing1 aWu, Xueling1 aZhai, Lipeng1 aMi, Liwei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 8 p.3989-3995dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta09433e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008600172300001800258520161100276592002801887650001501915650001501930650001901945650001101964650001301975650001101988650002901999650001802028650002402046650001402070650001502084653001902099653001602118653001802134653001402152653002302166700001602189700001602205700001602221773010002237856008702337852000902424655001202433IND60564918920221121145823.0180830e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056491892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.03.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yingying10aScreening of conventional ionic liquids for carbon dioxide capture and separation  ap. 1160-1170.  aCO2 capture and storage could efficiently mitigate CO2 emissions, wherein CO2 capture is a crucial energy-intensive process. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed as potential liquid absorbents for CO2 separation. The CO2 absorption capacity and selectivity of ILs have also been investigated extensively. Although ILs have been screened for CO2 separation, only specific ILs have been examined in terms of energy consumption. In this study, 76 conventional ILs were collected and screened in terms of energy consumption to establish potential ILs for CO2 separation. Seventeen ILs were screened according to the CO2 dissolution enthalpy and CO2 working capacity criteria obtained from the Henry’s law constant in the preliminary screening. Seven ILs were then screened from the 17 ILs according to the CO2 working capacity from the measured CO2 solubility in the final screening. The energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs (i.e., [Emim][NTf2], [Bmim][BF4], [Bmim][PF6], [Bmim][NTf2], [Hmim][NTf2], [Bmpy][NTf2], and [Hmpy][NTf2]) were calculated, and the corresponding gas solubility selectivities were discussed. The energy consumptions and properties of the seven screened ILs were compared with those of the commercial CO2 absorbents of 30wt% MEA, 30wt% MDEA, and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol (Selexol™ or Coastal AGR®). The results showed that the energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs were lower than those of the commercial CO2 absorbents. [Hmpy][NTf2] showed the lowest energy consumption among the seven screened ILs under the operating conditions set in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aethers 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aionic liquids 3apolyethylene glycol 3ascreening 3asolubility 0aCO2 separation 0aCO2 capture 0aIonic liquids 0aScreening 0aEnergy consumption1 aJi, Xiaoyan1 aXie, Yujiao1 aLu, Xiaohua0 tApplied energy.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 162 p.1160-1170dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.03.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009900170300002200269506010400291506007600395520107000471592002801541506003701569650001601606650001701622650001801639650001101657650000901668650001301677653002801690653002901718653001701747653003201764653003701796653002301833653004101856653002201897700002501919700001801944700001901962700002101981700001702002700002102019700002102040700002002061700002502081700002202106700002302128700001902151773010302170856004902273852000902322655001202331IND60781378020221207112020.0220628e20220623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078137802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmer-Javed, Attya10aMobilization-based chemotherapy-free engraftment of gene-edited human hematopoietic stem cells  ap. 2248-2264.e21.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHematopoietic stem/progenitor cell gene therapy (HSPC-GT) is proving successful to treat several genetic diseases. HSPCs are mobilized, harvested, genetically corrected ex vivo, and infused, after the administration of toxic myeloablative conditioning to deplete the bone marrow (BM) for the modified cells. We show that mobilizers create an opportunity for seamless engraftment of exogenous cells, which effectively outcompete those mobilized, to repopulate the depleted BM. The competitive advantage results from the rescue during ex vivo culture of a detrimental impact of mobilization on HSPCs and can be further enhanced by the transient overexpression of engraftment effectors exploiting optimized mRNA-based delivery. We show the therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of hyper IgM syndrome and further developed it in human hematochimeric mice, showing its applicability and versatility when coupled with gene transfer and editing strategies.

In this study, a phenotype-based strategy, coupled with a spray plate method, selected a Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 mutant (6G11) that degrades HMW PAHs but not LMW PAHs. Sequence analysis determined that the mutant was defective in pdoA2, encoding an aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenase (RHO). A series of metabolic comparisons using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that the mutant had a lower rate of degradation of fluorene, anthracene, and pyrene. Unlike the wild type, the mutant did not produce a color change in culture media containing fluorene, phenanthrene, and fluoranthene. An Escherichia coli expression experiment confirmed the ability of the Pdo system to oxidize biphenyl, the LMW PAHs naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and fluorene, and the HMW PAHs pyrene, fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene, with the highest enzymatic activity directed toward three-ring PAHs. Structure analysis and PAH substrate docking simulations of the Pdo substrate-binding pocket rationalized the experimentally observed metabolic versatility on a molecular scale. Using information obtained in this study and from previous work, we constructed an RHO-centric functional map, allowing pleiotropic and epistatic enzymatic explanation of PAH metabolism. Taking the findings together, the Pdo system is an RHO system with the pleiotropic responsibility of LMW PAH-centric hydroxylation, and its epistatic functional contribution is also crucial for the metabolic quality and quantity of the PAH-MN.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiphenyl 3asequence analysis 3ametabolism 3aphenanthrenes 3aanthracenes 3aepistasis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3abacteriology 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acolor 3amutants 3ahydroxylation 3anaphthalene 3aMycobacterium 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3aEscherichia coli 0aphenanthrene1 aKim, Seong-Jae1 aKim, Dae-Wi1 aKim, Jeong Myeong1 aKim, Hyun-lee1 aAhn, Youngbeom1 aSutherland, John B.1 aCerniglia, Carl E.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2014 Oct. 1, v. 196, no. 19 p.3503-3515dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.01945-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009200169506010400261506007600365520111900441592002801560506003701588650001101625650002901636650001501665650001701680650001201697650002301709650002201732650002101754650001201775650001801787650001201805653001801817653001901835653003201854653002301886700002001909700002101929700002901950773011301979856008202092852000902174655001202183IND60791663020221207124328.0220906e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079166302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2022.1086022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVigato, Francesco10aDissolved CO2 profile in bio-succinic acid production from sugars-rich industrial waste  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe inorganic carbon source (CO₂) availability to the microorganisms has a key role in the succinic acid (SA) fermentation process. This study aims to investigate the behavior of the inorganic carbon source for SA production and underline the importance of CO₂ in the fermentation process. The effect of pressure was investigated for CO₂ availability and its overall impact on the fermentation process. Results obtained demonstrated a significant effect of pressure on yield, productivity and CO₂ fixation rate. Industrial waste, rich in maltose, glucose, and sucrose, was used as feedstock combined with a gas mixture of CH₄ and CO₂, which simulated biogas composition. A final titer for succinic acid of 25.5 ± 2.4 g/L was detected at a headspace gas pressure of 1.4 atm. The yield raised from 0.48 g/g sugars to 0.64 and 0.65 g/g sugars when 1.4 and 1.6 atm pressure was applied, respectively. Overall, this study represents one of the first attempts to explore CO₂ availability during succinic acid production, using biogas as a CO₂ source and sugars-rich industrial waste as feedstock.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogas 3adissolved carbon dioxide 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3aglucose 3aheadspace analysis 3aindustrial wastes 3ainorganic carbon 3amaltose 3asuccinic acid 3asucrose 0aSuccinic acid 0aCarbon dioxide 0aActinobacillus succinogenes 0aWaste valorization1 aAngelidaki, I.,1 aWoodley, John M.1 aAlvarado-Morales, Merlin0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2022 Nov., v. 187 p.108602-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2022.1086023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010200163520094000265592002801205650002501233650002501258650001101283650001401294651001801308651001201326773012501338856007301463852000901536655001201545IND60651948120221118033808.0190712e20170512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065194812DNAL7 a10.3390/su90508062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrones, Jonathan S.10aIndustrial Symbiosis in the Upper Valley: A Study of the Casella-Hypertherm Recycling Partnership  aThe Casella-Hypertherm Recycling Partnership (CHRP) is a collaboration between a waste management company and a manufacturer that has created a unique recycling environment for companies in the Upper Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire. This article presents the CHRP as a novel form of industrial symbiosis (IS) using the recently published theoretical framework of IS dynamics proposed by Boons et al. We present this partnership in the academic literature for the first time and also gauge the adequacy of the typology when faced with a new model of IS. We argue that the CHRP exhibits qualities of multiple dynamics, and may in fact be an example of a new dynamic which we call “active facilitation”. Finally, the article also contributes evidence to the Boons et al. generative research question about the relationship between initial conditions and specific dynamics by analyzing the context in which the CHRP emerged.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aindustrial symbiosis 3amodels 3arecycling 3aNew Hampshire 3aVermont0 tSustainability.g2017 May 12, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90508063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011700166300001800283520071900301592002801020650002301048650001801071650002001089650001301109650001001122650001601132650002601148650001101174650001401185700001601199700001801215700001201233773012601245856007401371852000901445655001201454IND60656864620221120070508.0190814e20150409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065686462DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay03061c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalanisamy, Sivakumar10aSurface enhanced Raman scattering-active worm-like Ag clusters for sensitive and selective detection of dopamine  ap. 3438-3447.  aHerein, we have reported worm-like silver (Ag) clusters deposited on glass substrate via radio frequency sputtering for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of dopamine (DA) in the presence of excess ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). The SERS enhancement was optimized by tuning the cluster size and film thickness of Ag by controlling sputtering parameters like time, pressure and power. The selectivity of the optimized Ag thin film for DA detection was studied by adding 100-fold excess of AA and UA. The limit of detection for optimized Ag film was calculated to be 8.3 × 10⁻⁹ M at a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of ∼3.

Constructing functional multi-enzyme systems to mimic natural multi-enzyme complexes is of great interest for multi-enzymatic biosynthesis and cell-free synthetic biotransformation, but with many challenges. Currently, various assembly strategies have been developed based on the interaction of biomacromolecules such as DNA, peptide and scaffolding protein. On the other hand, chemical-induced assembly is based on the affinity of enzymes with small molecules including inhibitors, cofactors and metal ions has the advantage of simplicity, site-to-site oriented structure control and economy. This review summarizes advances and progresses employing these strategies. Furthermore, challenges and perspectives in designing multi-enzyme systems are highlighted.  aThis work was supported by the State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21336009), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.41306124), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No.20720170033), the Foundation of South Oceanographic Research Center of China in Xiamen (No.:14GYY011NF11), and the Public science and technology research funds projects of ocean (No.: 201505032-6).  aPublisher supplied data  a41306124cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21336009cState Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2013121029cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a14GYY011NF11cFoundation of South Oceanographic Research Center of China in Xiamen  a201505032–6cPublic science and technology research funds projects of ocean 3aDNA 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3acatalytic activity 3ametal ions 3apeptides 3ascaffolding proteins 0aMulti-enzyme systems 0aenzyme assembly 0achemical induction 0astructure-function analysis 0adesigned biosynthesis 0acascade reactions1 aZhang, Yong-Hui1 aRen, Hong1 aWang, Ya-Li1 aJiang, Wei1 aFang, Bai-Shan0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2017 Nov. 17, v. 37, no. 8 p.1024-1037dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2017.13038033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012800161300001800289520160600307592002801913650005001941650000901991650001502000650002202015650001202037650001802049650002202067650001002089650001402099650003702113650000902150650001402159650001702173650000902190651001002199700001802209700001802227700001702245700001802262700001802280700001702298700001902315773013502334856008102469852000902550655001202559IND60123742120221122003634.0150331e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012374212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3746-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Zhi10aSpatial and temporal distribution and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediments of Taihu Lake, eastern China  ap. 5350-5358.  aSpatial and temporal distributions of concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments and dated sediment core from Taihu Lake in eastern China were determined. The sum of concentrations of PAHs (sum of total 16 USEPA priority PAH (∑PAHs)) of the entire Taihu Lake ranged from 2.9 × 10²to 8.4 × 10² ng/g dry mass (dm). Concentrations of ∑PAHs in surface sediments near more urbanized regions of the lake shore were greater than those in areas more remote from the urban centers. Temporal trends in concentrations of ∑PAHs ranged from 5.1 × 10²to 1.5 × 10³ ng/g dm, increasing from deeper layers to surface sediments with some fluctuations, especially in the past three decades after the inception of China’s Reform and Opening Up Policy, in which China’s economy and urbanization underwent rapid development. Forensic analysis of surface sediments indicates that PAHs originated primarily from combustion of grass/wood/coal except for the special function water area, which was most likely influenced by petroleum products of traveling vessels. Vertical profiles of relative concentrations of PAHs suggested that the contribution of lesser-molecular-weight PAHs was gradually decreasing, while due to the heavier consumption of petroleum products, the proportion of greater-molecular-weight PAHs was increasing. When assessed by use of the rather conservative, apparent effect threshold method, concentrations of ∑PAHs in sediments from most locations in Taihu Lake are predicted to pose little risk of harm to benthic invertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3acoal 3acombustion 3aforensic sciences 3agrasses 3ainvertebrates 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3apetroleum 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3asediments 3aurbanization 3awood 3aChina1 aGuo, Jianyang1 aLiao, Haiqing1 aZhao, Xiaoli1 aWu, Fengchang1 aZhu, Yuanrong1 aZhang, Liang1 aGiesy, John P.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Apr., v. 22, no. 7 p.5350-5358dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3746-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012300160500001400283520105200297592002801349650002601377650002301403650002601426650001501452650001601467650001401483650001301497650001801510650001501528650004101543650001401584650001601598650001901614650001101633650002001644650001501664700001901679700001601698700002101714700002201735700002001757700001901777700001901796773012301815856007301938852000902011655001202020IND60724431320221122233758.0210122e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072443132DNAL7 a10.3390/d130100242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Ling  Min10aGenome Insights into the Novel Species Jejubacter calystegiae, a Plant Growth-Promoting Bacterium in Saline Conditions  aNAL-light  aJejubacter calystegiae KSNA2ᵀ, a moderately halophilic, endophytic bacterium isolated from beach morning glory (Calystegia soldanella), was determined to be a novel species in a new genus in the family Enterobacteriaceae. To gain insights into the genetic basis of the salinity stress response of strain KSNA2ᵀ, we sequenced its genome using two complementary sequencing platforms (Illumina HiSeq and PacBio RSII). The genome contains a repertoire of metabolic pathways, such as those for nitrogen, phosphorus, and some amino acid metabolism pathways. Functional annotation of the KSNA2ᵀ genome revealed several genes involved in salt tolerance pathways, such as those encoding sodium transporters, potassium transporters, and osmoprotectant enzymes. Plant growth-promoting bacteria-based experiments indicated that strain KSNA2ᵀ promotes the germination of vegetable seeds in saline conditions. Overall, the genetic and biological analyses of strain KSNA2ᵀ provide valuable insights into bacteria-mediated salt tolerance in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalystegia soldanella 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aamino acid metabolism 3aendophytes 3agermination 3anew genus 3anitrogen 3aosmotolerance 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3apotassium 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3astress response 3avegetables1 aLee, Yong-Jae,1 aHan, Ho  Le1 aLee, Myoung  Hui1 aJeong, Jae  Cheol1 aKim, Cha  Young1 aKim, Suk  Weon1 aLee, Ji Young,0 tDiversity.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130100243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009000168300001800258520105300276592002801329596009801357596010201455596013201557596008701689650002101776650001101797650003401808650001701842650002201859650003001881650001001911650001201921650002601933650000701959650001301966650001601979700001601995700001502011700001802026700001302044700001902057700001502076773014602091856008202237852000902319655001202328IND60650408120221119015629.0190710e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065040812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-09947-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Tianzhen10aBiosynthesis of D-danshensu from L-DOPA using engineered Escherichia coli whole cells  ap. 6097-6105.  aD-Danshensu (D-DSS), a traditional Chinese medicine, is used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, current isolation protocols for D-DSS both natural and synthetic are not ideal; therefore, in this study, we have developed a whole-cell biotransformation method to produce D-DSS from L-DOPA. This was done by co-expressing L-amino acid deaminase (aadL), D-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhD), and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh). To begin to optimize the production of D-DSS, varying copy number plasmids were used to express each of the required genes. The resulting strain, Escherichia coli ALG7, which strongly overexpressed aadL, ldhD, and weakly overexpressed gdh, yielded a 378% increase in D-DSS production compared to E. coli ALG1. Furthermore, the optimal reaction conditions for the production of D-DSS were found to be a pH of 7.5, temperature at 35 °C, and 50 g/L wet cells for 12 h. Under these optimized conditions, the D-DSS amount achieved 119.1 mM with an excellent ee (> 99.9%) and a productivity of 9.9 mM/h.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013YQ17052504cNational Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Project of China  aLITE2108-04cnational first-class discipline program of Light Industry Technology and Engineering  aIRT_15R55cthe Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in the University of Ministry of Education of China  a2017ZDCXL-SF-01-02-01cThe Key Project of Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi 3aEscherichia coli 3aL-dopa 3aOriental traditional medicine 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3acerebrovascular disorders 3agenes 3aglucose 3alactate dehydrogenase 3apH 3aplasmids 3atemperature1 aJiang, Jing1 aBai, Yajun1 aFan, Tai-ping1 aZhao, Ye1 aZheng, Xiaohui1 aCai, Yujie0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 Aug., v. 103, no. 15 p.6097-6105dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09947-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002900132024002200161024001900183040001800202100001300220245010000233300001300333500001900346506007600365506017300441520126800614506003701882650002201919650001501941650001401956650001301970650003701983650002502020650001402045650001102059650001902070651001002089700001802099700001502117700001502132700001902147700001502166700001602181700001802197773009502215856011202310856004202422956008602464961000902550852000902559655001202568IND50090676620221214230858.0140625e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009067662DNAL7 a3033592aris7 a10113/589762hdl7 a10.1155/2014/3027532doi7 aPMC40554682pmcid7 a249829392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jun10aCultivar Evaluation and Essential Test Locations Identification for Sugarcane Breeding in China  ap. 1-10.  aArticle 302753  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aUsing a genotype main effect plus genotype-environment interaction (GGE) biplot software, the yield performance data of seven sugarcane cultivars in the 8th Chinese National Sugarcane Area Trials were analyzed to identify cultivars recommended for commercial release.

Significantly different sugar and cane yields were encountered across seasons due to strong cultivar-environment interactions. Three areas, including Guangxi Chongzuo, Guangxi Baise, Guangxi Hechi, showed better representativeness of cane and sugar yields than the other four areas. On the other hand, areas Guangxi Chongzuo, Yunnan Lincang, and Yunnan Baoshan showed strong discrimination ability, while areas Guangxi Hechi and Guangxi Liuzhou showed poor discrimination ability. It is concluded that the GGE-Biplot software is an intuitive and effective tool for evaluating yielding ability and stability of sugarcane cultivars in multi-area varietal trials.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer software 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agermplasm evaluation 3asugarcane 3asugars 3avariety trials 3aChina1 aPan, Yong-Bao1 aXu, Liping1 aZhang, Hua1 aYuan, Zhaonian1 aDeng, Zuhu1 aChen, Rukai1 aQue, Youxiong0 tThe scientific world journal.g2014 May 20, v. 2014 p.1-10wJournal:27586x1537-744X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/589763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/302753  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/303359.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245006800176300001800244520139900262536021001661592002801871596003301899650002801932650002601960650002401986650002202010650001902032650001802051650002302069650002502092650001502117650002302132650002402155650001402179650001302193653001402206653002602220653001302246653002502259700001702284700002402301700002202325773012802347856008502475852000902560655001202569IND60689225120221123035530.0200420e20171117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922512DNAL7 a10.1080/07388551.2017.13038042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, Kashyap Kumar10aBiotherapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of colchicine  ap. 1038-1047.  aCancer is a clinical situation caused by uncontrolled cell division and is responsible for a large number of deaths worldwide. Colchicine is a classical antimitotic, tubulin-binding agent (TBA) which is being explored for its antitumor activities, although its tubulin-binding ability leads to some toxicity toward normal cells proliferation. Colchicine derivatives are considered as potent antitumor compounds with less toxicity compared to colchicine. Derivatives with substituted functional groups at A-ring (methoxy), B-ring (acetamide) or C-ring (methoxy) have been synthesized via chemical and microbial routes and show modified bioactivities and altered tropolonic functionality. Earlier reports, in combination with our group’s research findings, suggest that microbial biotransformation is an efficient choice for the production of bioactive colchicine derivatives. This route has gained significant interest in the mass production of regio-specific, cost-effective, safe and eco-friendly derivatives. The present review paper critically analyzes and discusses the development and application of colchicine derivatives as a potent antitumor molecule and their production through a microbial transformation process. The information provided in this review might assist in the stimulation of new ideas regarding the development of alternative therapeutic agent(s) for cancer treatment.  aThe authors (KKD and PS) sincere thanks to the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India and Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India for providing necessary support.  aPublisher supplied data  cMaharshi Dayanand University 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3abioactive compounds 3abiotransformation 3acancer therapy 3acell division 3acell proliferation 3achemical derivatives 3acolchicine 3acost effectiveness 3amechanism of action 3aneoplasms 3atoxicity 0aantitumor 0atubulin-binding agent 0aalkaloid 0atropolonic alkaloids1 aKumar, Punit1 aLabrou, Nikolaos E.1 aShukla, Pratyoosh0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2017 Nov. 17, v. 37, no. 8 p.1038-1047dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2017.13038043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012000158300001800278500002000296520162200316592002801938596005501966596005902021596006902080596007502149650002202224650002002246650001502266650001202281650001902293650001102312650001102323650000702334650001802341650001602359650001302375700005602388700001402444700001802458700001502476773015102491856007302642852000902715655001202724IND60693524720221120192854.0200507e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069352472DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.63752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qingyun10aDissolution kinetics of calcium vanadates in sulfuric acid: a fundamental study for the vanadium extraction process  ap. 1773-1780.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The dissolution behavior of calcium vanadates is vital for the vanadium extraction process, as well as the utilization of calcium vanadates based function materials. Therefore, the dissolution kinetics study of calcium vanadates (CaV₂O₆, Ca₂V₂O₇, and Ca₃V₂O₈) in sulfuric acid are presented. The effects of stirring speed, solid/liquid ratio, pH, and temperature on the dissolution rate of calcium vanadates were determined. The mineralogical and microstructure of the residue after dissolution are also performed. RESULTS: The results showed that the dissolution rate of calcium vanadates significantly increased with the increase of temperature from 30 to 70 °C. Under the conditions with solid/liquid ratio of 1:150 g mL⁻¹, temperature range of 30 to 70 °C, and pH of 4, the rate of Ca₃V₂O₈ dissolution is the fastest, followed by Ca₂V₂O₇ and CaV₂O₆, especially at low temperature. CONCLUSION: The mineralogical analyses results showed that the main products for the dissolution of Ca₂V₂O₇ and Ca₃V₂O₈ are needle‐like CaSO₄·0.5H₂O, whereas for CaV₂O₆ are undissolved CaV₂O₆ and hydrolyzed V₂O₅. The dissolution kinetics indicate that the dissolution of CaV₂O₆ follows second‐order pseudo‐homogeneous model, whilst Ca₂V₂O₇ and Ca₃V₂O₈ follow the diffusion through the product or ash layer model. The apparent activation energies for the dissolution of CaV₂O₆, Ca₂V₂O₇, and Ca₃V₂O₈ were determined as 46.44, 38.72, and 23.50 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2018M640898cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a51974053cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  acstc2019jcyj‐bshX0068cNatural Science Foundation of Chongqing  a2018YFC1900500cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aactivation energy 3acalcium sulfate 3ahydrolysis 3aliquids 3amicrostructure 3amixing 3amodels 3apH 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3avanadium1 aXiang, Junyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2327-72271 aWang, Xin1 aPei, Guishang1 aLv, Xuewei0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2020 June, v. 95, no. 6 p.1773-1780dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.63753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245017700199300001800376500002000394520184000414592002802254596003602282650002502318650001602343650002502359650001302384650002102397650002102418650001502439650003802454650001802492650002402510650001302534650002702547650002502574650001502599650001902614650001302633650001602646650002302662650002102685700002002706700002202726700002002748700003002768773015102798856007302949852000903022655001203031IND60693524820221120193024.0200507e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069352482DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.63572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Andrés F1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0666-100510aEvaluation of poly(3‐hydroxybutyrate) solubility in non‐halogenated solvents to achieve an environmentally friendly recovery process from Burkholderia cepacia B27 cells  ap. 1657-1665.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Poly(3‐hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) is a biopolymer of bacterial origin widely studied for its physicochemical characteristics, biocompatibility, nontoxicity and biodegradability. Unfortunately, there is no extraction and purification process that allows sustainable large‐scale production of the biopolymer. RESULTS: The solubility of P3HB in several non‐halogenated solvents was studied to achieve a novel and environmentally friendly methodology for polymer solvent extraction from bacterial cells. Acetic acid, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and methyl ethyl ketone were selected using theoretical approximations for the experimental evaluation of solubility at various temperatures, concentrations and incubation times with a complete general factorial experimental design. The results were interpreted with analysis of variance to evaluate the influence of each factor on the solubility. It was determined that at temperatures above 90 °C, acetic acid has a high P3HB solubilization efficiency, which makes it an excellent candidate for an environmentally friendly solvent‐extraction process. The mass yield of the extraction process with the new procedure was 54.8% compared to 59.9% for the standard chloroform solvent‐extraction process. Also, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry showed thermal behavior to be similar between P3HB recovered using chloroform and acetic acid extraction. CONCLUSIONS: P3HB extraction from Burkholderia cepacia cells using acetic acid extraction and methanol purification is a promising method for large‐scale biopolymer production due to the elimination of hazardous solvents from the process. However, polymer purity and yield are slightly affected compared to the conventional chloroform extraction process. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cNational University of Colombia 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aacetic acid 3aanalysis of variance 3abacteria 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3achloroform 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethyl acetate 3aexperimental design 3amethanol 3apoly-3-hydroxybutyrate 3apurification methods 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry1 aMuñoz, Melissa1 aEspinosa, Armando1 aCabeza, Iván O1 aMoreno‐Sarmiento, Nubia0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2020 June, v. 95, no. 6 p.1657-1665dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.63573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245004500169300001600214520135500230592002801585650001101613650001201624650001901636650001801655650001101673650001301684650001501697650001401712651000901726653001501735653001501750653001801765653002201783653001701805653001301822653001801835700001901853773009301872856008401965852000902049655001202058IND60121925720221120130701.0150325e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012192572DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2012.7453892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyler, Stephen12aA framework for urban climate resilience  ap. 311-326.  aClimate change will have unavoidable impacts on urban systems and populations, especially in Asia where many large cities are exposed. Climate adaptation will be essential, and planning for adaptation can be simplified through operationalizing concepts of climate resilience and vulnerability. This article reviews concepts and theories in a range of diverse fields to illustrate how the general notion of urban climate resilience can be developed into an operational framework for planning practitioners. The framework integrates theoretical and empirical knowledge of the factors contributing to resilience with processes for translating those concepts into practice. The framework includes characteristics of urban systems, the agents (people and organizations) that depend on and manage those systems, institutions that link systems and agents, and patterns of exposure to climate change. It operationalizes these concepts through structured and iterative shared learning approaches that allow local planners to define these factors in their own context, in order to develop practical strategies for local action. The viability of the framework is demonstrated through examples from resilience planning activities undertaken in 10 cities across Asia through the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aorganizations 3apeople 3aplanning 3apopulation 3aviability 3aAsia 0aresilience 0aadaptation 0aurban systems 0aadaptive capacity 0ainstitutions 0aplanning 0avulnerability1 aMoench, Marcus0 tClimate and development.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 4, no. 4 p.311-326dRoutledgex1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2012.7453893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245013500173300001800308520146900326592002801795596005101823650002401874650002001898650002201918650001301940650001201953650001501965650001001980650001101990650001302001650001202014650001102026650001902037650001002056650001602066650001502082650001602097650002002113650001702133650002002150650001102170650001102181650001002192700001902202700006102221773010702282856008202389852000902471655001202480IND60674985920221119101405.0191031e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067498592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-019-01397-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutthinon, Pornsawan10aPollen development in male sterile mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) and male fertile seashore mangosteen (Garcinia celebica L.)  ap. 1545-1556.  aMangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) is an economically important tropical fruit, yet the reproductive biology of this dioecious plant is complex. Male trees are not known, and female trees have sterile anthers leading to apomixis. We hypothesized that pollen abortion in mangosteen is due to altered tapetum activity during microgametogenesis. Developmental events at the cellular and sub-cellular levels during pollen development in G. mangostana were therefore examined and compared with seashore mangosteen (G. celebica L.), a closely related species with fertile anthers. In G. mangostana, the microspore mother cell had disorganized cytoplasm, including lack of Golgi apparatus and its vesicles, as well as abnormal callose wall accumulation. Globular droplets, which resembled orbicules or Ubisch bodies, were abundant in the locule, including pre-Ubisch bodies found along the tapetal plasma membrane. The tapetum of G. mangostana underwent cell death earlier than the fertile G. celebica, and during the premature death, the mitochondria had dramatically altered shapes. Low accumulation of starch in collapsed microspore mother cells and tetrad cell remnants also suggested that altered cell metabolism is related to pollen abortion in mangosteen. The present results demonstrate the importance of coordinated development between the tapetum and microspores in pollen development and provide new insights into male sterility in mangosteen (G. mangostana).  aPublisher supplied data  a-cScience Achievement Scholarship of Thailand 3aGarcinia mangostana 3aGolgi apparatus 3aabortion (plants) 3aapomixis 3acallose 3acell death 3adeath 3adioecy 3adroplets 3afemales 3afruits 3amale sterility 3amales 3amangosteens 3ametabolism 3amicrospores 3amicrosporocytes 3amitochondria 3aplasma membrane 3apollen 3astarch 3atrees1 aSamuels, Lacey1 aMeesawat, Upatham1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2207-21900 tProtoplasma.g2019 Nov., v. 256, no. 6 p.1545-1556dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-019-01397-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009900172300001300271520144100284592002801725650001101753650002601764650001101790650001401801650000901815650001401824650001201838650001501850650001501865651001101880653001401891653001401905653001801919653003001937653001401967653001201981700001901993700002002012773008402032856008502116852000902201655001202210IND60531227320221122141816.0190403e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053122732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2016.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuszyński, Filip10aUnderground erosion and sand removal from a sandstone tableland, Stołowe Mountains, SW Poland  ap. 1-15.  aModels of geomorphic evolution of tablelands vary as far as the patterns of cliff line degradation and hence, scarp retreat are concerned. Among surface processes rock slope failures from caprock cliffs, often induced by preferential seepage from rock faces, are emphasized. In this paper evidence is provided that mechanical removal of sand from inside the caprock through underground erosion may also play an important role in the long-term evolution of cliffed escarpments in sandstone tablelands. More than 140 sandy cones and nearly 80 sand sheets emerging from fissures in the sandstone cap were mapped and measured along six cliff sections of variable length in the Stołowe Mountains tableland in SW Poland. The density of sandy accumulation forms varies along the cliff length, with cones preferentially associated with intact cliffs and sand sheets being more common along degraded cliff sections. Further redistribution of sand downslope results in widespread sandy covers below cliff lines which extend for a few hundred metres and are 1–3m thick, as demonstrated by electrical resistivity tomography. Sand removal from caprock accounts for progressive, non-catastrophic degradation of tableland margins through gradual subsidence of blocky compartments and the development of ruiniform relief behind the cliff lines. Thus, it may be an important component of long-term evolution of stepped relief in sedimentary terrains.  aPublisher supplied data 3acliffs 3aelectrical resistance 3amodels 3amountains 3asand 3asandstone 3aseepage 3asubsidence 3atomography 3aPoland 0aTableland 0aSandstone 0aScarp retreat 0aGroundwater geomorphology 0aSuffosion 0aSudetes1 aMigoń, Piotr,1 aKasprzak, Marek0 tCatena.g2016 Dec., v. 147 p.1-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245017300163520128000336592002801616650001501644650002801659650001701687650002401704650001401728650002901742650001201771650003501783650002201818650001501840650002101855650002001876650001501896651001201911700001901923700002001942700002201962700002601984700001802010773012502028856007302153852000902226655001202235IND60651948620221118033914.0190712e20170513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065194862DNAL7 a10.3390/su90508132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Quang-Khanh12aA Novel Hybrid Approach Based on Instance Based Learning Classifier and Rotation Forest Ensemble for Spatial Prediction of Rainfall-Induced Shallow Landslides using GIS  aThis study proposes a novel hybrid machine learning approach for modeling of rainfall-induced shallow landslides. The proposed approach is a combination of an instance-based learning algorithm (k-NN) and Rotation Forest (RF), state of the art machine techniques that have seldom explored for landslide modeling. The Lang Son city area (Vietnam) is selected as a case study. For this purpose, a spatial database for the study area was constructed, and then was used to build and evaluate the hybrid model. Performance of the model was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), area under the ROC curve (AUC), success rate and prediction rate, and several statistical evaluation metrics. The results showed that the model has high performance with both the training data (AUC = 0.948) and the validation data (AUC = 0.848). The results were compared with those obtained from soft computing techniques, i.e. Random Forest, J48 Decision Trees, and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks. Overall, the performance of the proposed model is better than those obtained from the above methods. Therefore, the proposed model is a promising tool for landslide modeling. The research result can be highly useful for land use planning and management in landslide prone areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acase studies 3acomputer techniques 3adatabases 3adecision support systems 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3aland use planning 3alandslides 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aVietnam1 aTien Bui, Dieu1 aHoang, Nhat-Duc1 aTrinh, Phan Trong1 aNguyễn, Việt Hà,1 aYilmaz, Isık0 tSustainability.g2017 May 13, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90508133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245013100169300002000300500001900320520208900339592002802428650001502456650001502471650001902486650002302505650001602528650001302544700001802557700002102575700005602596773013902652856008102791852000902872655001202881IND60713716320221123040137.0201027e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071371632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c070622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAksu, Gokhan Onder10aComputational Selection of High-Performing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Adsorption and Membrane-Based CO₂/H₂ Separation  ap. 22577-22590.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCovalent organic frameworks (COFs) have high potential in gas separation technologies because of their porous structures, large surface areas, and good stabilities. The number of synthesized COFs already reached several hundreds, but only a handful of materials were tested as adsorbents and/or membranes. We used a high-throughput computational screening approach to uncover adsorption-based and membrane-based CO₂/H₂ separation potentials of 288 COFs, representing the highest number of experimentally synthesized COFs studied to date for precombustion CO₂ capture. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed to assess CO₂/H₂ mixture separation performances of COFs for five different cyclic adsorption processes: pressure swing adsorption, vacuum swing adsorption, temperature swing adsorption (TSA), pressure−temperature swing adsorption (PTSA), and vacuum−temperature swing adsorption (VTSA). The results showed that many COFs outperform traditional zeolites in terms of CO₂ selectivities and working capacities and PTSA is the best process leading to the highest adsorbent performance scores. Combining GCMC and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, CO₂ and H₂ permeabilities and selectivities of COF membranes were calculated. The majority of COF membranes surpass Robeson’s upper bound because of their higher H₂ permeabilities compared to polymers, indicating that the usage of COFs has enormous potential to replace current materials in membrane-based H₂/CO₂ separation processes. Performance analysis based on the structural properties showed that COFs with narrow pores [the largest cavity diameter (LCD) < 15 Å] and low porosities (ϕ < 0.75) are the top adsorbents for selective separation of CO₂ from H₂, whereas materials with large pores (LCD > 20 Å) and high porosities (ϕ > 0.85) are generally the best COF membranes for selective separation of H₂ from CO₂. These results will help to speed up the engineering of new COFs with desired structural properties to achieve high-performance CO₂/H₂ separations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3amolecular dynamics 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aDaglar, Hilal1 aAltintas, Cigdem1 aKeskin, Seda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5968-03360 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Sept. 18, v. 124, no. 41 p.22577-22590dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c070623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245014100205300001800346520114600364592002801510596005901538650001501597650001301612650001301625700001401638700001601652700001601668773012101684856008301805852000901888655001201897IND60769595820221122230617.0220308e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076959582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-06996-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haikuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2173-189210aTwo barbituric acid–polyoxometalate hybrids with morphology-tunable supramolecular self-assemblies for the degradation of organic dyes  ap. 5410-5425.  aSupramolecular hybrid materials based on polyoxometalates (POMs) have attracted intense attention, due to their wide range of unique properties and potential applications. However, the relationships between supramolecular structures and influencing factors are challenging to determine. To provide a deeper understanding, this work discusses how molecular structures and solution components affect the self-assembly process of two barbituric acid–POM hybrids. We have designed and synthesized two barbituric acid–POM hybrids with similar molecular structures. The morphologies of the hybrids in the supramolecular self-assembly were closely investigated under various solvent conditions. The correlation between supramolecular structures and molecular structures and solution components was examined. The barbituric acid–POM hybrids, prepared in methanol/chloroform mixed solution at a volume ratio of 1:3, could be potentially used as effective catalysts for the degradation of organic dyes. This study provides a protocol for preparing supramolecular hybrid materials with controlled supramolecular structures or peculiar properties.  aPublisher supplied data  a21802127cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3achloroform 3amethanol 3asolvents1 aWang, Kai1 aZhang, Chen1 aZhang, Huan0 tJournal of materials science.g2022 Mar., v. 57, no. 9 p.5410-5425dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-06996-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245015500169300001600324500002000340520155600360592002801916596004801944650002101992650001602013650001602029650001102045650001402056650001502070650001502085650001202100650001102112650001602123650001502139650001702154650001102171650001802182650001402200650002902214650001502243650001102258700002102269700002402290700002402314700002102338700003102359700002002390700001702410700002902427700002002456700002402476700003002500700001602530773012802546856008002674852000902754655001202763IND60792491420221120093843.0220906e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079249142DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.122762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrüppel, Katharina10aPathways and substrate‐specific regulation of amino acid degradation in Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395 (archetype of the marine Roseobacter clade)  ap. 218-238.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCombining omics and enzymatic approaches, catabolic routes of nine selected amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, histidine, lysine and threonine) were elucidated in substrate‐adapted cells of Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395 (displaying conspicuous morphotypes). The catabolic network [excluding tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle] was reconstructed from 71 genes (scattered across the chromosome; one‐third newly assigned), with 69 encoded proteins and 20 specific metabolites identified, and activities of 10 different enzymes determined. For example, Ph. inhibens DSM 17395 does not degrade lysine via the widespread saccharopine pathway but might rather employ two parallel pathways via 5‐aminopentanoate or 2‐aminoadipate. Tryptophan degradation proceeds via kynurenine and 2‐aminobenzoate; the latter is metabolized as known from Azoarcus evansii. Histidine degradation is analogous to the Pseudomonas‐type Hut pathway via N‐formyl‐l‐glutamate. For threonine, only one of the three genome‐predicted degradation pathways (employing threonine 3‐dehydrogenase) is used. Proteins of the individual peripheral degradation sequences in Ph. inhibens DSM 17395 were apparently substrate‐specifically formed contrasting the non‐modulated TCA cycle enzymes. Comparison of genes for the reconstructed amino acid degradation network in Ph. inhibens DSM 17395 across 27 other complete genomes of Roseobacter clade members revealed most of them to be widespread among roseobacters.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFB TRR 51cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aAzoarcus evansii 3aRoseobacter 3achromosomes 3agenome 3ahistidine 3aisoleucine 3akynurenine 3aleucine 3alysine 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3amicrobiology 3amorphs 3aphenylalanine 3athreonine 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3atryptophan 3avaline1 aHensler, Michael1 aTrautwein, Kathleen1 aKoßmehl, Sebastian1 aWöhlbrand, Lars1 aSchmidt‐Hohagen, Kerstin1 aUlbrich, Marcus1 aBergen, Nils1 aMeier‐Kolthoff, Jan P.1 aGöker, Markus,1 aKlenk, Hans‐Peter1 aSchomburg, D.q(Dietmar),1 aRabus, Ralf0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2014 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.218-238dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.122763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245010300210300001800313506007600331520168000407592002802087506003702115650002402152650001302176650001602189650001402205650002102219650001802240650001102258650002002269650001602289650002002305650001602325650001102341653002002352653002602372653002602398653002402424653002602448700002102474700002102495700002102516773017402537856007902711852000902790655001202799IND60178571120221207081210.0150604e20140429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017857112DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14025851112doi7 aPMC40359582pmcid7 a247339122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBranciamore, Sergio10aEnhanced evolution by stochastically variable modification of epigenetic marks in the early embryo  ap. 6353-6358.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEvolution by gene duplication is generally accepted as one of the crucial driving forces for the gain of new complexity and functions, but the formation of pseudogenes remains a problem for this mechanism. Here we expand on earlier ideas that epigenetic modifications can drive neo- and subfunctionalization in evolution by gene duplication. We explore the effects of stochastic epigenetic modifications on the evolution (and thus development) of complex organisms in a constant environment. Modeling is done both using a modified genetic drift analytical treatment and computer simulations, which were found to agree. A transposon silencing model is also explored. Some key assumptions made include (i) stochastic, incomplete removal (or addition) of repressive epigenetic marks takes place during a window(s) of opportunity in the zygote and early embryo; (ii) there is no statistical variation of the marks after the window closes; and (iii) the genes affected are sensitive to dosage. Our genetic drift treatment takes into account that after gene duplication the prevailing case upon which selection operates is a duplicate/singlet heterozygote; to the best of our knowledge, this has not been considered in previous treatments. We conclude from our modeling that stochastic epigenetic modifications, with rates consistent with experimental observation, can both increase the rate of gene fixation and decrease pseudogenization, thus dramatically improving the efficacy of evolution by gene duplication. We also find that a transposon silencing model is advantageous for fixation of recessive genes in diploid organisms, especially with large effective population sizes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer simulation 3adiploidy 3aepigenetics 3aevolution 3agene duplication 3agenetic drift 3amodels 3apopulation size 3apseudogenes 3arecessive genes 3atransposons 3azygote 0aDNA methylation 0amathematical modeling 0acomputational biology 0amolecular evolution 0adevelopmental biology1 aRodin, Andrei S.1 aRiggs, Arthur D.1 aRodin, Sergei N.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Apr. 29, v. 111, no. 17 p.6353-6358dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14025851113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002700153245016100180300001400341520102200355592002801377650001001405650004601415650001001461650001501471650001901486650001801505650001701523650001201540650001101552650001201563650002601575650001401601650001301615650001901628700002101647700001801668773008401686856008901770852000901859655001201868IND4492502820221121105717.0150808e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449250282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreshty, M.

The present study is aimed at harvesting the benefits of synergism between the wild-type Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis-H14 (Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus-2362 (Bs) strains by evaluating six different combinations of mixtures toxic to Aedes and Culex mosquito larvae. Isobolographic analysis was performed to distinguish the synergistic combinations of Bti and Bs, followed by determination of the degree of synergism through synergy and improvement factors.

This study aimed to determine the current state of knowledge regarding parasites of the Southern Hemisphere freshwater fish family Galaxiidae, in order to identify knowledge gaps to focus future research attention. Specifically, we assessed how galaxiid–parasite knowledge differs among geographic regions in relation to research effort (i.e., number of studies or fish individuals examined, extent of tissue examination, taxonomic resolution), in addition to ecological traits known to influence parasite richness. To date, ~50% of galaxiid species have been examined for parasites, though the majority of studies have focused on single parasite taxa rather than assessing the full diversity of macro- and microparasites. The highest number of parasites were observed from Argentinean galaxiids, and studies in all geographic regions were biased towards the highly abundant and most widely distributed galaxiid species, Galaxias maculatus. Parasite diversity generally increased with the number of studies and individual fish examined, however studies which examined parasites from all body tissues could overcome the effects of low study effort. In order to promote further understanding of galaxiid–parasite biodiversity, we provide a series of recommendations, including the use of molecular techniques to verify parasite identity, and highlight the future roles both fish biologists and parasitologists can play.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalaxias maculatus 3abiodiversity 3afreshwater fish 3aparasites1 aViozzi, Gustavo  P.1 aRauque, Carlos  A.1 aFlores, Verónica  R.1 aPoulin, Robert 0 tDiversity.g2021 Jan. 14, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130100273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245016800165300001600333500002000349520137900369592002801748596006601776596005801842596002201900596006901922650000801991650001901999650001202018650001402030650001402044650001002058650000902068650001702077650001702094650001302111650000902124650002102133650002002154650001402174650002002188650001102208650001202219700001902231700001802250700001702268700002002285700002302305700002202328700001702350700002202367773012802389856008002517852000902597655001202606IND60792491520221120185819.0220906e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079249152DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.122772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, So‐Jeong10aMetabolic versatility of toluene‐degrading, iron‐reducing bacteria in tidal flat sediment, characterized by stable isotope probing‐based metagenomic analysis  ap. 189-204.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDNA stable isotope probing and metagenomic sequencing were used to assess the metabolic potential of iron‐reducing bacteria involved in anaerobic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation in oil spill‐affected tidal flats. In a microcosm experiment, ¹³C‐toluene was degraded with the simultaneous reduction of Fe(III)‐NTA, which was also verified by quasi‐stoichiometric ¹³C‐CO₂ release. The metabolic potential of the dominant member affiliated with the genus Desulfuromonas in the heavy DNA fraction was inferred using assembled scaffolds (designated TF genome, 4.40 Mbp with 58.8 GC mol%), which were obtained by Illumina sequencing. The gene clusters with peripheral pathways for toluene and benzoate conversion possessed the features of strict and facultative anaerobes. In addition to the class II‐type benzoyl‐CoA reductase (Bam) of strict anaerobes, the class I‐type (Bcr) of facultative anaerobes was encoded. Genes related to the utilization of various anaerobic electron acceptors, including iron, nitrate (to ammonia), sulfur and fumarate, were identified. Furthermore, genes encoding terminal oxidases (caa₃, cbb₃ and bd) and a diverse array of genes for oxidative stress responses were detected in the TF genome. This metabolic versatility may be an adaptation to the fluctuating availability of electron acceptors and donors in tidal flats.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF‐2013R1A2A2A05006754cNational Research Foundation (NRF)  cMinistry of Education, Science, and Technology (MEST)  cBK21 Plus program  aNIBR no. 2013‐02‐055cMinistry of Environment (MOE) of Korea 3aDNA 3aDesulfuromonas 3aammonia 3aanaerobes 3afumarates 3agenes 3airon 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiology 3anitrates 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3aoxidoreductases 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3asulfur 3atoluene1 aPark, Soo‐Je1 aCha, In‐Tae1 aMin, Deullae1 aKim, Jin‐Seog1 aChung, Won‐Hyung1 aChae, Jong‐Chan1 aJeon, Che Ok1 aRhee, Sung‐Keun0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2014 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.189-204dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.122773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009300165300001800258500001100276520158700287592002801874596005901902596006901961596008302030650001502113650002002128650001302148650001502161650001602176650002502192650001602217650002702233650001202260650002502272650002402297650001502321650001502336650001502351700001802366700001402384700001502398700001602413700001302429700001402442700001702456773014602473856008202619852000902701655001202710IND60650408620221119015938.0190710e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065040862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-09927-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Adil10aUpdates in understanding the hypocholesterolemia effect of probiotics on atherosclerosis  ap. 5993-6006.  aReview  aAtherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular diseases, which are considered the fatal ailment globally. Hypercholesterolaemia plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Many studies have been stated that probiotics could affect hypercholesterolemia via cholesterol metabolism. Probiotics are live bacteria which are good for our health when administered orally in high amounts. Recently, many studies have revealed the beneficial effects of the nutritional ingestion of probiotics which can decrease serum cholesterol levels. The aim of this review is, firstly, to explore the hypercholesterolemia effect of how it progresses into atherosclerosis and, secondly, to summarize the hypocholesterolaemia effect of probiotics on atherosclerosis and the up-to-date information on their basic mechanisms. The most important mechanisms responsible for the hypocholesterolemic effect of probiotics are the suppression of the reabsorption of bile acids and inhibition of the intestinal cholesterol absorption. Current studies indicate that numerous mechanisms within the cholesterol metabolism, e.g., ones involving the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and 7α- and 27α-hydroxylases, have been recommended where regulation may take place after oral intake of probiotics. However, these mechanisms are still poorly understood. Thus, further studies are required to examine the possible mechanisms, whereby probiotics can be utilized safely and considered for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.  aPublisher supplied data  a11572064cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFC1102305cthe National Key Technology R&D Program of China  a2018CDPTCG0001-10cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aabsorption 3aatherosclerosis 3abacteria 3abile acids 3ablood serum 3acholesteremic effect 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3aenzymes 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ahypocholesterolemia 3aintestines 3aprobiotics 3aresorption1 aDin, Ahmad Ud1 aZhu, Yuan1 aZhang, Kun1 aLi, Tianhan1 aWang, Yi1 aLuo, Yang1 aWang, Guixue0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 Aug., v. 103, no. 15 p.5993-6006dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09927-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03757naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245015100175300001800326520225200344592002802596650001302624650001702637650002202654650002602676650001002702650002602712650001902738650002302757650002502780650002202805650002202827650002002849650001802869650002102887650001302908650002002921651001202941651001602953651001202969700002702981700002103008700002103029773013503050856008103185852000903266655001203275IND60123742820221122031017.0150331e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012374282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3758-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlichenko, Vasiliy V.10aIdentification of a putatively multixenobiotic resistance related Abcb1 transporter in amphipod species endemic to the highly pristine Lake Baikal  ap. 5453-5468.  aThe fauna of Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia, the largest freshwater body on Earth, is characterized by high degrees of biodiversity and endemism. Amphipods, a prominent taxon within the indigenous fauna, occur in an exceptionally high number of endemic species. Considering the specific water chemistry of Lake Baikal with extremely low levels of potentially toxic natural organic compounds, it seems conceivable that certain adaptions to adverse environmental factors are missing in endemic species, such as cellular defense mechanisms mitigating toxic effects of chemicals. The degree to which the endemic fauna is affected by the recently occurring anthropogenic water pollution of Lake Baikal may depend on the existence of such cellular defense mechanisms in those species. We here show that endemic amphipods express transcripts for Abcb1, a major component of the cellular multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) defense against toxic chemicals. Based on a partial abcb1 cDNA sequence from Gammarus lacustris, an amphipod species common across Northern Eurasia but only rarely found in Lake Baikal, respective homologous sequences were cloned from five amphipods endemic to Lake Baikal, Eulimnogammarus verrucosus, E. vittatus, E. cyaneus, E. marituji, and Gmelinoides fasciatus, confirming that abcb1 is transcribed in those species. The effects of thermal (25 °C) and chemical stress (1–2 mg L⁻¹phenanthrene) in short-term exposures (up to 24 h) on transcript levels of abcb1 and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), used as a proxy for cellular stress in the experiments, were exemplarily examined in E. verrucosus, E. cyaneus, and Gammarus lacustris. Whereas increases of abcb1 transcripts upon treatments occurred only in the Baikalian species E. verrucosus and E. cyaneus but not in Gammarus lacustris, changes of hsp70 transcript levels were seen in all three species. At least for species endemic to Lake Baikal, the data thus indicate that regulation of the identified amphipod abcb1 is triggered within the general cellular stress response. This is the first report presenting molecular data on a MXR transporter in amphipods, an ecotoxicologically important but with regard to gene sequence data comparatively little explored taxon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus 3abiodiversity 3acomplementary DNA 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ahydrochemistry 3aindigenous species 3anucleotide sequences 3aorganic compounds 3asequence homology 3astress response 3asurface water 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3aEurasia 3aLake Baikal 3aSiberia1 aProtopopova, Marina V.1 aTimofeyev, Maxim1 aLuckenbach, Till0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Apr., v. 22, no. 7 p.5453-5468dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3758-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148242049000204245010600694300001800800520188000818592002802698650001302726650001202739650002002751650002902771650001502800650002402815650002402839650002102863700001802884700002002902700001902922700001602941773012802957856008303085852000903168655001203177IND60674986320221119101956.0200315e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067498632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-019-02004-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, E.

Modelling the effectiveness of groundwater management scenarios  ap. 2447-2470.  aIn contrast to management optimisation methods, which quantify decision variables to create plans, this study does not seek the “best” strategy. Instead, it simulates the sequential decision-making process implicit in environmental management, so that the effectiveness of management scenarios, when implemented as intended, can be evaluated. The purpose was to develop a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of groundwater management plans by simulating sequential management decisions that evolve based on aquifer/management feedback. A groundwater management scheme was structured as a system control loop to capture the aquifer/management feedback, and management decisions were based on realistically sparse observation times and locations. The method indicates how a plan may proceed in reality under alternate timings and frequencies of management decisions and in systems with differing response times. A synthetic example quantified the impact of a generic plan, specifying environmental objectives, extraction restrictions and entitlement limits (maximum volume/year that users are permitted), relative to no-management by combining a numerical model of “reality” with management rules under a stochastic climate. The management decision-making frequency varied from daily to decadal. Generally, effectiveness decreased as the interval between management interventions increased and intervals greater than annual showed minimal improvement compared to entitlement only. The timing of management decisions relative to the irrigation season also impacted plan effectiveness, and when decisions were made prior to the irrigation season, quarterly management was less effective than annual and biannual management. By testing the capacity of plans to achieve objectives, groundwater management can be systematically and objectively improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclimate 3adecision making 3aenvironmental management 3airrigation 3amathematical models 3asystem optimization 3awater management1 aCostelloe, J.1 aPeterson, T.

The use of some natural minerals as the carrier is not only beneficial to recycling of sonocatalysts, but also reduces the treatment costs of organic pollutants. Two kinds of hydroxyapatite (HAP), Ox Bone (OB)‐HAP and synthesized (Syn)‐HAP combine with the Pt‐TiO₂/(Er³⁺:Y₃Al₅O₁₂@Ta₂O₅) (P‐TET) composite, obtaining two Z‐scheme sonocatalysts, P‐TET/OB‐HAP and P‐TET/Syn‐HAP, respectively. The sonocatalytic activities of the prepared samples are investigated via degradation of prometryn and disinfection of Escherichia coli. RESULTS: A series of characterizations showed that the Z‐scheme P‐TET/(OB or Syn)‐HAP sonocatalysts were prepared successfully. To evaluate their sonocatalytic activities, some influencing factors such as ultrasonic irradiation time, inorganic oxidants, used times and trapping agents on the sonocatalytic degradation prometryn were determined. The best degradation ratio (80.31% based on N computing and 85.07% based on S atom computing) of prometryn could be obtained for 10 mmol L⁻¹ K₂S₂O₈, 1.0 g L⁻¹ P‐TET/OB‐HAP sonocatalyst and 150 min ultrasonic irradiation. The excellent sonocatalytic disinfection ratio (88.65%) of E. coli could also be obtained under 40 min ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, a possible mechanism on sonocatalytic degradation of prometryn was illustrated. CONCLUSION: The treated bovine bone HAP was directly used as a carrier to combine with P‐TET to construct a novel Z‐scheme P‐TET/OB‐HAP sonocatalyst. The high degradation ratio of prometryn and disinfection ratio of E. coli showed that P‐TET/OB‐HAP could be a promising sonocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants and the disinfection of bacteria. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a31570154cthe National Science Foundation of China  a41977205cthe National Science Foundation of China  aXLYC1802070cLiaoning Province "Xingliao Talent Program" project  a2015ZX07202‐012cMajor science and technology project of water pollution control and management in China 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3acatalysts 3acattle 3adisinfection 3ahydroxyapatite 3aoxidants 3apollutants 3aprometryn 3arecycling 3asonocatalysis 3atantalum oxide 3aultrasonic treatment1 aCao, Yuejiao1 aYi, Ludong1 aWang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3465-784X1 aSong, Youtao0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2020 June, v. 95, no. 6 p.1756-1772dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.63743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03891naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012600166300001400292520136200306536053601668592002802204596006402232596006902296596007802365596007202443596011902515596009402634650001902728650001802747650001502765650001902780650001902799650002502818650002102843650001902864650001702883650001902900650001302919653002102932653002802953653002302981653001503004700002003019700001903039700001903058700001303077700001603090700001403106773012303120856008503243852000903328655001203337IND60689225620221120031106.0200420e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922562DNAL7 a10.1080/07388551.2017.13112962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Min10aTween 80 surfactant-enhanced bioremediation: toward a solution to the soil contamination by hydrophobic organic compounds  ap. 17-30.  aThe occurrence of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in the soil has become a highly significant environmental issue. This problem has been exacerbated by the strong sorption of HOCs to the soils, which makes them unavailable for most remediation processes. More and more works show that surfactant-enhanced biological technologies offer a great potential to clear up HOCs-contaminated soils. This article is a critical review of HOCs removal from soils using Tween 80 (one of the mostly used nonionic surfactants) aided biological remediation technologies. The review begins with a discussion of the fundamentals of Tween 80-enhanced desorption of HOCs from contaminated soils, with special emphasis on the biotoxicity of Tween 80. Successful results obtained by Tween 80-enhanced microbial degradation and phytoremediation are documented and discussed in section 3 and section 4, respectively. Results show Tween 80-enhanced biotechnologies are promising for treating HOCs-contaminated soils. However, considering the fact that most of these scientific studies have only been conducted at the laboratory-scale, many improvements are required before these technologies can be scaled up to the full-scale level. Moreover, further research on mechanisms related to the interaction of Tween 80 with degrading microorganisms and the plants is in high demand.  aThis study was financially supported by the Program for the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51278176, 51378190, 51408206, 51579098, 51521006), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-13–0186), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT-13R17), the International S&T Cooperation Program of China (2015DFG92750) and the Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate (CX2016B132).  aPublisher supplied data  cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2015DFG92750cthe International S&T Cooperation Program of China  aNCET-13-0186cthe Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University  aCX2016B132cHunan Provincial Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate  a51278176, 51378190, 51408206, 51579098, 51521006cthe Program for the National Natural Science Foundation of China  aIRT-13R17cthe Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University 3abiodegradation 3abiotechnology 3adesorption 3ahydrophobicity 3amicroorganisms 3anonionic surfactants 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3apolysorbates 3asoil pollution 3asorption 0aSoil remediation 0abiological technologies 0aorganic pollutants 0asurfactant1 aZeng, Guangming1 aHuang, Danlian1 aYang, Chunping1 aLai, Cui1 aZhang, Chen1 aLiu, Yang0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 38, no. 1 p.17-30dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2017.13112963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010400164300001800268520103500286592002801321596006601349596008901415650001801504650002201522650001101544650001901555650001801574650001701592650002101609650001901630700001801649700001301667700001701680700002101697700001601718700005801734773012101792856008301913852000901996655001202005IND60769596120221122230733.0220308e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076959612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-06951-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zecheng10aInvestigation of a novel poly (lactic acid) porous material toughened by thermoplastic polyurethane  ap. 5456-5466.  aPoly (lactic acid)/thermoplastic polyurethane (PLA/TPU) ductile fibrous porous material was obtained by electrospinning, which has better mechanical properties than pure PLA fibrous material. The effects of TPU on the morphology, hydrophobicity, thermal and mechanical properties of the porous fibrous material were studied. After adding TPU, the fiber diameter increased significantly. The static water contact angle of electrospinning fiber decreased as TPU increased. The addition of TPU reduced the crystallinity of the material, but the crystallinity built up over the rise of TPU. TPU substantially improved the toughness of the material, and the PLA/TPU strain energy can be enhanced by nearly 17 times. When the PLA/TPU mass ratio was 10, the maximum tensile strength could reach 9.2 MPa, and if the mass ratio is 20, it holds the highest elongation at break of 153.1%. The preparation of electrospun PLA ductile porous material would be a reliable foundation for broadening the application range of PLA fibrous material.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019JJD120012cNatural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province  a2019ZR02cGuangxi Key Laboratory of Clean Pulp and Papermaking and Pollution Control 3acontact angle 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3apolyurethanes 3aporous media 3atensile strength 3athermoplastics1 aZhang, Zhijun1 aWei, Wei1 aYin, Yanqing1 aHuang, Chongxing1 aDing, Jiang1 aDuan, Qingshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5741-59420 tJournal of materials science.g2022 Mar., v. 57, no. 9 p.5456-5466dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-06951-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245012900209300001800338520129100356592002801647596009101675650002101766650002901787650002601816650001801842650001801860650002201878650001601900650001701916650001201933650002901945650001401974650001401988650001702002700002302019700002202042700002402064773014602088856008202234852000902316655001202325IND60650408820221119015950.0190710e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065040882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-09954-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Halim, Heba1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1619-174014aThe search of potential inhibitors of the AcrAB–TolC system of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli: an in silico approach  ap. 6309-6318.  aThe number of infections caused by multidrug antibiotic resistance (MDR) species is increasing globally. The efflux pump system, AcrAB–TolC, confers Escherichia coli resistance to many antibiotics and results in poor treatment outcomes. Different rational drug design techniques were employed to search for a safe and effective AcrAB–TolC system inhibitor. Ligand docking was performed to analyze the binding of different ArcB substrates and/or inhibitors in the different AcrAB crystal structure binding sites. The validated docking site using the established docking preferences was used to perform virtual high-throughput screening on a large library of compounds. Domperidone, a known and safe over-the-counter antiemetic drug, was proposed as an effective ArcB inhibitor. Microbiological studies confirmed the computational results and domperidone reversed the resistance to the antibiotics: levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the MDR E. coli stains with an effect that surpassed the effect of the known efflux pump inhibitor, reserpine. In addition, it was able to increase both antibiotic effects on susceptible strains. This finding suggests that the antibiotic-domperidone combination can be used clinically to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant E. coli strains.  aPublisher supplied data  a2/4/2016cDeanship of Scientific Research and Graduate Studies – University of Petra 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abinding sites 3aciprofloxacin 3acrystal structure 3adrug design 3alevofloxacin 3aligands 3amultiple drug resistance 3areserpine 3ascreening 3atransporters1 aAl Dajani, Ala’a1 aAbdelhalim, Abeer1 aAbdelmalek, Suzanne0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 Aug., v. 103, no. 15 p.6309-6318dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09954-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010500163300001800268520145600286592002801742650001701770650001301787650001901800650002701819650001301846700001901859700001801878773011701896856007902013852000902092655001202101IND60439690320221119133100.0151024e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043969032DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10267730094362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Doo-Hyun10aMonodisperse micron-sized polymethylmethacrylate particles having a crosslinked network structure. V  ap. 6181-6188.  aHighly monodisperse micron-sized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles crosslinked with carboxylic group-containing urethane acrylates (CUA) were produced by simple dispersion polymerization in methanol. In proper condition, CUA employed as a crosslinker had an excellent ability to achieve the monodisperse PMMA particles to the concentration of about 10 wt%. This arose from the fact that CUA formed monomer-swellable primary particles due to its structurally long tetramethylene oxide groups in the molecule. The influence of the concentrations of the initiator and CUA on the particle diameter (D ₙ), particle number density (N ₚ), and polymerization rate (R ₚ) was found to obey the following approximate relationship, D ₙ ∝ [initiator]⁰.⁴¹[CUA]⁻⁰.⁰⁶, N ₚ ∝ [initiator]⁻¹.²² [CUA]⁰.²¹, and R ₚ ∝ [initiator]⁰.³⁴±⁰.⁰³, respectively. The power law dependence of D ₙ and N ₚ on the initiator concentration coincided well with that of linear polymers in the literature. Especially, in this study, it was found that CUA did not have a serious influence on the nucleation. However, the dependence of R ₚ on the initiator concentration was observed to be higher than that of linear polymers, suggesting that uniquely, the solution polymerization process competed with the heterogeneous polymerization during polymerization, because of the crosslinked network structure of the primary particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3amethanol 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aurethane1 aKim, Jin-Woong1 aSuh, Kyung-Do0 tJournal of materials science.g2000 Dec., v. 35, no. 24 p.6181-6188dKluwer Academic Publishersx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10267730094363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148242029300168245007600461300001800537520150800555592002802063650001802091650002102109650001302130650001202143650001602155650001402171650002202185650001702207650001302224650001302237650001402250650001502264650001002279651001002289700002702299700001902326773012802345856008302473852000902556655001202565IND60674986520221119101857.0200315e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067498652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-019-02000-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetlur, Neeraja13aLe système aquifère de roches cristallines du bombement de Llano, Texas Central, EUA Sistema acuífero de roca Cristalina del Llano Uplift, Central Texas, EEUU 美国德克萨斯中部拉诺隆起的结晶岩含水层系统 Sistema aquífero cristalino do alto Llano, Texas Central, EUA10aCrystalline-rock aquifer system of the Llano Uplift, Central Texas, USA  ap. 2431-2446.  aThe crystalline-rock aquifer system of the Llano Uplift (Central Texas, USA) hosts an important local water resource that has been relatively little studied. The Uplift is a structural dome of Precambrian granitic and metamorphic rocks. Late Paleozoic normal faulting and fractures, decompressive fractures, weathering, lithology, and rock fabric control the aquifer properties. Data from driller reports (over 2,000 wells) show that wells in granites have higher median yields than wells in metamorphic rocks. There is a weak correlation of well yield with regolith thickness, and median regolith thickness is greater over granites than over metamorphic rocks. Fracture permeability, which is very heterogeneous, is the major control. Wells are shallow (generally <100 m depth), but more recent wells have been drilled more deeply. Permeability data imply decreased open-fracture density and aperture with depth, although sample bias is a consideration. Diamond drill cores show that many near-surface fractures with significant aperture are filled by rock fragments from weathered surrounding rocks and that fracture skins are thinner and contain iron oxides in a more reduced state with depth. Fracture skins can be porous, with porosity ranging to over 10%. There is a need to compare crystalline-rock aquifer systems to assess weathering, tectonics, fractures, and mineralogy/petrology to assess the characteristics of these systems, which are critical water resources in large areas of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaleozoic era 3aPrecambrian time 3aaquifers 3afabrics 3airon oxides 3alithology 3ametamorphic rocks 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aregolith 3atectonics 3aweathering 3awells 3aTexas1 aSharp, John M., JrcJr1 aHunt, Brian B.0 tHydrogeology journal.g2019 Nov., v. 27, no. 7 p.2431-2446dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-019-02000-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009700167300001800264500001100282520126700293592002801560596007001588596002801658596006601686650002001752650001601772650002101788650001201809650002001821650001401841650001201855650002501867650001301892650001301905650001301918650002001931650001901951650001301970650001101983650001701994650002502011700002602036700001402062700001902076700001502095700002002110700005002130773014602180856008202326852000902408655001202417IND60650408920221119015924.0190710e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065040892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-09935-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Yan-Xiang10aBiological nitrogen removal from wastewater using sulphur-driven autotrophic denitrification  ap. 6023-6039.  aReview  aBiological denitrification process in mainstream wastewater treatment often needs dosing supplemental electrons, consequently adding a remarkable operating cost. Organic carbon compounds are nowadays the most intensively used electron sources in full-scale wastewater treatment, corresponding with the well-understood carbon-nitrogen biogeochemistry for heterotrophic denitrification process. In the twenty-first century, the low-carbon technology is on calling to reduce the carbon footprint and relieve climate changing threatens. Autotrophic denitrification is highly recommended for mainstream wastewater treatment. The reduced-sulphur compounds (such as sulphide, elemental sulphur, and thiosulphate) could be utilised as electron donors, to drive sulphur cycle reactions to reduce nitrate and nitrite to dinitrogen gas. Based on the literature review and our own research experiences, this paper presents our perspectives on sulphur-driven autotrophic denitrification. It particularly focuses on the functional enzymes, sulphur bioreactors, and influential operating factors. Overall, this paper provides new insights on sulphur-nitrogen biogeochemistry and application as a low-carbon technology for nitrogen removal during municipal wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  aITC-CNERC14EG03cInnovation and Technology Commission - Hong Kong  a51638005cKey Programme  aJSGG2017101071620730cShenzhen Technology Development Program 3abiogeochemistry 3abioreactors 3acarbon footprint 3aclimate 3adenitrification 3aelectrons 3aenzymes 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aoperating costs 3aorganic carbon 3asulfides 3asulfur 3athiosulfates 3awastewater treatment1 aBiswal, Basanta Kumar1 aGuo, Gang1 aDeng, Yang-Fan1 aHuang, Hao1 aChen, Guang-Hao1 aWu, Di1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4293-50340 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 Aug., v. 103, no. 15 p.6023-6039dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09935-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245009700185300001400282520137900296592002801675650001701703650001901720650002201739650001501761650001801776650001701794651001101811653001901822653001501841653001801856653001101874653001501885773009101900856008401991852000902075655001202084IND60121926320221120221349.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012192632DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2013.7637622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosamu, Ishmael Bobby Mphangwe10aNational level organisational responses to climate change adaptation: a case study of Malawi  ap. 93-98.  aClimate change is presenting new and, to a large extent, unpredictable challenges to communities in Malawi and effective adaptation requires a well-coordinated organisational framework. This study looked at the success of organisations and the processes they employed for implementing policies that have implications for climate change adaptation in Malawi. This was done by assessing the linkages between different interest groups, as well as potential conflicts of interest between actors from the national to the local level. One of the major findings was that although national organisational and policy interventions seem to be well linked among various actors, community needs are mostly compromised. There is no effective communication between adaptation strategies which are proposed and the livelihood strategies in communities within the country. Local knowledge is given very little attention in formulating, communicating and implementing policies that have implications for adaptation to climate change. The study highlights inadequate human and financial resources to support climate change adaptation in Malawi. It also exposes the weak links between different stakeholders and the subsequent lack of collective commitment. Results suggest that there is a lot of talk about climate change adaptation strategies but the actual implementation needs improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3aorganizations 3astakeholders 3aMalawi 0aclimate change 0aadaptation 0aorganisations 0aMalawi 0astrategies0 tClimate and development.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 5, no. 1 p.93-98dRoutledgex1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2013.7637623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245012200180300001600302520133700318592002801655650001501683650001501698650002201713650000901735650001101744650001301755650001901768650001101787650002101798650002301819650001701842650002101859650001301880653000901893653002601902653002401928653001901952653001901971653001301990700001902003700002102022773010402043856008402147852000902231655001202240IND60614319220221123034544.0181002e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061431922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.11.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazan-Wozniak, Aleksandra10aProduction of new activated bio-carbons by chemical activation of residue left after supercritical extraction of hops  ap. 456-463.  aA technology of activated bio-carbons production from the residue left after supercritical extraction of hops is described. The effect of the variant of chemical activation and impregnation ratio on the physicochemical properties as well as sorption capacity towards toxic gas of acidic character (nitrogen dioxide), basic organic dye (aqueous solution of methylene blue - MB) and iodine was investigated. The materials obtained were activated bio-carbons of well-developed surface area ranging between 897 and 1095m²/g, showing clearly acidic character of the surface. The sorption tests results proved that chemical activation of the residue left after supercritical extraction of hops allows obtaining activated bio-carbons with very high sorption capacity towards nitrogen dioxide, reaching to 77.2 and 155.3mg/g in dry and wet conditions, respectively. The maximum sorption capacity of the adsorbents towards methylene blue was 328.75mg/g, while towards iodine 1815mg/g. The equilibrium data for aqueous solution of MB were analyzed by the Langmuir and Freundlich models, whereas the kinetics of the adsorption process was studied using pseudo-first and second-order models. According to the obtained data, the adsorption of MB from aqueous solution is better described by Langmuir model and pseudo-second order kinetic model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3ahops 3aiodine 3akinetics 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aHops 0aActivated bio-carbons 0aChemical activation 0aNO2 adsorption 0aMethylene blue 0aKinetics1 aNowicki, Piotr1 aPietrzak, Robert0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 Feb., v. 161 p.456-463dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245018900162300001800351520182500369592002802194596005902222650002002281650001402301650001602315650001902331650001802350650002102368650001902389650002202408700001802430700001602448700001802464700005602482773012102538856008302659852000902742655001202751IND60769596520221122230739.0220308e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076959652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07000-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aPreparation of renewable gallic acid-based self-healing waterborne polyurethane with dynamic phenol–carbamate network: toward superior mechanical properties and shape memory function  ap. 5679-5696.  aEndowing thermoset self-healing polymers with excellent mechanical properties and shape memory function by utilizing bio-based monomers is highly desirable for the development of the next-generation smart materials. To achieve this goal, herein, we developed a novel thermally induced self-healing system with robust mechanical properties and shape memory function by incorporating dynamic phenol–carbamate bond formed by the polymerization reaction of the renewable gallic acid (GA) and isocyanate into waterborne polyurethane (GA-WPU) with excellent emulsion stability. The mechanical properties and thermal stability of the resulting polymers were much improved due to the introduction of phenol–carbamate networks. Moreover, the crystallization and microphase separation were evaluated to deeply insight into the effect of GA moieties incorporated into the polymer chains of GA-WPU. Significantly, a good balance can be achieved between desirable self-healing ability (healing efficiency 81.1%) and robust mechanical properties (tensile strength 45.1 MPa and elongation at break 576.5%) by adjusting dynamic phenol–carbamate bonds incorporated into the polymer networks, and compared with the reported self-healing polymers, the recovered tensile strength of our target polymer shows an overwhelming superiority. Furthermore, taking the advantage of the crystalline PBA (switching segment) and phenol–carbamate cross-linkages, the prepared GA-WPU polymer can rapidly recover from temporary shape to original shape by thermal energy (less than 30 s, and the shape fixity and recovery ratio remain above 91.5%). We envision that this elaborate strategy is instructive for designing mechanically robust polymeric materials with self-healing, shape memory function and environmentally friendly characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data  a21376153cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3acrystallization 3aemulsions 3agallic acid 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3atensile strength 3athermal energy 3athermal stability1 aZhang, Zetian1 aFan, Weiwei1 aYang, Kaifeng1 aLi, Zhengjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3943-56210 tJournal of materials science.g2022 Mar., v. 57, no. 9 p.5679-5696dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-07000-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245007500159300001800234520132300252592002801575650001401603650001001617650001101627650001901638650001101657650001901668700001801687700001801705773011701723856007901840852000901919655001201928IND60439690620221119132825.0151024e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043969062DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10267195313002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkkus, O.10aMicrostructural aspects of the fracture process in human cortical bone  ap. 6065-6074.  aFracture toughness tests were conducted in the transverse and longitudinal directions to the osteonal orientation of human femoral cortical bone tissue to investigate the resulting damage patterns and their interaction with the microstructure. The time history of damage accumulation was monitored with acoustic emission (AE) during testing and was spatially observed histologically following testing. The fracture toughness of the transverse specimens was almost two times greater than the fracture toughness of the longitudinal specimens (3.47 MNm⁻³/² vs. 1.71 MNm⁻³/², respectively). The energy content of the AE waveforms of transverse specimens were greater than those of the longitudinal specimens implying higher fracture resistance in the transverse crack growth direction. The results showed that the propagation of the main crack involved weakening of the tissue by ultrastructural (diffuse) damage at the fracture plane and formation of linear microcracks away from the fracture plane for the transverse specimens. For the longitudinal specimens, the growth of the main crack occurred in the form of separations at lamellar interfaces. The lamellar separations generally arrested at the cement lines. Linear microcracks occurred primarily in the interstitial tissue for both crack growth directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3abones 3acement 3aenergy content 3ahumans 3amicrostructure1 aJepsen, K.

The Schiff base reagent, bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine (Salen) functionalized graphene oxide (GO) was applied as adsorbent. Salen functionalized GO was prepared and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, zeta potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. The batch experiment represented maximum removal efficiency of 99% at pH 6.5, adsorbent dose of 100 mg L⁻¹ and 5 min contact time. RESULTS: The residual concentration of lead(II) after removal was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. DLS results suggested slightly smaller particle size of Salen modified GO than pristine GO. The optimized model calculated with Gaussian 09 W software showed maximum total energy (1.3959 eV) and dipole moment (6.8646 D) for model of lead interaction with Salen–GO. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was most fitted and the kinetic data indicated that the lead(II) adsorption on Salen–GO followed second‐order model. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated was 68 mg g⁻¹. CONCLUSION: The adsorbent was applied to remove lead(II) ions in real contaminated water samples of the battery manufacturing industry with average removal of 95% with relative standard deviation 1.23% (n = 3). The adsorbent was reusable with desorption of lead(II) from adsorbent and was 95% with 0.2 mol L‐¹ nitric acid. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Sindh 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abatteries 3acomputer software 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene oxide 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3aions 3alead 3alight scattering 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3anitric acid 3apH 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aschiff bases 3asorption isotherms 3astandard deviation 3awater pollution 3azeta potential1 aKhuhawar, Muhammad Yar1 aMahar, Rasool Bux0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2020 June, v. 95, no. 6 p.1694-1704dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.63623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001100146245010400157300002000261500001900281520168500300592002801985650001502013650003002028650001302058650001102071650002102082650001602103700001902119700005402138773013902192856008002331852000902411655001202420IND60713716920221117174255.0201023e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071371692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c071822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Ce10aDynamics of H₂O Adsorption on Pt(110)-(1 × 2) Based on a Neural Network Potential Energy Surface  ap. 23190-23199.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater adsorption on metal surfaces is of both fundamental and practical relevance to heterogeneous and electrocatalysis. Here, we report a comprehensive theoretical study on the dynamics of H₂O adsorption on Pt(110)-(1 × 2) based on a neural network potential energy surface (PES) fit to thousands of density functional theory data points. This PES allows us to investigate the dynamics of molecular and dissociative adsorption of water on Pt(110)-(1 × 2) from first principles with no adjustable parameters. Specifically, we find a molecular adsorption well depth that is close to the experimental estimate with no entry barrier, leading to a monotonic decrease in initial sticking probability (S₀) with increasing translational energy. While this translational energy dependence of S₀ is consistent with the conventional mechanism for nonactivated adsorption and with earlier theoretical results, it is in qualitative disagreement with experimental data. Using an electronic friction model implemented with the local density friction approximation, we find that the low-energy electron–hole pair excitation mildly increases the trapping probability, whereas it has little influence on the translational energy dependence. Other possible factors, such as the rotational alignment and dynamical steering, which may be relevant to the discrepancy between theory and experiment, have also been discussed. On the other hand, the dissociative sticking probability is predicted as complementary information awaiting experimental confirmation. We hope that these results could motivate future experimental and theoretical studies to explore this puzzling gas–surface system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3afriction 3amodels 3apotential energy 3aprobability1 aZhang, Yaolong1 aJiang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2696-54360 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Sept. 29, v. 124, no. 42 p.23190-23199dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c071823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014200165300001800307520158700325592002801912650001301940650002201953650001801975650003001993650002702023650002202050650001102072650001302083650001502096650001102111650001502122650002502137700005802162700001902220700001702239773016302256856008202419852000902501655001202510IND60693881920221120182033.0200509e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069388192DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02653-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatif, E.

The objective of this research is to study the effect of sludge retention time and aeration pattern on the performance of intermittent cycle extended aeration system pilot scale for wastewater treatment. In addition, the process simulation using GPS-X software was conducted. Five different runs of sludge retention times of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 days were studied. The optimum sludge retention time for wastewater treatment by intermittent cycle extended aeration system pilot scale was 10 days, and under operating condition of sludge retention time of 10 days, effluent quality was 15.5 ± 3.8, 6.5 ± 1.1, 5.3 ± 1.6, 0.7 ± 0.2, 5.0 ± 1.4 mg/L and 1.4 ± 0.7 mg/L for COD, BOD₅, TSS, NH₄–N, TN and TP which amply met the local regulation of class A treated wastewater. GPS-X sensitivity analysis tool box was used to determine the most sensitive kinetic parameters affecting the intermittent cycle extended aeration system pilot scale performance. Out of about 50 kinetic parameters, YH, bH, μA, Kₒ, bA, Kₐ and μPAO appeared to the most sensitive kinetic parameters. The calibrated GPS-X model proved that the presence of anoxic phase in the cycle has a significant impact on nitrogen and phosphorus removal. In addition, intermittent aeration pattern achieved the highest performance compared with other patterns of aeration only, aeration/anoxic and anoxic/aeration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aammonium nitrogen 3abatch systems 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3acomputer software 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aElmolla, E.

However, there is also evidence that pasturing honey bee colonies within natural landscapes may negatively affect wild bees through resource competition. To assess resource competition between managed honey bees and wild bees, we conducted repeated, short‐term deployments of honey bee colonies within Florida forests coinciding with seasonal wildflower bloom, and compared wild bee foraging with and without honey bee colonies present over multiple seasons. We recorded over 2000 bee visits including 196 pairwise bee–plant interactions. Deploying honey bee colonies was associated with a reduction in wild bee foraging rates, and honey bee and wild bee foraging rates were significantly, negatively correlated. Honey bees disproportionately visited resources with high floral density. Honey bee foraging preferences differed significantly from genera with small‐bodied (Lasioglossum, Perdita, Augochlorella), and/or specialist species (Perdita, Andrena), as well as with Megachile, but overlapped with genera including larger‐bodied (Bombus, Habropoda, Osmia, Xylocopa) and/or generalist species (Bombus, Xylocopa, Agapostemon). Deploying honey bee colonies did not significantly affect plant–pollinator network metrics. These results illustrate that short‐term honey bee colony deployment can negatively affect wild bee foraging and that competition may be greater for certain genera, particularly larger‐bodied bees or those with generalist diets though less for smaller‐bodied and/or specialist bees. Our short‐term, low‐density deployment treatments may have precluded significant effects on network metrics and likely underestimate the effects of typical higher density and longer‐term honey bee deployment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgapostemon 3aAndrena 3aApis mellifera 3aAugochlorella 3aBombus 3aHabropoda 3aLasioglossum 3aMegachile 3aOsmia 3aPerdita 3aXylocopa 3aecosystems 3aforage 3ahabitats 3ahoney 3ahoney bee colonies 3ahoney bees 3awild flowers 3aFlorida1 aAscher, John S.1 aMallinger, Rachel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3782-17100 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2022 Sept., v. 15, no. 5 p.634-644dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.125943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245018700170300001600357520111500373592002801488650002001516650002401536650001601560650001401576650002201590650002001612650002801632650001301660650001101673650001901684650001501703650001901718650001601737653002201753653001501775653003801790653002001828653003301848653003101881700001401912700001601926700001701942700001601959773010501975856008702080852000902167655001202176IND60589770920221123042750.0200717e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058977092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.02.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Huiyang10aImproving cellulose nanofibrillation of waste wheat straw using the combined methods of prewashing, p-toluenesulfonic acid hydrolysis, disk grinding, and endoglucanase post-treatment  ap. 321-327.  aHere we established a new approach for improving the cellulose nanofibrillation of high ash content waste wheat straw (WWS). The results were comprehensively elucidated from the ash removal, delignification, mechanical fibrillation and endoglucanase post-treatment. When water dosage was increased from 50 to 500 times of the WWS weight, the ash content gradually decreased during prewashing process, which facilitated lignin solubilization in subsequent p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) hydrolysis. Approximately 80% of lignin in prewashed WWS could be dissolved during acid hydrolysis to result in a relatively higher crystallinity of 59.1%. Compared with the lignocellulosic nanofibrils (LCNF) directly obtained using acid hydrolysis and disk grinding, prewashing-assisted acid hydrolyzed WWS was fibrillated into LCNF with smaller height of 57.0 nm. Mild endoglucanase post-treatment could further produce less entangled LCNF with thinner diameters. In short, this study presented a promising and green pathway to achieve an efficient utilization of agricultural residue wastes to cellulose nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3aagricultural wastes 3aash content 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3adelignification 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agrinding 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3ananofibers 3asolubilization 3awheat straw 0aWaste wheat straw 0aPrewashing 0ap-Toluenesulfonic acid hydrolysis 0aDelignification 0aEndoglucanase post-treatment 0aCellulose nanofibrillation1 aGao, Ying1 aYang, Yiqin1 aFang, Guigan1 aDai, Hongqi0 tBioresource technology.g2018 May, v. 256 p.321-327dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.02.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006800140245013300208300001600341500002000357520161600377592002801993596004902021650001902070650001802089650002902107650001302136650001702149650001702166650001202183650002902195650000902224650001502233650002402248650001902272650001502291651002202306651001102328700002002339700002702359700001902386773013702405856007502542852000902617655001202626IND60792492320221120180127.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079249232DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.125722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArgueta‐Guzmán, Magda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1758-312914aThe role of seasonality and disturbance in bee–plant interactions in semi‐arid communities of the southern Chihuahuan desert  ap. 543-554.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe maintenance of interactions between plants and their floral visitors depends on factors such as resource variability, seasonality, and population dynamics. Changes in water availability along with different types and levels of anthropogenic disturbance may influence how plants and pollinators interact, especially in arid environments. In a semi‐arid area of the southernmost Chihuahuan Desert (Mexico), we surveyed bee–plant interactions in the dry and rainy season at sites that differed in disturbance type. We used a mutualistic network approach to analyse our data. We collected 946 bee individuals belonging to 32 bee species, almost a third of the total richness previously reported for Querétaro state. We detected a strong impact of seasonality on the structure of ecological interactions, with more complex and robust interactions among bee and plant species in the rainy season. We did not find statistical support for a relationship among disturbance, nestedness, or niche overlap. We did find disturbance negatively affected plant robustness to secondary extinctions. Four plants: Echinocactus platyacanthus, Opuntia stenopetala, Senna wislizeni var. painteri and Cylindropuntia imbricata comprised the core species that were primarily responsible for the resilience of the bee communities. The following bees conformed the generalist core of species: Diadasia rinconis, Lasioglossum (Dialictus) sp. 1, Apis mellifera, and Augochlorella pomoniella. Overall, network nestedness and robustness differed significantly between seasons but not among sites with different levels of disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de la Ciencia y Tecnología 3aApis mellifera 3aAugochlorella 3aCylindropuntia imbricata 3aDiadasia 3aEchinocactus 3aLasioglossum 3aOpuntia 3aanthropogenic activities 3abees 3anestedness 3apopulation dynamics 3asemiarid zones 3awet season 3aChihuahuan Desert 3aMexico1 aGolubov, Jordan1 aCano‐Santana, Zenón1 aAyala, Ricardo0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2022 Sept., v. 15, no. 5 p.543-554dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.125723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245008500194300001600279520121600295592002801511650002001539650002701559650002101586650002201607650003201629650002101661650001801682650001001700650002501710650005501735650003101790650006401821650001601885650001701901700002201918700002301940700001901963773009901982856004802081852000902129655001202138IND50062968820221120213341.0130323e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006296882DNAL7 a231322762pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-012-9839-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLøvdal, Irene Stranden10aActivation of Bacillus spores at moderately elevated temperatures (30–33 °C)  ap. 693-700.  aThe time/temperature profiles experienced by spores on the track from their natural sporulation environment to consumable food products may be highly diverse. Temperature has been documented as an important factor that may activate spores, i.e. potentiates spores to germinate. There is, however, limited knowledge about the relationship between the expected temperature history and the subsequent germination characteristics of bacterial spores. We show here that the germination rate of five different Bacillus spore populations, represented by strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus weihenstephanensis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis could be increased following 1 week storage at moderately elevated temperatures, 30–33 °C, compared to spores stored at 3–8 °C. The results imply that spores contamination routes to foods, specifically the temperature history, could be highly relevant data in predictive modeling of food spoilage and safety. Activation at these moderately elevated temperatures may be a native form of spore activation in their natural habitats, knowledge that also could be useful in development of decontamination strategies for mildly heated foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus pumilus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBacillus weihenstephanensis 3abacterial spores 3afood spoilage 3afoods 3atemperature profiles 2aBacillusxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aFood Microbiologyxmethods 2aSpores, Bacterialxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors1 aGranum, Per Einar1 aRosnes, Jan Thomas1 aLøvdal, Trond0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2013 Mar., v. 103, no. 3 p.693-700dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-012-9839-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010900157300001800266520090800284592002801192650004401220650002201264650002201286650002001308650002201328650000901350650003301359650001401392650002301406700001901429700001701448700001301465773012701478856007401605852000901679655001201688IND60656865720221120051003.0190814e20150312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065686572DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay03093a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhihua10aLuminol chemiluminescence actuated by modified natural sepiolite material and its analytical application  ap. 2779-2785.  aIt was found that a modified natural sepiolite material could tremendously catalyze the chemiluminescence (CL) emission of the luminol–H₂O₂ system. A variety of characterization methods, including FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET and CL spectroscopy, were utilized to investigate the possible CL enhancement mechanism. Moreover, a modified natural sepiolite was used for the luminol-driven CL detection of H₂O₂. Under the optimum conditions, the CL intensity was proportional to the concentration of H₂O₂ in the range from 0.01 to 8 μM. The detection limit (S/N = 3) was 8.8 nM and the relative standard deviation (RSD) for twelve repeated measurements of 1.0 μM H₂O₂ was 2.5%. The proposed method was also successfully applied to detect H₂O₂ in tap and rain water samples with recoveries of 98–104%. Thus, this method can be used as a sensitive detection tool for the analysis of H₂O₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemiluminescence 3adetection limit 3ahydrogen peroxide 3arain 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asepiolite 3astandard deviation1 aZhao, Changxin1 aHan, Dongmei1 aGu, Fubo0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Mar. 12, v. 7, no. 6 p.2779-2785dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay03093a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012400163300001800287520172400305592002802029596003502057650002002092650001802112650001602130650003502146650002802181650001802209650001102227650002602238650003002264650002702294650002102321650002402342650002502366650001902391650002102410650001302431650001502444650002202459650002302481650001102504650001102515650002702526650001502553650001502568650002502583650001102608700002302619700001702642700001802659700005302677773016302730856008202893852000902975655001202984IND60693882120221122120507.0200509e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069388212DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02648-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhouja, I.10aSpatial–temporal variation of treatment performance and bacterial community diversity in a hybrid constructed wetland  ap. 3217-3230.  aA hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland (HSSF-FWS) with three horizontal flow components and a free water surface in series (HF-CW₁ + HF-CW₂ + HF-CW₃ + FWS) was designed and investigated to evaluate seasonal wastewater treatment performance, the microbial diversity and community structure. The HF-CW₁ component was planted with Scirpus holoschoenus and Cyperus papyrus; HF-CW₂ was unplanted, whereas HF-CW₃ was planted with Scirpus validus. In FWS, the wastewater was covered with Lemna minor and Daphnia magna. HSSF-FWS has a great potential to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD₅), total suspended solids (TSS), fecal coliforms (FC) and fecal streptococci (FS), while the removal efficiencies of nitrate nitrogen (NO₃⁻) and orthophosphorus (PO₄³⁻) were relatively low. The best removal efficiency was achieved in spring for COD and BOD₅, in summer for TSS, in autumn for NO₃⁻ and in winter for PO₄³⁻, while no seasonal difference was found for the removal of FC and FS. The seasonal treatment performance is generally less influenced by the plant species than by the presence or absence of vegetation. HF-CW₃ and FWS had different influences on treatment parameters; the FWS component improved the removal of TSS and PO₄³⁻ during winter and the removal of COD and NO₃⁻ during spring season. Seasonal changes affect the microbial diversity and community structure throughout the hybrid constructed wetland and are enhanced by the presence of plants, with diversity changing with different plant species. Cluster analysis indicated that bacterial community structure from influent and FWS samples was closely related in autumn.  aPublisher supplied data  aLR15CERTE04cContrat programme 3aCyperus papyrus 3aDaphnia magna 3aLemna minor 3aSchoenoplectus tabernaemontani 3aScirpoides holoschoenus 3aStreptococcus 3aautumn 3abacterial communities 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3acluster analysis 3acommunity structure 3aconstructed wetlands 3afecal bacteria 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3apollution control 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atotal suspended solids 3avegetation 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awinter1 aSullivansealey, K.1 aM’hiri, F.1 aOuzari, H.-I.1 aSaidi, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6091-55180 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2020 June, v. 17, no. 6 p.3217-3230dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-020-02648-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245010400196300001800300500001900318500002000337520201900357592002802376596009602404650001302500650002002513650001102533650002402544650001902568650001602587650002102603650001802624650002102642650000902663650001302672650001602685650001202701650002002713650001802733650001602751651001102767700002602778700003002804700002202834700001802856773013002874856007303004852000903077655001203086IND60693525720221119225725.0200507e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069352572DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.137532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolbe, Tamara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7943-995310aLagged rejuvenation of groundwater indicates internal flow structures and hydrological connectivity  ap. 2176-2189.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLarge proportions of rainwater and snowmelt infiltrate into the subsurface before contributing to stream flow and stream water quality. Subsurface flow dynamics steer the transport and transformation of contaminants, carbon, weathering products and other biogeochemistry. The distribution of groundwater ages with depth is a key feature of these flow dynamics. Predicting these ages are a strong test of hypotheses about subsurface structures and time‐varying processes. Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)‐based groundwater ages revealed an unexpected groundwater age stratification in a 0.47 km² forested catchment called Svartberget in northern Sweden. An overall groundwater age stratification, representative for the Svartberget site, was derived by measuring CFCs from nine different wells with depths of 2–18 m close to the stream network. Immediately below the water table, CFC‐based groundwater ages of already 30 years that increased with depth were found. Using complementary groundwater flow models, we could reproduce the observed groundwater age stratification and show that the 30 year lag in rejuvenation comes from return flow of groundwater at a subsurface discharge zone that evolves along the interface between two soil types. By comparing the observed groundwater age stratification with a simple analytical approximation, we show that the observed lag in rejuvenation can be a powerful indicator of the extent and structure of the subsurface discharge zone, while the vertical gradient of the age‐depth‐relationship can still be used as a proxy of the overall aquifer recharge even when sampled in the discharge zone. The single age stratification profile measured in the discharge zone, close to the aquifer outlet, can reveal the main structure of the groundwater flow pattern from recharge to discharge. This groundwater flow pattern provides information on the participation of groundwater in the hydrological cycle and indicates the lower boundary of hydrological connectivity.  aPublisher supplied data  cSwedisch University of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Aquatic Sciences and Assessment 3aaquifers 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon 3achlorofluorocarbons 3adrainage water 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrologic cycle 3arain 3asnowmelt 3astream flow 3astreams 3asubsurface flow 3awater quality 3awater table 3aSweden1 aMarçais, J.q(Jean),1 ade Dreuzy, Jean‐Raynald1 aLabasque, Thierry1 aBishop, Kevin0 tHydrological processes.g2020 May 15, v. 34, no. 10 p.2176-2189dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.137533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013400163300001600297500002000313520149700333592002801830596004901858596004201907596004501949596004901994650001102043650001502054650001202069650001202081650001902093650001202112650002102124650001102145650001102156650001202167650001402179650001402193650002302207650001302230651001202243700002502255700003002280700001802310700002102328700006102349773013702410856007502547852000902622655001202631IND60792492520221120180211.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079249252DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.125752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, Göran,10aArthropod populations in a sub‐arctic environment facing climate change over a half‐century: variability but no general trend  ap. 534-542.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDramatic declines of some arthropod populations have recently received a lot of attention. Identified declines have mainly been attributed to changes in agriculture, climate, pathogen prevalence and light pollution, as well as cross‐regional effects of, e.g., drifting pesticides. However, the overall picture is complex and debated, and there is a need for systematically collected long‐term data, not least from areas relatively unaffected by humans. We monitored the abundance of arthropods (mainly insects) in subalpine birch forest in Swedish Lapland over a period of 53 years (1968–2020), in an area comparatively unaffected by human activities. Arthropod abundance was assessed by yearly systematic counts on 24,000 birch shoots, in the second half of June. Animals were categorised into 17 different groups directly upon counting, dependent on taxonomy and life stage (imago, larva). Overall, there was no significant change in arthropod numbers. Nor did estimates of the total biomass of arthropods (using group‐specific indices of the mass of individuals) show any significant trend. Accordingly, there are no signs that the arthropod abundance or biomass on birch in this subarctic study site has gone through the same declines as have been reported from sites in other habitats. The reason may be that the impact of factors identified worldwide as drivers of arthropod declines so far are small or non‐existent because of the low human population density in this area.  aPublisher supplied data  cCounty Administrative Board of Västerbotten  cPaul och Marie Berghaus donationsfond  cSwedish Natural Science Research Council  cWilhelm och Martina Lundgrens vetenskapsfond 3aBetula 3aarthropods 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforests 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aimagos 3ainsects 3apathogens 3apollution 3apopulation density 3ataxonomy 3aLapland1 aProschwitz, Ted von,1 aFägerström, Christoffer1 aGreen, Martin1 aSmith, Henrik G.1 aLindström, Åke,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5597-62090 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2022 Sept., v. 15, no. 5 p.534-542dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.125753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018000160300001800340520090200358592002801260650001901288650001601307650001101323650001901334650002001353650001001373650002101383650001701404650001101421650002301432650002201455650001501477650001501492650000901507650001101516650001201527650001201539650002301551650001701574650001501591700002001606700001701626700001901643700002001662700001501682773012701697856007401824852000901898655001201907IND60656865920221122053004.0190814e20150326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065686592DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay03098b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajidano, S.

Hence, instead of the case study, dimensionless energy-matching parameters, energy-matching map, and nine universal energy-matching scenarios are proposed to measure the loads disparity between users’ demands and the provision of CCHP system when coupled with thermal energy storage system, electric energy storage system, or the hybrid energy storage system, respectively. Then based on the energy-matching relations, the capacity sizing method and suitable user scopes are discussed to find the suitable energy storage system for CCHP systems in different energy-matching scenarios. The results indicate that if the system coupling with electric or thermal energy storage system, the capacity of the CCHP system can be installed in users’ average electric or thermal energy demand, however, if the system coupling the hybrid energy storage system, the installed capacity can be summarized into two different situations based on the energy-matching relations. Meanwhile, thermal energy storage system is found to be more applicable when the heating load is dominant and greater energy saving would be achieved when the surplus electricity can be sold back to the Gird. Compared to the conventional CCHP systems, the systems in hot climate zones showed significant performance improvements than in cold climate zone when coupled with energy storage systems. Moreover, suitable users’ boundaries in winter or cold climate zones are found to be larger than that in summer or hot climate zones, and a larger installed capacity will contribute to a wider suitable user scope. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to reveal the influence rules of the key parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acold zones 3acooling 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3asummer 3athermal energy 3awinter 0aCombined cooling, heating, and power systems 0aEnergy storage system 0aEnergy-matching 0aSuitable users1 aDai, Xiaoye1 aMo, Junrong1 aShi, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6929-00910 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 200dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001900160245007900179300001600258520070200274592002800976650001501004650001401019650000901033650001001042650001201052650001401064650001201078650002801090650005001118650000901168650002201177650005701199650000901256650004901265650005801314700003001372700002501402700002201427773014801449856008101597852000901678655001201687IND4471827720221116141351.0120501e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447182772DNAL7 a218525182pmid7 a10.5326/JAAHA-MS-56722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasdani, Eleni10aSpontaneous Urethral Catheter Kinking or Knotting in Male Dogs: Four Cases  ap. 351-355.  aFour dogs were diagnosed with urethral catheter malfunction.

It has been widely applied in assisted-scaffolding in sequence assemblies, microbial strain typing and detection of structural variations. Various computational methods have been developed to analyze optical mapping data. However, existing tools for processing and visualizing optical map data still have many shortcomings. Here, we present OMTools, an efficient and intuitive data processing and visualization suite to handle and explore large-scale optical mapping profiles. OMTools includes modules for visualization (OMView), data processing and simulation. These modules together form an accessible and convenient pipeline for optical mapping analyses.

To evaluate the gravity of the situation, continuity in research of MP abundance is required. In this work for the first time a systematic literature review was conducted to build abundance datasets of MP at marine surface waters that were used to estimate average MP abundance and produce maps. Due to non-Gaussian distribution of the data, non-parametric statistics were used. The results show that an estimated average of approximately 6300 MP km⁻² MP float at the surface of the oceans. Additionally, observations of drawbacks in MP research that hamper inter-research comparability were made and these mainly include heterogeneity of methods and poor reporting practice.

The aim of the study was to evaluate Si fertilisation as a strategy to improve phosphorus (P) fertiliser use efficiency on acidic tropical soil, and the potential of using glacial rock flour (GRF) as a source of Si. METHODS: Wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Benchmark) plants were grown in a pot experiment in an oxisol soil. Si was supplied as either GRF or silicic acid (SiA) at low and sufficient P levels. A soil incubation study and a compartmented pot experiment were also included to assess how soil chemistry was affected by the Si sources both with and without plants. RESULTS: Addition of Si as either GRF or SiA doubled shoot biomass under limited P conditions, and the combined treatment quadrupled it. SiA led to increased P uptake under P-limited conditions, while GRF did not. Soil incubation showed that only SiA increased P availability in bulk soil. The addition of SiA in combination with GRF led to increased root exudation of citric and oxalic acid. Localised weathering of GRF resulted in higher rhizosphere pH, but did not affect rhizosphere P availability or organic acid exudation. CONCLUSION: Si released from GRF can rejuvenate strongly weathered agricultural soils, improve stress tolerance in plants and ultimately increase yields but GRF does not improve P availability on acidic soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiomass 3aexudation 3afertilizer application 3aoxalic acid 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere 3arock flour 3asilicic acid 3asilicon 3asoil chemistry 3astress tolerance 3atropical soils 3awheat1 aSchjoerring, Jan Kofod1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2852-32981 aGómez-Muñoz, Beatriz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6611-58451 ade Neergaard, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9108-11221 aJensen, Lars Stoumann1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1446-20840 tPlant and soil.g2022 Aug., v. 477, no. 1-2 p.241-258dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05399-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245010400174506010400278506007600382520109600458592002801554506003701582650001501619650001201634650001601646650001201662650002101674650001101695650001901706650001201725650001501737650001201752651001401764651001001778651001101788653002601799653001801825653001301843653003101856653001201887653001901899653001901918653001101937653002601948700001701974773011901991856008802110852000902198655001202207IND60773062220221207112915.0220606e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077306222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1550652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReimann, Clemens10aQuantifying diffuse contamination: Comparing silver and mercury in organogenic and minerogenic soil  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor both, silver (Ag) and mercury (Hg), the median concentrations in an aqua regia extraction of minerogenic top- and subsoil from continental scale geochemical surveys (Australia, China, Europe) are around 0.02 mg/kg. When the soil O horizon is collected as topsoil sample, the concentration of again both elements is higher by about a factor of 10 (range 7–30), with median concentrations around 0.2 mg/kg Ag and Hg. Geochemical maps of top- and subsoil at different scales for both elements display regional patterns which reflect mainly geology, climate and topography. Anthropogenic sources like mines, power plants, or major cities visually occur only as local anomalies. For Ag in organogenic topsoil the maximum possible input due to diffuse contamination is estimated to be in the 0.02 mg/kg range, about 10% of the median concentration in the soil O horizon. For Hg this value is slightly higher at 0.03 mg/kg. In the soil O horizon Hg concentrations show less variability than in the C horizon. Substantial Hg soil contamination should lead to noticeably increased Hg/Ag ratios.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaqua regia 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3amercury 3aorganic horizons 3asilver 3asoil pollution 3asubsoil 3atopography 3atopsoil 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aEurope 0aDiffuse contamination 0aAnthropogenic 0aGeogenic 0aLinear concentration shift 0aTopsoil 0aSoil O horizon 0aSoil C horizon 0aPlants 0aRegional geochemistry1 aFabian, Karl0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 832 p.155065-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1550653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245018500172520138700357592002801744650000801772650001501780650002201795650001401817650001301831650001301844650000901857653002601866653001901892653002101911653001401932700001601946700001201962700001701974773010601991856008702097852000902184655001202193IND60670300020221119233314.0191002e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067030002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Changming10aComparative study on combustion and emissions between methanol port-injection engine and methanol direct-injection engine with H2-enriched port-injection under lean-burn conditions  aLean-burn is an effective way to improve thermal efficiency and reduce emissions of spark-ignition (SI) engines. A hydrogen (H2) enrichment combustion strategy can extend the lean-burn limits of SI engines. Two engines equipped with hydrogen and methanol dual-port injection (HPI + MPI) and hydrogen port injection plus methanol direct injection (HPI + MDI) were used to evaluate the lean-burn capability of SI engines. The lean-burn characteristics of homogeneous and stratified combustion modes were compared. The results showed that H2 addition was more conducive to extending the lean-burn limit of the direct-injection methanol engine and achieving high indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) than the port-injection methanol engine. HPI + MDI engines with 6% H2 addition effectively extended the lean-burn limit to an excess air ratio of 2.2. H2 addition compensated for the power drop caused by the decrease in volumetric efficiency and speed up combustion under lean-burn conditions. H2 addition could also realize stable combustion under super lean-burn conditions for HPI + MDI engines. The BSHC and BSCO emissions of HPI + MPI engines were lower than those of HPI + MDI engines, but the BSNOX and soot emissions were higher. H2 addition decreases BSCO2 emissions at the same excess air ratio for both the HPI + MPI and HPI + MDI engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion 3acomparative study 3aemissions 3ahydrogen 3amethanol 3asoot 0aSpark-ignition engine 0aPort-injection 0aDirect-injection 0aLean-burn1 aLi, Zhaohui1 aYi, Lin1 aLiu, Fenghua0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 200dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1120963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245017500161300002000336520147700356592002801833650001601861650002801877650001301905650001501918650002601933650001501959650001901974650002001993650001102013650001502024650002202039650001202061650001702073650002202090650001602112700003002128773012902158856007502287852000902362655001202371IND60563127720221117223756.0170215e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056312772DNAL7 a10.1021/jp50529362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoudarzi, Hossein10aTriplet–Triplet Annihilation-Induced Up-Converted Delayed Luminescence in Solid-State Organic Composites: Monitoring Low-Energy Photon Up-Conversion at Low Temperatures  ap. 14256-14265.  aHitherto, the role of the enhanced intermolecular interactions and the effect of lowering the temperature on the process of triplet–triplet annihilation-induced up-converted delayed luminescence in solid-state composites systems have remained controversial. Here we address these issues by performing temperature-dependent time-integrated and time-gated luminescence spectroscopic studies on the model photon up-converting solid composite comprising the (2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-porphyrinato) Ptᴵᴵ (PtOEP) sensitizer, mixed with the blue-light emitting 9,10 diphenyl anthracene (DPA) activator. Atomic force microscopy imaging and photoluminescence (PL) spectra confirm that the strength of intermolecular interactions in the DPA:PtOEP system can be tuned by keeping the composite either in its binary or in its ternary form with the use of the optically inert matrix of polystyrene (PS). By diluting DPA:PtOEP in PS, the concentration of the DPA excimeric and the PtOEP triplet dimer quenching sites is reduced and the lifetime of the DPA up-converted PL signal is prolonged to the microsecond time scale. By lowering the temperature to 100 K, the DPA up-converted luminescence intensity increases by a factor of 3, and this is attributed to the increased energetic disorder of the DPA excited states in the PS:DPA:PtOEP ternary system. These findings provide useful guidelines for the fabrication of efficient solid-state photon up-converting organic layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiphenyl 3ablue light 3achemical interactions 3aguidelines 3aimage analysis 3alight intensity 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotons 3apolystyrenes 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature1 aKeivanidis, Panagiotis E.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2014 July 03, v. 118, no. 26 p.14256-14265dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp50529363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245010700203300002000310520084900330592002801179653001501207653001901222653001301241653001701254653001101271700002801282700002401310700001301334700001401347700001901361700002401380700001901404773019401423856007901617852000901696655001201705IND60517993920160819000000.0160406e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051799392DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15056901122doi7 aPMC46555052pmcid7 a265150942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jun-Bao10aType I IFN induces protein ISGylation to enhance cytokine expression and augments colonic inflammation  ap. 14313-14318.  aSignificance This study demonstrates that the formation of covalent conjugates of IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) to many cellular proteins, a process known as “protein ISGylation,” exacerbates experimental colitis and colitis-associated cancer in mouse models. Additional mechanistic studies uncovered a previously unidentified regulation of macrophage activity by protein ISGylation through the ubiquitin proteasome system–reactive oxygen species–p38 axis. Using available gene-expression data, we show that higher expression of ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 homolog is significantly correlated with worse survival in human patients with colorectal cancer. Thus, our work identified, for the first time to our knowledge, an important role of protein ISGylation in regulating colonic inflammation and its related malignant progression.  aPublisher supplied data 0aISGylation 0aubiquitylation 0acytokine 0ainflammation 0acancer1 aMiyauchi-Ishida, Sayuri1 aArimoto, Kei-ichiro1 aLiu, Dan1 aYan, Ming1 aLiu, Chang-Wei1 aGyáőrffy, Balázs1 aZhang, Dong-Er0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 112, no. 46 p.14313-14318dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15056901123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010700161300002000268520129500288592002801583650001501611650001501626650001401641650001301655650002001668650001101688650001801699650001401717650001301731650001301744650001901757700003001776700002601806773012901832856007501961852000902036655001202045IND60563127820180611000000.0170215e20140717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056312782DNAL7 a10.1021/jp502575a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozlov, Sergey
M.10aAdsorbed and Subsurface Absorbed Hydrogen Atoms on Bare and MgO(100)-Supported Pd and Pt Nanoparticles  ap. 15242-15250.  aHeterogeneous catalysts customarily contain active metal nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on oxides. It is often difficult to understand in detail the influence of supports on NP properties based solely on experimental data. Here, we study by means of electronic structure calculations the effect of a rather chemically inert defect-free support MgO(100) on adsorption and absorption properties of 1.6 nm large Pd₁₂₇ and Pt₁₂₇ NPs representative of bigger species. We show that metal nanostructuring only slightly affects adsorption of single hydrogen atoms on terrace sites. At the same time, structural flexibility of the NPs increases thermodynamic stability of subsurface H in Pt NPs and seems to kinetically assist absorption of H in both Pd and Pt. For H bound to Pd, NPs influence of the support is only noticeable near the metal–oxide interface, while for Pt NPs H atoms more distant from the interface are also affected. Overall, the support is found to change the binding energies of H to Pd₁₂₇ and Pt₁₂₇ NPs by less than 0.1 eV. Quantitative estimates of the differences between adsorption and absorption properties of bare and MgO-supported noble metal NPs are important for modeling of catalytic systems not featuring strong metal–support interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3amagnesium oxide 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3aterraces 3athermodynamics1 aAleksandrov, Hristiyan A.1 aNeyman, Konstantin M.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2014 July 17, v. 118, no. 28 p.15242-15250dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp502575a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245014000162300001600302520175200318592002802070596008902098650002102187650001302208650001302221650001102234650001302245650002402258650001502282650001502297650000902312650001802321650001602339650001002355651001002365700001602375700001602391700001602407700001802423700002002441700001202461700002002473700005602493773012802549856008302677852000902760655001202769IND60793412920221119171026.0220915e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079341292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-022-05424-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ben10aGrowth and nutrient stoichiometry responses to N and P fertilization of 8-year old Masson pines (Pinus massoniana) in subtropical China  ap. 343-356.  aBACKGROUND: Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) plantations are one of the most common forestry plantations in southern China. A high proportion of these plantations is managed as monoculture forests. Productivity in these plantations often declines as they age due to stand retrogression. In these plantations, fertilization is a key practice to prevent stand retrogression. Understanding how plants respond to nutrient fertilization at the tree and stand-level is crucial for evaluating the effects of fertilization and devising nutrient management strategies to prevent stand retrogression and to maintain plantation productivity. METHODS: To determine the effects of nutrient fertilization on plant growth and nutrient stoichiometry, we conducted a nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization experiment in an 8-year old Masson pine plantation in subtropical Hubei Province, China. Plant growth and nutrient stoichiometry responses to fertilization were determined over 12 months. RESULTS: Tree growth in height and trunk diameter and resorption efficiency of both N and P responded positively to N and/or P fertilization. Soil total P concentration was low (0.32 mg/g). Leaf N:P ratio was high and increased (>20) in N fertilization but decreased (<9) in P fertilization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Masson pine plantations of the study area are severely P limited, with low soil P concentration, high leaf N:P ratio, and positive growth responses to P fertilization. As the most common forestry plantations in subtropical and tropical China, P limitation is likely to be a widespread problem facing the Masson pine plantation industry. Thus nutrient fertilization of Masson pine plantations in comparable contexts should focus on P management.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0600304cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China 3aPinus massoniana 3aforestry 3aindustry 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3aphosphorus 3aresorption 3asoil 3astoichiometry 3atree growth 3atrees 3aChina1 aChen, Jihao1 aHuang, Guan1 aZhao, Shuai1 aDong, Fangwei1 aZhang, Yangyang1 aHe, Wei1 aWang, Pengcheng1 aYan, Zhaogui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2246-92510 tPlant and soil.g2022 Aug., v. 477, no. 1-2 p.343-356dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05424-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009900175520174100274592002802015650001502043650001802058650001902076650001402095650001402109650001402123650001302137650001702150650001902167651001202186651001102198653001302209653002902222653002102251653001902272653003102291653002802322700002002350700001802370700003302388773010602421856008802527852000902615655001202624IND60672234120221120195510.0220914e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067223412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.1019922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommer, Laura Kim10a“Pollution Pods”: The merging of art and psychology to engage the public in climate change  aEnvironmental artists have risen to the challenge of communicating the urgency of public action to address environmental problems such as air pollution and climate change. Joining this challenge, the immersive artwork Pollution Pods (PPs) was created through a synthesis of knowledge from the fields of environmental psychology, empirical aesthetics, and activist art. This study summarizes the scientific process in this transdisciplinary project and reports the findings from a questionnaire study (N = 2662) evaluating the effect of the PPs on visitors. Data were collected at the first two exhibitions of the installation, one in a public park in Trondheim, Norway, and one at Somerset House, London, UK. Intentions to act were strong and slightly increased after visiting the art installation. Individual changes in intentions were positively associated with self-reported emotions of sadness, helplessness, and anger and self-reported cognitive assessment their awareness of the environmental consequences of their action, their willingness to take responsibility for their consequences, and belief in the relevance of environmental problems for daily life. Education and age were negatively associated with intentions. Despite favorable intentions, however, taking advantage of an actual behavioral opportunity to track one's climate change emissions behavior after visiting the PPs could not be detected. We conclude that environmental art can be useful for environmental communication and give recommendations for communicators on how to best make use of it. We emphasize the potential benefits of art that encourages personal responsibility and the need for valid behavior measures in environmental psychological research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aair pollution 3aclimate change 3acognition 3aeducation 3aemissions 3aemotions 3apublic parks 3aquestionnaires 3aEngland 3aNorway 0aEmotions 0aEnvironmental psychology 0aInstallation art 0aClimate change 0aTransdisciplinary research 0aEnvironmental awareness1 aSwim, Janet Kay1 aKeller, Ellis1 aKlöckner, Christian Andreas0 tGlobal environmental change.g2019 Nov., v. 59 p.101992-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.1019923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03847naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001800160245022200178300001800400520174800418592002802166650002102194650001002215650001802225650001802243650001302261650002302274650002002297650002102317650001602338650001002354650001202364650001202376650002302388650001102411650002102422650001802443650001402461650001602475650002102491650001202512650001602524650006902540650004302609650000902652650003402661650001402695650005302709650001102762650004902773650004002822650000902862650003602871650002202907650004602929650001302975650001302988700001503001773010403016856004403120852000903164655001203173IND4477038820221116141639.0120516e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447703882DNAL7 a225822972pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2011-020642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalmendal, R.10aEffects of a xylanase and protease, individually or in combination, and an ionophore coccidiostat on performance, nutrient utilization, and intestinal morphology in broiler chickens fed a wheat-soybean meal-based diet  ap. 1387-1393.  aThe effects of 2 single exogenous and monocomponent feed enzymes, and their combination, and an ionophore coccidiostat on production performance, feed AMEn, nutrient utilization, and intestinal morphology were studied in broiler chickens. One-day-old unvaccinated and unsexed Ross 308 birds (n = 320) were kept in groups of 8 on wood shavings in pens raised from the floor and fed one of 5 experimental diets, replicated 8 times, for 36 d. Treatments were 1) a wheat-soybean meal-based feed with no added coccidiostats or exogenous enzymes (CON), 2) CON + ionophore coccidiostat (Narasin), 3) CON + xylanase (Ronozyme WX CT; XYL), 4) CON + serine protease (Ronozyme ProAct CT; PRO), or 5) CON + xylanase + serine protease (XYL+PRO). Enzymes were added on top in the feed formulation. Diets contained 0.5% TiO2 to facilitate estimations of total tract apparent nutrient utilization. Treatments had no effect on BW gain or feed intake, but feed conversion, apparent digestibility of starch and fat, and feed AMEn were improved with all enzyme treatments. The relative length of the ileum was reduced with XYL+PRO. For all parameters measured, the effects of XYL+PRO were similar to when XYL and PRO were fed individually. Narasin had no effect on production performance or nutrient utilization but reduced the relative lengths of jejunum and ileum. Relative lengths and weights of duodenum and cecum were unaffected by treatments. In conclusion, the improved feed conversion with both a xylanase and a protease was reflected in increased nutrient utilization, but their combination was not superior to when supplied separately. Narasin did not affect performance or nutrient utilization but reduced the relative lengths of the jejunum and ileum.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3acecum 3acoccidiostats 3adigestibility 3aduodenum 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afeed formulation 3afeed intake 3aileum 3ajejunum 3anarasin 3aserine proteinases 3astarch 3atitanium dioxide 3awood shavings 3axylanases 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCoccidiostatsxadministration & dosage 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplementsxanalysis 2aDigestion 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aIntestinesxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aIonophoresxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aPyransxadministration & dosage 2aRandom Allocation 2aSerine Proteasesxadministration & dosage 2aSoybeans 2aTriticum1 aTauson, R.0 tPoultry science.g2012 June, v. 91, no. 6 p.1387-1393dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2011-02064  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013200168300001600300520112500316592002801441650002101469650001301490650003001503650001301533650002801546650001901574650002401593650001501617650001701632650001401649650001601663650001301679650001201692650001901704650002501723650001501748653002101763653001501784653000801799700001601807773010301823856008601926852000902012655001202021IND60537889320221122201051.0190408e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053788932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahay, Ratna10aIdentification and performance of sodicity tolerant phosphate solubilizing bacterial isolates on Ocimum basilicum in sodic soil  ap. 639-643.  aOcimum basilicum is tolerant to higher salt, pH and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) in soil. It is observed as a potential crop to be grown in salt affected soil. Its tolerance to adverse condition and association with halophilic beneficial microbes together can play a greater role for utilization and improvement of sodic waste land. After screening the potential phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) (RS-1, RS-2, RS-3 and RS-4) from sodic soil, they were identified and tested in pot experiment in naturally occurring sodic soil having pH 9.3 and ESP about 45. At optimum condition, these bacteria showed phosphorus solubilization potential in liquid medium containing tricalcium phosphate (TCP) under laboratory condition. Inoculation of PSB significantly increased the plant growth with respect to height, number of branches, dry matter accumulation and P content of plants. Quantity and quality of essential oil were also significantly influenced by PSB inoculation as compared to control. It has been observed that PSB also improved the physical, chemical and biological properties of the post harvest soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3abacteria 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abranches 3adry matter accumulation 3aessential oils 3aexchangeable sodium 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3ascreening 3asodic soils 3asodicity 3asoil pH 3asolubilization 3atricalcium phosphate 3awastelands 0aOcimum basilicum 0aSodic soil 0aPSB1 aPatra, D.D.0 tEcological engineering.g2014 Oct., v. 71 p.639-643dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012700159300001600286500002000302520153700322592002801859596005201887596005501939596005501994650001802049650002102067650000802088650001602096650001102112650001602123650002702139650001102166650001502177650003802192650001402230650001602244650001302260650001102273651001402284651002402298700001502322700001702337700001802354700001802372700001202390700001802402700001602420700002602436700001702462700002302479700002002502773013602522856007302658852000902731655001202740IND60747473120221121155522.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074747312DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.125042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHapairai, L.

Given the widespread emergence of insecticide resistance, stable and biofriendly alternatives for mosquito larviciding are needed. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that inactivated yeast interfering RNA tablets targeting key larval developmental genes can be used to facilitate effective larvicidal activity while also promoting selective gravid female oviposition behaviour. Here we examined the efficacy of transferring this technology toward development of lure‐and‐kill ovitraps targeting Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) female mosquitoes. Insectary, simulated field and semi‐field experiments demonstrated that two mosquito‐specific yeast interfering RNA pesticides induce high levels of mortality among larvae of both species in treated large volume containers. Small‐scale field trials conducted in Trinidad, West Indies demonstrated that large volume ovitrap containers baited with inactivated yeast tablets lure significantly more gravid females than traps containing only water and were highly attractive to both A. aegypti and A. albopictus females. These studies indicate that development of biorational yeast interfering RNA‐baited ovitraps may represent a new tool for control of Aedes mosquitoes, including deployment in existing lure‐and‐kill ovitrap technologies or traditional container larviciding programs.  aPublisher supplied data  aR21 AI128116‐01cCenter for Scientific Review  aW81XWH‐17‐1‐0294cU.S. Department of Defense  aW81XWH‐17‐1‐0295cU.S. Department of Defense 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes albopictus 3aRNA 3aarboviruses 3ahumans 3ainsectaries 3ainsecticide resistance 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3amedical and veterinary entomology 3amortality 3aoviposition 3aovitraps 3ayeasts 3aCaribbean 3aTrinidad and Tobago1 aMysore, K.1 aJames, L.

The main results found were: i) Phosphorus (P) concentration varied seasonally, with organic P and total P increasing in the sediments in warmer periods; i) Sediment spatial variation, in terms of grain size composition and organic matter content, influenced P concentrations; iii) quantities and qualities of P in the sediments were positively correlated with water parameters, especially DO and NO₃, Chl-a, water temperature, pH, and total P. Negative correlations were observed between %OP and DO in sites 1, 3 and 4, and with NO₃ in sites 2, 3 and 4; iv) benthic functional feeding groups showed significant relationships with temporal variation in sediment P concentration, including gathering- collectors, shredders, filterers and filtering-collectors. The results suggest a high importance of temperature mediated control of sediment-P release, both directly, through its direct effects on primary production and decomposition rates, and indirectly through its effects on other water and sediment parameters, especially dissolved oxygen concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic organisms 3adissolved oxygen 3alakes 3alimnology 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aprimary productivity 3awater temperature 3aBrazil 0aPhosphorus release 0asubtropical lake 0asediment phosphorus 0amacroinvertebrates 0aSouthern Brazil.

The detection of specific antibodies associated with this disease is required to confirm its clinical diagnosis and to aid in prevention. Although helminth infection during pregnancy can promote foetal immune responses with long-term effects, specific information regarding the risk of Toxocara spp. infection to the human foetus during pregnancy is lacking.Therefore,the present study aimed to investigate the frequency of antibodies against Toxocara spp. in umbilical cord serum samples to determine the neonatal risk factors associated with Toxocara spp. infection.A cross-sectional study of the frequency of specific antibodies against Toxocara spp. was performed on umbilical cord samples of 280 neonates. A cord blood sample was obtained from each newborn after parturition, and serum samples were examined by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Epidemiological data were obtained through a questionnaire regarding obstetric history (abortion history, premature birthhistory, and pregnancy and birth numbers), general aspects (animal contact anddiet) and socio-economic factors). The frequency of anti-Toxocara spp. IgG antibodies in the umbilical cords of neonates was 20% in serum pre-adsorbed with Ascaris spp. antigen. Family income and dog ownership were considered risk factors associated with infection. No association was found between reproductive disorders and Toxocara seropositivity. The 20% frequency rate of anti-Toxocara spp. IgG antibodies in sera from umbilical cords of newborns can be related to IgG binding at the maternal-foetal interface, requiring greater care during pregnancy. Anti-Toxocara IgM and IgE antibodies no were found in umbilical cord serum samples, indicating that no vertical transmission of these parasites occurred in this population. Studies regarding antibodies against Toxocara spp. in umbilical cord sera are important for determining neonatal exposure to these parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscaris 3aToxocara 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3adogs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afetus 3ageographical distribution 3ahospitals 3ahousehold income 3ahuman diseases 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3along term effects 3aneonates 3aownership 3aparasites 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3aquestionnaires 3areproductive disorders 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3asocioeconomic factors 3atoxocariasis 3aumbilical cord 3aBrazil 0aumbilical cord 0aToxocara spp 0arisk factors 0avertical transmission1 aTelmo, Paula Lima1 aLehmann, Lis Maurente1 aLorenzi, Carolina1 aHirsch, Carolina1 aMattos, Gabriela Torres1 aKlafke, Gabriel Baracy1 aBerne, Maria Elisabeth Aires1 aGonçalves, Carla Vitola1 aScaini, Carlos James0 tActa tropica.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245014200216500002200358520196000380592002802340650001102368650002202379650001002401650001802411650002502429650001702454650001902471650001902490650001802509653003402527653002602561653001602587653002702603653002902630700006202659700001602721773010102737856008702838852000902925655001202934IND60670300520221119233332.0191002e20190923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067030052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1121012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCozzolino, Raffaello1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2991-992110aExperimental characterisation of a novel thermal energy storage based on open-cell copper foams immersed in organic Phase Change Material  aPre-press version  aIn this paper, a novel tubes-in-tank thermal energy storage (TIT-TES) based on open-cell copper foams immersed in organic paraffin is presented and experimentally studied. The system consists of a rectangular external case which encloses 16 U-tubes and phase change material (PCM) embedded in copper foams matrix, which guarantee an average power during both heat charge and discharge phases close to 1 kW and high storing/releasing energy efficiency. With the aim of measuring internal temperature, six thermocouples have been installed at two different sections, S1 and S2, located at 1/3 and at 2/3 of the total height, respectively. In order to thermally characterize the system during the heat charge and discharge phases, a series of tests have carried out under different inlet temperatures and flow rate of the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Temperature evolutions have obtained during the tests, and directional temperature derivative profiles, time-durations, average powers and energy efficiencies have derived so to evaluate and characterize the TIT-TES performance. The results have shown how both HTF volumetric flow rate and inlet temperature play a relevant role in heat charge and discharge phases. A larger temperature difference between the HTF and the PCM and a higher HTF input flow rate improve heat transfer and consequently increase the average exchanged power and energy efficiency as well. In particular, during the thermal charge phase, when the HTF temperature increases from 80 °C to 90 °C, the energy efficiencies increase from 73.6% to 91.4% and from 78.7% to 93.8% for the minimum and maximum HTF flow conditions respectively.The analysis of directional temperature derivative profiles have allowed to define some important characteristics of the apparatus, highlighting the preferential directions of the liquefaction/solidification front paths, and also confirming the importance of the HTF inlet temperature and flow rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aenergy efficiency 3afoams 3aheat transfer 3ainternal temperature 3aliquefaction 3asolidification 3athermal energy 3athermocouples 0aLatent Thermal Energy Storage 0aPhase Change Material 0aCopper Foam 0aExperimental procedure 0aThermal characterisation1 aChiappini, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5316-44341 aBella, Gino0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 23, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1121013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245008000186300001800266520096100284592002801245650002001273650001601293650001701309650001801326650001001344650001701354650001501371650001001386650002501396650001101421650001101432650001401443650001101457650001901468650001801487650001301505650001801518650003001536650002701566650002201593650003101615650002401646650003301670700002601703773011601729856004801845852000901893655001201902IND50063290620221116141618.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006329062DNAL7 a233068902pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-012-0066-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Baljinder10aBiotechnological and Molecular Approaches for Vanillin Production: a Review  ap. 1353-1372.  aVanillin is one of the most widely used flavoring agents in the world. As the annual world market demand of vanillin could not be met by natural extraction, chemical synthesis, or tissue culture technology, thus biotechnological approaches may be replacement routes to make production of bio-vanillin economically viable. This review’s main focus is to highlight significant aspects of biotechnology with emphasis on the production of vanillin from eugenol, isoeugenol, lignin, ferulic acid, sugars, phenolic stilbenes, vanillic acid, aromatic amino acids, and waste residues by applying fungi, bacteria, and plant cells. Production of biovanillin using GRAS lactic acid bacteria and metabolically engineered microorganisms, genetic organization of vanillin biosynthesis operons/gene cassettes and finally the stability of biovanillin generated through various biotechnological procedures are also critically reviewed in the later sections of the review.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGRAS substances 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acells 3aferulic acid 3aflavorings 3afungi 3alactic acid bacteria 3alignin 3aoperon 3astilbenes 3asugars 3atissue culture 3avanillic acid 3avanillin 3aworld markets 2aBenzaldehydesxmetabolism 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aBiotransformation 2aCoumaric Acidsxmetabolism 2aEugenolxmetabolism 2aLactobacillaceaexmetabolism1 aChakraborty, Debkumar0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2013 Feb., v. 169, no. 4 p.1353-1372dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-012-0066-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008600172300001600258520126700274592002801541650001901569650001601588650001201604650001201616650001101628650002601639650001801665650001501683650001801698650001001716650001901726650001401745650000701759650001901766650002001785653002501805653001701830653001901847653001601866653003301882700002101915773010301936856008602039852000902125655001202134IND60537889620221122222704.0190408e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053788962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuthar, Surindra10aNutrient recovery from urban forest leaf litter waste solids using Eisenia fetida  ap. 660-666.  aThe efforts were made in this study to recycle the nutrients from silver oak (SOL) and bamboo (BL) leaf litter waste solids spiked with cow dung (CD) using earthworm Eisenia fetida. A total of five mixtures of leaf litter and CD were vermicomposted and the changes in physico-chemical properties were recorded at the end. Vermicomposting caused significant decrease in pH, total organic carbon, exchK and C:N ratio by 2.4–11.8, 4–10.07, 13.4–45.2 and 2.18–4.13-folds, respectively, but increase in EC, ash content, totN, totP, totCa, and N–NO3− contents of 12–142, 1.07–1.17, 2.1–3.72, 111–117, 182–215, 9.47–17.59-folds, respectively in leaf litter waste mixtures. The vermibed with SOL showed the high mineralization rate than BL vermibeds. The vermicomposted waste mixture showed high microbial populations: bacterial (423.33–684.0CFU×105g−1), fungal (22.0–36.67 CFU×105g−1) and actinomycetes (107.67–141.67CFU×105g−1). E. fetida showed better biomass and cocoon numbers in all vermibeds. The earthworm population build-up was the maximum in CD (100%) set-up (50.0±3.0).

If niche overlap between the species is substantial, the intrinsic faster population growth of the unisexual over sexual species can cause competitive exclusion of the host from resources, causing the demise of the unisexual species. However, theoretical models predict that coexistence is possible, even without niche differentiation, if the unisexual species is a poorer competitor than the sexual host and if the effect of the unisexual species on the exploitative abilities of the sexual species is smaller than the effect that the sexually reproducing individuals have among themselves. We tested these predictions in the unisexual-bisexual mating complex of Poecilia formosa, and one of its sexual hosts, P. latipinna. Fishes were housed from parturition for 76 days with both conspecific and heterospecific individuals under both limited and ad libitum food regimes. Only one of the predictions of the models was met: the effects of intraspecific competition for P. latipinna were stronger than the effects of interspecific competition. Poecilia latipinna raised with conspecifics with limited food stored fewer fats than both heterospecific P. formosa, and conspecifics raised in any other treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia formosa 3acompetitive exclusion 3afish 3afoods 3ahosts 3aintraspecific competition 3alipids 3amodels 3aparturition 3apopulation growth 3aspermatozoa 3asympatry1 aRobinson, Reginald J.1 aTobler, Michael1 aAspbury, Andrea S.1 aGabor, Caitlin R.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2014 Aug., v. 97, no. 8 p.875-880dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-013-0188-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245011000183300001600293520175300309592002802062650001602090650001502106650002302121650002302144650002202167650001802189650002802207650001202235650001802247650001102265650002802276650002302304650001202327650002402339650001402363650002002377650001502397650003302412650003302445650001102478650001302489653001602502653002302518653003102541653001502572653002202587653003402609700002002643700002302663700002202686700001902708700002602727700002402753773009102777856009002868852000902958655001202967IND60581564520221123004814.0181011e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058156452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.09.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Andreia C.M.10aEnergetic costs and biochemical biomarkers associated with esfenvalerate exposure in Sericostoma vittatum  ap. 445-453.  aPyrethroid insecticides have been used for decades and their worldwide market continues to increase, despite their high toxicity to non-target insects. Recent studies reveal that it is essential to investigate the secondary mechanisms of action of type II pyrethroids to understand their cellular effects on invertebrates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lethality, behaviour and physiological alterations and energetic costs in caddisfly larvae exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of esfenvalerate (ESF). ESF caused both mortality and feeding inhibition of exposed caddisfly larvae: nominal ESF 96 h LC50 was 2.29 μg/L; feeding activity was impaired at concentrations equal or above 0.25 μg/L. At the cellular level, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was increased on caddisfly larvae exposed to 0.25 and 0.5 μg/L ESF, which might contribute to prevent oxidative damage since levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) were not altered. The energy budget of exposed caddisfly larvae was impaired by exposure to 0.25 μg/L ESF since sugar and protein contents decreased, while a decline of energy consumption was observed. The analysis of feeding, energy reserves and consumption data through structural equation modelling (SEM) allowed to quantify the direct and indirect effects of ESF exposure on bioenergetics of caddisfly larvae. SEM analysis showed a strong negative direct influence of ESF onto feeding activity, sugars content and energy consumption, highlighting a significant positive relationship between sugars and protein contents. These results show that energy expenditure is related to oxidative defense mechanisms induced by ESF stress that may lead to deleterious effects on growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoptera 3abiomarkers 3adefense mechanisms 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy metabolism 3aesfenvalerate 3aglutathione transferase 3ainsects 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3alipid peroxidation 3amarkets 3amechanism of action 3amortality 3aprotein content 3apyrethrins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astructural equation modeling 3asugars 3atoxicity 0aPyrethroids 0aNon-target insects 0aCellular energy allocation 0aBiomarkers 0aFeeding behaviour 0aStructural equation modelling1 aGravato, Carlos1 aQuintaneiro, Carla1 aBordalo, Maria D.1 aBarata, Carlos1 aSoares, Amadeu M.V.M.1 aPestana, João L.T.0 tChemosphere.g2017 Dec., v. 189 p.445-453dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.09.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245009500177520202000272592002802292650002302320650002402343650001602367650002502383650001702408650001102425650001602436650001502452650002002467650002402487650001302511650001402524650001002538650001902548651001002567653002202577653002202599653002502621653001302646653003802659700003002697700002202727700002302749700002302772773011902795856008802914852000903002655001203011IND60773062920221119125729.0220606e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077306292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1550722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjha, Priti Chhanda10aOvercoming challenges due to enhanced biomedical waste generation during COVID-19 pandemic  aBiomedical wastes (BMWs) are potentially infectious to the environment and health. They are co-dependent and accumulative during the ongoing coronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19) pandemic. In India the standard treatment processes of BMWs are incineration, autoclaving, shredding, and deep burial; however, incineration and autoclaving are the leading techniques applied by many treatment providers. These conventional treatment methods have several drawbacks in terms of energy, cost, and emission. But the actual problem for the treatment providers is the huge and non-uniform flow of the BMWs during the pandemic. The existing treatment methods are lacking flexibility for the non-uniform flow. The Government of India has provisionally approved some new techniques like plasma pyrolysis, sharp/needle blaster, and PIWS-3000 technologies on a trial basis. But they are all found to be inadequate in the pandemic. Therefore, there is an absolute requirement to micromanage the BMWs based on certain parameters for the possible COVID-19 like pandemic in the future. Segregation is a major step of the BMW management. Its guideline may be shuffled as segregation at the entry points followed by collection instead of the existing system of the collection followed by segregation. Other steps like transportation, location of treatment facilities, upgradation of the existing treatment facilities, and new technologies can solve the challenges up to a certain extent. Technologies like microwave treatment, alkaline hydrolysis, steam sterilization, biological treatment, catalytic solar disinfection, and nanotechnology have a lot of scopes for the treatment of BMWs. Hi-tech approaches in handling and transportation are found to be fruitful in the initial steps of BMW management. End products of the treated BMWs can be potentially fabricated for the application in the built environment. Some policies need to be re-evaluated by the health care facilities or government administrations for efficient BMW management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3aautoclaving 3abiological treatment 3adisinfection 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aguidelines 3ahealth services 3amicrowave treatment 3apandemic 3apyrolysis 3asteam 3atransportation 3aIndia 0aBiomedical wastes 0aCOVID-19 pandemic 0aTreatment facilities 0aPolicies 0aUpgrading conventional techniques1 aSatpathy, Swati Sucharita1 aOjha, Akash Kumar1 aSukla, Lala Behari1 aPradhan, Debabrata0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 832 p.155072-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1550723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245018200168300001800350520118600368592002801554650001401582650001401596650001501610650002801625650001501653650002101668650004301689650001301732650001901745650001901764700001901783700001801802700001401820700001401834700001201848700001601860773010401876856008401980852000902064655001202073IND4449707920221120193011.0141111e20110304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444970792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xiao-Ping10aOn-line high-performance liquid chromatography–diode array detection–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry–chemiluminescence assay of radical scavengers in Epimedium  ap. 1227-1235.  aAn on-line analysis method for the simultaneous detection and identification of radical scavenging compounds in plant extracts was developed by combining HPLC with hydrogen dioxide radical scavenging and HPLC–DAD–MS–CL system. The structural identification and activity characteristics of various constituents could be rapidly achieved by the on-line assay of UV, MS and CL in one run. In 4 species of Epimedium studied 32 compounds, including phenolic acids, 8-isopentenyl-flavonoid glycosides and flavonoid glycosides containing a ortho-hydroxyl group, were identified by comparison with authentic standards and published mass data. Among these compounds, phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides containing an ortho-hydroxyl group could obviously inhibit CL, which suggested their strong radical scavenging activity. These four species each exhibited different active properties, which might correlate to their respective quality. The results indicated that the on-line HPLC–DAD–MS–CL system would be a potential method to rapidly and sensitively screen radical scavengers in herbal medicines, and could display an integrated fingerprint based on different detectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpimedium 3adetectors 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3aglycosides 3aherbal medicines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen 3aphenolic acids 3aplant extracts1 aWang, Xin-Tang1 aChen, Lin-Lin1 aGuo, Qing1 aWang, Hui1 aQi, Jin1 aYu, Bo-Yang0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Mar. 4, v. 1218, no. 9 p.1227-1235dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245016600197300001600363500002000379520137400399592002801773596007301801650001501874650002201889650001501911650002601926650001201952650002101964650003801985650003002023650001902053650001402072650002502086650001202111650001302123650002202136651001002158700006202168700001402230700001402244700005402258700005402312700002202366700002302388700006902411700005602480773013602536856007302672852000902745655001202754IND60747473520221121155616.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074747352DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.125092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, M.

It is associated with poverty and imposes a significant health, welfare and economic burden on many tropical countries. Current methods to visualize infections within the vectors rely on invasive methods. However, using micro‐computed tomography techniques, without interference from physical tissue manipulation, we visualized in three dimensions for the first time an L1 larva of an Onchocerca species within the thoracic musculature of a blackfly, Simulium damnosum s.l. Theobald 1903 (Diptera: Simuliidae), naturally infected in Ghana. The possibility that thicker peritrophic membranes in savannah flies could account for their lower parasite loads was not supported, but there were limits to our analysis. While there were no statistically significant differences between the mean thicknesses of the peritrophic membranes, in the anterior, dorsal and ventral regions, of forest and savannah blackflies killed 34–48 min after a blood‐meal, the thickness of the peritrophic membrane in the posterior region could not be measured. Micro‐computed tomography has the potential to provide novel information on many other parasite/vector systems and impactful images for public engagement in health education.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/R005362/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council 3aOnchocerca 3aSimulium damnosum 3ablood meal 3acitizen participation 3aforests 3ahealth education 3amedical and veterinary entomology 3amicro-computed tomography 3aonchocerciasis 3aparasites 3aperitrophic membrane 3apoverty 3asavannas 3atropical diseases 3aGhana1 aMartín‐Vega, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5626-54411 aClark, B.1 aGhosh, D.1 aRogers, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6542-64381 aPigoli, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4591-41671 aVeriegh, F.

An ideal plant architecture is important for achieving high grain yield in crops. Tiller angle (TA) is an important factor influencing yield. In the present study, 266 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Zhongmai 871 (ZM871) and its sister line Zhongmai 895 (ZM895) was used to map TA by extreme pool-genotyping and inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM). Two quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 1AL and 5DL were identified with reduced tiller angle alleles contributed by ZM895. QTA.caas-1AL was detected in six environments, explaining 5.4–11.2% of the phenotypic variances. The major stable QTL, QTA.caas-5DL, was identified in all eight environments, accounting for 13.8–24.8% of the phenotypic variances. The two QTL were further validated using BC₁F₄ populations derived from backcrosses ZM871/ZM895//ZM871 (121 lines) and ZM871/ZM895//ZM895 (175 lines). Gene TraesCS5D02G322600, located in the 5DL QTL and designated TaTAC-D1, had a SNP in the third exon with ‘A’ and ‘G’ in ZM871 and ZM895, respectively, resulting in a Thr169Ala amino acid change. A KASP marker based on this SNP was validated in two sets of germplasm, providing further evidence for the significant effects of TaTAC-D1 on TA. Thus extreme pool-genotyping can be employed to detect QTL for plant architecture traits and KASP markers tightly linked with the QTL can be used in wheat breeding programs targeting improved plant architecture.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0101802cthe National Key Research and Development Programs of China  a2016YFD0100502cthe National Key Research and Development Programs of China  a2016YFE0108600cthe National Key Research and Development Programs of China  aZDRW202002cCAAS 3aamino acids 3abackcrossing 3aexons 3agermplasm 3agrain yield 3aphenotype 3aplant architecture 3aquantitative traits 3awheat1 aYang, Li1 aXu, Kaijie1 aCao, Shuanghe1 aTian, Yubing1 aYan, Jun1 aHe, Zhonghu1 aXia, Xianchun1 aSong, Xiyue1 aZhang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3669-39080 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Nov., v. 133, no. 11 p.3037-3047dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03653-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100001600182245013500198300001600333500002400349520196100373650001502334650001602349650001402365650000802379650001102387650001602398650002302414650001602437650001802453650001502471651001202486700001602498700001802514773011702532852000902649856011202658856008602770930003302856945001302889946001302902655001202915IND2333636020221118230508.0030716e200208  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233363602DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-31.4.7022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL001 0aL500 0aL2101 aLuker, L.A.10aReproductive responses to photoperiod by a south Florida population of the grasshopper Romalea microptera (Orthoptera: Romaleidae)  ap. 702-707.  aIncludes references  aReproductive tactics of some insects are affected by photoperiod because daylength is a reliable cue indicating seasonal change in environmental suitability. We tested the hypothesis that late-season (short-day) photoperiod affects the length of the oviposition cycle of the eastern lubber grasshopper, which is from a subtropical area with a winter dry season. We predicted that oviposition would occur sooner in short-day (11.5:12.5 [L:D] h) than in long-day (13.75:10.25 [L:D] h) individuals, and that costs associated with earlier oviposition would be expressed as smaller eggs or fewer eggs per female under the short-day photoperiod. Two diets (low and high food quantity) were tested at each photoperiod. Although MANOVA yielded no significant main effect of photoperiod on the timing of oviposition, number of eggs, and mean egg dry mass, there was a significant multivariate interaction between photoperiod and food for these variables. In the low food treatment, the short-day animals produced fewer, smaller eggs than did the long-day animals, but this multivariate difference between short-day and long-day animals was absent in the high-food treatment. Photoperiod and its interaction with food did not affect timing of oviposition in either multivariate or univariate analyses. The absence of the predicted change in timing of reproduction in an autumn photoperiod suggests that seasonal constraints on reproduction do not exert a strong influence on reproductive timing of this population. Our alternative hypothesis is that the combination of short days and low food availability serve as a cue to lubber grasshoppers of an oncoming dry season with potentially limiting food, and that they respond to this cue by reducing the mass of reproductive output but not by accelerating reproductive timing. Thus, we propose that these subtropical grasshoppers adjust reproductive investment in response to seasonal changes in resource availability. 3aOrthoptera 3aoviposition 3afecundity 3aova 3aweight 3aphotoperiod 3aseasonal variation 3afood intake 3afeeding level 3adry season 3aFlorida1 aHatle, J.D.1 aJuliano, S.A.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2002 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.702-707dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-31.4.7023Available from publisher's Web site  a20110119b20110205c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01280naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011600159300001800275520037700293592002800670650002300698650002700721650001100748650001000759700001800769773013200787856007400919852000900993655001201002IND60638628120221122084504.0190430e20160107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063862812DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc08538a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhvenniemi, E.10aAtomic/molecular layer deposition: a direct gas-phase route to crystalline metal–organic framework thin films  ap. 1139-1142.  aAtomic/molecular layer deposition offers us an elegant way of fabricating crystalline copper(ii)terephthalate metal–organic framework (MOF) thin films on various substrate surfaces.

To simultaneously solve the problems of the phytotoxicity and non-systemic insecticidal activity of tralopyril, four new tralopyril conjugates containing theanine or glutamic acid moieties were designed and synthesized. Their phytotoxicity to tea shoot, phloem systemicity, and insecticidal activity were evaluated. Phytotoxic symptoms were not observed after the tea shoots were exposed to the four conjugates at concentrations of 2mM. The phloem mobility test on Ricinus communis L. seedlings confirmed that all four conjugates were mobile in the sieve tubes. Results of insecticidal activity against the third-instar larvae of Plutella xylostella showed that only conjugate 20 exhibited activity with an LC50 value of 0.5882±0.0504mM. After root application to tea seedlings, conjugate 20 showed obviously systemic insecticidal activity against Dendrothrips minowai Priesner, while chlorfenapyr showed no attribute of that. A new conjugate as potential phloem mobile pro-insecticide candidate was provided and so a novel strategy of pro-insecticide for improved phloem systemicity was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendrothrips 3aPlutella xylostella 3aRicinus communis 3achlorfenapyr 3aglutamic acid 3ainsecticidal properties 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3aphytotoxicity 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asieve tubes 3atea 3atheanine 0aTheanine 0aGlutamic acid 0aTralopyril 0aChlorfenapyr 0aPhloem mobility1 aChen, Yao1 aZhang, Ying1 aGao, Xiu-Bing1 aZhou, Yu-Feng0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Sept., v. 141 p.29-40dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245011100161300001600272520167400288592002801962596005901990596005902049596004702108596008502155650002802240650002302268650002802291650001202319650001102331650001202342650002602354650001402380650001502394650001702409650001902426650003202445650001002477650001602487650001702503651001002520700005302530700001602583700001502599700001502614700001802629773012802647856008302775852000902858655001202867IND60793413620221119171018.0220915e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079341362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-022-05421-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Nan10aUrban soil phosphorus hotspot and its imprint on tree leaf phosphorus concentrations in the Beijing region  ap. 425-437.  aPURPOSE: Rapid urbanization has altered regional nutrient cycles and consequently affected soil nutrient availability for plant growth. This study aims to explore the way in which urbanization shapes the spatial patterns of soil phosphorus (P) concentrations as well as the imprint on tree leaf P concentrations across gradients of urban-rural forests. METHODS: We collected soil samples of the surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-20 cm) layers and leaf samples of three common tree species (Chinese pine, Pinus tabuliformis; Chinese scholar tree, Sophora japonica; golden rain tree, Koelreuteria paniculata) from forest patches in twenty parks across urban-rural transects in the Beijing metropolitan region, China. By measuring soil total P, soil available P, and leaf P concentrations, we tested the urban soil P hotspot hypothesis and assessed the consequent imprint on tree leaf P concentrations. RESULTS: Soil total P and available P concentrations in the surface and subsurface layers both increased significantly with closer distance to the urban core. Spatially, leaf P concentrations showed an increase with soil available P concentrations only for the legume Chinese scholar tree, while leaf P concentrations of Chinese pine and broadleaf golden rain tree both increased significantly with the diameter at breast height. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the occurrence of an urban soil P hotspot and identified its significant imprint on leaf P nutrition of legume trees across transects of urban-rural forests. The findings improve the understanding of the way that urbanization alters regional P cycles and consequent P availability for plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data  a41877328cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41630750cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a161015cFok Ying Tong Education Foundation  a2021-TS-02cState Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology 3aKoelreuteria paniculata 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aStyphnolobium japonicum 3aforests 3aleaves 3alegumes 3anutrient availability 3anutrition 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3asoil nutrients 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aurban soils 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aDu, Enzai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5519-01501 aGuo, Yuying1 aTang, Yang1 aWang, Yang1 ade Vries, Wim0 tPlant and soil.g2022 Aug., v. 477, no. 1-2 p.425-437dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05421-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011700160300001800277500001900295520144300314592002801757596006501785596011701850596008501967650002202052650001902074650002202093650001302115650001602128650001502144650001002159650001302169650001102182650000902193650002102202650003002223650002002253700001302273700001802286700001602304700001602320700001702336700005602353773013902409856008202548852000902630655001202639IND60714486820221121044517.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071448682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-020-03664-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Xu10aImproved Brassica oleracea JZS assembly reveals significant changing of LTR-RT dynamics in different morphotypes  ap. 3187-3199.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBrassica oleracea is an important vegetable crop that has provided ancestor genomes of the two most important Brassica oil crops, Brassica napus and Brassica carinata. The current B. oleracea reference genome (JZS, also named 02–12) displays problems of large mis-assemblies, low sequence continuity, and low assembly integrity, thus limiting genomic analysis. We reported an updated assembly of the B. oleracea reference genome (JZS v2) obtained through single-molecule sequencing and chromosome conformation capture technologies. We assembled an additional 83.16 Mb of genomic sequences, and the updated genome features a contig N50 size of 2.37 Mb, representing an ~ 88-fold improvement. We detected a new round of long terminal repeat retrotransposon (LTR-RT) burst in the new assembly. Comparative analysis with the reported genome sequences of two other genomes of B. oleracea (TO1000 and HDEM) identified extensive gene order and gene structural variation. In addition, we found that the genome-specific amplification of Gypsy-like LTR-RTs occurred around 0–1 million years ago (MYA). In particular, the athila, tat, and Del families were extensively amplified in JZS around 0–1 MYA. Moreover, we identified that the syntenic genes were modified due to the insertion of genome-specific LTR-RTs. These results indicated that the genome-specific LTR-RT dynamics were associated with genome diversification in B. oleracea.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0100307cthe National Program on Key Research Project  aNSFC grants 31630068cInnovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  aNo.Y2017PT52cCentral Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund 3aBrassica carinata 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica oleracea 3aancestry 3achromosomes 3agene order 3agenes 3agenomics 3amorphs 3aoils 3aretrotransposons 3aterminal repeat sequences 3avegetable crops1 aWu, Jian1 aLiang, Jianli1 aLin, Runmao1 aZhang, Kang1 aZheng, Feng,1 aWang, Xiaowu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6753-227X0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Nov., v. 133, no. 11 p.3187-3199dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03664-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011400165300001600279500002000295520127900315592002801594596007401622596007401696650002401770650003001794650001001824650000801834650001201842650002001854650002401874650001401898650003801912650001001950650001201960650001501972651001401987700002202001700002002023700005602043700002002099773013602119856007302255852000902328655001202337IND60747473720221121155557.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074747372DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.124992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurčinavičienė, J.14aThe contribution of insects to African swine fever virus dispersal: data from domestic pig farms in Lithuania  ap. 484-489.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOutbreaks of African Swine Fever (ASF) in domestic pig farms in Lithuania typically begin in June and are detected through October, suggesting that insects might be involved in the transmission of the virus. Entomological collecting was performed to obtain two data sets: from farms with ASF outbreaks, and from farms without ASF outbreaks but in an ASF‐infected area. Target insects from the families Muscidae, Calliphoridae and Tabanidae were analysed for the presence of ASF Virus (ASFV) DNA. Musca domestica L., Calliphoridae flies and Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) collected by entomological net during ASF outbreaks were confirmed to be ASFV positive. Viral DNA detected in insects collected by Nzi traps from farms with no ASFV outbreaks indicate that Culex, Lucilia, M. domestica and S. calcitrans are likely to play a role in spreading the ASFV mechanically. This finding could suggest contamination from outside of the farms: from infected wild boar or their carcasses. The role of Stomoxys flies as mechanical vectors could be accidental, because we did not find a significant correlation between the activity of S. calcitrans and the number of ASF outbreaks in pig farms, whereas temperatures positively correlated to the number of ASF outbreaks during 2018–2019.  aPublisher supplied data  aMT‐18‐4cthe Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Lithuania  aMT‐19‐3cthe Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Lithuania 3aAfrican swine fever 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3aCulex 3aDNA 3aLucilia 3aMusca domestica 3aStomoxys calcitrans 3aTabanidae 3amedical and veterinary entomology 3aswine 3aviruses 3awild boars 3aLithuania1 aPetrašiūnas, A.1 aBernotienė, R.1 aMasiulis, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2779-58031 aJonušaitis, V.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2021 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.484-489dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl42323x0269-283X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.124993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245007300173300001200246520148700258592002801745650001801773650002101791650003001812650001101842650001801853650001001871650001501881650001601896650001301912650001801925650001701943650001901960650001401979650001401993650002502007650001002032650001602042650001202058650001302070651001202083653001502095653001802110653001902128653002802147653001302175700001902188700001902207700001902226700002002245700001702265700002302282700002002305700001602325773007502341856008902416852000902505655001202514IND60563128820221117223924.0170719e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056312882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabus, Josipa10aNew trends in human and animal leptospirosis in Croatia, 2009–2014  ap. 1-8.  aLeptospirosis is a geographically widespread and globally underestimated zoonosis that affects humans and variety of animals. To identify trends and possible risk factors, joined medical and veterinary teams investigated epidemiology and epizootiology of leptospirosis in Croatia. Retrospective analysis of data obtained from referent diagnostic laboratories included a total of 1917 human and 123964 animal sera tested in the period from 2009 to 2014. We found high human leptospirosis average incidence rate of 1.53/100000 with clear predominance of male patients older than 40 years (sex ratio M/F:3.2; median age 51±15.1years). Statistical analysis revealed seasonal and annual variations of incidence in humans that were primarily associated with favourable weather conditions (temperature 10–19, 9°C and precipitation above 100mm/m2). Majority of infections in humans were caused by serogroups Sejroe, Australis and Icterohaemorrhagiae. Notable variations in seroprevalence and changing trends in prevailing serogroups were recorded in most of the domestic animals and during the entire period of investigation. All of the observed findings underline leptospirosis as a significant human and veterinary public health threat and emphasize the importance of continuous multidisciplinary surveillance. We also argue that only input from both professions improves our overall knowledge on leptospirosis and leads to better and more efficient prevention and control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata analysis 3adomestic animals 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3aleptospirosis 3amales 3amonitoring 3aoccupations 3apatients 3apublic health 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3aserotypes 3asex ratio 3astatistical analysis 3ateams 3atemperature 3aweather 3azoonoses 3aCroatia 0aLeptospira 0aLeptospirosis 0aSeroprevalence 0aLaboratory surveillance 0aZoonoses1 aPersic, Zdenka1 aSpicic, Silvio1 aVince, Silvijo1 aStritof, Zrinka1 aMilas, Zoran1 aCvetnić, Željko,1 aPerharic, Matko1 aTurk, Nenad0 tActa tropica.g2017 Apr., v. 168 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008100166300001400247520137600261592002801637650000901665650002001674650001401694650002201708650001501730650001101745650002201756650001901778650001201797650002401809650001201833650002101845650001301866651001101879653002101890653002601911653001201937653001101949700002001960700001901980700001901999773012302018856008302141852000902224655001202233IND60581564920221122223150.0190318e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058156492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManda, Julius10aEx-ante welfare impacts of adopting maize-soybean rotation in eastern Zambia  ap. 22-30.  aThis paper estimates the welfare impacts of adoption of maize-soybean rotation in eastern Zambia using data from on-farm trials and household survey data collected from over 800 households. The on-farm trials were conducted from 2012 to 2015 while the household survey was conducted in 2012. The study evaluated maize-soybean rotation where soybean was grown with and without inoculants and inorganic fertilizer, whereas continuous maize cropping was used as a control. The paper estimated household level income changes and poverty reduction due to adoption of maize-soybean rotation using market level economic surplus as well as household level analyses to allocate economic surplus changes to individual households. The results showed that several factors influence the adoption of maize-soybean rotation, including land ownership, education, and age of the household head. Results also showed that adoption of maize-soybean rotation reduced per-unit production costs by between 26 and 32% compared to continuous maize. Ex-ante welfare impact analysis showed significant potential income gains and poverty reduction following adoption of maize-legume rotation in eastern Zambia. The paper concludes with implications for policy to promote wider adoption of soil fertility management practices such as maize-soybean rotation for increased maize productivity in Zambia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3adata collection 3aeducation 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aland ownership 3amarkets 3amineral fertilizers 3apoverty 3aproduction costs 3asoybeans 3aZambia 0aEconomic surplus 0aMaize-legume rotation 0aPoverty 0aZambia1 aAlene, Arega D.1 aMukuma, Cannon1 aChikoye, David0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 249 p.22-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245015000204300001800354500001900372520193100391592002802322650001102350650004602361650002202407650002202429650003402451650001602485650001402501650001102515650001202526700005702538700005502595700005902650700005502709700005702764773013902821856008202960961002303042852000903065655001203074IND60714487020221121044320.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071448702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-020-03666-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrain, Jared1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9484-832510aSequenced-based paternity analysis to improve breeding and identify self-incompatibility loci in intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium)  ap. 3217-3233.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKEY MESSAGE: Paternity assignment and genome-wide association analyses for fertility were applied to a Thinopyrum intermedium breeding program. A lack of progeny between combinations of parents was associated with loci near self-incompatibility genes. In outcrossing species such as intermediate wheatgrass (IWG, Thinopyrum intermedium), polycrossing is often used to generate novel recombinants through each cycle of selection, but it cannot track pollen-parent pedigrees and it is unknown how self-incompatibility (SI) genes may limit the number of unique crosses obtained. This study investigated the potential of using next-generation sequencing to assign paternity and identify putative SI loci in IWG. Using a reference population of 380 individuals made from controlled crosses of 64 parents, paternity was assigned with 92% agreement using Cervus software. Using this approach, 80% of 4158 progeny (n = 3342) from a polycross of 89 parents were assigned paternity. Of the 89 pollen parents, 82 (92%) were represented with 1633 unique full-sib families representing 42% of all potential crosses. The number of progeny per successful pollen parent ranged from 1 to 123, with number of inflorescences per pollen parent significantly correlated to the number of progeny (r = 0.54, p < 0.001). Shannon’s diversity index, assessing the total number and representation of families, was 7.33 compared to a theoretical maximum of 8.98. To test our hypothesis on the impact of SI genes, a genome-wide association study of the number of progeny observed from the 89 parents identified genetic effects related to non-random mating, including marker loci located near putative SI genes. Paternity testing of polycross progeny can impact future breeding gains by being incorporated in breeding programs to optimize polycross methodology, maintain genetic diversity, and reveal genetic architecture of mating patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus 3aThinopyrum intermedium subsp. intermedium 3acomputer software 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3aoutcrossing 3apaternity 3apollen 3aprogeny1 aLarson, Steve1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2742-21341 aDorn, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2722-62211 aHagedorn, Traci1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8584-29651 aDeHaan, Lee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6368-52411 aPoland, Jesse1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7856-13990 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Nov., v. 133, no. 11 p.3217-3233dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03666-13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHISUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002100168245006500189300001400254520129800268592002801566650002101594650002701615650001201642650001801654650001201672650002101684650000901705650001901714650001801733650002101751650002101772650001501793650001801808650001301826650002401839650002101863650001001884650003501894650000901929700002201938700002101960700001701981700002701998700002102025773010502046856008502151852000902236655001202245IND4473099420221116141539.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447309942DNAL7 a221155102pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuane, Eimear M.10aPerformance of a woodchip filter to treat dairy soiled water  ap. 49-55.  aThe milking process on dairy farms produces wastewaters, known as dairy soiled waters (DSW), which contain variable concentrations of nutrients. The most common method of disposal is by application to land. However, this practise can result in the pollution of nearby receiving water bodies. A laboratory study, comprising two sets of 0.5 m, 1 m and 1.5 m-deep filters loaded at two loading rates, examined the performance of woodchip filters in treating DSW. The filters comprised de-barked Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) woodchips. Dried DSW was reconstituted to 1% and 3% suspended solids (SS) concentrations and was applied at 28 L/m².d to the surface of the filters at loading rates of 280 g SS/m².d and 840 g SS/m².d, respectively. Filters were loaded for a maximum of 277 days. The filters achieved substantial decreases in SS (>99%), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (>97%) and total nitrogen (TN) (>89%). The dominant treatment mechanism appears to be physical filtration, but sorption and biological uptake likely also play a role. As the filters are aerobic, mineralisation and nitrification occur, but gaseous N losses are probably not significant. Woodchip shows potential as a filter medium for treating DSW, significantly decreasing the concentrations of SS, COD and TN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea sitchensis 3achemical oxygen demand 3adairies 3adairy farming 3afilters 3aland application 3amilk 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3asoil water 3asurface water 2aDairying 2aFiltrationxmethods 2aIndustrial Waste 2aPicea 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWood1 aMurphy, Paul N.C.1 aClifford, Eoghan1 aO'Reilly, E.1 aFrench, P.q(Padraig),1 aRodgers, Michael0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 Mar., v. 95, no. 1 p.49-55dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245010700180520163900287592002801926650001501954650000801969650001901977650002001996650001502016650001102031650001202042650001702054650001302071650001102084650002202095650002102117650001702138650001002155650001602165653003602181653001602217653001502233653004302248653001902291700005802310700002402368700002902392700002002421773011602441856008702557852000902644655001202653IND60670301320221119233859.0200228e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067030132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1121092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnaiz del Pozo, Carlos14aThe oxygen production pre-combustion (OPPC) IGCC plant for efficient power production with CO2 capture  aThis work presents a novel integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant configuration for CO₂ capture with minimal energy penalty. The proposed oxygen production pre-combustion (OPPC) power plant synergistically integrates a gas switching oxygen production (GSOP) unit into a pre-combustion IGCC power plant, reducing the energy penalty through two channels: 1) avoidance of a cryogenic air separation unit and 2) pre-heating the air sent to the combined power cycle, which reduces the steam requirement for shifting CO to H₂ and the CO₂ capture duty involved in pre-combustion CO₂ capture. Relative to a conventional pre-combustion IGCC benchmark, the OPPC configuration improves the electric efficiency by about 6%-points, although the CO₂ capture ratio reduces by about 6%-points. OPPC as avoids the maximum temperature limitation of Chemical Looping Combustion based plants, and can therefore benefit from efficient modern gas turbine technology operating at very high inlet temperatures. CO₂ removal via physical absorption (Selexol) generally results in higher efficiencies, but lower CO₂ avoidance than chemical absorption (MDEA). Plant efficiency also benefits from an increase in GSOP operating temperature, although the maximum temperature was limited to 900 °C to avoid any temperature-related challenges with oxygen carrier stability or downstream valves and filters. OPPC therefore appears to be a promising configuration for minimizing the energy penalty of CO₂ capture in IGCC power plants, combining well known and proven technology blocks with a GSOP reactor cluster instead of an ASU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3aenergy 3afilters 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apower generation 3apower plants 3asteam 3atemperature 0aGas switching oxygen production 0aCO2 capture 0aEfficiency 0aIntegrated gasification combined cycle 0aPre-combustion1 aCloete, Schalk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9641-29391 aHendrik Cloete, Jan1 aJiménez Álvaro, Ángel1 aAmini, Shahriar0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 201 p.112109-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.1121093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245022000167300001200387520180600399592002802205650001902233650002702252650001602279650002102295650001102316650001002327650002102337650001402358650003102372650001702403650001702420650002402437650001302461650001902474650003002493650001402523650002202537651001002559653002802569653004902597653001902646653002502665653001902690700001202709700001502721700001802736700002002754700001402774700001702788700001402805773011802819856008502937852000903022655001203031IND60581565020221123043526.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058156502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xuewei10aBoth point mutations and low expression levels of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β1 subunit are associated with imidacloprid resistance in an Aphis gossypii (Glover) population from a Bt cotton field in China  ap. 1-8.  aAphis gossypii Glover is a destructive pest of numerous crops throughout the world. Although the expansion of Bt cotton cultivation has helped to control some insect pests, the damage from cotton aphids has not been mitigated. The evolution of aphid resistance to imidacloprid has made its chemical control more difficult since its introduction in 1991. Field populations of A. gossypii that were collected from different transgenic (Bt) cotton planting areas of China in 2014 developed different levels of resistance to imidacloprid. The IMI_R strain has developed high resistance to imidacloprid with the resistance ratio >1200-fold. Compared with the susceptible IMI_S strain, the IMI_R strain also developed a high level cross resistance to sulfoxaflor and acetamiprid. The limited synergism with either PBO or DEF suggests that resistance may be due to the site mutation of molecular target rather than to enhanced detoxification. Three target-site mutations within the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) β1 subunit were detected in the IMI_R strain. The R81T mutation has been reported to be responsible for imidacloprid resistance in A. gossypii and M. persicae. Both V62I and K264E were first detected in A. gossypii. These point mutations are also present in field populations, suggesting that they play a role in the resistance to imidacloprid. Furthermore, the expression level of transcripts encoding β1 subunit was decreased significantly in the IMI_R strain compared with the IMI_S strain, suggesting that both point mutations and the down-regulation of nAChR β1 subunit expression may be involved in the resistance mechanism for imidacloprid in A. gossypii. These results should be useful for the management of imidacloprid-resistant cotton aphids in Bt cotton fields in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis gossypii 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aacetamiprid 3achemical control 3acotton 3acrops 3across resistance 3aevolution 3agene expression regulation 3aimidacloprid 3ainsect pests 3anicotinic receptors 3aplanting 3apoint mutation 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3asynergism 3atransgenic plants 3aChina 0aImidacloprid resistance 0aNicotinic acetylcholine receptor β1 subunit 0aPoint mutation 0aExpression reduction 0aAphis gossypii1 aLi, Fen1 aChen, Anqi1 aMa, Kangsheng1 aLiang, Pingzhuo1 aLiu, Ying1 aSong, Dunlun1 aGao, Xiwu0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Sept., v. 141 p.1-8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015100166300001800317520130600335592002801641650002201669650001101691650002501702650001101727650002201738650002301760650001801783650001101801650001201812650002401824650002501848650002001873650001101893650001201904650001501916650001101931651002101942700001901963700001901982700002102001773009302022856008102115852000902196655001202205IND60580587520221116150142.0170922e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058058752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-017-0252-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Young-Jae10aHydrodynamic Effects on Growth Performance of the Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas Cultured in Suspension in a Temperate Bay on the Coast of Korea  ap. 1551-1565.  aThe pattern of somatic growth of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas cultured in suspension in Geoje–Hansan Bay, Korea was evaluated between July 2013 and March 2014 comparing culturing sites and depths. Gross biochemical composition of oyster tissues provided a measure of physiological status, and clearance rates of oysters provided a measure of feeding physiology at different water flow speeds. A growth curve model indicated greater tissue growth in the surface than in the bottom layers, and advanced summer growth by more than 4 months in the stagnant inner bay compared with winter growth in the more rapidly flowing outer bay. Our results suggest that rapid tissue growth of oysters in the surface layer in summer is supported by high primary productivity in the inner bay. In contrast, oyster growth performance at the outer bay in late fall and winter may be related to seasonal food availability that is regulated by short residence time and thereby rapid renewal of water compared to the inner bay. Furthermore, a combination of the water flow regime of the bay and the flow rate-dependent feeding physiology of oysters proved to be an important determinant of seasonal growth dynamics. Finally, oyster growth was better explained by water flow rates than by hydrographic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aautumn 3achemical composition 3acoasts 3afood availability 3agrowth performance 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aoysters 3aphysiological state 3aprimary productivity 3aseasonal growth 3asummer 3atissues 3awater flow 3awinter 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKang, Hee Yoon1 aLee, Won-Chan,1 aKang, Chang-Keun0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2017 Nov., v. 40, no. 6 p.1551-1565dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-017-0252-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014100167300001500308500001500323520177600338592002802114650000902142650002002151650001102171650002102182650001102203650001502214650001902229650001102248650001802259650001602277650001002293650002002303650001402323650002502337650001302362650001602375650001802391650001702409650002602426651001202452653001902464653003502483653002102518653002602539653001702565653001602582700001602598700001602614773010202630856008602732852000902818655001202827IND60537890520221122233448.0190408e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053789052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamro, G.M.10aOrganic capping type affected nitrogen availability and associated enzyme activities in reconstructed oil sands soils in Alberta, Canada  ap. 92-101.  a2019-12-06  aOrganic materials applied in land reclamation play a key role in the development of ecosystem properties and functions. Peat mineral soil mix (PMM) and LFH (identifiable litter (L), fragmented litter (F) and humus (H)) mineral soil mix (LFH) are commonly used organic amendments for oil sands reclamation in northern Alberta. These materials have contrasting soil properties, with organic matter in LFH more decomposed and having a lower carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio than that in PMM. We quantified the effects of LFH and PMM capping material on N availability and enzyme activities during early ecosystem development in the oil sands region. Monthly samples were taken from 0 to10 and 10 to 20cm layers from June through October in 2011 and 2012. The N availability and activities of soil enzymes including β-1,4-N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAGase), urease, arylamidase and protease were measured. In-situ N availability was measured using plant root simulator (PRS™) probes. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that N availability and NAGase, arylamidase and protease activities were greater in LFH than in PMM and were affected by time of sampling. These differences were attributed to the lower C:N ratio in LFH than in PMM. We found greater N availability and enzyme activities in the fall than in the summer in both years. These differences were likely caused by fresh labile C inputs through root exudates and litter fall during fall that induced greater enzyme activities and led to greater N mineralization despite the potential limitation by the lower fall temperature. Overall, the greater N availabilities and enzyme activities in LFH suggest that LFH would be a better soil capping material than PMM for early ecosystem development in oil sands reclamation.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeat 3asoil properties 3asummer 3aland restoration 3aurease 3aecosystems 3amineralization 3aautumn 3amineral soils 3atemperature 3ahumus 3aenzyme activity 3aoil sands 3aanalysis of variance 3anitrogen 3aproteinases 3aroot exudates 3asoil enzymes 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aAlberta 0aorganic matter 0aFluorimetric soil enzyme assay 0aLand reclamation 0aEcosystem development 0aPRS™ probe 0aLFH capping1 aChang, S.X.1 aNaeth, M.A.0 tEcological engineering.g2014 Dec., v. 73 p.92-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245016800173520112000341592002801461650001801489650001601507650001901523650002001542650001101562650001901573650001901592650001501611650002501626650001301651653001901664653002001683653002601703653002301729700001801752700001901770700001601789700001901805700001801824700001901842700001401861773009101875856009001966852000902056655001202065IND60791660920221121185825.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079166092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Baodeng10aHigh-performance and superhydrophobic piezoresistive pressure sensor based on mountain ridge-like microstructure by silver nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide  aIngenious microstructure design is crucial for piezoresistive pressure sensor to achieve excellent sensing performances and water repellency. Herein, we propose a new strategy to prepare high-performance polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sponge-based piezoresistive pressure sensor with superhydrophobicity. The silver nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide on the skeleton surface of PDMS sponge jointly constructed mountain ridge-like microstructure and endowed the sensor with conductive network. The sensor exhibited high sensitivity, wide detection range, fast response and exceptional repeatability (4,000 loading–unloading cycles) and was applied for detecting human motions and daily scenarios. Owing to the hierarchical microstructure and the surface modification by 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane, the sensor showed a high water contact angle of 156°, and the response signal kept stable even being sprayed by water. The prepared high-performance and superhydrophobic piezoresistive pressure sensor in this work has great potential in wearable electronics, healthcare monitoring and smart robot.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3aelectronics 3agraphene oxide 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3ananosilver 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3askeleton 0aNanocomposites 0aMicrostructures 0aElectrical properties 0aSurface treatments1 aLi, Hongqiang1 aZhang, Shifeng1 aLai, Xuejun1 aZeng, Xingrong1 aWu, Xiangrong1 aCheng, Xiantao1 aLiu, Hong0 tComposites.g2022 Nov., v. 162 p.107171-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04562naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009900164300001600263520257200279592002802851650002102879650002502900650001602925650001502941650001402956650002502970650002602995650001203021650001203033650002703045650001303072650001503085650002203100650001803122650001203140650002403152650001403176650002603190650000903216650001003225650000903235650001603244650000903260651001303269651001103282653002403293653002103317653001703338653004103355700001903396700002303415700001903438700002403457700003003481700002303511700001703534700002603551700002003577700003203597700001803629773012503647856008303772852000903855655001203864IND60581565120221123033000.0190318e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058156512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyssen, Jan10aGeographical determinants of inorganic fertiliser sales and of resale prices in north Ethiopia  ap. 256-268.  aLow mineral fertiliser use received much attention in Africa over the last decades. As fertiliser sales have exponentially grown in Ethiopia, and evidence exists of a supply that is beyond the demand in the drier northern parts of the country, we investigated the geographical determinants of inorganic fertiliser sales and its resale prices in north Ethiopia. Quantitative data on fertiliser provision and prices on the black market in 2016 were obtained from official statistics and from key informants in each of the 35 studied districts and in all municipalities of the Raya area. Environmental variables were collected from spatial databases. To promote inorganic fertiliser, agricultural experts use incentives, and also barter the purchase of fertiliser by a farmer against food aid or other advantages from the authorities. The high application rate that is aimed at (200kgha−1) contrasts with the dominance of less-responsive soils in the study area, for which inorganic fertiliser application does not result in higher crop yields, or even leads to root burn. The quantitative analysis shows that 40.7 103 Mg of fertiliser were officially sold in the study area in 2016, which corresponds to 52kgha−1. This is notably different from the application rate, as reselling widely occurs, at 50% of the official price for diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 54% for urea, mostly to users outside the community. By accepting the opportunity offered by agricultural companies and traders, smallholders save themselves from greater losses. The black market rate is strongly and positively correlated to monthly rainfall at sowing time (July 2016) (R2=0.44; n=31; p<0.01). In the four districts with spate irrigation, black market prices for inorganic fertiliser are low (35% of the official rate) and small quantities are sold officially (32kgha−1). This corresponds to the farmers’ saying that there “nobody needs inorganic fertiliser since the spate irrigation adds organic and inorganic nutrients yearly”. We found similarities to the ‘Green Revolution’ in Mexico: the forced delivery of high-cost fertiliser, and the reselling at half price in the black market. Inorganic fertilisers are one of the elements that have allowed boosting agricultural production in Ethiopia; our findings indicate however that in the study area, the fertiliser policy needs to be much fine-tuned so that it is led by agronomic needs, rather than by statistics of inorganic fertiliser consumption, that hide complex environmental variability and socio-political relations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3abusiness enterprises 3acorrelation 3acrop yield 3adatabases 3adiammonium phosphate 3aenvironmental factors 3aexperts 3afarmers 3afertilizer application 3afood aid 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3amarket prices 3amarkets 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrients 3aquantitative analysis 3arain 3asales 3asoil 3asowing date 3aurea 3aEthiopia 3aMexico 0aChemical fertiliser 0aSpate irrigation 0aBlack market 0aIntegrated soil fertility management1 aBiruk, Birhanu1 aTesfamariam, Zbelo1 aFrankl, Amaury1 aDemissie, Biadgilgn1 aGhebreyohannes, Tesfaalem1 aMeaza, Hailemariam1 aPoesen, Jean1 aEetvelde, Veerle van,1 aZenebe, Amanuel1 aDeckers, J.

Based on the survey data of 591 residents of Seoul, we empirically analyzed the relationship between walking experience for various purposes and individual perceptions of social capital using one-way ANOVA and OLS regression models. As a result of the analysis, we found that the levels of neighborly trust and networking of people who experienced leisure walking were higher than those of people who did not, while there was no difference in the level of social capital according to walking experiences for other purposes. This result is significant in that it shows the basis for the restoration of the social function of neighborhoods through social capital formation of people as an effect of walking. Hence, it is important to create a walking environment that supports leisure activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3arecreation 3aregression analysis 3asocial capital 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3awalking1 aYang, Seungho0 tSustainability.g2017 Apr. 27, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90506803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245027200159300001800431520169700449592002802146650001602174650001502190650001102205650004102216650002302257650001102280650001002291650003202301650001602333650002302349700001902372700001702391700002102408773012602429856007402555852000902629655001202638IND60656862920221119075940.0190814e20150409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065686292DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ay03034f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Changgook10aImproving the extraction of headspace volatile compounds: development of a headspace multi-temperature solid-phase micro-extraction-single shot-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (mT-HSSPME-ss-GC/MS) method and application to characterization of ground coffee aroma  ap. 3521-3536.  aA multi-temperature headspace solid-phase micro-extraction-single shot-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (mT-HSSPME-ss-GC/MS) method has been developed for headspace analysis. Three SPME fibers (50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS) were used simultaneously for the extraction of volatile components from the headspace of a sample in three sample chambers at three different temperatures. A cryo-focusing technique was adopted to avoid peak broadening and to maximize resolution during the sequential thermal desorption of the SPME fibers prior to a ‘single-shot’ chromatographic run. The method was developed and validated on a model ethanolic flavor mixture, containing 81 components. Comparison of mT-HSSPME-ss-GC/MS (10 min incubation time, then 30 min extraction time at 22, 50, and 70 °C extraction temperatures) with conventional SPME-GC/MS at a fixed temperature of 22, 50, or 70 °C showed that the former gave a headspace GC profile of the flavor mixture that was much closer to that of the syringe (direct) injection profile. None of the conventional headspace SPME extraction profiles were a good match to the syringe injection profile. The same technique applied to the headspace of coffee grounds gave a plentiful headspace volatile component profile compared to that of a single SPME analysis at a fixed single extraction temperature (22, 50, and 70 °C). The average percent recovery (defined for each component as 100 × mT-SPME (22 °C + 50 °C + 70 °C) TIC peak intensity divided by the arithmetic sum of individual temperature SPME (22 °C, 50 °C, 70 °C) TIC peak intensities) was 89.8% and 132 components were detected by mT-SPME-ss-GC/MS in the headspace of coffee grounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarithmetics 3adesorption 3aflavor 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3amodels 3aodors 3asolid phase microextraction 3atemperature 3avolatile compounds1 aLee, Younghoon1 aLee, Jae-Gon1 aBuglass, Alan J.0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Apr. 9, v. 7, no. 8 p.3521-3536dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay03034f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008100164300001600245520164300261592002801904596004801932650000901980650002501989650001402014650002102028650001802049650002102067650001602088650001502104650000902119700002402128700002102152700002002173700002202193700005902215773010402274856008302378852000902461655001202470IND60769593220221122235836.0220308e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076959322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-021-02512-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoma, Vira10aDoes roundup affect zinc functions in a bivalve mollusk in ex vivo exposure?  ap. 335-340.  aRoundup (Rn), a glyphosate-based formulation, is one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. It affects non-targeted organisms in several ways, including adhesive activity towards metal ions. Zinc (Zn) plays a crucial role in a number of biochemical processes. In this study, we aim to elucidate the direct impact of Rn on Zn accumulation and Zn-dependent activities in the ex vivo system. To this end, we exposed the samples of the digestive gland of a bivalve mollusk Unio tumidus to 3 µM of Rn (calculated as 3 µM of glyphosate), Zn, Zn chelator (N,N,N′,N′-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine) (TPEN, Tp), and their combinations ZnTp and ZnRn for 17 h. We determined the levels of Zn in the tissue (Zn t) and metallothioneins (Zn-MT), metallothioneins (MTSH), and glutathione (GSH & GSSG), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), lysosomal membrane integrity, and caspase-3 activity. Our study demonstrated that Rn and Tp had different effects on the accumulation and functionality of Zn. Rn did not affect the accumulation of Zn (Zn t, Zn-MT) in the Zn- and ZnRn-groups. On the contrary, Tp produced effects antagonistic to Zn on caspase-3 activity, lysosomal stability, and MTSH concentration. Rn caused particular pro-oxidative effect that decreased GSH level (Rn- and ZnRn-groups) and lysosomal stability (Rn-group). The shared affected index was the GSH/GSSG ratio, which decreased by 2–8 times in each exposure. As the first experience with the application of Tp to indicate Zn activity in mollusks, the study concluded that the ex vivo approach could be useful in the study of numeral aquatic pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data  aM19/2020cministry of education and science 3aUnio 3aantioxidant activity 3acaspase-3 3achelating agents 3aecotoxicology 3aethylenediamines 3aglutathione 3aglyphosate 3azinc1 aMartinyuk, Viktoria1 aMatskiv, Tetyana1 aYunko, Kateryna1 aGnatyshyna, Lesya1 aStoliar, Oksana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8579-28810 tEcotoxicology.g2022 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.335-340dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-021-02512-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245007700166500001400243520099900257592002801256650001901284650001801303650001301321650000901334650001401343650001301357650001601370650001401386650001601400650001401416650002301430650002201453700001901475700002801494700003601522700002701558700002001585700002101605700001801626700003001644700001901674700002101693773012101714856007901835852000901914655001201923IND60724429520221122055153.0210122e20201225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072442952DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100100082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarraza, Felipe 10aRevisiting the Teleost Thymus: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives  aNAL-light  aThe thymus in vertebrates plays a critical role in producing functionally competent T-lymphocytes. Phylogenetically, the thymus emerges early during evolution in jawed cartilaginous fish, and it is usually a bilateral organ placed subcutaneously at the dorsal commissure of the operculum. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the thymus localization, histology studies, cell composition, and function in teleost fishes. Furthermore, we consider environmental factors that affect thymus development, such as seasonal changes, photoperiod, water temperature fluctuations and hormones. Further analysis of the thymus cell distribution and function will help us understand how key stages for developing functional T cells occur in fish, and how thymus dynamics can be modulated by external factors like photoperiod. Overall, the information presented here helps identify the knowledge gaps and future steps needed for a better understanding of the immunobiology of fish thymus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChondrichthyes 3aT-lymphocytes 3adynamics 3afish 3ahistology 3ahormones 3ainformation 3aknowledge 3aphotoperiod 3aphylogeny 3aseasonal variation 3awater temperature1 aMontero, Ruth 1 aWong-Benito, Valentina 1 aValenzuela Valderrama, Héctor,1 aGodoy-Guzmán, Carlos 1 aGuzmán, Fanny 1 aKöllner, Bernd 1 aWang, Tiehui 1 aSecombes, Christopher  J.1 aMaisey, Kevin 1 aImarai, Mónica 0 tBiology.g2020 Dec. 25, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100100083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013800195300001600333500002000349520174300369592002802112596004002140596005102180650002402231650001002255650001102265650002402276650002702300650001502327650001402342650001002356650001202366650001402378650001202392650001102404650001702415700001602432700001902448700001602467700002102483700001702504700002302521700001902544700006302563773010902626856007302735852000902808655001202817IND60693523220221120153019.0200507e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069352322DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.130122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Jungmoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5908-956X10aExperimental study of alarm calls of the oriental tit (Parus minor) toward different predators and reactions they induce in nestlings  ap. 610-619.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnti‐predatory strategies of birds are diverse and may include predator‐specific alarm calls. For example, oriental tit (Parus minor) parents can distinguish snakes from other predators and produce snake‐specific referential vocalizations ("jar" call) when a snake poses a threat to their nest. The “jar” call has a very specific function to induce fledging of nestlings close to fledging age. This reaction ensures nestlings' survival in natural encounters with snakes that are capable of entering nest cavities and kill entire broods. Sciurid rodents, like chipmunks, may pose a similar threat to cavity‐nesting birds. We explored the hypothesis that parents use the fledging‐inducing alarm vocalizations in this situation, because chipmunks, like snakes, can kill the brood upon entering the nest cavity. We compared alarm calls of parents toward two predators (chipmunk and snake) who pose a similar threat to the nestlings in a nest cavity, and toward an avian predator (Eurasian jay) who cannot enter nest cavities and poses no threat to the nestlings in a nest. Our results show that the vocal responses of oriental tits were different among the three predators. This suggests that the acoustic properties of vocal responses to predators are different between predators of a similar hunting strategy (nest‐cavity entering). The playback of recorded vocal responses of parents to chipmunks did not trigger the fledging of old nestlings, whereas the vocalizations toward a snake did, as shown by earlier studies. Our study suggests that the vocal response of parents does not carry information about the ability of predators to enter the nest cavity and confirms the special status of alarm calls triggered by snakes.  aPublisher supplied data  a21A20131212006cBrain Korea 21 Plus  a2019R1A2C1004300cNational Research Foundation 3aGarrulus glandarius 3aParus 3aTamias 3aacoustic properties 3aantipredatory behavior 3afledglings 3anestlings 3anests 3aparents 3apredators 3arodents 3asnakes 3avocalization1 aLee, Keesan1 aYang, Eunjeong1 aKim, Woojoo1 aSong, Ho‐kyung1 aHwang, Injae1 aLee‐Cruz, Larisa1 aLee, Sang‐im1 aJabłoński, Piotr,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8333-01060 tEthology.g2020 June, v. 126, no. 6 p.610-619dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39008x0179-16137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.130123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013300172300001600305520100700321592002801328650002501356650002401381650001301405650001801418650001601436650002001452650002801472650001501500650001701515650001801532650001601550650001901566650002101585650002201606650001101628650001601639650001601655653002801671653002501699653001601724653006101740653001801801700001601819773010601835856008701941852000902028655001202037IND60589768620221122193859.0200509e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058976862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.12.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrewal, Jasneet10aOne-pot bioprocess for lactic acid production from lignocellulosic agro-wastes by using ionic liquid stable Lactobacillus brevis  ap. 268-273.  aThe lignocellulosic agro-wastes are an attractive renewable resource in biorefinery for production of value-added platform chemicals and biofuels.

Research within local communities can lead to a better understanding of the observed changes in climate, and help to find more appropriate strategies for dealing with them. A number of studies have been carried out in West Africa, but most focus on Sahelian countries and all focus on a single area with one or two ethnic groups. Therefore, to determine whether a countrywide multi-ethnic assessment could provide more accurate information, we studied perceptions of climate change in local communities in Benin. Two focus groups (men and women) were carried out in nine villages. Local farmers and herders were asked about the changes in climate they have observed, the effects of these changes, and how they have adapted to them. Observed changes in climate followed a latitudinal trend, and were in agreement with available climatic studies. Some of the observed changes in climate had not been reported before for this latitude in West Africa. The effects of these climatic changes and the adaptive strategies used differed between areas and ethnic groups. Some adaptive strategies were only used by some ethnic groups. We found that the main obstacles preventing communities from adopting new strategies were unavailability of credit, lack of improved seeds and insufficient information. The findings support the conclusion that country-level multi-ethnic assessments provide key information for both climate change research and policy development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acredit 3afarmers 3afocus groups 3afood security 3alatitude 3amen 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aresearch policy 3aseeds 3avillages 3awomen 3aBenin 0aadaptation 0aAfrica 0aBenin 0aclimate change 0alocal farmers1 aFandohan, Belarmain1 aAssogbadjo, Achille Ephrem1 aSinsin, B.,0 tClimate and development.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 4, no. 2 p.114-128dRoutledgex1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2012.7281263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245010200209300001100311506007600322520166400398592002802062596003602090506003702126650002502163650001202188650002102200650001302221650001402234650000902248650001602257700002102273700002302294700002102317773012902338856008102467852000902548655001202557IND60590540820221207054141.0191108e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059054082DNAL7 a294583692pmid7 aPMC58192352pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-018-2136-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinnell, John S.10aIs fasting safe? A chart review of adverse events during medically supervised, water-only fasting  ap. 67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that fasting, during which only water is consumed, results in potentially health promoting physiological effects. However, peer-reviewed research assessing the safety of water-only fasting is lacking. To address this, we conducted a chart review to describe adverse events (AEs) that occurred during medically supervised, water-only fasting. METHODS: Electronic charts from patient visits to a residential medical facility from 2006 to 2011 were reviewed. Patients who were at least 21 years of age and water-only fasted for ≥2 consecutive days with a refeeding period equal to half of the fast length were included. Out of 2539 charts, 768 visits met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. AEs were abstracted from chart notes and classified according to CTCAE (v4.03) and MedDRA (v12.1) terminology. Descriptive analysis of AEs is reported. RESULTS: During the protocol period, the highest grade AE (HGAE) in 555 visits was a grade 2 event or lower, in 212 visits it was a grade 3 event, in 1 visit it was a grade 4 event, and there were no grade 5 events. There were 2 (0.002%) visits with a serious adverse event (SAE). The majority of AEs identified were mild (n = 4490, 75%) in nature and known reactions to fasting. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive analysis of AEs experienced during medically supervised, water-only fasting conducted to date. Overall, our data indicate that the majority of AEs experienced were mild to moderate and known reactions to fasting. This suggests that the protocol used in this study can be safely implemented in a medical setting with minimal risk of a SAE.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcNational Health Association0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative medicine 3afasting 3ahealth promotion 3apatients 3arefeeding 3arisk 3aterminology1 aSaul, Bradley C.1 aGoldhamer, Alan C.1 aMyers, Toshia R.0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.67-67dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2136-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014000170300001600310520167300326592002801999650001502027650002402042650001502066650001202081650001502093650001302108650002302121650002102144650001802165650000902183650001502192650002202207651001502229700001902244700002002263700002102283700002302304700003202327773012302359856008102482852000902563655001202572IND60439687820221119201421.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043968782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-015-9790-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaubus, Weston J.10aAnt communities in native sage scrub, non-native grassland, and suburban habitats in Los Angeles County, USA: conservation implications  ap. 669-680.  aSouthern California’s sage scrub (SS) ecosystem is severely threatened by suburban development and invasion by non-native grasses, but how these threats impact the arthropod community is poorly understood. Native ants, which face the additional threat of being displaced by non-native Argentine ants, may be particularly at risk of local and regional extirpation. In this study, we surveyed the ant communities in the SS and non-native grassland habitats at the Robert J Bernard Biological Field Station (BFS) and surrounding suburban habitat, and compared patterns of species richness and composition among habitat types. We also compared ant richness and composition at the BFS to 40 coastal SS fragments previously surveyed in San Diego County to better understand how ant communities in interior and coastal SS fragments differ. Ant composition significantly differed among all three habitat types at and surrounding the BFS, but species richness did not. Comparisons between the BFS and coastal fragments indicate that interior SS fragments harbor unique ant species and more species relative to fragment area. Increased richness and unique ant assemblages are probably associated with the limited ability of invasive Argentine ants to colonize the non-native grassland and SS at the BFS. Because many southern California invertebrates are narrowly endemic to low elevation areas, patterns of habitat specificity seen with ants highlight that maintaining a mosaic of SS and non-native grassland habitat, particularly in interior areas where activity and diversity of non-native invertebrate species may be restricted, may be critical to preserving biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ainsect communities 3ainvasive species 3ainvertebrates 3arisk 3ashrublands 3aspecies diversity 3aCalifornia1 aBoyd, Elise S.1 aAdams, Tessa A.1 aSpear, Dakota M.1 aDipman, Madison M.1 aMeyer, Wallace M., IIIcIII0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2015 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.669-680dSpringer International Publishingx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-015-9790-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007600169500001900245520207200264592002802336650001202364650001602376650000902392650001302401650002502414653002102439653002302460653001702483700006802500700005502568700005302623773010502676856008602781852000902867655001202876IND60700239020221120224731.0210212e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070023902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1252092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yuening10aDevelopment of groundwater lens for transient recharge in strip islands  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGroundwater in surficial aquifers in small islands is stored in the form of freshwater lenses floating on the seawater due to density difference. Recharge from rainfall infiltration is one of the primary mechanisms that control the lens growth and decay. Unlike previous studies either assuming steady-state groundwater lenses or relying on numerical simulations, we derive an approximate analytical solution to describe the transient change of groundwater lenses for a time-dependent, fluctuating recharge rate. The approximate analytical solution is validated by numerical simulations of variable density flow and transport. Based on this analytical solution and dimensional analysis, we investigate the impact of periodic recharge, extended drought events and random time-series recharge on the time-dependent behavior of the lens thickness and volume. Results show that only slowly changing recharge patterns with long periods such as seasonal and yearly changes can cause significant fluctuations of groundwater lenses. In specific, 10%, 50% and 100% fluctuations correspond to dimensionless periods of 200, 500 and 1300, respectively, which are 69, 174 and 451 days for our specified hydrogeological parameters. Thus, assuming an average constant recharge rate may be valid for simulating the transient lens profile and volume for recharge patterns with short periods such as daily fluctuations. We further analyze the approximate analytical solution using the method of low-pass filter. The complex physical process of the lens development is fitted by a second-order system on the frequency domain. Such a filter passes sine-wave recharge components with frequencies smaller than the break frequency and attenuates those higher than the break frequency, yielding smooth profiles of the lens thickness and volume. By analyzing the recharge rate spectrum and comparing the component frequency with the break frequency, we demonstrate how the development of a groundwater lens is affected by the transient recharge in reported laboratory and field observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3agroundwater 3arain 3aseawater 3atime series analysis 0aGroundwater lens 0aTransient recharge 0aStrip island1 aSingh Rathore, Saubhagya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0469-29591 aLu, Chunhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0676-08821 aLuo, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7202-996X0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Nov., v. 590 p.125209-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1252093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100005700193245012300250506007600373506003100449520179600480592002802276596004402304596005702348596000902405596000802414506003702422650001902459650002602478650001202504650001002516650001202526650001102538650001602549650001502565650002002580650001502600650002002615650001302635650002202648650001402670650001602684653002402700653001402724653001802738653002102756700005602777700005902833700006002892700006302952773011303015856008603128852000903214655001203223IND60737775620221207135047.0220426e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073777562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275012chorus7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyman, Miriam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8108-931210aProduction of Daphnia zooplankton on wastewater-grown algae for sustainable conversion of waste nutrients to fish feed  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis study investigates the upcycling of nutrients in anaerobic digestate via algal biomass to zooplankton which is a natural fish feed. There are no published studies, to the authors’ knowledge, on the viability of growing zooplankton on digestate-grown algae. Here, the viability of digestate-grown Chlorella sorokiniana as a feed for the large-bodied generalist zooplankter, Daphnia, was tested. It was found that Daphnia fed with digestate-grown C. sorokiniana led to 1.5- to 14-fold greater Daphnia population growth than Daphnia fed with Ankistrodesmus sp., an established feed. A sterol analysis of C. sorokiniana found 4–6 mg/g of the sterol, ergosterol, and nearly double the α-linolenic acid content of Ankistrodesmus. Sterols and α-linolenic acid are often-limiting nutrients in Daphnia diets. Other factors hypothesized to influence nutrient transfer from algae to Daphnia were also tested, including algal feed concentration, sterol supplementation, and the presence of digestate bacteria in the algal feed. The presence of bacteria and exogenous cholesterol had no significant impacts on Daphnia growth. The higher feed concentration (5 mg C/L) led to 3 times higher Daphnia growth than the low feed concentration (1.5 mg C/L) even though the latter concentration has frequently been used by other researchers. Finally, it was determined that the feed conversion ratio of algae to Daphnia fell in the range of 0.19–0.31 and that trophic transfer of carbon was 25–28% while that of nitrogen was 29–34% in this un-optimized system. These values compare favorably to livestock feed conversion efficiency but additional losses will occur when Daphnia are fed to fish. These results show that cultivation of Daphnia on digestate-grown algae is technically feasible.  aPublisher supplied data  cAlabama Agricultural Experiment Station  cAuburn University Samuel Ginn College of Engineering  cNIFA  cNSF0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnkistrodesmus 3aChlorella sorokiniana 3aDaphnia 3aalgae 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acholesterol 3aergosterol 3afeed conversion 3afish feeds 3alivestock feeds 3anitrogen 3apopulation growth 3aviability 3azooplankton 0aAnaerobic digestate 0aNutrition 0aPhytoplankton 0aTrophic transfer1 aWang, Qichen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4050-45401 aWilson, Alan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1080-03541 aAdhikari, Sushil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6539-68221 aHiggins, Brendan T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6854-96120 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 310 p.127501-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245018800162300001800350520147400368592002801842650002301870650001701893650001501910650001101925650001401936650002301950650001301973650002101986650003402007650002102041650004902062650001402111650002402125650001102149650002202160650001302182653002402195653002002219653002602239653002102265653002002286700005202306700005202358700005802410700005402468700005502522700001502577700001902592700001802611773013902629856007802768852000902846655001202855IND60683226520221121034540.0200207e20200110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068322652DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b193822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Songge10aUnderstanding the Role of Nanoscale Heterointerfaces in Core/Shell Structures for Water Splitting: Covalent Bonding Interaction Boosts the Activity of Binary Transition-Metal Sulfides  ap. 6250-6261.  aThe appropriate catalyst model with a precisely designed interface is highly desirable for revealing the real active site at the atomic level. Herein, we report a proof-of-concept strategy for creating an exposed and embedding interface model by constructing a unique Co₉S₈ core with a full WS₂ shell (Co₉S₈/FWS₂) and a half WS₂ shell (Co₉S₈/HWS₂) to uncover the synergistic effect of heterointerfaces on the catalytic performances. Tailoring the heteroepitaxial growth of WS₂ shell, Co₉S₈/HWS₂ with exposed Co–S–W interfaces leads to the exceptional electron density changes on edged-S atoms with large amounts of lone-pair electrons. Meanwhile, the unique Co₉S₈/HWS₂ could accelerate the kinetic adsorption of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing intermediates. Such Co₉S₈/HWS₂ electrocatalysts show extremely low overpotentials of 78 and 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–² for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Using Co₉S₈/HWS₂ as both the cathode and anode, an alkali electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm–² at a quite low cell voltage of 1.60 V. The results of both operando Raman spectroscopy and electron spin resonance indicate the presence of S–S terminal and S–S bridging with unsaturated S atoms during the HER process. The present work reveals the synergistic effects of nanoscale interfaces on overall electrocatalytic water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3achemical bonding 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectrons 3ahydrogen production 3amodels 3aoxygen production 3asulfides 0amaterials chemistry 0aelectrospinning 0acore/shell structures 0aheterointerfaces 0awater splitting1 aLi, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2774-841X1 aZhu, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6274-852X1 aLu, Shuanglong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8598-54561 aMa, Piming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4597-06391 aDong, Weifu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7432-83621 aDuan, Fang1 aChen, Mingqing1 aDu, Mingliang0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 10, v. 12, no. 5 p.6250-6261dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b193823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245007300173300001600246500001900262520098300281592002801264650001501292650002201307650002801329650001201357650001301369650002101382650001301403650001601416653001701432653001901449653001301468653002701481653002001508653004401528653002901572653002501601700006401626773014601690856008301836852000901919655001201928IND60700889320221119230612.0200804e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070088932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushwaha, Vandana S.14aThe temperature dependence of kinesin motor-protein mechanochemistry  ap. 812-818.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiophysical studies of the mechanochemical cycle of kinesin motors are essential for understanding the mechanism of energy conversion. Here, we report a systematic study of the impact of temperature on velocity and run length of homodimeric Drosophila kinesin-1, homodimeric C. elegans OSM-3 and heterodimeric C. elegans kinesin-II motor proteins using in vitro single-molecule motility assays. Under saturated ATP conditions, kinesin-1 and OSM-3 are fast and processive motors compared to kinesin-II. From in vitro motility assays employing single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we extracted single-motor velocities and run lengths in a temperature range from 15 °C to 35 °C. Both parameters showed a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence for all three motors, which could be quantitatively modeled using a simplified, two-state kinetic model of the mechanochemistry of the three motors, providing new insights in the temperature dependence of their mechanochemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aenergy conversion 3afluorescence microscopy 3akinesin 3akinetics 3amechanochemistry 3aresearch 3atemperature 0aMicrotubules 0aMotor proteins 0aKinesins 0aCaenorhabditis elegans 0aTIRF microscopy 0aSingle-molecule fluorescence microscopy 0aSingle molecule analysis 0aATP hydrolysis cycle1 aPeterman, Erwin J.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1058-249X0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Aug. 27, v. 529, no. 3 p.812-818dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001700168245011700185300001600302500001900318500000900337520139400346592002801740650002101768650002001789650002301809650001201832650002501844650001201869650001501881650001401896650002301910650001301933650003001946650002201976700001701998700001602015700001802031773012102049852000902170856009802179655001202277991600099430742620221121032545.0191122e197211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7391347042DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200060041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeath, K.

Alfalfa plant materials were defatted with hexane-heptane, followed by extraction with alcohol. The alcohol extracts were further fractionated into chloroform, chloroform-methanol, butanol, and water fractions. Saponin mixtures were obtained as precipitates from butanol. DuPuits contained more saponin than did Lahontan. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of highly complex saponin mixtures in each alfalfa cultivar. Growth responses of the test organisms varied with the organism, the fraction, the source cultivar, and the concentration of the fraction. All test concentrations were below those of saponins naturally occurring in alfalfa. In general, the effects of the four saponin mixtures were similar, with those from DuPuits exhibiting more activity than those from Lahontan. The test organisms varied greatly in their responses to all fractions, i.e., unaffected, stimulated, or inhibited (fungistatic and fungicidal). The nonsaponin fractions greatly affected the growth of the test organisms, but little effect of source variety was noted. The potential role of saponins in disease resistance was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aMedicago sativa 3aTrichoderma viride 3aalfalfa 3abioactive properties 3abutanol 3achloroform 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3asaponins 3athin layer chromatography 3avegetative growth1 aDavis, K.

In this regard, the use of agricultural waste residues has been widely explored owing to their unique properties which enable them to be applied as adsorbents. However, their use in pristine forms leaves much to be desired. Several modification agents have been applied for the treatment of agricultural waste residues with the view of enhancing their adsorption capacity and ameliorating the disadvantages accompanying their use in the pristine state. Due to the abundance of peanut husk generated globally and its cellulosic nature, it has been extensively applied as an adsorbent for the removal of a broad-spectrum of pollutants in wastewater. This makes it a useful model for the design of efficient adsorbents based on agricultural biomass. In this review, the application of functionalized adsorbents, based on peanut husk (an agricultural waste material) for the sequestration of pollutants in aqueous solution, is presented. In a bid to understand the suitability of these functionalized adsorbents, a brief overview on the surface properties of the modified adsorbent, mechanism of adsorption process as well as advantages associated with the modified agents are presented. This review presents cost-effective and efficient adsorbents based on peanut husk for the sequestration of wastewater which can aid in the design of novel adsorbents hinged on agricultural waste materials for environmental remediation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagricultural wastes 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomass 3acost effectiveness 3amodels 3apeanut hulls 3aremediation 3awastewater 0aPeanut husk 0aModification 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aAdsorption 0aMechanism1 aMpatani, Farid Mzee1 aKani, Alexander Nti1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9667-74511 aDovi, Evans1 aHan, Runping1 aLi, Zhaohui1 aQu, Lingbo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 310 p.127502-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1275023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010200167300001800269520157900287592002801866596008801894650004401982650001502026650001402041650001702055650001302072650002602085650001002111650002102121650001402142650001302156650001102169650000702180650001202187650001302199650002102212650000902233650001702242700001902259700001102278700006002289773011102349856008302460852000902543655001202552IND60779208320221116144309.0220605e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077920832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04600-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Farhana10aPectin and mucin modified cellulose-based superabsorbent hydrogel for controlled curcumin release  ap. 5207-5222.  aPectin (Pec) and mucin (Muc) were incorporated into a pure cellulose hydrogel network prepared in a urea/NaOH solvent system and cross-linked with epichlorohydrin to create cellulose-based superabsorbent hydrogels. Hydrogels were also tested for pH-responsive swelling capacity and in vitro drug release behavior. It was observed that swelling ratios increased several folds for the Pec/Muc-modified hydrogels compared to pure cellulose hydrogel and the maximum swelling ratio was 2781% at pH 10 for Pec-modified hydrogel. Besides, different drug release profiles were observed in different pH mediums, where a highly swollen and less eroded matrix showed a slower release due to a larger diffusion path. The incremented swelling ratio of modified hydrogels was attributed to numerous functional groups present on the backbone of the polymers, which aided in forming excessive hydrogen bonds with water. Structural characterization and possible interactions among cellulose and incorporated materials inside the hydrogels were confirmed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope, and simultaneous thermal analysis. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the Pec and Muc incorporated hydrogels were significantly improved. Owing to the tunable pH-sensitive water absorption, drug release behavior, and improved mechanical properties, Pec/Muc-modified cellulose hydrogels present a wide range of possibilities for further expansion in controlled drug delivery systems and other biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aDAERS/CASR/R-1/2020/DR-330(53)cbangladesh university of engineering and technology 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorbents 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3acurcumin 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aepichlorohydrins 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen 3amucins 3apH 3apectins 3asolvents 3athermal analysis 3aurea 3awater uptake1 aWong, Siew Yee1 aLi, Xu1 aArafat, M.

To make free ubiquitin molecules available for conjugation, in cells ubiquitin is not only synthesized de novo, but is also provided by cleaving off existing conjugated ubiquitin molecules, so-called deubiquitination reaction. Therefore, intracellular ubiquitin molecules are thought to be recycled, but the recycling frequency remains elusive. The main reason for the lack of such mechanistic details is that the original and recycled ubiquitin molecules are indistinguishable in their chemical and physical properties. To tackle this issue, here we applied ¹⁸O-labeling to trace how ubiquitin is recycled in a simultaneous ubiquitination/deubiquitination reaction (ubiquitin cycle reaction). Because deubiquitination is a hydrolysis reaction, the two ¹⁶O atoms of the C-terminal carboxy group of a ubiquitin molecule can be exchanged with ¹⁸O atoms by deubiquitination in ¹⁸O-labeled aqueous solution. By using quantitative mass spectrometry, we detected ¹⁸O atom incorporation into the C-terminal carboxy group of ubiquitin in the course of a deubiquitination reaction, in addition, we were able to quantify the ¹⁸O-incorporation in a ubiquitin cycle reaction. Unexpectedly, kinetic analysis suggested that ubiquitination reactivity was accelerated in the presence of a deubiquitinating enzyme. Collectively, we have established a quantitative method to trace ubiquitin cycle reactions by analyzing deubiquitination-associated ¹⁸O-incorporation into ubiquitin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aenzymes 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3amass spectrometry 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitination 0aUbiquitin cycle 0a18O-incorporation 0aQuantitative mass spectrometry 0aDeubiquitination1 aMorimoto, Daichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7672-21361 aWalinda, Erik1 aSugase, Kenji1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8623-77431 aShirakawa, Masahiro0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 529, no. 2 p.418-424dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013200174300001600306520077100322592002801093650002001121650001601141650002101157650002701178650002901205650002301234650002501257650001901282650004101301650002201342650001101364650001301375650001201388650000901400651001701409653002201426653002101448653002401469653001801493700002501511700001901536700002301555700002401578773012801602856008401730852000901814655001201823IND60122580320221117172554.0150325e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012258032DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2014.9369082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawal, Oladipupo A.10aChemical Composition and Antibacterial Activities of Essential Oil of Warburgia salutaris (Bertol. f.)

Blight is a complex problem with varied consequences requiring integrated decision making at both individual and community levels. This is an important issue since residents of blighted areas live in environments that directly influence their quality of life, values and behaviors. This study conducts an economic, social, and environmental analysis regarding impacts, intermediation and eradication of blight. The complexity of blight requires an analysis encompassing both objective and subjective variables. Also, this study addresses limitations of prior research by applying a methodology that combines cognitive mapping and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. Study results include a multi-criteria analysis system based on the inputs provided by a panel of experts. Although process-oriented, where results generally are not applicable from one application to another, our approach resulted in blight-caused impacts being allocated to four major clusters: governance; construction and real estate market; social dimensions and security; and health and environment. The findings were presented to and validated by a board member of the Instituto de Habitação e da Reabilitação Urbana (Institute of Housing and Urban Renewal of Portugal). Advantages and limitations of our approach are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablight 3adecision making 3aenvironmental assessment 3agovernance 3aland policy 3amarkets 3aquality of life 3aurban development 3aPortugal 0aCognitive mapping 0aDEMATEL 0aImpacts 0aUrbanization1 aFerreira, Fernando A.F.1 aSpahr, Ronald W.1 aSunderman, Mark A.1 aGovindan, Kannan1 aMeidutė-Kavaliauskienė, Ieva0 tLand use policy.g2021 Sept., v. 108 p.105661-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1056613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01217naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011800170300001800288500002200306520024800328592002800576650002400604650001000628650002600638700003100664773015400695856008100849852000900930655001200939IND60602048120221120215835.0180709e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060204812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-018-1474-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoffler, Christoph10aCorrection to: On the calculation of fuel savings through lightweight design in automotive life cycle assessments  ap. 1525-1526.  aPublished Erratum  aIn the 2010 volume 15 page 128–135 article “On the calculation of fuel savings through lightweight design in automotive life cycle assessments” (Koffler and Rohde-Brandenburger 2010) in the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3afuels 3alife cycle assessment1 aRohde-Brandenburger, Klaus0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2018 July, v. 23, no. 7 p.1525-1526dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-018-1474-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012600164300001800290520125300308592002801561650002801589650001301617650001201630650001201642650002101654650002401675650001701699650001501716650001201731650001401743650001401757700001901771700001901790700002501809773013501834856008101969852000902050655001202059IND50071645020221120235655.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007164502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-013-2015-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, He Ping10aEffect of cadmium on cytogenetic toxicity in hairy roots of Wedelia trilobata L. and their alleviation by exogenous CaCl2  ap. 1436-1443.  aEffects of cadmium (Cd) alone and in combination with calcium on mitosis and chromosomal aberration in the hairy root tips of Wedelia trilobata were investigated. The results showed that Cd concentrations below 50 μmol/L had a lesser or even a promoting effect on the mitotic index (MI) and the rate of chromosomal aberration in hairy root tips, while those higher than 100 μmol/L significantly decreased the MI and gradually stimulated the rate of chromosomal aberrations with prolonged time and increasing concentrations of Cd. Concentrations of 50 μmol/L Cd mainly induced C-mitosis, while more than 100 μmol/L Cd mainly caused chromosome breakage and chromosome adhesion in hairy root tip cells. When cultured with 300 μmol/L Cd, micronuclei were only observed in the interphase, middle, and late phase of hairy root tip cells. Compared with untreated controls, exogenous calcium had an alleviating effect on Cd-induced cytotoxicity by effectively enhancing the MI and reducing the rate of chromosomal aberration in root tip cells. The results presented here provide evidence that W. trilobata hairy roots with rapid autonomous growth could be used as a sensitive tool for monitoring and evaluation of Cd pollution in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagneticola trilobata 3aadhesion 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3achromosome breakage 3acytotoxicity 3ainterphase 3amitosis 3apollution 3aroot tips1 aZhu, Yuan Feng1 aWang, Yun Ling1 aTsang, Po Keung Eric0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Jan., v. 21, no. 2 p.1436-1443dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-2015-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245012500196300001600321500001900337500002000356520183600376592002802212596005802240650002702298650001002325650001902335650001402354650002502368650001502393650001402408650001302422650001302435650001902448650001802467650001402485650002702499650001102526650001302537651001802550700001702568700002002585700005502605773013302660856007302793852000902866655001202875IND60723954620221120093524.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395462DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.136642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavinet, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2841-179810aPatterns of genomic divergence and introgression between Japanese stickleback species with overlapping breeding habitats  ap. 114-127.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWith only a few absolute geographic barriers in marine environments, the factors maintaining reproductive isolation among marine organisms remain elusive. However, spatial structuring in breeding habitat can contribute to reproductive isolation. This is particularly important for marine organisms that migrate to use fresh‐ or brackish water environments to breed. The Japanese Gasterosteus stickleback species, the Pacific Ocean three‐spined stickleback (G. aculeatus) and the Japan Sea stickleback (G. nipponicus) overwinter in the sea, but migrate to rivers for spawning. Although they co‐occur at several locations across the Japanese islands, they are reproductively isolated. Our previous studies in Bekanbeushi River showed that the Japan Sea stickleback spawns in the estuary, while the Pacific Ocean stickleback mainly spawns further upstream in freshwater. Overall genomic divergence was very high with many interspersed regions of introgression. Here, we investigated genomic divergence and introgression between the sympatric species in the much shorter Tokotan River, where they share spawning sites. The levels of genome‐wide divergence were reduced and introgression was increased, suggesting that habitat isolation substantially contributes to a reduction in gene flow. We also found that genomic regions of introgression were largely shared between the two systems. Furthermore, some regions of introgression were located near loci with a heterozygote advantage for juvenile survival. Taken together, introgression may be partially driven by adaptation in this system. Although, the two species remain clearly genetically differentiated. Regions with low recombination rates showed especially low introgression. Speciation reversal is therefore likely prevented by barriers other than habitat isolation.  aPublisher supplied data  aA19H01003cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aJapan 3abrackish water 3aestuaries 3aevolutionary biology 3afreshwater 3agene flow 3agenomics 3ahabitats 3aheterozygosity 3aintrogression 3ajuveniles 3areproductive isolation 3arivers 3asympatry 3aPacific Ocean1 aKume, Manabu1 aIshikawa, Asano1 aKitano, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8659-56980 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2021 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.114-127dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.136643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01878naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245007400154300001500228500002000243520098200263592002801245650001901273650001901292650002101311650000901332650001401341650002301355773011601378856007301494852000901567655001201576IND60788326020221121055112.0220813e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078832602DNAL7 a10.1136/inp.l9832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Sue10aSmall animal oncology: how to give a client a more accurate prognosis  ap. 98-105.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGiving an accurate prognosis is important for many diseases and is a part of everyday veterinary practice. It is especially important with a diagnosis of cancer, not least because many of the treatment modalities are expensive, time consuming and have the potential to cause side effects. Equally, clients often have an experience of cancer treatment and outcomes for themselves or friends and relatives, and they assume that the prognosis for one type of cancer in the human population mirrors what happens to their companion animal. There are many factors that influence an individual animal's prognosis and it is important that veterinary surgeons appreciate the usefulness of these factors to help guide the client's expectations. This article describes how to interpret information obtained regarding the tumours’ histopathological type, grade, stage, and likely response to an appropriate treatment, to provide a prognosis that is as accurate as possible to the client.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3ahistopathology 3ahuman population 3apets 3aprognosis 3aveterinary clinics0 tIn practice.g2019 Apr., v. 41, no. 3 p.98-105dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl42967x0263-841X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/inp.l9833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013000164300001800294520167500312592002801987650002502015650001802040650001502058650001002073650002102083650001002104650001602114650002202130650001002152650002102162650001002183650001002193650002202203650001602225650001702241650002002258650001402278650001302292650002102305650001802326650001502344650001302359650001502372700001702387700002102404700002302425700006502448773012902513856008402642852000902726655001202735IND60648922120221120073001.0190702e20190610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064892212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b022242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin10aAnalysis of an Integrated Human Multiorgan Microphysiological System for Combined Tolcapone Metabolism and Brain Metabolomics  ap. 8667-8675.  aHuman-on-a-chip systems are rapidly advancing due to the availability of human stem cells from a variety of tissues, but publications have utilized mostly simple methods of biochemical analysis. Here, we apply mass spectrometry to a sophisticated multiorgan human-on-a-chip system for the comprehensive study of tolcapone metabolite profiling and metabolomics. The developed human-on-a-chip includes seven interacting microphysiological systems (MPSs), brain, pancreas, liver, lung, heart, gut, and endometrium, with a mixer chamber for systemic circulation and tolcapone dose. We investigated tolcapone metabolism by analyzing the circulating medium using mass spectrometry. Twelve tolcapone metabolites were identified, three of which are newly reported. These metabolites demonstrated that oxidation, reduction, and conjugation reactions were the most important routes of tolcapone metabolism. In parallel, metabolomics in brain MPS evaluated the tolcapone influences on endogenous pathways in human brain. Untargeted metabolomics identified 18 key biomarkers significantly changed in human brain MPS after tolcapone dosing, which were mainly associated with perturbation of tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism (BH₄ cycle), glycerophospholipid metabolism, energy metabolism, and aspartate metabolism. This is the first example of successfully combining drug metabolism, metabolomics, and cell engineering to capture complex human physiology and the multiorgan interactions; the results we present here could be a step toward using analytical chemistry to advance the utilization of human-on-a-chip for testing both drug efficacy and toxicity in a single system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaspartic acid 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3acell engineering 3adrugs 3aendometrium 3aenergy metabolism 3aheart 3ahuman physiology 3aliver 3alungs 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3aoxidation 3apancreas 3apharmacokinetics 3aphenylalanine 3astem cells 3atoxicity 3atryptophan1 aCirit, Murat1 aWishnok, John S.1 aGriffith, Linda G.1 aTannenbaum, Steven R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1819-31810 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 June 10, v. 91, no. 13 p.8667-8675dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b022243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013100158300001600289500002000305520181900325592002802144650002302172650001702195650002502212650001602237650001502253650001302268650001202281650001402293650001602307650002002323650002502343650001502368650002602383650001602409700002002425700002002445700002202465700001702487773010202504856007302606852000902679655001202688IND60548429320221120162622.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054842932DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.124142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaurin, Sejuti14aThe response regulator Npun_F1278 is essential for scytonemin biosynthesis in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133  ap. 564-571.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFollowing exposure to long‐wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVA), some cyanobacteria produce the indole‐alkaloid sunscreen scytonemin. The genomic region associated with scytonemin biosynthesis in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme includes 18 cotranscribed genes. A two‐component regulatory system (Npun_F1277/Npun_F1278) directly upstream from the biosynthetic genes was identified through comparative genomics and is likely involved in scytonemin regulation. In this study, the response regulator (RR), Npun_F1278, was evaluated for its ability to regulate scytonemin biosynthesis using a mutant strain of N. punctiforme deficient in this gene, hereafter strain Δ1278. Following UVA radiation, the typical stimulus to initiate scytonemin biosynthesis, Δ1278 was incapable of producing scytonemin. A phenotypic characterization of Δ1278 suggests that aside from the ability to produce scytonemin, the deletion of the Npun_F1278 gene does not affect the cellular morphology, cellular differentiation capability, or lipid‐soluble pigment complement of Δ1278 compared to the wildtype. The mutant, however, had a slower specific growth rate under white light and produced ~2.5‐fold more phycocyanin per cell under UVA than the wildtype. Since Δ1278 does not produce scytonemin, this study demonstrates that the RR gene, Npun_F1278, is essential for scytonemin biosynthesis in N. punctiforme. While most of the evaluated effects of this gene appear to be specific for scytonemin, this regulator may also influence the overall health of the cell and phycobiliprotein synthesis, directly or indirectly. This is the first study to identify a regulatory gene involved in the biosynthesis of the sunscreen scytonemin and posits a link between cell growth, pigment synthesis, and sunscreen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc punctiforme 3abiosynthesis 3acell differentiation 3acell growth 3acomplement 3agenomics 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphycocyanin 3aregulator genes 3aspecific growth rate 3asunscreens 3aultraviolet radiation 3awhite light1 aBennett, Janine1 aVideau, Patrick1 aPhilmus, Benjamin1 aSoule, Tanya0 tJournal of phycology.g2016 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.564-571dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.124143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245010000205300001600305520139100321592002801712650001801740650002301758650002701781650001001808650002401818650002501842650001801867650001001885650001401895650001401909650001701923650000901940650001901949700002301968700003201991773011402023856008102137852000902218655001202227IND60597801120221120193309.0180627e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059780112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-018-4139-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParejo, Deseada1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7368-237810aReceivers matter: the meaning of alarm calls and competition for nest sites in a bird community  ap. 707-717.  aAnimal communities may constitute information networks where individuals gain information on predation risk by eavesdropping on alarm calls of other species. However, communities include species in different trophic levels, and it is not yet known how the trophic level of the receiver influences the informative value of a call. Furthermore, no empirical study has yet tested how increased competition may influence the value of alarm calls for distinct receivers. Here, we identify the importance of alarm calls emitted by a small owl, the little owl (Athene noctua), on the structure of a cavity-nesting bird community including mesopredators and primary prey under variable levels of competition for nest holes. Competitors sharing top predators with the callers and prey of the callers interpreted alarm and non-alarm calls differently. Competitors chose preferentially alarm and non-alarm patches over control patches to breed, while prey selected alarm patches. In contrast, competition for nest sites affected habitat selection of prey species more than that of competitors of the callers. This study provides support for a changing value of alarm calls and competition for nest sites for distinct receivers related to niche overlapping among callers and eavesdroppers, therefore, calling attention to possible cascading effects by the use of information in natural communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthene noctua 3aanimal communities 3aantipredatory behavior 3abirds 3ahabitat preferences 3ainformation networks 3anesting sites 3anests 3apredation 3apredators 3aprey species 3arisk 3atrophic levels1 aAvilés, Jesús M.1 aExpósito-Granados, Mónica0 tOecologia.g2018 July, v. 187, no. 3 p.707-717dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4139-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007900163300001800242520079700260592002801057650001701085650001701102650002201119650002001141650001201161650001301173650000901186650001001195650001001205651001601215700001701231773012001248856008101368852000901449655001201458IND60612729420221119041255.0180907e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061272942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-017-0072-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolt, Lania14aThe economic potential of Gevuina avellana in New Zealand planted forests  ap. 1287-1300.  aGevuina avellana (gevuina) is a South American tree that produces edible nuts. This study conceptualizes the transformation of a planted radiata forest into an agroforestry system that integrates radiata and gevuina trees to produce timber and Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs). This study assesses the economic potential of growing gevuina nuts in a New Zealand planted forest case study. Findings suggest that planted forests offer the potential for commercial scale using land use opportunities created around road infrastructure, and in pocket areas connected by roads. The economic returns determined in this study were significant, even in small areas. The key to realising this potential will be in the identification and use of the production strategies to handle the complex system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3acase studies 3acosts and returns 3aforest products 3aforests 3aland use 3anuts 3aroads 3atrees 3aNew Zealand1 aMurphy, Glen0 tAgroforestry systems.g2018 Oct., v. 92, no. 5 p.1287-1300dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-017-0072-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245015200184300001600336520203100352592002802383650002002411650001402431650002102445650002102466650001102487650002002498650002602518650002102544650002502565650002102590650001802611650001002629650001802639650001102657650002102668650001402689650002602703700001702729700001702746700001602763700001202779700001402791773010702805856004802912852000902960655001202969IND50074214620221118045746.0140326e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007421462DNAL7 a243223472pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-013-0799-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Gangbiao10aAge distribution patterns of human gene families: divergent for Gene Ontology categories and concordant between different subcellular localizations  ap. 137-147.  aThe age distribution of gene duplication events within the human genome exhibits two waves of duplications along with an ancient component. However, because of functional constraint differences, genes in different functional categories might show dissimilar retention patterns after duplication. It is known that genes in some functional categories are highly duplicated in the early stage of vertebrate evolution. However, the correlations of the age distribution pattern of gene duplication between the different functional categories are still unknown. To investigate this issue, we developed a robust pipeline to date the gene duplication events in the human genome. We successfully estimated about three-quarters of the duplication events within the human genome, along with the age distribution pattern in each Gene Ontology (GO) slim category. We found that some GO slim categories show different distribution patterns when compared to the whole genome. Further hierarchical clustering of the GO slim functional categories enabled grouping into two main clusters. We found that human genes located in the duplicated copy number variant regions, whose duplicate genes have not been fixed in the human population, were mainly enriched in the groups with a high proportion of recently duplicated genes. Moreover, we used a phylogenetic tree-based method to date the age of duplications in three signaling-related gene superfamilies: transcription factors, protein kinases and G-protein coupled receptors. These superfamilies were expressed in different subcellular localizations. They showed a similar age distribution as the signaling-related GO slim categories. We also compared the differences between the age distributions of gene duplications in multiple subcellular localizations. We found that the distribution patterns of the major subcellular localizations were similar to that of the whole genome. This study revealed the whole picture of the evolution patterns of gene functional categories in the human genome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aduplicate genes 3aevolution 3agene duplication 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aprotein kinases 3atranscription factors 2aAge Distribution 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Duplication 2aGene Ontology 2aGenes 2aGenome, Human 2aHumans 2aMultigene Family 2aPhylogeny 2aSubcellular Fractions1 aZou, Yangyun1 aCheng, Qiqun1 aZeng, Yanwu1 aGu, Xun1 aSu, Zhixi0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2014 Apr., v. 289, no. 2 p.137-147dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-013-0799-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008400176300001800260520165400278592002801932650001201960650002701972650002201999650001702021650002202038650001502060650003302075650001102108650002102119650001302140650001502153650001502168650001302183650001702196650001002213650001302223651001302236700002302249700002002272700002002292700001902312773012002331856008102451852000902532655001202541IND60612729520221119041249.0180907e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061272952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-017-0076-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiemela, Stella Nwawulu10aTransformation of degraded farmlands to agroforestry in Zongi Village, Ethiopia  ap. 1317-1328.  aThe interaction of human land use, steep slopes and erosion has been a serious threat to Ethiopia’s ecosystems. Community’s initiated land rehabilitation programmes such as tree regeneration on farm lands, hill-side planting and exclosures have been established to rejuvenate debilitated lands. To characterize, map out and monitor such transformations, this study was carried out in Zongi, Tigray Region of northern Ethiopia. The study used an integration of remote sensing data, field observations and information from key informants and randomly selected respondents to analyse the land-use/land cover (LULC) changes from 1984 to 2013. Conventional method of supervised image classification was used for landsat image of 2013 while hybrid method of unsupervised and supervised classification was employed for landsat images of 1984 and 1999. The results revealed significant modifications and conversion of LULC types over the multi-dates. Analysis of the 29-year change matrix revealed that 78.5% of the land underwent significant changes in LULC. The major changes to agroforestry land use(LU)types between 1984 and 2013 were conversion of intensively cultivated land to moderately cultivated land (32.1%) and sparsely cultivated land (11.8%). The drivers of changes were linked to the introduction of land rehabilitation initiatives, government consensus (via agricultural extension) with the community, which were complemented by growing awareness of landowners. This study corroborates the necessity of community involvement and participation to improve their land use systems for environmental sustainability and sustainable livelihood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural extension 3aagricultural land 3aagroforestry 3acommunity service 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahumans 3aland restoration 3aland use 3alandowners 3alivelihood 3aplanting 3aspatial data 3atrees 3avillages 3aEthiopia1 aNoulekoun, Florent1 aZenebe, Amanuel1 aNigussie Abadi,1 aEmiru Birhane,0 tAgroforestry systems.g2018 Oct., v. 92, no. 5 p.1317-1328dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-017-0076-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03950naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003700132024001100169040001800180100002200198245009300220300001400313506017300327520187000500592002802370650002202398650001102420650002302431650002602454650002002480650004002500650002602540650001602566650001602582650001902598650001502617650001602632650001702648651001302665653002502678653004602703653002602749653002502775653001602800653002302816700001802839700002402857700002102881773012602902856008403028856011203112956012603224961001303350852000903363655001203372IND60005942520221214225013.0190403e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000594252DNAL7 a3024552aris7 a10113/594252hdl7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2014.06.0032doi8 ans5135  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaghvaeian, Saleh10aConventional and simplified canopy temperature indices predict water stress in sunflower  ap. 69-80.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aCanopy temperature has been used as an indicator of crop water stress, since a reduction in plant available water results in lower transpiration rates and consequently higher canopy temperatures. In this study, two indices based on remotely-sensed canopy temperature were used in northern Colorado to monitor water stress in sunflower under six levels of regulated deficit irrigation. The two indices included the widely-used Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) and the simple Degrees Above Non-Stressed (DANS). The goal of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity of CWSI and DANS to different levels of irrigation and to investigate their relationship with several crop parameters. In estimating CWSI, non-water-stressed baselines developed in this study were similar to those developed previously at another site in northern Colorado. Both CWSI and DANS were sensitive to irrigation timing/depth and soil water deficit in the root zone, increasing as water availability decreased. Four studied crop parameters, namely the fraction of Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fIPAR), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Leaf Water Potential, and root growth were all affected by deficit irrigation treatments, with the first three parameters decreasing and the last one increasing with decrease in water application. All of these crop parameters were also strongly correlated with CWSI and DANS. Statistically significant relationships were developed to predict fIPAR, LAI, and relative root growth based on CWSI and DANS, with coefficients of determination that were similar among the two temperature-based stress indices. The results suggest that DANS, based solely on canopy temperature and estimated by a simple subtraction, may be used effectively in monitoring water stress and scheduling irrigations in deficit-irrigated sunflower in arid/semi-arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3acanopy 3adeficit irrigation 3airrigation scheduling 3aleaf area index 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplant-water relations 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3asemiarid zones 3asoil depth 3atemperature 3awater stress 3aColorado 0aInfrared thermometry 0aPhotosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) 0aLeaf Area Index (LAI) 0aLeaf Water Potential 0aRoot Growth 0aDeficit irrigation1 aComas, Louise1 aDeJonge, Kendall C.1 aTrout, Thomas J.0 tAgricultural water management.g2014 Oct., v. 144 p.69-80dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2014.06.0033Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/594253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Taghvaeian%20et%20al%202014%20Ag%20Water%20Man.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245004800165520117900213592002801392650003401420650002501454650001601479650001701495650001001512650002101522650001201543650001601555650001401571650001201585700002601597700002501623700002801648773012201676856007301798852000901871655001201880IND60719068420221120195531.0201126e20201031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071906842DNAL7 a10.3390/v121112402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeviatkin, Andrei  A.10aTBEV Subtyping in Terms of Genetic Distance  aCurrently, the lowest formal taxon in virus classification is species; however, unofficial lower-level units are commonly used in everyday work. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a species of mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses that may cause encephalitis. Many known representatives of TBEV are grouped into subtypes, mostly according to their phylogenetic relationship. However, the emergence of novel sequences could dissolve this phylogenetic grouping; in the absence of strict quantitative criterion, it may be hard to define the borders of the first TBEV taxonomic unit below the species level. In this study, the nucleotide/amino-acid space of all known TBEV sequences was analyzed. Amino-acid sequence p-distances could not reliably distinguish TBEV subtypes. Viruses that differed by less than 10% of nucleotides in the polyprotein-coding gene belonged to the same subtype. At the same time, more divergent viruses were representatives of different subtypes. According to this distance criterion, TBEV species may be divided into seven subtypes: TBEV-Eur, TBEV-Sib, TBEV-FE, TBEV-2871 (TBEV-Ob), TBEV-Him, TBEV-178-79 (TBEV-Bkl-1), and TBEV-886-84 (TBEV-Bkl-2).  aPublisher supplied data 3aTick-borne encephalitis virus 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aencephalitis 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3amammals 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aviruses1 aKarganova, Galina  G.1 aVakulenko, Yulia  A.1 aLukashev, Alexander  N.0 tViruses.g2020 Oct. 31, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121112403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245010500196300001400301500001900315500002000334520179100354592002802145596004002173650002202213650001702235650001902252650002502271650001102296650001802307650001202325650001202337650001302349650001602362651002002378700006702398700005402465773013102519856007302650852000902723655001202732IND60723955020221120103418.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395502DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.136092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudson, Jamie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2294-161610aContemporary climate change hinders hybrid performance of ecologically dominant marine invertebrates  ap. 60-72.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHuman activities alter patterns of biodiversity, particularly through species extinctions and range shifts. Two of these activities are human mediated transfer of species and contemporary climate change, and both allow previously isolated genotypes to come into contact and hybridize, potentially altering speciation rates. Hybrids have been shown to survive environmental conditions not tolerated by either parent, suggesting that, under some circumstances, hybrids may be able to expand their ranges and perform well under rapidly changing conditions. However, studies assessing how hybridization influences contemporary range shifts are scarce. We performed crosses on Pyura herdmani and Pyura stolonifera (Chordata, Tunicata), two closely related marine invertebrate species that are ecologically dominant and can hybridize. These sister species live in sympatry along the coasts of southern Africa, but one has a disjunct distribution that includes northern hemisphere sites. We experimentally assessed the performance of hybrid and parental crosses using different temperature regimes, including temperatures predicted under future climate change scenarios. We found that hybrids showed lower performance than parental crosses at the experimental temperatures, suggesting that hybrids are unlikely to expand their ranges to new environments. In turn, we found that the more widespread species performed better at a wide array of temperatures, indicating that this parental species may cope better with future conditions. This study illustrates how offspring fitness may provide key insights to predict range expansions and how contemporary climate change may mediate both the ability of hybrids to expand their ranges and the occurrence of speciation as a result of hybridization.  aPublisher supplied data  a64801cNational Research Foundation 3aPyura stolonifera 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aevolutionary biology 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aprogeny 3asympatry 3atemperature 3aSouthern Africa1 aMcQuaid, Christopher D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3473-83081 aRius, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2195-66050 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2021 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.60-72dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.136093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011400162520131000276592002801586650003401614650002201648650002301670650001201693650002201705650001101727650001101738650001001749650001401759650001301773650001401786650001901800650001101819650001001830650001501840650001901855650001201874650001201886650001301898651001101911700001601922700002001938700002201958700002901980700001902009700003402028773012202062856007302184852000902257655001202266IND60719068520221120195518.0201126e20201023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071906852DNAL7 a10.3390/v121112062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRissmann, Melanie 10aCompetency of Amphibians and Reptiles and Their Potential Role as Reservoir Hosts for Rift Valley Fever Virus  aRift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne zoonotic pathogen, which is endemic in Africa, causing large epidemics, characterized by severe diseases in ruminants but also in humans. As in vitro and field investigations proposed amphibians and reptiles to potentially play a role in the enzootic amplification of the virus, we experimentally infected African common toads and common agamas with two RVFV strains. Lymph or sera, as well as oral, cutaneous and anal swabs were collected from the challenged animals to investigate seroconversion, viremia and virus shedding. Furthermore, groups of animals were euthanized 3, 10 and 21 days post-infection (dpi) to examine viral loads in different tissues during the infection. Our data show for the first time that toads are refractory to RVFV infection, showing neither seroconversion, viremia, shedding nor tissue manifestation. In contrast, all agamas challenged with the RVFV strain ZH501 carried virus genomes in the spleens at 3 dpi, but the animals displayed neither viremia nor virus shedding. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that amphibians are not susceptible and reptiles are only susceptible to a low extent to RVFV, indicating that both species play, if at all, rather a subordinate role in the RVF virus ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRift Valley fever phlebovirus 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease reservoirs 3aecology 3aenzootic diseases 3agenome 3ahumans 3alymph 3apathogens 3areptiles 3aruminants 3aseroconversion 3aspleen 3atoads 3aviral load 3aviral shedding 3aviremia 3aviruses 3azoonoses 3aAfrica1 aKley, Nils 1 aUlrich, Reiner 1 aStoek, Franziska 1 aBalkema-Buschmann, Anne 1 aEiden, Martin 1 aGroschup, M.

These interactions are shaped by components of individual behavior, particularly foraging behaviors. However, few studies consider species’ behavioral responses to warming to predict how species interactions will be affected by warming. We chose two complementary approaches to examine how climate warming may affect the behavior and interactions of aquatic intraguild predators. First, we measured behavioral responses to warming in six larval dragonfly species, expecting that feeding rate and activity would increase with temperature. Secondly, we conducted intraguild predation (IGP) trials with three species to understand how temperature affects IGP, and if species’ behavioral responses to warming are indicative of the outcome of IGP interactions. Warming increased feeding rates by 42% on average across species but had no effect on activity rate. The magnitude of change in feeding rate was positively correlated with the maximum temperatures species experience across their ranges. Lastly, warming increased rates of IGP twofold, however, species’ behavioral responses alone were not predictive of their susceptibility to become IG prey of other larvae at warmer temperatures. Our results provide evidence that IGP interactions may be greatly affected by future increases in temperature; however, activity responses to warming alone are weak predictors of the outcomes of these interactions. Future studies should consider other species’ traits when forecasting the effects of climate change on species interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3acorrelation 3aforaging 3aglobal warming 3alarvae 3apredation 3apredators 3atemperature1 aMcCauley, Shannon J.0 tOecologia.g2018 July, v. 187, no. 3 p.585-596dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4146-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013100167300001600298520119700314592002801511650001901539650002301558650001601581650001801597650001701615650001501632650001801647650001701665650001601682650001001698650001601708650001601724650001001740650001501750650003001765653002101795653001001816653001501826653001001841653002301851700001701874700002101891773013001912856008402042852000902126655001202135IND60122581120221121232945.0150325e20141102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012258112DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2014.9610992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, R.

A simple, rapid and reliable High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatographic (HPTLC) method was developed for the analysis of rutin. HPTLC was carried out for qualitative determination of flavonoids in the fermentation broth using silica gel 60 F ₂₅₄ 20×20cm thickly plated preparative chromatography plates as a stationary phase and ethyl acetate, glacial acetic acid and formic acid (5:0.5:1, v/v) as mobile phase. The plates were scanned densitometrically between 200 and 700 nm. The fermentation extract of the endophytic Aspergillus flavus produced metabolite and showed a compact and well resolved blue band with the same R f (0.32±0.02) to that of authentic rutin. The bioactive metabolite produced by endophytic fungi is generally less than their host plant. However, in this study, the flavonoids were easily detected with HPTLC indicating more production of the metabolite. The present study demonstrates a new method to produce, isolate and analyze flavonoids by fungal fermentation, which could overcome the extensive use of the host plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegle marmelos 3aAspergillus flavus 3aacetic acid 3aculture media 3adensitometry 3aendophytes 3aethyl acetate 3afermentation 3aformic acid 3afungi 3ahost plants 3ametabolites 3arutin 3asilica gel 3athin layer chromatography 0aEndophytic fungi 0aHPTLC 0aflavonoids 0arutin 0aAspergillus flavus1 aPatil, M.

A fusion protein of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5-agonist domains from flagellin and multiple repeats of the conserved extracellular domain of the influenza matrix protein 2 (M2e) was constructed, purified and evaluated as such a vaccine. A painless vaccination method suitable for possible self-administration using coated microneedle arrays was investigated for skin-targeted delivery of the fusion protein in a mouse model. The results demonstrate that microneedle immunization induced strong humoral as well as mucosal antibody responses and conferred complete protection against homo- and heterosubtypic lethal virus challenges. Protective efficacy with microneedles was found to be significantly better than that seen with conventional intramuscular injection, and comparable to that observed with intranasal immunization. Because of its advantages for administration, safety and storage, microneedle delivery of M2e-flagellin fusion protein is a promising approach for an easy-to-administer universal influenza vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aToll-like receptors 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3across immunity 3aflagellin 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccines 3aintramuscular injection 3aligands 3apandemic 3avaccination 3aviruses 0aCross-protection 0aInfluenza M2e 0aMicroneedle array 0aTLR5 ligand 0aUniversal influenza vaccine1 aGill, Harvinder S.1 aHe, Cheng1 aOu, Changbo1 aWang, Li1 aWang, Ying-Chun1 aFeng, Hao1 aZhang, Han1 aPrausnitz, Mark R.1 aCompans, Richard W.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2014 Mar. 28, v. 178 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00979naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011000162520015200272592002800424650001700452650001700469650001900486700001600505773012200521856007300643852000900716655001200725IND60719068720221120195550.0201126e20201031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071906872DNAL7 a10.3390/v121112432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Mark C.,10aIntroduction to Special Issue “The 11th International Retroviral Nucleocapsid and Assembly Symposium”  aThe 11th International Retroviral Nucleocapsid and Assembly Symposium was held August 15–17, 2019, on the campus of Northeastern University [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3aRetroviridae 3anucleocapsid 3avirus assembly1 aOno, Akira 0 tViruses.g2020 Oct. 31, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121112433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011000176300001600286500001900302520136400321592002801685650001101713650001701724650002801741650003001769650001201799650001301811650002201824650002101846651001001867653003101877653001901908653001401927653002401941653001801965653002201983700002202005700002202027700002002049773009402069856008202163852000902245655001202254IND60735921920221120171721.0210429e20210526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073592192DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2020-00792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMboumba, Jean-François10aSmall rodent communities (Muridae) in Gabonese savannas: species diversity and biogeographical affinities  ap. 256-268.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study contributes to the knowledge of species composition and biogeographical affinities of savannas rodent in Gabon. Unlike small rodents in Gabonese forests, there is little data on the diversity of small rodents in Gabonese savannas. The diversity and distribution of rodent murid communities was studied in four different types of savanna in Gabon: Coastal Basin (South-West), Lopé/Okanda (in the Center), Batéké Plateaux (Southeastern) and Ngougnié/ N’yanga (in the South). A total of 428 individuals representing six species were captured over 11,920 trap nights. Trap success was highly variable (2.2–6.9 %). The most abundant species were Mus minutoides (69%) followed by Lemniscomys striatus (21.5%). Indices of species richness varied from 2 to 5 and diversity (Shannon and Weaver) was low in the four savannas with the highest value at Ngougnié/N’yanga (H′ = 1.2). Species distributions show that Gabonese savanna small rodents conform to four distribution types, with one species known from Zambesian savannas exhibiting austral affinities (Pelomys campanae: occurs in three southern savannas). This new information provides important insight into the biogeography of small rodents at a local and regional level. Moreover, the correspondence analysis highlighted an influence of local ecological factors on population abundance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiogeography 3acorrespondence analysis 3ageographical distribution 3arodents 3asavannas 3aspecies abundance 3aspecies richness 3aGabon 0abiogeographical affinities 0aCentral Africa 0adiversity 0aMuridae communities 0asmall rodents 0atropical savannas1 aHervé, Maxime R.1 aGuyot, Véronique1 aYsnel, Frederic0 tMammalia.g2021 May 26, v. 85, no. 3 p.256-268dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2020-00793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04747naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003700132024001100169040001800180100001600198245009300214500001500307506017300322520243800495650001802933650002202951650001602973650001002989650001402999650001803013650003303031650001303064650001303077650001603090650003003106650000903136650000903145650001203154650001703166650000903183650000903192650002403201650002703225650001103252650002203263650003303285650001503318650001903333650001003352651001103362651001503373651001903388651001003407651001103417651001203428651001503440700001903455700001303474700001603487700001803503700001903521700002003540773008703560856011203647856008303759956014103842961000903983852000903992655001204001IND60006127220221214223822.0150820e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000612722DNAL7 a3140082aris7 a10113/612722hdl7 a10.1094/PDIS-02-15-0138-PDN2doi8 ans7961  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyer, A.

Although H. avenae occurs in several U.S. states, H. filipjevi was discovered in the United States in Oregon in 2008 and has since been reported only in Washington. In Chouteau County, Montana, a winter wheat field reported to contain H. avenae was observed with localized areas of heavily stunted Yellowstone winter wheat. Roots from affected plants displayed moderate numbers of nematode cysts with no associated proliferation of lateral roots. Living nematode cysts from wheat roots from the affected field were examined morphologically and by PCR for species identification. Observations of morphological characters critical for identification indicated that the specimens were H. filipjevi. Diagnostic measurements of second-stage juveniles included length of body, stylet with anchor-shaped basal knobs, tail, and hyaline tail terminus. The lateral field had four lines; the inner two were more distinct. Shapes of the tail, tail terminus, and stylet knobs were also consistent with H. filipjevi. The lemon-shaped cysts were light brown to yellow and had a zigzag pattern and bifenestrate vulval cone; diagnostic morphometrics included body length excluding neck, body width, length/width, neck length and width, fenestra length and width, heavy underbridge, vulval slit, and many bullae. Molecular analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS1 and 2) and 28S rRNA confirmed identity as H. filipjevi. Amplicons generated from three J2 were cloned and sequenced. Sequences from the 28S region were >99.9% identical to those of H. filipjevi from China but distinct from several populations of H. avenae (99.0-99.2%). The ITS rDNA from this population matched with 99.9% identity several H. filipjevi sequences available from GenBank, including ones from Russia, Tajikistan, UK, USA, and China. The next closest species match was H. avenae, showing 96-97% identity to the Montana population. This is the first report of H. filipjevi from Montana. Importantly, eggs from H. filipjevi are noted for hatching in the fall during winter wheat planting and therefore may more greatly affect winter wheat than H. avenae, whose eggs hatch only in the spring after a cold period. Moreover, resistance in wheat against these two nematode species is different and will require additional considerations. 3aribosomal RNA 3aHeterodera avenae 3abody length 3aroots 3ajuveniles 3aribosomal DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ahatching 3aplanting 3amorphometry 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aneck 3atail 3astylets 3awinter wheat 3aeggs 3acold 3aHeterodera latipons 3aspecies identification 3aspring 3agenetic databases 3acysts (developmental stages) 3apopulation 3acyst nematodes 3alight 3aRussia 3aTajikistan 3aUnited Kingdom 3aChina 3aOregon 3aMontana 0aWashington1 aAl-Khafaji, R.1 aLane, T.1 aPaulitz, T.1 aHandoo, Z.

The virus emerged in the late 1980s and became endemic in most swine producing countries, causing substantial economic losses to the swine industry. The first reverse genetics system for PRRSV was reported in 1998. Since then, several infectious cDNA clones for PRRSV have been constructed. The availability of these infectious cDNA clones has facilitated the genetic modifications of the viral genome at precise locations. Common approaches to manipulate the viral genome include site-directed mutagenesis, deletion of viral genes or gene fragments, insertion of foreign genes, and swapping genes between PRRSV strains or between PRRSV and other members of the Arteriviridae family. In this review, we describe the approaches to construct an infectious cDNA for PRRSV and the ten major applications of these infectious clones to study virus biology and virus–host interaction, and to design a new generation of vaccines with improved levels of safety and efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetaarterivirus suid 1 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3afinancial economics 3agenes 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apork industry 3areverse genetics 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aswine 3avaccines 3aviruses1 aVu, Hiep  L.

Oil Revenues, Information Disclosure, and Transparency  ap. 1187-1202.  aExperience shows that discovery of valuable natural resources can become a curse rather than a blessing, and transparency has been identified as key to better resource governance because it can limit opportunities for corruption and mismanagement. This article shows that information disclosure, in which many governments and donor institutions engage, does not automatically translate into transparency. Ghana has embedded transparency as one of its key principles in oil management. However, fieldwork conducted in a coastal village close to Ghana's offshore oil fields documents that people in the village lack access to information about oil revenues. The study identifies that the main barriers for acquiring information are people's lack of capacity and willingness to acquire such information. Furthermore, the government of Ghana and the villagers perceive transparency very differently: The former equates information disclosure to transparency, whereas the latter perceive transparency in terms of the development in their community.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity development 3agovernance 3aincome 3aoil fields 3aoils 3apeople 3avillages 3aGhana 0aaccess 0aaccountability 0acapacity 0aCape Three Points 0aGhana 0ainformation disclosure 0anatural resources 0aoil 0atransparency1 aLujala, Päivi,0 tSociety & natural resources.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 28, no. 11 p.1187-1202dRoutledgex1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2015.10248063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01730naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245013500202300002000337520047100357592002800828650001600856650001000872650001200882650002300894650002300917650001100940650002200951700007100973700001901044700002901063700006401092773013601156856007901292852000901371655001201380IND60626642620221119085812.0181222e20181129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062664262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b026182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajesh, Manda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8106-652710aNickel Catalyzed syn-Selective Aryl Nickelation and Cyclization of Aldehyde/Enone-Tethered Terminal Alkynes with Arylboronic Acids  ap. 15361-15371.  aA syn-arylative nickelation followed by nucleophilic syn-selective cyclization of o-propargyloxy benzaldehydes is achieved toward the synthesis of chromanol skeletons with alkenyl substitution at C3.

Aβ aggregation can result in a myriad of distinct aggregate species, from soluble oligomers to insoluble fibrils. Aβ strongly interacts with membranes, which can be linked to a variety of potential toxic mechanisms associated with AD. Oxidative damage accompanies the formation of Aβ aggregates, with a 10–50% proportion of Aβ aggregates being oxidized in vivo. Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a reactive oxygen species implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the H₂O₂ concentration fluctuates rapidly in the brain, resulting in large concentration spikes, especially in the synaptic cleft. Here, the impact of environmental H₂O₂ on Aβ aggregation in the presence and absence of lipid membranes is investigated. Aβ₄₀ was exposed to H₂O₂, resulting in the selective oxidation of methionine 35 (Met35) to produce Aβ₄₀Met35[O]. While oxidation mildly reduced the rate of Aβ aggregation and produced a distinct fibril morphology at high H₂O₂ concentrations, H₂O₂ had a much more pronounced impact on Aβ aggregation in the presence of total brain lipid extract vesicles. The impact of H₂O₂ on Aβ aggregation in the presence of lipids was associated with a reduced affinity of Aβ for the vesicle surface. However, this reduced vesicle affinity was predominately associated with lipid peroxidation rather than Aβ oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abrain 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amethionine 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidation 3atoxicity1 aDonohoe, Gregory C.1 aAkhmedov, Novruz G.1 aFerrebee, Timothy1 aValentine, Stephen J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4360-29281 aLegleiter, Justin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5262-18670 tBiochemistry.g2019 June 12, v. 58, no. 26 p.2893-2905dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b002333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013200169520145900301592002801760650002901788650001701817650001401834650001701848650001001865650000901875650001801884650001701902650001801919650001201937650002001949653001701969653002001986653002902006653001702035653001902052700002102071700001602092700001502108700001802123700001802141700002102159700001902180773010202199856008602301852000902387655001202396IND60747978720221120215657.0211001e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074797872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1071062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xiao-Dan10aFabrication, interaction mechanism, functional properties, and applications of fish gelatin-polysaccharide composites: a review  aFish gelatins (FGs), which have been considered as excellent candidates to substitute mammalian gelatins, are important food hydrocolloids isolated from aquatic resources. However, some undesirable sensory and physicochemical properties limit the applications of FGs. Over the past decade, many studies have reported the modification of FGs using polysaccharides and the FG-polysaccharide composites show great potentiality in food industry. This review summarizes and discusses fabrication methods, interaction mechanism, functional properties, and applications of FG-polysaccharide composites. Various approaches including physical mixing, chemical cross-linking, and enzymatic cross-linking have been put forward to prepare the FG-polysaccharide composites. Therefore, non-covalent and covalent bonds occurred between the two types of macromolecules. Mechanical properties (gel strength and barrier property) and biological functions (mainly antioxidant and antimicrobial activity) of FGs are improved after the addition of polysaccharides. The FG-polysaccharide composites show wide varieties of applications in food packaging, wound dressing, and drug delivery. Further scientific studies such as determining the structural and physicochemical properties of FGs and polysaccharides, optimizing reaction conditions, identifying interaction mechanisms, and expanding their applications in food, cosmetics, and medical industries are urgently required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3acosmetics 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3afish 3afood industry 3agel strength 3ahydrocolloids 3amammals 3apolysaccharides 0aFish gelatin 0aPhysical mixing 0aNon-covalent interaction 0aEdible films 0aFood packaging1 aHuang, Jing-Jing1 aWu, Jiu-Lin1 aCai, Xi-Xi1 aTian, Yong-Qi1 aRao, Ping-Fan1 aHuang, Jian-Lian1 aWang, Shao-Yun0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Jan., v. 122 p.107106-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1071063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011700167300001600284520170900300592002802009650001502037650001702052650002402069650001602093650003002109650001102139650001502150650002902165650002602194650001102220650001602231650002502247650002102272650001502293651001002308700001402318700001502332700001602347700001402363773013302377856008102510852000902591655001202600IND60597802120221121062322.0180627e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059780212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2186-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Zhongmin12aA data-driven SVR model for long-term runoff prediction and uncertainty analysis based on the Bayesian framework  ap. 137-149.  aAccurate and reliable long-term forecasting plays an important role in water resources management and utilization. In this paper, a hybrid model called SVR-HUP is presented to predict long-term runoff and quantify the prediction uncertainty. The model is created based on three steps. First, appropriate predictors are selected according to the correlations between meteorological factors and runoff. Second, a support vector regression (SVR) model is structured and optimized based on the LibSVM toolbox and a genetic algorithm. Finally, using forecasted and observed runoff, a hydrologic uncertainty processor (HUP) based on a Bayesian framework is used to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the simulated values, and the associated uncertainty of prediction was quantitatively analyzed. Six precision evaluation indexes, including the correlation coefficient (CC), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), relative error (RE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and qualification rate (QR), are used to measure the prediction accuracy. As a case study, the proposed approach is applied in the Han River basin, South Central China. Three types of SVR models are established to forecast the monthly, flood season and annual runoff volumes. The results indicate that SVR yields satisfactory accuracy and reliability at all three scales. In addition, the results suggest that the HUP cannot only quantify the uncertainty of prediction based on a confidence interval but also provide a more accurate single value prediction than the initial SVR forecasting result. Thus, the SVR-HUP model provides an alternative method for long-term runoff forecasting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aconfidence interval 3acorrelation 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3aquantitative analysis 3arunoff 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aLi, Yujie1 aHu, Yiming1 aLi, Binquan1 aWang, Jun0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2018 July, v. 133, no. 1-2 p.137-149dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2186-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200961 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012300171300001600294520106700310592002801377650002301405650002701428650001101455650001401466650001801480650001301498650001101511650001301522650002501535650002301560650002001583650002201603650001301625650001001638650001601648653004101664653002901705653004101734653004301775653002901818653003001847653003701877653004401914653003201958653004101990653003102031653002902062653003802091653005102129653004902180653001102229653001002240653000802250653000802258653000802266653000802274653000802282653000802290653001102298653001002309653001102319653000802330653000602338653000802344653001202352653000802364653001902372653002002391653001902411653006402430653003202494653001002526700001802536700001502554700001802569700002702587700001802614700001402632700001502646700001402661700001702675700001602692700005502708773010002763856008702863852000902950655001202959IND60617965320221122062458.0210105e20190330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061796532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.10.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Yingxin10aNitrogen topdressing timing modifies the gluten quality and grain hardness related protein levels as revealed by iTRAQ  ap. 135-144.  aNitrogen fertilization regimes significantly affect both grain quality and yield. Wheat plants were subjected to different application timing of topdressed nitrogen at the emergence of the top fifth (TL5), top third (TL3) and top first leaf (TL1), respectively. The iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) technology was adopted to obtain the complete proteome of wheat flour and to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) as regulated by nitrogen topdressing timing. Collectively, 591 proteins into 17 functional categories in flour of mature grains were identified. In comparison to TL3, 50 and 63 DEPs were identified in TL5 and TL1, respectively. Nine of the DEPs commonly dependent on nitrogen topdressing timing are the γ-gliadins or high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. Additionally, delaying nitrogen topdressing modified the grain hardness and allergic protein content. The results suggested that altering nitrogen topdressing timing is a potential strategy for pursuing targeted processing quality of wheat flour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication timing 3afertilizer application 3agluten 3aglutenins 3agrain quality 3ahardness 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aprocessing quality 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3awheat 3awheat flour 0aDithiothreitol (PubChem CID: 446094) 0aTris (PubChem CID: 6503) 0aHydrochloric Acid (PubChem CID: 313) 0aβ-Mercaptoethanol (PubChem CID: 1567) 0aEDTA (PubChem CID: 6049) 0aPVPP (PubChem CID: 17595) 0aTriton X-100 (PubChem CID: 5590) 0aAmmonium Sulfate (PubChem CID: 6097028) 0aMethanol (PubChem CID: 887) 0aIndoleacetic Acid (PubChem CID: 802) 0aAcetone (PubChem CID: 180) 0aUrea (PubChem CID: 1176) 0aIodoacetamide (PubChem CID: 3727) 0aTetraethylammonium Bromide (PubChem CID: 6285) 0aAcetonitrile Hydrate (PubChem CID: 18373917) 0aADP-RF 0aANOVA 0aDAA 0aDEP 0aFDR 0aGMP 0aGPC 0aGSP 0aHMW-GS 0aiTRAQ 0aLMW-GS 0aLSD 0aN 0aPDI 0aqRT-PCR 0aSDS 0aFlour proteome 0aGluten proteins 0aGrain hardness 0aiTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) 0aNitrogen topdressing timing 0aWheat1 aWang, Weiling1 aHuang, Xin1 aLiu, Mingming1 aHebelstrup, Kim Henrik1 aYang, Donglei1 aCai, Jian1 aWang, Xiao1 aZhou, Qin1 aCao, Weixing1 aDai, Tingbo1 aJiang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0876-50430 tFood chemistry.g2019 Mar. 30, v. 277 p.135-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.10.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001200143245011700155300001300272520087100285592002801156650003401184650002401218650001601242650002101258650002401279650000901303650002101312651001001333700001401343773012801357856007801485852000901563655001201572IND60765152220221120200441.0220419e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076515222DNAL7 a10.17221/425/2013-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Q.10aContribution of root respiration to soil respiration in a rape (Brassica campestris L.) field in Southwest China  ap. 8-14.  aThis study aimed to separate the respective contributions of root and microbial respiration to soil respiration in a rape field in Southwest China. The soil respiration was measured with a closed chamber technique and a regression method was used to apportion root and microbial respiration. Microbial and root respiration ranged from 70.67 to 183.77 mg CO<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>/h and 21.99 to 193.09 mg CO<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>/h, averaged 127.16 and 116.66 mg CO<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>/h during the rape growing season, respectively. Root respiration coefficient ranged from 0.41 to 5.39 mg C-CO<sub>2</sub>/g C/h and was negatively correlated with root/shoot ratio, aboveground and belowground biomass, but positively correlated with root N content.

In the present study, the protective effects of guar gum (GG), xanthan gum (XG) and carrageenan (CG) on the gastric digestion of SC II under pH 2.0 were explored by in vitro simulated gastric digestion. Based on the results of sodium dodecyl sulfonate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), anionic polysaccharides including XG and CG improved the gastric digestive stability of SC II. After digestion, the content of SC II with intact structure in XG-SC II and CG-SC II group was 1.52–3.10 and 1.99–2.73 times of that in control group, while the protective effect of GG was limited (only 1.03–1.42 times). The results of rheology, ζ-potential, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and CD showed that, at the ratio of 0.1:1–0.2:1, CG could improve the thermal stability of SC II to protect it from degradation, while XG could form insoluble complexes with SC II and slightly prevent the binding of pepsin; at the ratio of 0.4:1–1.5:1, both CG and XG could form extensive insoluble complexes with SC II, which might hinder the binding of pepsin, and thus inhibited the gastric digestion of SC II. Therefore, through electrostatic interaction, a small amount of CG could have a great protective effect on the gastric digestion of SC II under pH 2.0, while XG required a higher dosage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrageenan 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acollagen 3adigestion 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aguar gum 3ahydrocolloids 3apH 3apepsin 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotective effect 3arheology 3asodium dodecyl sulfonate 3athermal stability 3axanthan gum 0aPepsin soluble undenatured type II collagen 0aGastric digestive stability1 aZheng, Lin1 aSu, Guowan1 aZhao, Mouming1 aYang, Qing1 aWang, Jinmei0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Jan., v. 122 p.107107-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1071073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245017400163300001600337520200800353592002802361650001502389650001402404650001002418650001002428650002602438650001602464650001102480650001202491653000902503653002602512653002102538653001302559653003402572700002402606700002402630700002402654773023002678856007402908852000902982655001202991IND60548430620221123020350.0190412e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054843062DNAL7 a10.1111/vaa.123272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Jacques P10aDetermination of the minimum infusion rate of propofol required to prevent purposeful movement of the extremities in response to a standardized noxious stimulus in goats  ap. 519-527.  aTo determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of propofol required to prevent purposeful movement in response to a standardized stimulus in goats.Prospective, experimental study.Eight healthy goats (four does, four wethers).Anaesthesia was induced with 4 mg kg−1 propofol intravenously (IV). A continuous IV infusion of propofol at 0.6 mg kg−1 minute−1 was initiated immediately to maintain anaesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, goats breathed spontaneously via a circle breathing system delivering supplementary oxygen. The initial propofol infusion rate was maintained for 30 minutes before responses to noxious stimulation provided by clamping the proximal part of the claw with a Vulsellum forceps for 60 seconds were tested. In the presence or absence of purposeful movements of the extremities, the infusion rate was increased or reduced by 0.1 mg kg−1 minute−1 and held constant for 30 minutes before claw clamping was repeated. The propofol MIR for each goat was calculated as the mean of the infusion rates that allowed and abolished movement. Basic cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored, recorded and tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon's signed rank test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. The quality of recovery from anaesthesia was assessed and scored.The median MIR of propofol was 0.45 mg kg−1 minute−1 (range: 0.45–0.55 mg kg−1 minute−1). Induction and recovery were free of adverse behaviour. No statistically significant cardiopulmonary changes in comparison with baseline were observed, but clinically relevant hypoxaemia at 2 minutes after induction of anaesthesia was consistently observed. Chewing during anaesthesia was observed in three goats. Median times to extubation and standing were 3 minutes (range: 2–6 minutes) and 10 minutes (range: 7–21 minutes), respectively.Propofol induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia minimally compromise cardiopulmonary function when oxygen is supplemented in goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3abreathing 3aclaws 3agoats 3aintravenous injection 3amastication 3aoxygen 3awethers 0agoat 0aminimum infusion rate 0anoxious stimulus 0apropofol 0atotal intravenous anaesthesia1 aNdawana, Patience S1 aDzikiti, Loveness N1 aDzikiti, Brighton T0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2016 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.519-527dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vaa.123273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011100169300001400280520061900294592002800913650002000941650003600961650001200997650003701009650002601046650001901072650000901091650001501100650001101115653000801126653003201134653001001166653002401176653002601200700002201226700002401248773009801272856008701370852000901457655001201466IND60617965420221122062420.0210105e20190330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061796542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.10.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcvirk, Miha14aThe determination of the geographic origins of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) by multi-elemental fingerprinting  ap. 32-37.  aFor brewers, it is important to know the geographic origins of the hop plants (Humulus lupulus L.) used in their brewing processes since the contents and compositions of the bitter resins and essential oils in them depend on the environmental conditions during their growth.

The crested porcupine, Hystrix cristata, is considered a strictly vegetarian rodent. It may integrate animal proteins through bone-gnawing, while the importance of insects in his diet is poorly known. In this study we assessed the presence of insects in the diet of this rodent in Central Italy by collecting 141 faecal samples along transects in 2016–2020. Hypogeal plant organs were the main component of the diet (absolute frequency = 50.38%; volume = 60.13%). Insects were detected only in 6.8% samples, only in February–March, at the annual birth peak for the crested porcupine. Insect consumption, although occasional, could be linked to the nutritional requirements of this rodent during lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHystrix cristata 3aentomophagy 3afrugivores 3agranivores 3alactation 3arodents 3avegetarian diet 3aItaly 0anutritional requirements1 aDi Gregorio, Milos1 aMazza, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6644-14291 aFicetola, Gentile Francesco0 tMammalia.g2021 May 26, v. 85, no. 3 p.231-235dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2020-01313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008100157300001600238520198400254592002802238650001302266650001302279650002902292650001202321650001602333650002302349650002102372650001702393650000802410650001202418650001202430650000702442650002402449650002302473650002402496650001102520700001802531700002002549773013602569856007502705852000902780655001202789IND60765152520221120200553.0220422e20111211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076515252DNAL7 a10.17221/4255-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoležal, P.14aThe effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on ruminal fermentation in dairy cows  ap. 503-510.  aThis study presents the results of an experiment in which the effect of addition of a yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Strain 47) on rumen fermentation was studied in thirty-six dairy cows of Holstein breed.The animals were divided into one control and five experimental groups. Each group involved 6 individuals. The animals received a diet consisting of good maize silage with a higher dry matter content (16 kg), clover-grass haylage (l6 kg), meadow hay (3 kg) and supplementary feed mixture (7.5 kg). The rations were fed to cows as total mixed ration (TMR).In experimental groups, the yeast culture was added into the feed mixture in amounts of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 g per day and animal. Samples of rumen fluid were taken perorally 3&ndash;4 hours after feeding. The obtained results indicated that the addition of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae SC-47 culture in recommended doses showed a positive effect on ruminal digestion. As compared with control, the addition of all aforementioned amounts of the yeast culture into the feeding ration resulted in all cases in a statistically significant (P < 0.01) decrease in pH and fluctuated near the lower limit of the reference values. As compared with control, the yeast culture supplementation showed a positive effect (P < 0.01) on production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) (127.6 vs. 84.0 mmol/l). The utilisation of ammonia was higher (P < 0.01) in experimental groups (8.12, resp. 8.68 mmol/l) than in controls (9.06 mmol/l). The difference in protozoa numbers in rumens of dairy cows in the control and experimental groups was statistically highly significantly (P < 0.01) different. There was a close relationship between the dose of yeast culture on the one hand and the VFA content and protozoa numbers on the other. The regression analysis of dependence of dependent variable (i.e. pH of rumen fluid) on the independent one (i.e. the dose of yeast culture) revealed only a slight degree of dependence (r = 0.671). &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aProtozoa 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aammonia 3acorn silage 3adry matter content 3afeed supplements 3afermentation 3ahay 3ahaylage 3ameadows 3apH 3aregression analysis 3arumen fermentation 3atotal mixed rations 3ayeasts1 aDoležal, J.,1 aTřináctý, J.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 50, no. 11 p.503-510dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4255-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016900170300001600339520142800355592002801783650002001811650002001831650001901851650001501870650002301885650002301908650003901931650001701970650001601987650001702003650001802020650003902038650002402077650001302101650001402114650001902128650001902147650001502166650003702181653001802218653003002236653003302266653001402299653001502313653002202328653002402350700002402374700002802398700002302426700002102449700002502470700003402495700002502529700005902554773012502613856008302738852000902821655001202830IND60700236420221122164746.0201023e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070023642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTasca, Elisamaria10aPoloxamer/sodium cholate co-formulation for micellar encapsulation of doxorubicin with high efficiency for intracellular delivery: An in-vitro bioavailability study  ap. 551-561.  aDoxorubicin hydrochloride (DX) is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent, though its severe side-effects limit its clinical use. A way to overcome these limitations is to increase DX latency through encapsulation in suitable carriers. However, DX has a high solubility in water, hindering encapsulation. The formulation of DX with sodium cholate (NaC) will reduce aqueous solubility through charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions thus facilitating DX encapsulation into poloxamer (F127) micelles, increasing drug latency.DX/NaC/PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer (F127) formulations with high DX content (DX-PMs) have been prepared and characterized by scattering techniques, transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Cell proliferation has been evaluated after DX-PMs uptake in three cell lines (A549, Hela, 4T1). Cell uptake of DX has been studied by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry.DX-PMs formulations result in small and stable pluronic micelles, with the drug located in the apolar core of the polymeric micelles. Cell proliferation assays show a delayed cell toxicity for the encapsulated DX compared with the free drug. Data show a good correlation between cytotoxic response and slow DX delivery to nuclei. DX-PMs offer the means to restrict DX delivery to the cell interior in a highly stable and biocompatible formulation, suitable for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abioavailability 3acancer therapy 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3acomposite polymers 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amicelles 3aneoplasms 3aneutralization 3asodium cholate 3asolubility 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aDrug-delivery 0aDoxorubicin hydrochloride 0aPEO-PPO-PEO block copolymers 0aPluronics 0aBile salts 0aTumour cell lines 0aConfocal microscopy1 aAndreozzi, Patrizia1 aDel Giudice, Alessandra1 aGalantini, Luciano1 aSchillén, Karin1 aMaria Giuliani, Anna1 aRamirez, Maria de los Angeles1 aMoya, Sergio Enrique1 aGiustini, Mauro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9390-02400 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 579 p.551-561dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01580naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012400157300001800281520053400299592002800833650001400861650002400875650002100899650001100920650002200931650001300953650002200966700001600988700001901004700001701023773011801040856007501158852000901233655001201242IND60549871320221121101955.0160909e20120518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054987132DNAL7 a10.1021/jo300236u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jaeyoung10aIndium Tri(isopropoxide)-Catalyzed Selective Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley Reduction of Aliphatic and Aromatic Aldehydes  ap. 4821-4825.  aIndium tri(isopropoxide)-catalyzed Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes in 2-propanol gave selectively the corresponding primary alcohols in good to excellent yields at room temperature.

Furthermore, 18 representative strains were selected and characterized using multilocus sequence analyses of core and symbiotic gene loci. Numerical analysis of the phenotypic characteristics grouped the 42 strains into 4 distinct clusters. The analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of the 18 strains showed that they belong to the Mesorhizobium genus. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree constructed from the combined genes sequences (recA, atpD, glnII, and gyrB), the test strains were distributed into 4 genospecies (designated as genospecies I–IV). Genospecies I, II, and III could be classified with Mesorhizobium ciceri, Mesorhizobium abyssinicae, and Mesorhizobium shonense, respectively, while genospecies IV might represent an unnamed Mesorhizobium genospecies. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the symbiosis-related (nifH and nodA) genes supported a single cluster together with a previously described symbiont of chickpea (M. ciceri and Mesorhizobium mediterraneum). Overall, our results corroborate earlier findings that Ethiopian soils harbor phylogenetically diverse Mesorhizobium species, justifying further explorative studies. The observed differences in symbiotic effectiveness indicated the potential to select effective strains for use as inoculants and to improve the productivity of chickpea in the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aMesorhizobium ciceri 3aMesorhizobium mediterraneum 3achickpeas 3agenes 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3asymbionts 3aEthiopia 0aMesorhizobium 0aMLSA 0acore genes 0asymbiotic genes 0asymbiotic effectiveness1 aWolde-Meskel, Endalkachew1 aDegefu, Tulu1 aWalley, Fran0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2017 May 12, v. 63, no. 8 p.690-707dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44722x0008-41667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2016-07763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011400210300001600324520159800340592002801938596004201966650001202008650002702020650001202047650001402059650001402073650003302087650001202120650002302132650001702155650002602172650002002198650003002218650002902248650001502277651001002292700002902302700003402331700002102365700002402386700002302410700002302433700002902456773010302485856008302588852000902671655001202680IND60779204920221116144317.0220605e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077920492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-022-03128-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanescu, Sinziana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0340-458010aInterorgan amino acid interchange in propionic acidemia: the missing key to understanding its physiopathology  ap. 777-786.  aBACKGROUND: Propionic acidemia is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency in the mitochondrial enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase that converts the propionyl CoA to methyl malonyl CoA. This leads to profound changes in distinct metabolic pathways, including the urea cycle, with consequences in ammonia detoxification. The implication of the tricarboxylic acid cycle is less well known, but its repercussions could explain both some of the acute and long-term symptoms of this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present observational study investigates the amino acid profiles of patients with propionic acidemia being monitored at the Hospital Ramón y Cajal (Madrid, Spain), between January 2015 and September 2017, comparing periods of metabolic stability with those of decompensation with ketosis and/or hyperammonemia. RESULTS: The concentrations of 19 amino acids were determined in 188 samples provided by 10 patients. We identified 40 metabolic decompensation episodes (22 only with ketosis and 18 with hyperammonemia). Plasma glutamine and alanine levels were reduced during these metabolic crises, probably indicating deficiency of anaplerosis (p < 0.001 for both alanine and glutamine). Hypocitrulllinemia and hypoprolinemia were also detected during hyperammonemia (p < 0.001 and 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The amino acid profile detected during decompensation episodes suggests deficient anaplerosis from propionyl-CoA and its precursors, with implications in other metabolic pathways like synthesis of urea cycle amino acids and ammonia detoxification.  aPublisher supplied data  aCIVP17A2827cFundación Ramón Areces 3aalanine 3aamino acid composition 3aammonia 3aglutamine 3ahospitals 3ainherited metabolic diseases 3aketosis 3amalonyl coenzyme A 3amitochondria 3aobservational studies 3apathophysiology 3apropionyl-CoA carboxylase 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aurea cycle 3aSpain1 aBelanger-Quintana, Amaya1 aFernandez-Felix, Borja Manuel1 aRuiz-Sala, Pedro1 adel Valle, Mercedes1 aGarcía, Fernando,1 aArrieta, Francisco1 aMartinez-Pardo, Mercedes0 tAmino acids.g2022 May, v. 54, no. 5 p.777-786dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-022-03128-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008600168520165100254592002801905650001901933650001701952650001601969650001201985650001701997650001302014650003102027650001902058650002102077650001102098650002202109650002602131650001902157650002002176653001602196653001802212653001702230700001802247773010602265856008502371852000902456655001202465IND60676216920221118182840.0191220e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067621692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2019.1263742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalwan, Richa10aMolecular and biotechnological aspects of secondary metabolites in actinobacteria  aThe ability to produce plethora of secondary metabolites and enzymes for pharmaceutical, agricultural and biotechnological applications make actinobacteria one of the most explored microbes among prokaryotes. The secondary metabolites and lytic enzymes of actinobacteria are known for their role in various physiological, cellular and biological processes including environmental sensing, mineral acquisition and recycling, and establishing social communication. In addition, the basic scaffold of secondary metabolties derived from actinobacteria is a source of inspiration for chemists. Recent development in “gene to metabolites” and “metabolites to gene” based omics technologies have played major role in revealing the prevalence of silent gene clusters in the genome of actinobacteria. Moreover, the development in precision-based genome editing tools and use of artificial gene operon for pathway engineering have emerged as a key player in activation of these silent/cryptic gene clusters for novel metabolites at large scale which were previously found to be poorly expressed and difficult to characterize in lab conditions. The access to diverse uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters of different types and the leverage of modern gene editing tools for modulated expression of the operons would contribute to novel product discovery and product diversification compared to traditional way of mining metabolites. Here, in review article, we have discussed the taxonomic status, genomic potential of actinobacteria for various secondary metabolites and role of genetic engineering to explore these microbes for human welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3abiosynthesis 3aengineering 3aenzymes 3agene editing 3agenomics 3alaboratory experimentation 3amicroorganisms 3amultigene family 3aoperon 3aprokaryotic cells 3asecondary metabolites 3asocial welfare 3asynthetic genes 0aMetabolites 0aGenome mining 0aGene cluster1 aSharma, Vivek0 tMicrobiological research.g2020 Jan., v. 231 p.126374-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2019.1263743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014500172300001600317520111000333592002801443650001901471650002101490650001601511650001401527650002301541650001801564650001601582650001401598650001401612650001301626650001001639650001601649650001801665650001501683651001001698651001301708653001601721653001301737653002401750653002301774653001501797700001901812700002201831700001901853700002001872700002101892773010101913856008702014852000902101655001202110IND60593111620221118025749.0190516e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059311162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.03.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRustioni, Laura10aUtilization of a freeze-thaw treatment to enhance phenolic ripening and tannin oxidation of grape seeds in red (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars  ap. 139-146.  aPhenolic ripening represents a major interest for quality wine producers. Nevertheless, climatic or genotypical limitations can often prevent optimal maturation process. During winemaking seeds can be easily separated and technologically processed to improve their quality. Relying on the key role of oxidation for phenolic ripening, a freeze-thaw treatment was proposed to improve the fruit quality for potential use in challenging growing conditions. The experiment was carried on in two distinctive viticultural areas, Michigan and Italy. Five cultivars (Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot noir and Chambourcin) and six cultivars (Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Syrah, Croatina, Barbera and Nebbiolo) were used in Michigan and Italy, respectively. Samples were collected at different phenological stages, to describe the natural ripening process and grape seeds were characterized before and after a freeze-thaw treatment. Colorimetric and spectrophotometric data highlighted similarities among natural and artificial seed ripening promising future applications for the wine industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aartificial seeds 3acolorimetry 3acultivars 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afruit quality 3agrape seeds 3aoxidation 3aphenology 3aripening 3aseeds 3aviticulture 3awine industry 3awinemaking 3aItaly 3aMichigan 0aViticulture 0aOenology 0aArtificial ripening 0aSuboptimal climate 0aWinemaking1 aCola, Gabriele1 aVanderWeide, Josh1 aMurad, Patrick1 aFailla, Osvaldo1 aSabbatini, Paolo0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 259 p.139-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.03.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013000169520225000299592002802549650001402577650001302591650002902604650001202633650001502645650001402660650003502674650001102709650001402720650001402734650001502748650001702763650002802780650002102808650001802829653003102847653004102878653002002919653003202939700001902971700001702990700001603007700001703023773011303040856008603153852000903239655001203248IND60737772220221120065256.0211017e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073777222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1273982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xiaowen10aVisual platform for water quality prediction and pre-warning of drinking water source area in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area  aWater, an essential resource in the ecosystem, is the basis for the survival of life on earth and determines the destiny of mankind. To deal with water resources problems, water quality prediction models and pre-warning platforms have become important means of water resources safety monitoring and essential guarantee for sustainable development in the world today. Since the Three Gorges Reservoir Area has many drinking water source areas, the water quality prediction and early warning platform should be developed, through this way the drinking water safety of the reservoir area can be guaranteed. In this study, a new two-dimensional water quality prediction sub-model was developed by processing and integrating two-dimensional water quality and quantity control equation and digital elevation model (DEM) through Geographic Information System (GIS) platform and FORTRAN language. Meanwhile, the Three Gorges Reservoir Area water quality warning sub-model was constructed, on the basis of the current situation of hydrology and water quality in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), then it combined with the water quality prediction sub-model (after processing by TecPlot 360), a visual platform was developed for the prediction and warning of drinking water quality in the reservoir area. To verify the accuracy and applicability of the platform, the predicted values of various pollutants were compared with the measured values and it was applied to predict and warn hexavalent chromium pollution accident. Under the assumed accident conditions, the pollutants were mainly concentrated on the side of the pollution source for diffusion, and that the migration rate of pollutants was positively correlated with the water level and quantity. The duration of pollution accidents in the four water periods was 31 min in drought period, 28 min in decline period, 25 min in storage period and 24 min in flood period. The results showed that the platform was feasible in operation, and the prediction and pre-warning of pollution accidents were scientific. This research provided a new tool for drinking water management, guaranteed water quality safety and people's health in the reservoir region and achieved sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3achromium 3adigital elevation models 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aequations 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3apollution 3aprediction 3astorage time 3asustainable development 3awater management 3awater quality 0aDrinking water source area 0aWater quality prediction and warning 0aVisual platform 0aThree gorges reservoir area1 aDong, Xinsheng1 aHou, Baodeng1 aFan, Guohua1 aZhang, Xinyi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 309 p.127398-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1273983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013300173520190700306592002802213650002002241650001302261650002802274650001402302650002102316650001602337650002302353650001902376650001902395650002002414650001002434650001102444650002102455650001802476650001902494650001402513650001002527650001302537650001402550653002502564653000902589653001802598653001102616653000802627653000902635653000802644653000902652653000802661653000802669653000802677653001002685700006602695700002402761700006402785773009402849856008502943852000903028655001203037IND60676217020221118182654.0191214e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067621702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1531332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradubyat, Nalinee10aNADPH: Quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) mediated anti-cancer effects of plumbagin in endocrine resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells  aPLB is a natural naphthoquinone compound isolated from the roots of Plumbago indica plant. Our previous study reported the inhibitory effect of Plumbagin (PLB) on human endocrine resistant breast cancer cell growth and cell invasion.Since PLB is a naphthoquinone compound, it can be reduced by the cytosolic NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) enzyme. NQO1 expression is upregulated in various types of aggressive cancer including breast cancer. This study investigated the impact of NQO1 on anti-cancer effects of PLB in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells.This study was an in vitro study using ER-positive cell line (MCF7) and endocrine-resistant cell lines (MCF7/LCC2 and MCF7/LCC9 cells).The roles of NQO1 in anti-cancer activity of PLB were investigated by using NQO1 knockdown cells, NQO1 inhibitor and NQO1 overexpressed cells. To study the impact of NQO1 on the effects of PLB on cell viability, apoptosis, invasion and generation of ROS, the following assays were used: MTT assays, annexin V-PE/7-ADD staining flow cytometry, matrigel invasion assays and DCFHDA assays. To study the mechanism of how NQO1 mediated PLB effects in tamoxifen response and apoptosis, we assessed the levels of mRNA expression by using qRT-PCR.1. In this study, NQO1 was upregulated in endocrine-resistant cells.2. PLB did not change the expression of NQO1 but it was able to increase NQO1 activity.3. The inhibitory effects of PLB on cell proliferation, cell invasion and expression of tamoxifen resistant gene were attenuated in NQO1 knockdown cells or in the presence of NQO1 inhibitor.4. The effects of PLB to induce apoptosis and generate ROS were also decreased when NQO1 activity was inhibited or when the NQO1 expression was reduced.5. The anti-cancer effects of PLB increased when NQO1 was upregulated.The effects of PLB in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells is dependent on NQO1’s activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aPlumbago 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aplumbagin 3aroots 3astaining 3atamoxifen 0aEndocrine resistance 0aNqo1 0aBreast cancer 0aDCFHDA 0aDIC 0aDMSO 0aFBS 0aHPLC 0aMEM 0aPLB 0aROS 0a7-AAD1 aSakunrangsit, Nithidol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1759-59741 aMutirangura, Apiwat1 aKetchart, Wannarasmi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1215-57500 tPhytomedicine.g2020 Jan., v. 66 p.153133-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1531333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012400205300001600329520161200345592002801957650002501985650002102010650003002031650002302061650001302084650002002097650002002117650001802137650002002155650002502175650001202200650000902212650002102221650000702242650001302249650001902262650001902281650001902300650001602319700002002335700002102355700001802376773010302394856008302497852000902580655001202589IND60779205120221116144312.0220605e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077920512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-022-03133-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOikawa, Tadao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1835-668110aFirst enzymological characterization of selenocysteine β-lyase from a lactic acid bacterium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides  ap. 787-798.  aWe succeeded in expressing selenocysteine β-lyase (SCL) from a lactic acid bacterium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides LK-151 (Lm-SCL), in the soluble fractions of Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) using a novel expression vector of pET21malb constructed by ourselves that has both maltose binding protein (MBP)- and 6 × His-tag. Lm-SCL acted on L-selenocysteine, L-cysteine, and L-cysteine sulfinic acid but showed a high preference for L-selenocysteine. The kcₐₜ and kcₐₜ/Kₘ values of Lm-SCL were determined to be 108 (min⁻¹) and 42.0 (min⁻¹・mM⁻¹), respectively, and this was enough catalytic efficiency to suggest that Lm-SCL might also be involved in supplying elemental selenium from L-selenocysteine to selenoproteins like other SCLs. The optimum temperature and optimum pH of Lm-SCL were determined to be 37 °C and pH 6.5, respectively. Lm-SCL was stable at 37–45 °C and pH 6.5–7.5. Lm-SCL was completely inhibited by the addition of hydroxylamine, semicarbazide, and iodoacetic acid. The enzyme activity of Lm-SCL was decreased in the presence of various metal ions, especially Cu²⁺. The quaternary structure of Lm-SCL is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 47.5 kDa. The similarity of the primary structure of Lm-SCL to other SCLs from Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, humans, or mouse was calculated to be 47.0, 48.0, 12.5, or 24.0%, respectively. Unlike Ec-SCL, our mutational and molecular docking simulation studies revealed that C362 of Lm-SCL might also catalyze the deselenation of L-selenocysteine in addition to the desulfuration of L-cysteine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrobacter freundii 3aEscherichia coli 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3acatalytic activity 3acysteine 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic vectors 3ahydroxylamine 3aiodoacetic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3amaltose 3amice 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aselenium 3aselenocysteine 3aselenoproteins 3asulfinic acids 3atemperature1 aOkajima, Kouhei1 aYamanaka, Kazuya1 aKatō, Shiro,0 tAmino acids.g2022 May, v. 54, no. 5 p.787-798dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-022-03133-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01882naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011900161300001800280520065300298592002800951650002200979650001001001650002601011650001001037650001901047650001101066650001501077650004301092650005201135651001001187700001401197700001501211700001901226700001801245700001601263773011501279856008101394852000901475655001201484IND60596494420221120050931.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059649442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-018-3773-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fan10aEstablishment of a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for rapid identification of H6 subtype avian influenza viruses  ap. 1671-1675.  aThe H6 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) possess the capacity for zoonotic transmission from avian species to humans.

This limits our ability to understand the effects of global and local stressors and to predict future trends under ongoing environmental change, which in turn hinders conservation actions. Cystoseira species develop important forest‐like assemblages along the sublittoral zone in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study we investigated the natural population dynamics and resilience patterns of a deep‐water brown and canopy‐forming macroalga, Cystoseira zosteroides. We used density‐dependent and stochastic matrix models to estimate its basic life‐history and compare it with other relevant habitat‐forming marine (brown algae) and terrestrial (plants) species. We also evaluated the consequences of increasing the disturbances caused by storms and the impact of lost fishing gear, and their interaction, on C. zosteroides population dynamics. The population dynamics of C. zosteroides showed similar patterns to terrestrial long‐lived species such as shrubs and trees, with high survival due to their investment in structural biomass. Our data and models suggest that this species is able to buffer mortality pulses by increasing the number of recruits (and probably recruit survival) due to the new space liberated and, therefore, lower intraspecific competition. Nevertheless, when storm disturbances were more frequent than once every 50 years, their populations collapsed, and this effect worsened when several stressors acted simultaneously. Our results improve our understanding about the demography of algal forests, and highlight the fact that increases in local and global stressors may erode the resilience of macroalgae, resulting in a loss of structural complexity in the benthic communities of temperate seas. Synthesis. Our findings reveal that deep‐water C. zosteroides forests display slow population dynamics, similar to terrestrial perennials and trees. The increase in disturbance frequencies due to global and local stressors and their interaction will cause the decline of underwater macroalgal forests and may induce profound changes in their population and community dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCystoseira 3aaquacultural and fisheries equipment 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3ademography 3aforests 3aintraspecific competition 3akelp forests 3alife history 3amacroalgae 3amodels 3amortality 3aperennials 3apopulation dynamics 3ashrubs 3astorms 3atrees 3aMediterranean Sea1 aHereu, Bernat1 aRiera, Juan Lluís1 aLinares, Cristina0 tjournal of ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 104, no. 6 p.1799-1808dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.126253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002000161245009200181300001600273500000900289500001500298520201000313592002802323650002702351650002102378650002302399650001102422650001502433650002002448650002002468650001802488650001602506650001002522650001602532650001902548650001902567650002502586650001602611650001502627650001202642651001202654653001202666653001602678700001802694700001802712773012002730852000902850856009802859655001202957IND2201763720221117201353.0191122e199905  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220176372DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900030025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrenholm, L.

Reflectance of narrow wavelength ranges as well as ratios of different ranges have been highly correlated with absorbency of photosynthetically active radiation, leaf area index (LAI), and plant response to stresses. The objectives of this research were to determine if data obtained by multispectral radiometry might accurately correlate with qualitative data (used as rapid estimates of color, density, and uniformity) typically used in turfgrass research. Furthermore, it was our objective to determine whether multispectral radiometry could discriminate between stressed and nonstressed turfgrass plots. This research was conducted in two consecutive trials during 1997 on seven seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum Swartz) ecotypes and three hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. × C. trunsvaalensis Burtt-Davy) cultivars established on a native Appling (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludult) soil at the University of Georgia Experiment Station in Griffin, GA. Reflectance at 661 and 813 nm, as well as the ratios normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, computed as R₉₃₅- R₆₆₁/R₉₃₅ + R₆₆₁), infrared/red (IRIR) (LAI, computed as R₉₃₅/R₆₆₁), Stress1 (R706/R760 nd Stress2 (R706/R813) were highly correlated with visual turf quality, shoot density, and shoot tissue injury (STI) ratings, but not with shoot clipping growth. Regression analysis also indicated very strong associations with each of these qualitative variables, but not with shoot growth data. Additionally, spectral measurements at all wavelengths except 559 and 706 nm were able to consistently distinguish between wear-treated and untreated plots. This methodology may have applications in both turfgrass research and management to provide quantitative measures with physiological significance to traditional visual qualitative estimates of shoot aspects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon transvaalensis 3aCynodon dactylon 3aPaspalum vaginatum 3ashoots 3aradiometry 3alight intensity 3aleaf area index 3aplant density 3ameasurement 3acolor 3awavelengths 3aabiotic stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aqualitative analysis 3areflectance 3avegetation 3adensity 3aGeorgia 0aCynodon 0amethodology1 aCarrow, R.

The changes in the volatile compounds of onions were assessed comparing results observed while measured immediately and 24 h after PEF treatment using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). Significant increases in the concentrations of propanethial S-oxide, propenyl propyl thiosulfinate, 2-methyl-2-pentenal, dipropyl disulfide, propenyl propyl disulfide, methyl propyl disulfide, and methyl propenyl disulfide were observed immediately after PEF treatment. The concentrations of propenyl propyl thiosulfinate, dipropyl disulfide, methyl propyl disulfide, dipropyl trisulfide, methyl propyl trisulfide, and propenyl propyl trisulfide increased after 24 h compared to initial concentrations. It is postulated that these changes are due to PEF-induced cell permeabilisation that facilitates enzyme-substrate reactions after the PEF treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAllium cepa 3aAllium fistulosum 3acultivars 3adisulfides 3aenzyme substrates 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aonions 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3apulsed electric fields 3asolid phase microextraction 3avolatile compounds1 aEyres, Graham  T.1 aBurritt, David J.,1 aKebede, Biniam1 aLeus, Michelle1 aOey, Indrawati0 tFoods.g2018 Nov. 07, v. 7, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods71101833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015700164300001800321520149400339592002801833650000801861650001901869650002201888650003301910650002801943650001101971650002501982650001002007650002702017650001302044650002402057650004302081650001502124651000902139700002702148700002002175700002102195700002002216700002902236700002602265700002002291700002102311700001902332773011502351856008102466852000902547655001202556IND60596494620221120051022.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059649462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-018-3740-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTajik, Zahra10aDetection of HBV genome in the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Iranian HBsAg negative patients with HIV infection: occult HBV infection  ap. 1559-1566.  aThe presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in the absence of traceable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the plasma specimen of patients is defined as occult HBV infection (OBI). This study aimed to detect HBV-DNA in the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Iranian HBsAg negative patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 172 patients with HIV infection from September 2015 to August 2017. The patients were tested for serological parameters (HBsAg, HBcAb, HBeAg and HBeAb) against HBV infection. Moreover, they were tested for HBV viral load (using COBAS TaqMan 48 Kit, Roche, USA) in plasma and the presence of the HBV genome in PBMC specimens using real-time PCR. The mean age of the patients was 35.4 ± 13.4 years. Of the 172 studied patients, 109 (63.4%) were male. In this study, 151 (87.8%) patients were negative for HBsAg, 111 (64.5%) patients were negative for all HBV infection serological markers, 9 (5.2%) patients were only positive for HBsAg and 29 (16.9%) patients were only positive for HBcAb. Moreover, five (3.3%) patients with HBsAg negative had OBI (in the plasma sample of four patients and PBMC specimens of all five patients, HBV-DNA was detected). The present study revealed that 3.3% of the patients with HIV infection had occult HBV infection. Presumably, designing prospective studies to identify this infection in patients with HIV infection is informative and valuable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHIV infections 3aHepatitis B virus 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3across-sectional studies 3agenome 3ahepatitis B antigens 3amales 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apatients 3aprospective studies 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviral load 3aIran1 aBokharaei-Salim, Farah1 aGhorbani, Saied1 aKeyvani, Hossein1 aEsghaei, Maryam1 aMonavari, SeyedHamidreza1 aAtaei-Pirkooh, Angila1 aGarshasbi, Saba1 aDonyavi, Tahereh1 aFakhim, Atousa0 tArchives of virology.g2018 June, v. 163, no. 6 p.1559-1566dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3740-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014200168520157900310592002801889650002301917650002301940650002301963650002001986650001602006650002102022650001502043650001502058650001202073651001002085653001702095653001602112653002202128653003202150653002602182653001902208700001202227700001902239773011002258856008702368852000902455655001202464IND60676217320221118182655.0200117e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067621732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.1038542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lian14aThe effects of carrier, benefit, and perceived trust in information channel on functional food purchase intention among Chinese consumers  aThe importance of consumers’ perceptions and adoption behavior has been recognized in the development of functional food innovation, but the issues have not been widely explored in China. This study aimed to examine the effects of carrier, benefit, and trust in information channel about functional foods on purchase intention as well as the demographic differences of these effects. A survey with 1144 respondents from Mainland China revealed that carriers were more important factors than benefits for perceived attractiveness and purchase intention. Benefits were more positively evaluated when attached to a more attractive carrier. Benefits of improving the body’s natural defense system were most favored by all groups; benefits about specific diseases were suitable to tailor for certain groups. Consumers with low educational level were reluctant to functional foods. The improvement of consumer education level does not necessarily increase the consumers’ purchase intention. Given the Chinese acquaintance society and the jeopardized public trust in food safety, the interpersonal channel was the most trusted information channel. However, perceived trust in mass media had more remarkable effects in predicting purchase intention toward functional foods, the typical products with credence attributes. Trust in mass media negatively interacted with friends’ recommendation in affecting purchase intention. These findings extend our understanding of how to tailor products for different groups and the effects of information channels on purchase intention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer education 3aeducational status 3afood purchasing 3afood safety 3afunctional foods 3amass media 3aprediction 3asurveys 3aChina 0aHealth claim 0aFood choice 0aConsumer behavior 0aInnovation diffusion theory 0aConsumer segmentation 0aMainland China1 aBai, Li1 aGong, Shunlong0 tFood quality and preference.g2020 Apr., v. 81 p.103854-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.1038543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245015900161300001800320520109700338592002801435650001501463650001501478650002301493650002801516650002501544650001301569650001101582650001401593650001401607653003001621653003701651653002201688653002301710653003201733653002501765700005901790700002401849700002201873700001801895700001701913700005801930700001801988773013902006856007802145852000902223655001202232IND60683224320200401000000.0200207e20200108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068322432DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b189062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaah, Marian10aElectrical, Transport, and Optical Properties of Multifunctional Graphitic Films Synthesized on Dielectric Surfaces by Nickel Nanolayer-Assisted Pyrolysis  ap. 6226-6233.  aWe demonstrate that predepositing a nanometrically thin nickel film on a dielectric surface is sufficient to transform an amorphous pyrolyzed photoresist film (PPF) into a graphitic film (GRF) enriched with nickel particles. The GRF shows 3 orders of magnitude higher carrier mobility than the amorphous PPF, whereas its electrical conductivity doubles after etching away the nickel remains. The pronounced 2D peak in the Raman spectrum, almost dispersionless absorbance in the spectral range of 750–2000 nm, and the saturable absorption coefficient indicate that GRF possesses a graphene-like band structure. The proposed cost-efficient and scalable synthesis route opens avenues toward fabrication of micron size patterned graphitic structures of any shape directly on a dielectric substrate. Having graphene-like transport and electrical properties at 20 times higher absorbance than the single-layer graphene, GRF is attractive for fabrication of fast modulators for optical radiation, bolometers, and other photonics and optoelectronic devices that require enhanced optical absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectronic equipment 3agraphene 3anickel 3aphotonics 3apyrolysis 0agraphitic thin film (GRF) 0apyrolyzed photoresist film (PPF) 0adirect deposition 0aoptical properties 0aelectrical characterization 0atransport properties1 aObraztsov, Petr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4696-81431 aPaddubskaya, Alesia1 aBiciunas, Andrius1 aSuvanto, Sari1 aSvirko, Yuri1 aKuzhir, Polina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3689-08371 aKaplas, Tommi0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 08, v. 12, no. 5 p.6226-6233dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b189063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013200169520138200301592002801683650004401711650001001755650001501765650002901780650002801809650003901837650001601876650001601892650001701908650001301925650001501938650001901953650001601972653001501988653001902003653001302022700001202035700001502047700001602062700001402078700001602092773011902108856008802227852000902315655001202324IND60678286520221120034445.0200128e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067828652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1346232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yajun10aEffect of bean dregs amendment on the organic matter degradation, humification, maturity and stability of pig manure composting  aThe purpose of this study was to effectively dispose of bean dregs (BD) using composting technology, which could provide a theoretical basis for the disposal of BD. Therefore, the influence of different quantities of bean dregs (BD) (0%, 5%, 10% and 15%, w/w with a dry base of pig manure (PM)) on the decomposition and humification of organic matter during PM-composting was investigated, and a 0% BD amendment was used as the control (CK). Wheat straw was used as a bulking agent. Compared to the CK, the BD amendment promoted the degradation of organic matter. The degree of organic matter degradation increased by 16.46–25.04% upon BD amendment. Furthermore, the BD amendment improved humification and increased indices of the humification ratio (HR), percentage of humic acids (PHA), degree of polymerization (DP) and the humification index (HI). Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that the aromatic structure was enhanced with the BD amendment, and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra showed increased humic-like substance production. Additionally, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), germination index (GI), electrical conductivity (Ec) and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) influenced the maturity and stability of composting. Comparatively, a 10% BD addition showed the optimal performance among all PM-composting treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeans 3acomposting 3adissolved organic carbon 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agermination 3ahumic acids 3ahumification 3anitrogen 3apig manure 3apolymerization 3awheat straw 0aBean dregs 0aOrganic matter 0aMaturity1 aDu, Wei1 aRen, Xiuna1 aCui, Ziying1 aZhou, Wei1 aLv, Jialong0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 708 p.134623-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1346233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245010400204506007600308520152000384592002801904506003701932650001101969650001101980650001001991650001202001650001302013650002202026650002402048650002402072650002602096650001602122650002702138650001402165650001602179650002002195650003202215650002202247650001702269650001302286651001702299651001002316700002702326700002102353700002602374773011902400856007602519852000902595655001202604IND60648050120221207142404.0190626e20181209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064805012DNAL7 a10.3390/foods71202022doi7 aPMC63069082pmcid7 a305448582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera, Mailing 12aA Microethnographic and Ethnobotanical Approach to Llayta Consumption among Andes Feeding Practices  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLlayta is a dietary supplement that has been used by rural communities in Per&uacute; and northern Chile since pre-Columbian days. Llayta is the biomass of colonies of a Nostoc cyanobacterium grown in wetlands of the Andean highlands, harvested, sun-dried and sold as an ingredient for human consumption. The biomass has a substantial content of essential amino acids (58% of total amino acids) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (33% total fatty acids). This ancestral practice is being lost and the causes were investigated by an ethnographic approach to register the social representations of Llayta, to document how this Andean feeding practice is perceived and how much the community knows about Llayta. Only 37% of the participants (mostly adults) have had a direct experience with Llayta; other participants (mostly children) did not have any knowledge about it. These social responses reflect anthropological and cultural tensions associated with a lack of knowledge on Andean algae, sites where to find Llayta, where it is commercialized, how it is cooked and on its nutritional benefits. The loss of this ancestral feeding practice, mostly in northern Chile, is probably associated with cultural changes, migration of the rural communities, and very limited access to the available information. We propose that Llayta consumption can be revitalized by developing appropriate educational strategies and investigating potential new food derivatives based on the biomass from the isolated Llayta cyanobacterium.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNostoc 3aadults 3aalgae 3abiomass 3achildren 3acommercialization 3adietary supplements 3aeducational methods 3aessential amino acids 3aethnobotany 3afatty acid composition 3ahighlands 3aingredients 3anutritive value 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arural communities 3asolar drying 3awetlands 3aAndes region 3aChile1 aGaletović, Alexandra 1 aLicuime, Romina 1 aGómez-Silva, Benito 0 tFoods.g2018 Dec. 09, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods71202023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245014000170300001800310520088700328592002801215650001501243650001901258650002201277650001401299650002301313650001901336650001101355650002601366650003001392650001301422650001301435650001401448650001101462653001901473653002501492653002801517653002601545653002301571700005701594700002401651700002401675700001801699700002101717700001901738700002101757700002601778700002201804700005701826700005901883700006301942700005802005700006202063773013902125856007802264852000902342655001202351IND60683224520221121044843.0200207e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068322452DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b189242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Riccardis, Alberto10aHeterogenized Pyridine-Substituted Cobalt(II) Phthalocyanine Yields Reduction of CO₂ by Tuning the Electron Affinity of the Co Center  ap. 5251-5258.  aConversion of CO₂ to reduced products is a promising route to alleviate irreversible climate change. Here we report the synthesis of a Co-based phthalocyanine with pyridine moieties (CoPc-Pyr), which is supported on a carbon electrode and shows Faradaic efficiency ∼90% for CO at 490 mV of overpotential (−0.6 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). In addition, its catalytic activity at −0.7 V versus RHE surpasses other Co-based molecular and metal–organic framework catalysts for CO₂ reduction at this bias. Density functional theory calculations show that pyridine moieties enhance CO₂ adsorption and electron affinity of the Co center by an inductive effect, thus lowering the overpotential necessary for CO₂ conversion. Our study shows that CoPc-Pyr reduces CO₂ at lower overpotential and with higher activity than noble metal electrodes, such as silver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon electrodes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aclimate change 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen 3amoieties 3apyridines 3asilver 0aphthalocyanine 0aCO2 electroreduction 0aheterogenized catalysis 0aelectronic properties 0amolecular catalyst1 aLee, Michelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5341-42611 aKazantsev, Roman V.1 aGarza, Alejandro J.1 aZeng, Guosong1 aLarson, David M.1 aClark, Ezra L.1 aLobaccaro, Peter1 aBurroughs, Paul W.

(2020) recently published “How robust are reductions in modeled estimates from GTAP-BIO of the indirect land use change induced by conventional biofuels?“, provided their narrative from the model improvements in GTAP-BIO over time, made several critical points regarding this model, and argued that the implemented improvements in this model tended to decrease Induce Land Use Changes (ILUC) emissions. They also provided several critical points regarding the Carbon Calculator for Land Use Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB) emissions model. In this response to Malins et al. we address these critiques point-by-point by providing our detailed responses to key issues: 1) the GTAP-BIO model and its improvements over time; 2) the inclusion of cropland pasture in the model; 3) the observed land use changes in the US that have been the bases for improvements in GTAP-BIO model, 4) the time trends in corn price and yield to challenge the concept of the yield to price response; 5) some sources of land intensification in crop production; 6) the FAO notifications with respect to the comparison between harvested area and arable land; and 7) the GTAP-BIO results for multiple cropping. We also provided responses to Malins et al. critical points regarding the CCLUB emissions model. We hope that this response letter will open more constructive discussion among the LUC modeling community to remain focused on the big picture regarding agriculture's role as a very effective GHG mitigation tool that can shape the new policies to govern the production and consumption of biofuels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarable soils 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3acorn 3acrop production 3acropland 3aland use change 3amodels 3apastures 3apollution control 3aprices1 aMueller, S.1 aKwon, H.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 310 p.127431-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1274313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010500168300001600273500002000289520160600309592002801915650002601943650001301969650001901982650002602001650002302027650001702050650001502067650001802082650001102100650001702111650002202128650002602150650001302176700002202189700003102211700001702242700002702259700002002286700002202306773010102328856007902429852000902508655001202517IND60571315220221121192057.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057131522DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.126642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDescombes, Patrice10aCommunity‐level plant palatability increases with elevation as insect herbivore abundance declines  ap. 142-151.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlants protect themselves against herbivore attacks through a myriad of physical structures and toxic secondary metabolites. Together with abiotic factors, herbivores are expected to modulate plant defence strategies within plant assemblages. Because the abundance of insect herbivore decreases in colder environments, the palatability of plants in communities at higher elevation should shift in response to both abiotic and biotic factors. We inventoried grasshopper communities to document changes in herbivore abundance along elevation gradients and quantified associated shifts in plant palatability. We measured plant palatability by measuring the growth of Spodoptera littoralis generalist caterpillars fed with the leaves of 172 plant species. We related plant palatability to leaf traits and elevation at the species and community levels. In congruence with the decrease in grasshopper abundance with elevation, we found that the mean palatability level of plant communities increases with elevation. In addition, plant palatability was negatively associated with the community‐weighted mean of leaf dry matter content. At the species level, plants with high carbon‐to‐nitrogen ratio were less palatable, while we found no effect of species mean elevation on plant palatability. Synthesis. Our results suggest that plant communities at higher elevation are composed of species that are generally more palatable for insect herbivores. Shift in plant palatability with elevation may thus be the outcome of a relaxation of the in situ herbivore pressure and changes in abiotic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aaltitude 3abiotic factors 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adry matter content 3agrasshoppers 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3aleaves 3apalatability 3aplant communities 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxicity1 aMarchon, Jérémy1 aPradervand, Jean‐Nicolas1 aBilat, Julia1 aGuisan, A.q(Antoine),1 aRasmann, Sergio1 aPellissier, Loïc0 tjournal of ecology.g2017 Jan., v. 105, no. 1 p.142-151dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.126643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245011200173520182200285592002802107650002802135650001902163650002502182650001302207650001302220650001702233650001002250650001702260650001002277650000702287653001502294653001302309653002202322653001802344653002202362653001302384700001602397700001702413700001502430700001602445700001802461700002302479700001802502700001902520700001202539700002602551773010702577856009102684852000902775655001202784IND60679011220221121193035.0220523e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067901122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1197012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Haijun10aStructure-based design of charge-conversional drug self-delivery systems for better targeted cancer therapy  aVarious design and fabrication strategies of carrier-based drug delivery systems have been quickly established and applied for cancer therapy in recent years. These systems contribute greatly to current cancer treatments but further development needs to be made to eliminate obstacles such as low drug loading capacity and severe side effects. To achieve better drug delivery, we propose an innovative strategy for the construction of easy manufactured drug self-delivery systems based on molecular structures, which can be used for the co-delivery of curcuminoids and all the nitrogen-containing derivatives of camptothecin for better targeted cancer therapy with minimized side effects. The formation mechanism investigation demonstrates that the rigid planar structures of camptothecin derivatives and curcuminoids with relevant leaving hydrogens make it possible for them to be assembled into nanoparticles under suitable conditions. These nanoparticles show stabilized particle sizes (100 nm) under various conditions and tunable surface charges which increase from around −10 mV in a normal physiological condition (pH 7.4) to +40 mV under acidic tumor environments. In addition, in vivo mice experiments have demonstrated that, compared to irinotecan (a derivative of camptothecin) itself, the co-delivered irinotecan curcumin nanoparticles exhibited significantly enhanced lung and gallbladder targeting, improved macrophage-clearance escape and ameliorated colorectal cancer treatment with an eradication of life-threatening diarrhea, bringing hope for better targeted chemotherapy and clinical translation. Lastly, the strategy of structure based design of drug self-delivery systems may inspire more research and discoveries of similar self-delivered nano systems for wider pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acancer therapy 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acurcumin 3adiarrhea 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3agall bladder 3alungs 3apH 0aIrinotecan 0aCurcumin 0aCharge conversion 0aSelf-delivery 0aTargeting therapy 0aDiarrhea1 aGuo, Yiping1 aLiu, Hongmei1 aLiu, Yushi1 aWang, Yumin1 aLi, Changqing1 aCísař, Jaroslav,1 aŠkoda, David1 aKuřitka, Ivo,1 aGuo, Li1 aSedlařík, Vladimír0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Feb., v. 232 p.119701-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1197013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245011500205300001800320506007600338520019000414520124900604592002801853506003701881650001601918650001001934650001401944650001801958650002501976700002002001700002202021700002002043700002002063700002502083700001602108700001402124700002302138700001702161700002102178700002902199700001602228700001802244700002302262700002602285700002002311700002002331773010802351856007802459852000902537655001202546IND60171848020221207105307.0150602e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017184802DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.114.1351602doi7 aPMC45586902pmcid7 a259010852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaha, Debabrata10aVIH2 Regulates the Synthesis of Inositol Pyrophosphate InsP₈ and Jasmonate-Dependent Defenses in Arabidopsis  ap. 1082-1097.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe inositol pyrophosphate InsP ₈ plays an important role in plant defenses against herbivorous insects and necrotrophic fungi and is a key cofactor of the jasmonate receptor complex.  aDiphosphorylated inositol polyphosphates, also referred to as inositol pyrophosphates, are important signaling molecules that regulate critical cellular activities in many eukaryotic organisms, such as membrane trafficking, telomere maintenance, ribosome biogenesis, and apoptosis. In mammals and fungi, two distinct classes of inositol phosphate kinases mediate biosynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates: Kcs1/IP6K- and Vip1/PPIP5K-like proteins. Here, we report that PPIP5K homologs are widely distributed in plants and that Arabidopsis thaliana VIH1 and VIH2 are functional PPIP5K enzymes. We show a specific induction of inositol pyrophosphate InsP ₈ by jasmonate and demonstrate that steady state and jasmonate-induced pools of InsP ₈ in Arabidopsis seedlings depend on VIH2. We identify a role of VIH2 in regulating jasmonate perception and plant defenses against herbivorous insects and necrotrophic fungi. In silico docking experiments and radioligand binding-based reconstitution assays show high-affinity binding of inositol pyrophosphates to the F-box protein COI1-JAZ jasmonate coreceptor complex and suggest that coincidence detection of jasmonate and InsP ₈ by COI1-JAZ is a critical component in jasmonate-regulated defenses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3afungi 3ainositols 3ajasmonic acid 3aphytophagous insects1 aJohnen, Philipp1 aAzevedo, Cristina1 aDynowski, Marek1 aWeiss, Michael,1 aCapolicchio, Samanta1 aMao, Haibin1 aIven, Tim1 aSteenbergen, Merel1 aFreyer, Marc1 aGaugler, Philipp1 ade Campos, Marília K.F.1 aZheng, Ning1 aFeussner, Ivo1 aJessen, Henning J.1 aVan Wees, Saskia C.M.1 aSaiardi, Adolfo1 aSchaaf, Gabriel0 tplant cell.g2015 Apr., v. 27, no. 4 p.1082-1097dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.114.1351603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008900170300001600259500001900275520117200294592002801466650001601494650002401510650001701534650001001551650000701561650001301568650000901581650001401590650001601604653003901620653002201659700001901681700002001700700005701720700001601777700002301793773014601816856008301962852000902045655001202054IND60700887520221119230148.0200726e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070088752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKajiura, Hiroyuki10aCharacterization of Bombyx mori N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II splicing variants  ap. 404-410.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aN-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GNTII), which catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to N-glycans, plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of branched and complex-type N-glycans. Some characteristics of the GNTIIs from various species have been identified, but not all features have been revealed because some insects have GNTII redundancies due to the possession of splicing variants. In this study, we focused on four splicing variants of silkworm Bombyx mori GNTII (BmGNTII) that differ only in the absence or presence of Exon 2, Exon 9 or both, and we characterized the spatiotemporal transcript levels and enzymatic properties of each. Two of the splicing variants, BmGNTII-B and BmGNTII-D, lack Exon 9, and were expressed more highly in silk glands than any other organs. With respect to the enzymatic properties, optimal temperature and pH were similar among the recombinant BmGNTIIs, but the specific activities and temperature stabilities differed according to the presence or absence of Exon 9 in the splicing variants. These results demonstrate that the B. mori genome encodes splicing variants of GNTII with different enzymatic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3abiosynthesis 3aexons 3apH 3aresearch 3asilk 3asilkworms 3atemperature 0aN-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase II 0aSplicing variants1 aNakamura, Yugo1 aNishimura, Mari1 aOhashi, Takao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5737-22301 aMisaki, Ryo1 aFujiyama, Kazuhito0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 529, no. 2 p.404-410dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001900185245008700204300001800291506007600309520017800385520130800563592002801871506003701899650001601936650001001952650001901962650001701981700001601998700001802014700001802032700001902050700001302069773010802082856007802190852000902268655001202277IND60171848120221207105312.0150602e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017184812DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.114.1354002doi7 aPMC45586912pmcid7 a258045402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhenzhen10aArabidopsis RIC1 Severs Actin Filaments at the Apex to Regulate Pollen Tube Growth  ap. 1140-1161.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRIC1 regulates pollen tube growth through its F-actin severing and capping activities, which contributes to the dynamics and abundance of F-actin in the tip of pollen tubes.  aPollen tubes deliver sperms to the ovule for fertilization via tip growth. The rapid turnover of F-actin in pollen tube tips plays an important role in this process. In this study, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana RIC1, a member of the ROP-interactive CRIB motif-containing protein family, regulates pollen tube growth via its F-actin severing activity. Knockout of RIC1 enhanced pollen tube elongation, while overexpression of RIC1 dramatically reduced tube growth. Pharmacological analysis indicated that RIC1 affected F-actin dynamics in pollen tubes. In vitro biochemical assays revealed that RIC1 directly bound and severed F-actin in the presence of Ca ²⁺ in addition to interfering with F-actin turnover by capping F-actin at the barbed ends. In vivo, RIC1 localized primarily to the apical plasma membrane (PM) of pollen tubes. The level of RIC1 at the apical PM oscillated during pollen tube growth. The frequency of F-actin severing at the apex was notably decreased in ric1-1 pollen tubes but was increased in pollen tubes overexpressing RIC1. We propose that RIC1 regulates F-actin dynamics at the apical PM as well as the cytosol by severing F-actin and capping the barbed ends in the cytoplasm, establishing a novel mechanism that underlies the regulation of pollen tube growth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aactin 3amicrofilaments 3apollen tubes1 aShi, Haifan1 aChen, Binqing1 aZhang, Ruihui1 aHuang, Shanjin1 aFu, Ying0 tplant cell.g2015 Apr., v. 27, no. 4 p.1140-1161dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.114.1354003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001600183245015600199506007600355520133900431592002801770506003701798650002501835650001901860650001101879650001101890650001701901650004301918650001401961650002001975650001401995650001402009650001202023650001502035651001402050700001902064700002002083700002202103773011902125856007602244852000902320655001202329IND60648050320221207142401.0190626e20181212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064805032DNAL7 a10.3390/foods71202042doi7 aPMC63068652pmcid7 a305451402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Sijing 10aImpact of Commercial Oenotannin and Mannoprotein Products on the Chemical and Sensory Properties of Shiraz Wines Made from Sequentially Harvested Fruit  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe tannin and polysaccharide profiles and therefore sensory properties of wine are influenced by fruit maturity at harvest, and practices employed during winemaking. This study investigated the extent to which commercial winemaking supplements (skin and seed tannins, and mannoprotein (MP)) can enhance the mouthfeel properties of red wine, in particular, wine made from grapes harvested before commercial ripeness (early-harvest). Supplements were added to wines made from Shiraz grapes harvested at 20.8 and 24.5 &deg;Brix. The chemical composition and mouthfeel properties of wines were then determined by high performance liquid chromatography and descriptive analysis (DA), respectively. Wines made from riper grapes had higher levels of tannin than wines made from early-harvest grapes, but similar polysaccharide levels were observed. The addition of seed oenotannin yielded higher tannin levels than addition of skin oenotannin, particularly for wines made from early-harvest grapes. The DA panel perceived sensory differences between H1 and H2 wines, but could not perceive any effect of supplementation on wine mouthfeel properties, with the exception of a minor increase in sweetness, attributed to mannoprotein addition to H1 wines, even when MP was added to wines at 2.5 times the level recommended for use in Australia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical composition 3afruit maturity 3afruits 3agrapes 3aharvest date 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amouthfeel 3apolysaccharides 3ared wines 3asweetness 3atannins 3awinemaking 3aAustralia1 aBindon, Keren 1 aBastian, Susan 1 aWilkinson, Kerry 0 tFoods.g2018 Dec. 12, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods71202043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245016200197300001800359520210600377592002802483650001702511650002602528650003102554650002202585650001402607650001802621650001402639650001402653650001002667650001202677650002502689650001702714650004002731650000902771650002102780650002902801650001502830650001702845653002602862653002002888653001802908653001802926653002202944700001902966700002002985700001403005700001603019700001903035700002103054700001503075700005503090700002103145773013903166856007803305852000903383655001203392IND60683224720221121044825.0200207e20200113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068322472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b189862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0115-907510aLocalized Controlled Release of Bilirubin from β-Cyclodextrin-Conjugated ε-Polylysine To Attenuate Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Transplanted Islets  ap. 5462-5475.  aIslet transplantation has been considered the most promising therapeutic option with the potential to restore the physiological regulation of blood glucose concentrations in type 1 diabetes treatment. However, islets suffer from oxidative stress and nonspecific inflammation in the early stage of transplantation, which attributed to the leading cause of islet graft failure. Our previous study reported that bilirubin exerted antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects on hypothermic preserved islets, which inspire us to utilize bilirubin to address the survival issue of grafted islets. However, the application of bilirubin for islet transplantation is limited by its poor solubility and fast clearance. In this study, we designed a supramolecular carrier (PLCD) that could improve the solubility of bilirubin and slowly release bilirubin to protect islets after cotransplantation. PLCD was synthesized by conjugating activated β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) to the side chain of ε-polylysine (PLL) and acted as a carrier to load bilirubin via host–guest interactions. The constructed bilirubin supramolecular system (PLCD-BR) significantly improved the solubility and prolonged the action time of bilirubin. In vitro results confirmed that PLCD-BR coculture substantially enhanced the resistance of islets to excessive oxidative stress and proinflammatory stimulation and maximumly maintained the islet function. In vivo, PLCD could prolong drug duration at the transplant site, and the localized released bilirubin could protect the islets from oxidative stress and suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines. Crucially, islet transplantation with PLCD-BR significantly extended the stable blood glucose time of diabetic mice and produced a faster glucose clearance compared to those cotransplanted with free bilirubin. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis showed that PLCD-BR had superior antioxidative and anti-inflammatory abilities and beneficial effects on angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate that the PLCD-BR has great potentials to support successful islet transplantation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal disease models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abilirubin 3ablood glucose 3acoculture 3acytokines 3adrugs 3aglucose 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3aphysiological regulation 3asolubility 3atherapeutics 0aislet transplantation 0aβ-cyclodextrin 0aε-polylysine 0aantioxidative 0aanti-inflammatory1 aHuang, Zhi-Wei1 aZhai, Yuan-Yuan1 aYue, Meng1 aLuo, Lan-Zi1 aXue, Peng-Peng1 aHan, Yŏng-hŭi,1 aXu, He-Lin1 aKou, Longfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8502-42791 aZhao, Ying-Zheng0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 13, v. 12, no. 5 p.5462-5475dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b189863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245008500153300001800238520108200256592002801338650002201366650001601388650001301404650001901417650002001436650001401456650002301470650002301493650001401516650001201530650002201542650001301564650003301577700001801610700001701628700002001645700001501665773011801680856007501798852000901873655001201882IND60549872420221121170913.0160909e20120518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054987242DNAL7 a10.1021/jo30042772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Hua10aAdded-Metal-Free Catalytic Nucleophilic Addition of Grignard Reagents to Ketones  ap. 4645-4652.  aOn the basis of the investigation of the combinational effect of quaternary ammonium salts and organic bases, an added-metal-free catalytic system for nucleophilic addition reactions of a variety of Grignard reagents to diverse ketones in THF solvent has been developed to produce tertiary alcohols in good to excellent yields. By using tetrabutylammonium chloride (NBu₄Cl) as a catalyst and diglyme (DGDE) as an additive, this system strongly enhances the efficiency of addition at the expense of enolization and reduction. NBu₄Cl should help to shift the Schlenk equilibrium of Grignard reagents to the side of dimeric Grignard reagents to favor the additions of Grignard reagents to ketones via a favored six-membered transition state to form the desired tertiary alcohols, and DGDE should increase the nucleophilic reactivities of Grignard reagents by coordination. This catalytic system has been applied in the efficient synthesis of Citalopram, an effective U.S. FDA-approved antidepressant, and a recyclable version of this catalytic synthesis has also been devised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrignard reagents 3aLewis bases 3aalcohols 3aammonium salts 3aantidepressants 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3achlorides 3aketones 3aorganic chemistry 3asolvents 3atetrabutylammonium compounds1 aHuang, Huayin1 aLiu, Junfeng1 aBian, Guangling1 aSong, Ling0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 May 18, v. 77, no. 10 p.4645-4652dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo30042773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008400168520119800252592002801450650001401478650002101492650001001513650001101523650001301534650001001547650002501557650001501582650001601597650001501613650001701628650002301645653001701668653002801685700002001713700005601733700001901789700001401808700005401822700005801876773010801934856008602042852000902128655001202137IND60679011520221121192932.0200103e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067901152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1156582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Fenghua10aApplications of chitin and chitosan nanofibers in bone regenerative engineering  aPromoting bone regeneration and repairing defects are urgent and critical challenges in orthopedic clinical practice. Research on bone substitute biomaterials is essential for improving the treatment strategies for bone regeneration. Chitin and its derivative, chitosan, are among the most abundant natural biomaterials and widely found in the shells of crustaceans. Chitin and chitosan are non-toxic, antibacterial, biocompatible, degradable, and have attracted significant attention in bone substitute biomaterials. Chitin/chitosan nanofibers and nanostructured scaffolds have large surface area to volume ratios and high porosities. These scaffolds can be fabricated by electrospinning, thermally induced phase separation and self-assembly, and are widely used in biomedical applications such as biological scaffolds, drug delivery, bacterial inhibition, and wound dressing. Recently, some chitin/chitosan-based nanofibrous scaffolds have been found structurally similar to bone’s extracellular matrix and can assist in bone regeneration. This review outlines the biomedical applications and biological properties of chitin/chitosan-based nanofibrous scaffolds in bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3abone substitutes 3abones 3achitin 3achitosan 3adrugs 3aextracellular matrix 3ananofibers 3aorthopedics 3aseparation 3asurface area 3atissue engineering 0aBiomaterials 0aBone tissue engineering1 aCheng, Yanxiang1 aShi, Xiaowen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8294-29201 aZheng, Huifeng1 aDu, Yumin1 aXiang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4443-36201 aDeng, Hongbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9784-61380 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 230 p.115658-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1156583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001200161245008000173300001600253500000900269520091200278592002801190650002301218650001301241650002501254650002401279650002401303650001501327700002001342773012001362852000901482856009801491655001201589IND2201769320221117201736.0191122e199905  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220176932DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900030041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, C.10aInfluence of Sample Size on Precision of Genetic Correlations in Red Clover  ap. 863-867.  aepub  aPrevious investigations of genetic correlation (rG)in dicate that rG is sensitive to sampling error. A nonparametric bootstrap method provides an alternative for estimating standard error and confidence intervals. Using the bootstrap method in a half-sib red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) population, we evaluated the effect of sample sizes on the point estimate, its sampling error, and confidence interval of rG. We conducted separate analyses for varying numbers of replications, families, and plants per family using a seedling data set. Precision of rG was affected by sample sizes and traits measured. To achieve a reasonable standard error and a small confidence interval of rG, a minimum of 42 half-sib families each having nine plants in four replications would be required. Although this study was limited to seedling traits in a greenhouse, similar results may occur when measuring other traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium pratense 3asampling 3astatistical analysis 3agenetic correlation 3amathematical models 3apopulation1 aMosjidis, J.

Nucleotide sequences of the entire hexon (2811 bases), penton base (1578 bases), and fiber-2 (1425 bases) genes from the Korean isolates were 97.5–99.3, 99.1–99.7, and 95.5–99.0 % identical, respectively, to those of foreign FAdV-4 isolates. In the N-terminal tail region of fiber-2, the KRP motif predicted to be the nuclear localization signal was identified in the Korean isolates, whereas KRP/A was detected in other isolates. The VYPF motif in fiber-2, which is known to interact with the penton base, was present in the same region of all FAdV-4 isolates that were compared. Amino acid variations in fiber-2 for HPS and non-HPS isolates revealed that D219 and T300 were conserved among ten HPS isolates from five countries, including Korea. T380 in fiber-2, previously found in HPS isolates, corresponded to A380 in the Korean isolates, indicating that T380 is not relevant for increased virulence. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the four Korean FAdV-4 isolates were more related to MX-SHP95, a Mexican FAdV-4 isolate of HPS origin, than to FAdV-4 isolates of Indian and Chinese origin, suggesting that the genetic relationship among FAdV-4 isolates is independent of geographic distribution. The molecular features of these genes will provide valuable information for vaccine development against HPS in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aamino acids 3achickens 3acoat proteins 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3ageographical distribution 3anuclear localization signals 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aserotypes 3avaccine development 3avirulence 3aKorean Peninsula1 aLim, Il-Soo1 aKim, Sang Kyu,1 aKim, Toh-Kyung1 aPark, Choi-Kyu1 aYeo, Sang-Geon0 tVirus genes.g2017 Feb., v. 53, no. 1 p.111-116dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1393-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245014000169520203000309592002802339650001702367650001202384650001902396650002702415650001602442650002002458650001802478650001902496650001802515650002902533650002102562650001202583650002302595650001202618650001602630650000902646650002002655650002402675650001702699653001502716653001902731653001202750653002702762700002102789700001902810700001702829773011902846856008802965852000903053655001203062IND60678287120221122233950.0200503e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067828712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1346412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jin Ho10aUnexpected high reduction of methane emission via short-term aerobic pre-digestion of green manured soils before flooding in rice paddy  aSoil organic matter (SOM) is used as an important indicator of soil quality and a countermeasure to mitigate global warming. To increase SOM stock, cover cropping and its biomass incorporation as green manure are strongly recommended in mono-rice paddy soils. However, green manure application significantly increased greenhouse gas emission, in particular, methane (CH₄) during rice cultivation, and then its simultaneous positive and negative outcome has become a serious issue. We hypothesized that the short-term aerobic pre-digestion of green manured soil under dry soil condition before flooding might degrade labile organic C into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and then reduce CH₄ production during the flooded rice cultivation period. In order to evaluate the feasibility of the short-term aerobic pre-digestion of green manured soil on reducing CH₄ emission in rice paddy, cover crop biomass was incorporated in the inner dry soil at different time intervals from 0 to 30 days before flooding, and then CH₄ and CO₂ emission rates were monitored. Over 10 days of aerobic pre-digestion significantly decreased CH₄ flux by 88–98% over the control (flooded soil without aerobic pre-digestion) during the two month’s incubation test. Similar results were observed during the field test, in which only at 10 days’ aerobic pre-digestion under dry soil condition, total CH₄ flux decreased by approximately 60% over the control. This reduction effect was slightly increased when aerobic pre-digestion period was extended. In contrast, rice productivities were not significantly different from 0 to 30 days of aerobic pre-digestion. As a result, more than 10 days of aerobic pre-digestion of green manured soil before flooding decreased CH₄ flux intensity (kg CH₄ kg⁻¹ grain) by 60% over the control. In conclusion, the short-term aerobic pre-digestion of green manured soil before flooding can be a good soil management strategy to mitigate CH₄ emission without productivity decrease in rice field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aconservation practices 3acover crops 3acrop production 3acrop rotation 3aglobal warming 3agreen manures 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amanure spreading 3amethane 3amethane production 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3arice 3asoil management 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 0aCover crop 0aGreenhouse gas 0aBiomass 0aMethane flux intensity1 aPark, Mun Hyeong1 aSong, Hyeon Ji1 aKim, Pil Joo0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 711 p.134641-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1346413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024002200175024001900197040001800216100001600234245014000250506007600390506003100466520126900497592002801766596004401794596004401838596008001882596004501962506003702007650001402044650002702058650001902085650001402104650002002118650002602138650001902164650001702183650002302200650001602223650000902239650003702248650002002285650003202305650001502337650002602352650003602378653001002414653002502424653002002449700002302469700001802492700001902510700002202529700001802551700001402569700002002583700002602603700001902629773011902648856008602767852000902853655001202862IND60676218020221215143331.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067621802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2019.1082862chorus7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2019.1082862doi7 aPMC70035502pmcid7 a319183372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuxin10atrans, trans-2,4-Decadienal, a lipid peroxidation product, induces inflammatory responses via Hsp90- or 14–3-3ζ-dependent mechanisms  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aPeroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids leads to the formation of a large array of lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs), many of which are important signaling molecules involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Previous research has shown that one of such LDEs, trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE), increases inflammation, however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we used click chemistry-based proteomics to identify the cellular targets which are required for the pro-inflammatory effects of tt-DDE. We found that treatment with tt-DDE increased cytokine production, JNK phosphorylation, and activation of NF-κB signaling in macrophage cells, and increased severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colonic inflammation in mice, demonstrating its pro-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Using click chemistry-based proteomics, we found that tt-DDE directly interacts with Hsp90 and 14–3-3ζ, which are two important proteins involved in inflammation and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of Hsp90 or 14–3-3ζ abolished the pro-inflammatory effects of tt-DDE in macrophage cells. Together, our results support that tt-DDE increases inflammatory responses via Hsp90- and 14–3-3ζ-dependent mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cStudienstiftung des Deutschen Volkesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004350  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaldehydes 3abiochemical mechanisms 3acarcinogenesis 3acytokines 3adextran sulfate 3aheat-shock protein 90 3ahuman diseases 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3amacrophages 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aproteomics 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aTrans 0atrans-2,4-Decadienal 0aClick Chemistry1 aDattmore, Devon A.1 aWang, Weicang1 aPohnert, Georg1 aWolfram, Stefanie1 aZhang, Jianan1 aYang, Ran1 aDecker, Eric A.1 aLee, Kin Sing Stephen1 aZhang, Guodong0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2020 Feb., v. 76 p.108286-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2019.1082863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245011300168300001600281500002000297520175100317592002802068650002302096650001902119650001102138650001002149650001502159650001202174650002302186650002202209650001902231650001302250650001902263650001402282650001602296650001002312650001402322650000902336650002402345650001402369650001402383700002102397700003502418700002002453700002502473700002302498700001902521773010102540856007902641852000902720655001202729IND60571315620221121154200.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057131562DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.126632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijkstra, Feike A.10aEnhanced decomposition and nitrogen mineralization sustain rapid growth of Eucalyptus regnans after wildfire  ap. 229-236.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEucalyptus regnans grows rapidly from seed after wildfires, out‐competing other species, thereby forming pure stands of mature forests that rank amongst the world's most carbon dense. By global standards, these forests grow on infertile soils. It is unclear how E. regnans is able to obtain large amounts nitrogen (N) from these infertile soils to support its rapid growth after fire. We measured carbon (C) and N stored in plant biomass and photosynthetic rates of E. regnans 2 years after a wildfire and examined whether E. regnans stimulated its own N supply through root‐induced increases in microbial decomposition and N mineralization. We compared microbial biomass, gross N mineralization rates and soil C in trenched and rooted plots. Photosynthetic rates of E. regnans seedlings were high and comparable to photosynthetic rates observed in fertilized crops. Presence of roots of E. regnans and allied microflora enhanced gross N mineralization more than fivefold compared to soil without roots present. Soil microbial biomass was more than doubled by root presence. The soil N pulse caused by the fire and N mineralization rates in the absence of roots were too small to account for the large amount of N stored in E. regnans 2 years after the fire. Our results suggest that E. regnans facilitated its rapid growth by enhancing microbial activity and N mineralization. This enhanced microbial activity also contributed to a substantial loss of soil C (˜62% of carbon gained in plant biomass was concurrently lost from soil). Synthesis. At the ecosystem scale, the synergistic effects of plant growth and soil N mineralization need to be carefully assessed against costs to soil C for forests regenerating after disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus regnans 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acrops 3aecosystems 3aforests 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytomass 3apure stands 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asynergism 3awildfires1 aJenkins, Meaghan1 ade Rémy de Courcelles, Vivien1 aKeitel, Claudia1 aBarbour, Margaret M.1 aKayler, Zachary E.1 aAdams, Mark A.0 tjournal of ecology.g2017 Jan., v. 105, no. 1 p.229-236dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.126633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148242059700164245015700761300001800918520160800936592002802544650001302572650001402585650002602599650001802625650001602643650002702659650001402686650001102700650001102711650001502722651001002737651001802747700005402765700001702819700001802836700001602854700001602870773012802886856008303014852000903097655001203106IND60779206220221116144230.0220826e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077920622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-022-02495-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Peipei10aAnalyse géostatistique et simulation des hydrofaciès pour estimer la variabilité spatiale de la conductivité hydraulique dans la plaine de Jianghan, Chine centrale Análisis geoestadístico y simulación de hidrofacies para estimar la variabilidad espacial de la conductividad hidráulica en la llanura de Jianghan, China central 地质统计和三维水相模拟江汉平原典型含水层渗透系数空间变异分布特征 Análise geoestatística e simulação de hidrofácies para estimar a variabilidade espacial da condutividade hidráulica na Planície de Jianghan, China central10aGeostatistical analysis and hydrofacies simulation for estimating the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity in the Jianghan Plain, central China  ap. 1135-1155.  aThis study evaluated the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity (K) along the Han River watershed in the Jianghan Plain (China) by using different geostatistical methods. The K distribution was estimated from 58 borehole measurements, and co-kriging estimates were obtained by incorporating 287 electrical resistivity (ρ) and 260 hydraulic gradient (I) values as auxiliary data. Additionally, 2,980 lithology samples were classified into three hydrofacies units in terms of decreasing K, which was simulated accordingly. The results indicate that the highest K values are in the western part of Shahu town and near the Yangtze River. The trend continues to diminish across western and northern Xiantao town and north-west of Xingou town, as well as across the transition zone from highland to lowland (from Shayang town to Zhanggang town). The low K values occur from the northern part of Jiukou town to Shayang town, and around Xingou town, and then are scattered around the high K values, with the lowest K values distributed in the north-west of the study area (from the catchment margin to the north of Shayang town), in Yanglinwei town, and east of Shahu town. As for the geostatistical methods, co-kriging estimates based on ρ and I highlight the variability of K, with the latter providing more realistic results. The three-dimensional hydrofacies model realistically represents the spatial distributions of K in the Quaternary aquifer system.

The properties of feedstocks, thermal decomposition, and biochar were analyzed using elemental analysis, coarse fiber determination, TG–FTIR, ICP–MS, FTIR, XRD, and SEM–EDS. Results showed that the cow manure-derived feedstocks were rich in total organic C (>37%) and had no heavy metal risk. According to the results of TG–FTIR, pyrolysis produced more residual solids, CO, CH₄, and NH₃ and less CO₂ than combustion. The factors affecting alkalinity, calorific value, adsorption capacity, and surface functional group properties of cow manure-derived biochar in order of effectiveness were as follows: pyrolysis temperature > manure characteristics > heating rate > residence time. In general, increasing the temperature from 300 °C to 700 °C increased the pH (8.05–11.74) and C content (45.75%–49.64%) of fresh cow manure biochar and decreased the yield (62.17%–39.82%), nutrient content (N + P + K = 6.90%–5.64%), iodine adsorption capacity (269–96 mg g⁻¹), aromaticity, and polarity. The biochar derived from flushing cow manure and anaerobic fermentation residues had similar C content (>48%), alkalinity (pH > 10), calorific value (>20000 J g⁻¹), stability, and polarity. Fresh cow manure biochar had higher nutrient recovery (6.6%) and iodine adsorption capacity (215 mg g⁻¹) than others. Compared with flushing cow manure and anaerobic fermentation residues, the pyrolysis of fresh cow manure reduced nutrient loss and treatment energy consumption. This study provides a good basis for the optimization of the pyrolysis process of three typical kinds of cow manures in dairy farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalkalinity 3abiochar 3acombustion 3acow manure 3acows 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3aheavy metals 3aiodine 3anutrient content 3apH 3apyrolysis 3arisk 3asustainable technology 3atemperature 0aThree different cow manures 0aPyrolysis conditions 0aFeedstock composition 0aPhysicochemical characterization1 aZheng, Lei1 aLi, Zifu1 aZhou, Xiaoqin1 aCheng, Shikun1 aZhang, Lingling1 aZhang, Qiang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 311 p.127458-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1274583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03880naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024002200175024001900197040001800216100001400234245018000248506007600428506003100504520144300535592002801978596004402006596004502050506003702095650001802132650001902150650002502169650001702194650002202211650001102233650001702244650002302261650001602284650001402300650001602314650000902330650001202339650002402351650002402375650001402399650003602413653000802449653000802457653000802465653000702473653000802480653001402488653000802502653000902510653000902519653000902528653000902537653000702546653001602553653000702569653000902576653000802585653002802593653002302621700001402644700001802658700001802676700002102694700001902715700001702734700002102751700002002772700001902792773011902811856008602930961001303016852000903029655001203038IND60676218220221215143326.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067621822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2019.1082852chorus7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2019.1082852doi7 aPMC69957722pmcid7 a317602282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Rong10aα-Linolenic acid-enriched butter attenuated high fat diet-induced insulin resistance and inflammation by promoting bioconversion of n-3 PUFA and subsequent oxylipin formation  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aα-Linolenic acid (ALA) is an essential fatty acid and the precursor for long-chain n-3 PUFA. However, biosynthesis of n-3 PUFA is limited in a Western diet likely due to an overabundance of n-6 PUFA. We hypothesized that dietary reduction of n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio is sufficient to promote the biosynthesis of long-chain n-3 PUFA, leading to an attenuation of high fat (HF) diet-induced obesity and inflammation. C57BL/6 J mice were fed a HF diet from ALA-enriched butter (n3Bu, n-6/n-3=1) in comparison with isocaloric HF diets from either conventional butter lacking both ALA and LA (Bu, n-6/n-3=6), or margarine containing a similar amount of ALA and abundant LA (Ma, n-6/n-3=6). Targeted lipidomic analyses revealed that n3Bu feeding promoted the bioconversion of long-chain n-3 PUFA and their oxygenated metabolites (oxylipins) derived from ALA and EPA. The n3Bu supplementation attenuated hepatic TG accumulation and adipose tissue inflammation, resulting in improved insulin sensitivity. Decreased inflammation by n3Bu feeding was attributed to the suppression of NF-κB activation and M1 macrophage polarization. Collectively, our work suggests that dietary reduction of the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, as well as total n-3 PUFA consumed, is a crucial determinant that facilitates n-3 PUFA biosynthesis and subsequent lipidomic modifications, thereby conferring metabolic benefits against obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern diets 3aadipose tissue 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3abutter 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amacrophages 3amargarine 3ametabolites 3amice 3aobesity 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aoxylipins 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aALA 0aARA 0aBAT 0aBu 0aDHA 0a15-d-PGJ2 0aEPA 0aeWAT 0aHETE 0aHEPE 0aiWAT 0aLA 0aLC n-3 PUFA 0aMa 0an3Bu 0aALA 0aMacrophage Polarization 0aN-6/N-3 PUFA Ratio1 aKim, Judy1 aYou, Mikyoung1 aGiraud, David1 aToney, Ashley M.1 aShin, Seung-Ho1 aKim, So-Youn1 aBorkowski, Kamil1 aNewman, John W.1 aChung, Soonkyu0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2020 Feb., v. 76 p.108285-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2019.1082853Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148242055300204245013300757300001800890520160300908592002802511650002402539650001402563650001602577650002102593650001702614650001502631650001702646650000902663650000902672650001502681650001802696651001002714700001702724700001702741700001402758700001602772700001302788700001502801700001202816773012802828856008302956852000903039655001203048IND60779206320221116144227.0220826e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077920632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-022-02489-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Kunchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1604-597810aCaractéristiques de l’évolution de l’affaissement de terrain et de la déformation des sols avant et après le Projet de Dérivation des Eaux à Pékin, en Chine Características de la evolución de la subsidencia del terreno y de la deformación del suelo antes y después del Proyecto de Desvíos de Agua en Beijing, China 北京调水工程前后地面沉降演化及土体变形特征 Características da evolução da subsidência de terreno e da deformação do solo antes e depois do Projeto de Transposição de Água em Pequim, China10aCharacteristics of land-subsidence evolution and soil deformation before and after the Water Diversion Project in Beijing, China  ap. 1111-1134.  aBeijing is a major metropolis in China, which shows characteristics of significant land subsidence because of long-term overexploitation of groundwater. Since the South-to-North Water Diversion Project Central Route was first operated in December 2014, it has provided Beijing with a new source of water. In this study, a variety of monitoring data has been used to analyze the changes in the groundwater flow field and land subsidence when comparing the conditions before and after the Water Diversion Project started, and to study the stress-strain characteristics of the soil layers at different depths under different water-level-change modes. Meanwhile, causes of the large residual deformation and hysteresis deformation of the cohesive soils are discussed. The study reveals that after the operation of the Water Diversion Project, the area of the groundwater depression cone and the rate of land subsidence in the Beijing Plain showed an overall decreasing trend. The deformation characteristics of different lithological soil layers under different water-level-change modes can be summarized into four categories. The sand layer is mainly characteristic of elastic deformation. The cohesive soil layers of different depths have elastic, plastic and creep deformation, and the viscoelastic-plastic characteristics are obvious. The large residual deformation and hysteresis deformation of the cohesive soil layer are mainly caused by two factors: firstly, the inelastic water storage rate is greater than the elastic water storage rate, and secondly, the cohesive soil has weak permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelastic deformation 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrogeology 3ahysteresis 3apermeability 3asand 3asoil 3asubsidence 3awater storage 3aChina1 aMa, Fengshan1 aChen, Beibei1 aLuo, Yong1 aCui, Wenjun1 aZhou, Yi1 aTian, Fang1 aSha, Te0 tHydrogeology journal.g2022 June, v. 30, no. 4 p.1111-1134dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-022-02489-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245016100193300001400354500001400368500002000382520164100402592002802043596005402071596005402125650001402179650002002193650001402213650002702227650001002254650001802264650001602282650001102298650001702309650002002326700001602346700001702362700001302379700001802392700001602410700001402426700001402440700001802454773013002472856007302602852000902675655001202684IND60723952820221120093633.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395282DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.138492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4998-692910aCo‐culture model reveals the characteristics of theca cells and the effect of granulosa cells on theca cells at different stages of follicular development  ap. 58-73.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTheca cells (TCs) play an important role in follicular development, which cannot be separated from granulosa cells (GCs). However, compared with mammals, the TCs and the effects of GCs on TCs at different follicular development stages (FDSs) have specific characteristics in avian species, but none of them have been clearly defined. In this study, we established an in vitro co‐culture (with GC at the corresponding stage) model of goose TCs at different FDSs (pre‐hierarchical, hierarchical and F1) by using a transwell system. The properties of TCs in co‐culture at the three FDSs, including cell morphology, activity and intracellular lipid content, as well as the expression of key genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, steroidogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis, were examined and defined. We further compared the mono‐culture and co‐culture groups. After co‐culture, the activity of TCs showed significant (p < .01) increases in all stages; moreover, in pre‐hierarchical TCs, the expression levels of FAS, SREBP, 3β‐HSD and CCND1 were promoted, and PPARγ, CYP19, BCL2 and CAS3 were inhibited (p < .05); in the hierarchical TCs, the expression levels of PPARγ, FAS, CYP19, CCND1 and BCL2 were promoted, and SREBP, STAR, 3β‐HSD and CAS3 were inhibited (p < .05), whereas in the F1 TCs, the expression levels of PPARγ, FAS, 3β‐HSD, CYP19 and CCND1 were promoted, and STAR and CAS3 were inhibited (p < .05). These results suggested that GCs at the three FDSs have dynamic and complex influences on the physiological characteristics of TCs, and the influences on TCs at the three FDSs were varied.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672424cNational Natural Science Funds of China  aCARS‐42‐4cChina Agricultural Research System 3aapoptosis 3acell structures 3acoculture 3afollicular development 3ageese 3alipid content 3alipogenesis 3amodels 3areproduction 3asteroidogenesis1 aWang, Yushi1 aGao, Shanyan1 aChen, Xi1 aHu, Shenqiang1 aWang, Jiwen1 aHu, Jiwei1 aLi, Liang1 aHan, Chunchun0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.58-73dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.138493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245013000187300001400317500001500331520216300346592002802509650002502537650002802562650001702590650001002607650002102617650001602638650003202654650001802686650002502704650002302729650001502752650001402767650002302781650001502804650002102819650002502840650001702865650002002882650002502902650001802927650001802945650001302963650001402976653002802990653002303018653001703041653002103058653001403079653002303093700002403116700002203140700002303162700002303185700002403208773011603232856009003348961001303438852000903451655001203460IND50060484720221119062257.0190405e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006048472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2012.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrareze, Jocleita Peruzzo10aJasmonic acid does not increase oxidative defense mechanisms or common defense-related enzymes in postharvest sugarbeet roots  ap. 11-18.  a2019-12-06  aJasmonic acid (JA) treatment significantly reduces rot due to several sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) storage pathogens. However, the mechanisms by which JA protects postharvest sugarbeet roots from disease are unknown. In other plant species and organs, alterations in antioxidant defense mechanisms and elevations in common pathogenesis-related defense enzymes have been implicated in jasmonate-induced disease resistance. To investigate whether these mechanisms are involved in JA-induced disease resistance in stored sugarbeet roots, the activities of several reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging and pathogenesis-related defense enzymes and the total concentration of antioxidant compounds were determined in harvested sugarbeet roots in the 60 d following treatment with JA. ROS-scavenging and pathogenesis-related defense enzymes and the concentration of antioxidant compounds were largely unaffected by JA as JA-treated roots exhibited small declines in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and chitinase activities, and were generally unaltered in ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), β-1,3-glucanase (β-Gluc), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activities or antioxidant compounds concentration. The lack of increase in enzyme activities or metabolites related to defense against oxidative stress or pathogens suggests that JA-induced disease resistance in postharvest sugarbeet roots does not arise from a direct increase in any of the ROS-scavenging and defense-related enzymes examined, or the concentration of total antioxidant compounds. However, ROS-scavenging enzymes and pathogenesis-related defense enzymes were affected by storage duration with POD, SOD, β-Gluc, chitinase, and PPO activities elevated and APX and CAT activities reduced in roots stored for 10 d or more. Storage-related changes in activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes and defense-related enzymes provide further evidence that these enzymes are uninvolved in sugarbeet root disease resistance during storage since many of these enzymes increased in activity after prolonged storage when disease resistance generally declines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbate peroxidase 3areactive oxygen species 3aplant organs 3aroots 3aoxidative stress 3ametabolites 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3ajasmonic acid 3apostharvest diseases 3adisease resistance 3aperoxidase 3apathogens 3adefense mechanisms 3asugar beet 3acatechol oxidase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3astorage time 3aenzyme activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aBeta vulgaris 3aroot diseases 3acatalase 3achitinase 0aReactive oxygen species 0aInduced resistance 0aantioxidants 0aStorage duration 0aJasmonate 0aDisease resistance1 aFugate, Karen Klotz1 aBolton, Melvin D.1 aDeckard, Edward L.1 aCampbell, Larry G.1 aFinger, Fernando L.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2013 Mar., v. 77 p.11-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013700161520139300298592002801691650001601719650001201735650002301747650001801770650001301788650001901801650000901820653002601829653003101855653003101886653001601917653002301933653000801956653000801964653000701972653000801979653000901987653000901996653000702005700001502012773012202027856008102149852000902230655001202239IND60741996320221120172724.0211030e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074199632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1119422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cheng10aAntagonistic effects of amylopectin and amylose molecules on the starch inter- and intramolecular interactions during retrogradation  aStarch retrogradation property is critical for developing functional foods with desirable nutritional and textural attributes, while its nature currently remains elusive. The current study investigated the relations between starch chain-length distributions (CLDs) and interaction patterns (i.e. intermolecular versus intramolecular interactions) of starch molecules during the retrogradation process. CLDs for different waxy potato and sago starch mixtures were characterized by size-exclusion chromatography, and molecular interactions were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and small amplitude oscillatory shear rheological test. Results for the first time showed that amylose molecules were involved in the formation of short-range intermolecular interactions with amylopectin molecules. Most intermolecularly heterogenous double helices were formed at the 1 : 1 mixing ratio of waxy potato to sago starch. Although the addition of waxy potato starch to sago starch increased the overall amount of short-range double helices, the amount of short-range intermolecular double helices was decreased. It suggests that there was an antagonistic effect between the formation of short-range inter- and intramolecular double helices. These results help a better understanding of the interaction patterns of amylose and amylopectin molecules during the retrogradation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3agel chromatography 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3aretrogradation 3asago 0aStarch retrogradation 0aIntermolecular interaction 0aIntramolecular interaction 0aSago starch 0aWaxy potato starch 0aDSC 0aCLD 0aAC 0aSEC 0aSAOS 0aNLLS 0aDP1 aHu, Yiming0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Aug., v. 148 p.111942-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1119423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245014000161300001800301500002000319520214100339592002802480650002302508650002402531650001202555650001402567650001102581650001502592650001602607650001402623650001102637650001802648650001002666650002002676650002202696773010402718856007902822852000902901655001202910IND60548427620221120162558.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054842762DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.126072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeger, Tina10aLight availability experienced in the field affects ability of following generations to respond to shading in an annual grassland plant  ap. 1432-1440.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFor plants competing for light, grasslands represent complex environments. Grassland microhabitats vary in the amount of available light and in the spatial distribution of patches with full sunlight, light shade and deep shade. Plant populations have been shown to adapt to specific competitors and shading conditions, but it is an open question how tightly the responses of populations to different shading situations are linked to the light availability previously experienced in the field. Using maternal families collected in grasslands ranging from open to closed canopies, I tested the effects of no shading, homogeneous and heterogeneous shade created in the glasshouse on trait expression in the annual Erodium cicutarium. Heterogeneous shading was simulated by a patchwork of single and double layers of light filters lowering the R:FR ratio of transmitted light and clear filters simulating gaps. Heterogeneous shading induced a stronger shade avoidance response than homogeneous shading, with larger leaf length, greater vegetative height and larger specific leaf area. Time to first flowering was longer under heterogeneous shading, and plants produced less fruits. Populations differed in their time to first flowering under the shading treatments, and these differences could be traced back to light availability measured in the field. Plants from populations with lower light availability showed a postponed date of first flowering even if they were not shaded. These differences were attributable to plasticity of the maternal families. Across shading treatments, plants from low‐light environments produced more above‐ground biomass. Synthesis. This study indicates that there is a close linkage between the light availability experienced in the field and the ability of following generations to respond to shading. Low average light availability experienced in the past seems to induce a trade‐off of vegetative growth against early flowering, providing the following generations with the capacity to overtop neighbours. This capacity is utilized especially if plants experience a mixture of gaps and deep shade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErodium cicutarium 3aaboveground biomass 3afilters 3aflowering 3afruits 3agrasslands 3agreenhouses 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amicrohabitats 3ashade 3asolar radiation 3avegetative growth0 tjournal of ecology.g2016 Sept., v. 104, no. 5 p.1432-1440dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.126073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008200164300001600246500001500262520122300277592002801500650001401528650002001542650001801562650001101580650002601591650001701617650001701634650003101651650001201682650002601694650001801720650001101738653001601749653001601765700002401781700003101805700002201836773008901858856004801947852000901995655001202004IND50061169920221120233554.0130318e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006116992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-012-1239-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavel, Simon10aNew methods for the investigation of leaf litter breakdown in river sediments  ap. 301-312.  a2019-12-06  aThe breakdown rate of leaf litter buried inside river sediments (i.e., in the hyporheic zone) remains poorly known. The burial of large bags (15 × 15 cm) used in the benthic layer generates disturbances of the vertical connectivity with surface water, and thus affects the breakdown rate. We performed field and laboratory experiments to test the suitability of two leaf litter containers: small litter bags (5 × 4 cm) and perforated stainless steel cylinders (6 cm long, 1.6 cm in diameter), both introduced inside sediments using mobile mini-piezometers (1 m long, 1.7 cm or 3 cm in diameter). We compared the two containers for (i) the hydrological exchanges toward leaf litter, (ii) the impact of a benthic shredder on leaf breakdown, and (iii) the response of leaf litter breakdown to changes in sediment characteristics. The two methods give similar patterns of breakdown rates with stream sediment characteristics, but the use of perforated stainless steel cylinders provides an artificial empty volume in which invertebrates can over degrade leaf litter. Small plastic bags do not alter physico-chemical conditions around leaf litter and give lower values of breakdown rates in the hyporheic zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3astainless steel 3ainvertebrates 3arivers 3alaboratory techniques 3aplant litter 3aplastic bags 3aphysicochemical properties 3astreams 3afield experimentation 3asurface water 3aleaves 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aPiscart, Christophe1 aMermillod-Blondin, Florian1 aMarmonier, Pierre0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 Jan., v. 700, no. 1 p.301-312dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1239-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009900159520179600258592002802054650002302082650002002105650001802125650001802143650001702161650001502178650002202193651001102215651001002226651001902236700002102255700002502276700002402301700002002325700002102345700002202366773012202388856007402510852000902584655001202593IND60748652220221119125032.0210827e20210813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074865222DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130827782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarino, Mirko 12aA Systematic Review of Worldwide Consumption of Ultra-Processed Foods: Findings and Criticisms  aA debate is ongoing on the significance and appropriateness of the NOVA classification as a tool for categorizing foods based on their degree of processing. As such, the role of ultra-processed food (UPF) on human health is still not completely understood. With this review, we aimed to investigate the actual level of consumption of UPF across countries and target populations to determine the impact in real contexts. Suitable articles published up to March 2021 were sourced through the PubMed and SCOPUS databases. Overall, 99 studies providing data on the level of UPF consumption expressed as the percentage of total energy intake were identified, for a total of 1,378,454 participants. Most of them were published in Brazil (n = 38) and the United States (n = 15), and the 24 h recall was the most-used tool (n = 63). Analysis of the results revealed that the United States and the United Kingdom were the countries with the highest percent energy intake from UPF (generally >50%), whereas Italy had the lowest levels (about 10%); the latter was inversely associated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet. High variability was also observed based on sex, age, and body mass index, with men, young people, and overweight/obese subjects generally having higher levels of consumption compared to older subjects. Overall, our findings underline the large differences in UPF intake. Since most of the observations derived from studies conducted with food questionnaires are not specifically validated for UPF, further efforts are essential to confirm the results previously obtained and to investigate further the association between UPF consumption and health status, also considering the actual contribution within different dietary patterns, which has been less investigated to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3abody mass index 3aenergy intake 3ahealth status 3ahuman health 3aoverweight 3asystematic review 3aBrazil 3aItaly 3aUnited Kingdom1 aPuppo, Federica 1 aDel Bo’, Cristian 1 aVinelli, Valentina 1 aRiso, Patrizia 1 aPorrini, Marisa 1 aMartini, Daniela 0 tNutrients.g2021 Aug. 13, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130827783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012800167300001600295520143500311592002801746650002501774650001101799650001701810650001901827650002101846650001901867650002601886650001001912650002301922650002601945650001501971650001101986650001701997650001802014650001102032650001602043650003002059650002502089650002602114650001102140651001002151653001002161653002502171653001702196653001702213653002302230653001802253653001402271700002702285773012702312856008402439852000902523655001202532IND60122578920221121022338.0150325e20140504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012257892DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2014.9211222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDey, Abhijit10aHPTLC Method for Quantitative Evaluation of Seasonal Variation of Stigmasterol in Rauvolfia serpentina (L). Benth. ex Kurz.  ap. 254-261.  aRauvolfia serpentina (L). Benth. ex Kurz. (Apocynaceae) occupies a prominent position in the ethno-therapeutics practiced in the Indian subcontinent. The plant is known to contain a number of bioactive secondary metabolites including indole alkaloids. The objective of our present study is to estimate the seasonal variation of stigmasterol content in the roots of the plant. Seasonal modulation in stigmasterol content in R. serpentina roots was analyzed by High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) performed on Silica gel 60 F ₂₅₄ TLC plates with benzene-acetone 86:14 (v/v) as mobile phase. Densitometric analysis was carried out at λ=366 nm after derivatization with vanillin-10 % (v/v) sulphuric acid alcohol. In the root samples stigmasterol was present at R f value of 0.44. Stigmasterol content was found to be the highest in roots harvested during summer and the lowest in winter and there was a gradual decrease from summer to winter through monsoon and autumn and from spring the hike was again found. Modulation in stigmasterol content during different seasons was noted which can be implicated to the popular notion of variation in secondary metabolites depending on temperature, ultraviolet radiation and other factors related to seasonal changes. Popular use of the plant in Indian ethnomedicine may be attributed to the presence of stigmasterol as one of the important constituents of the plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRauvolfia serpentina 3aautumn 3adensitometry 3aderivatization 3aindole alkaloids 3amonsoon season 3aquantitative analysis 3aroots 3aseasonal variation 3asecondary metabolites 3asilica gel 3aspring 3astigmasterol 3asulfuric acid 3asummer 3atemperature 3athin layer chromatography 3atraditional medicine 3aultraviolet radiation 3awinter 3aIndia 0aHPTLC 0aRauvolfia serpentina 0aStigmasterol 0aDensitometry 0aSeasonal variation 0aEthnomedicine 0aSnakebite1 aPandey, Devendra Kumar0 tJournal of Biologically Active Products from Nature.g2014 May 4, v. 4, no. 3 p.254-261dTaylor & Francisx2231-18747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22311866.2014.9211223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245008700160300001600247520125200263592002801515650001601543650002601559650001701585650002501602650001301627650002201640650000901662650000901671650001601680700001801696700001701714700001601731700001401747700001501761773013101776856007801907852000901985655001201994IND60765149720221117235816.0220714e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076514972DNAL7 a10.17221/422/2018-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuotao, Yang10aDifferent micro-climate response of indica rice population to nitrogen fertilizer  ap. 407-412.  aField experiment was carried out from 2014 to 2016 to clarify the micro-climate response of indica rice population to nitrogen fertilizer. R498, R816 and R499 were used as representatives of drooping panicle, semi-erect panicle and erect panicle indica rice, respectively and 3 nitrogen fertilizer levels (N0 – 0 kg N/ha; N1 – 150 kg N/ha; N2 –150 kg/ha) were set for each panicle of indica rice. Results showed that the erect panicle indica rice (R499) improved the environment of temperature, relative humidity and light of rice population under heavy nitrogen fertilizer, and built a healthier micro-climate environment for rice population, especially at the middle position of rice population. Comparing with drooping panicle indica rice (R498), erect panicle indica rice performed better under heavy nitrogen fertilizer, with a higher micro-climate response index to nitrogen fertilizer at middle and lower position in rice population. In comparison of R498, the yield of R499 increased by 0.10–0.11 t/ha under N1 treatment, while it increased by 0.93–0.96 t/ha under N2 treatment; thus, the suggestion for farmers is to plant erect panicle indica rice in heavy fertilizer area or to use more fertilizer in moderate fertilizer area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3amicroclimate 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apanicles 3arelative humidity 3arice 3asoil 3atemperature1 aXuechun, Wang1 aYoulin, Peng1 aFahd, Rasul1 aTing, Zou1 aYungao, Hu0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 64, no. 9 p.407-412dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/422/2018-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245009200194300001400286500001400300500002000314520169300334592002802027596006702055596009202122596007402214596007402288596010602362650003102468650002002499650003102519650001902550650001302569650001902582650002202601650002202623650002302645650001102668650002902679650002002708700005602728700001202784700001602796700001702812700001802829700001902847700001602866700005602882700001402938773013002952856007303082852000903155655001203164IND60723953020221120084206.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395302DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.138442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5566-649710aTranscriptomic analysis of gene expression in normal goat ovary and intersex goat gonad  ap. 12-25.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntersexuality is a congenital reproductive disorder that usually occurs in hornless goats, hindering breeding of goats with hornless traits and the development of the goat industry. In this study, we aimed to identify differentially expressed genes in intersex and normal goat gonads by comparing gene transcription profiles of intersex and normal goat gonads. As intersex goats are genetically based on females, we chose female goats as controls. The goats in the control group and the experimental group were both over one‐year old. We evaluated the anatomical characteristics of the reproductive organs of five intersex goats using histopathological methods. The gonads were found to be ovarian and testicular types. RNA‐Seq technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes in gonads and normal goat ovary tissues. Transcription analysis results were verified by qPCR. The results showed that 2,748 DEGs were upregulated and 3,327 DEGs were downregulated in intersex ovaries unlike in controls, whereas 2006 DEGs were upregulated and 2032 DEGs were downregulated in the interstitial testes. Many of these genes play important roles in mammalian sex determination and sex differentiation, such as SOX9, WT1, GATA4, DMRT1, DHH, AMH, CYP19A1 and FST. We found that many DEGs are involved in biological developmental regulation by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, and that most genes associated with the steroid synthesis pathway were downregulated. The DEGs identified in this study may be involved in the regulation of intersex goat sex determination and differentiation, and may increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mammalian sex differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD05020006cSub‐project of the National Key R&D Program  aGSCXZX‐2019cGansu Province Guiding Science and Technology Innovation Special Project  a202102110237cKey R&D and Promotion in Henan Province Special Project  a192102110073cKey R&D and Promotion in Henan Province Special Project  a2019HNUAHEDF021cDoctoral Start‐up Fund Project of Henan University of Animal Husbandry and Economy 3aGATA transcription factors 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahistopathology 3aindustry 3aintersexuality 3asequence analysis 3asex determination 3asexual development 3atestes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aHan, Haoyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7260-02381 aLi, Jun1 aZhang, Yong1 aZhao, JinYan1 aWei, Hongfang1 aHasi, Tonglaga1 aLv, Huifang1 aZhao, Xingxu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5470-38151 aQuan, Kai0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.12-25dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.138443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01295naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245003900163300002000202520036600222592002800588650002300616650002300639650002200662650002200684700002000706700005500726773013600781856007900917852000900996655001201005IND60626640620221119085856.0181222e20181119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062664062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b024502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKauhl, Ulrich10aTotal Synthesis of epi-Trichosetin  ap. 15170-15177.  aThe natural 3-decalinoyltetramic acid epi-trichosetin was synthesized in ten steps starting from (R)-(+)-citronellal using an intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction and a Lacey–Dieckmann cyclization as the key steps.

Products analysed included: primary and recovered oils (PO/RO) derived from distillates, chloroform extractives (CE) of the non-distilled fractions, and hexane concretes (HC). Number of components identified by GC-MS varied from 35-60 (88.56 - 98.17 % of the total composition). PO/RO showed close amounts of hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds; yet, the latter prevailed in CE and HC samples. Hydrocarbon fraction was the least in buds CE (15.36 %) and greatest in flowers PO/RO (48.04 %); meanwhile, oxygenated constituents dominated flowers HC (74.04 %). Chief hydrocarbons were: alkanes and alkenes (flowers CE, 32.46 %; major phytane 16.41 %), and terpenoids (PO/RO: buds 22.44 %, major α-pinene 9.34 % vs . flowers 19.91 %, major β-selinene 8.51 %). Oxygenated constituents included: carbonyl compounds (flowers CE 31.83 %; major 6-benzofurancarboxyaldehyde 27.75 %); acids (HC: flowers 52.16 %, major hexadecanoic acid 32.47 % vs . buds 51.64 %, major 9, 12-octadecadienoic acid 30.19 %); esters and lactones (buds CE, 66.24 %; major 1, 2-benzenedicarboxylic acid diisooctyl ester, 38.99 %; and PO/RO, buds 31.52 % vs. flowers 28.01 %). The volatiles exhibited variable cytotoxic activities against (MCF7) and (HCT116) cell lines. Buds HC demonstrated the lowest IC ₅₀ (4.2 µg/ml). In conclusion, the stage of development and isolation techniques obviously influenced yield, composition and bioactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3acarbonyl compounds 3abuds 3alactones 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3acytotoxicity 3adevelopmental stages 3apalmitic acid 3aalpha-pinene 3aflowers 3aisolation techniques 3aSpathodea campanulata 3aoils 3ahydrodistillation 3ahexane 3asolvents 3achloroform 3adistillates 3aalkenes 0afloral volatiles 0aesters 0aGC-MS 0astage of development1 aShehab, Naglaa G.1 aEl Zalabani, Soheir M.0 tJournal of Biologically Active Products from Nature.g2014 May 4, v. 4, no. 3 p.196-208dTaylor & Francisx2231-18747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22311866.2014.9368993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003500139245018400174520172200358592002802080650002202108650001202130650001302142650002502155650002702180650001502207650001402222650001102236650001302247650001702260650001302277650000902290650001902299650003502318650001202353651001102365700002502376700002902401700002602430700003302456700003002489700003102519773012202550856007302672852000902745655001202754IND60719066620221120195533.0201126e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071906662DNAL7 a10.3390/v121112242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonce-Gallegos, Marco  Antonio10aPolymorphisms in Processing and Antigen Presentation-Related Genes and Their Association with Host Susceptibility to Influenza A/H1N1 2009 Pandemic in a Mexican Mestizo Population  a(1) Background: The influenza A/H1N1 pdm09 virus rapidly spread throughout the world. Despite the inflammatory and virus-degradation pathways described in the pathogenesis of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, little is known about the role of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes involved in the processing and antigenic presentation-related mechanisms. (2) Methods: In this case-control study, we evaluated 17 SNPs in five genes (TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP, PSMB8, and PSMB9). One hundred and twenty-eight patients with influenza A/H1N1 infection (INF-P) and 111 healthy contacts (HC) were included; all of them are Mexican mestizo. (3) Results: In allele and genotype comparison, the rs241433/C allele (TAP2), as well as AG haplotype (rs3763365 and rs4148882), are associated with reduced risk for influenza A/H1N1 infection (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the rs2071888G allele (TAPBP) and GG haplotype (rs3763365 and rs9276810) are associated with a higher risk for influenza A/H1N1 infection. In addition, after adjustment for covariates, the association to a reduced risk for influenza A/H1N1 infection remains with rs241433/C allele (p < 0.0001, OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.13–0.43), and the association with TAPBP is also maintained with the G allele (p = 0.0095, OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.17–3.06) and GG genotype models (p < 0.05, OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.27–3.74). (4) Conclusion: The rs241433/C allele and AC genotype (TAP2) and the AG haplotype are associated with a reduced risk for influenza A/H1N1 infection. In addition, the rs2071888/G allele and GG genotype (TAPBP) and the GG haplotype are associated with a higher risk for developing influenza A/H1N1 infection in a Mexican mestizo population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aalleles 3aantigens 3acase-control studies 3adisease susceptibility 3ahaplotypes 3ainfluenza 3amodels 3apandemic 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aviruses 3aMexico1 aRuiz-Celis, Aseneth 1 aAmbrocio-Ortiz, Enrique 1 aPérez-Rubio, Gloria 1 aRamírez-Venegas, Alejandra 1 aBautista-Félix, Nora  E.1 aFalfán-Valencia, Ramcés 0 tViruses.g2020 Oct. 29, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121112243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013300160300001600293500001400309500002000323520180900343592002802152596006602180596007402246650002802320650001202348650001502360650001002375650001402385650002002399650001302419650002202432650001602454650001502470650001702485650001302502650001202515650002302527650002702550650001902577650001102596700001302607700002102620700002002641700002102661700006102682773013202743856007302875852000902948655001202957IND60723953520221120084141.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395352DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.138612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu‐ting10aMetabolomic differences of seminal plasma between boars with high and low average conception rates after artificial insemination  ap. 161-171.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeminal plasma is a complex biological fluid containing many metabolites including amino acids, fructose, carbohydrates and lipids Metabolites play important roles in multiple biological processes, but details and significance of the seminal plasma metabolome related to boar fertility are unknown. The aim of the present study was to compare the comprehensive metabolome of seminal plasma from boars with different conception rate after artificial insemination and to identify the potential biomarkers. Semen samples were collected from boars which divided into two groups according to the conception rates in the offspring. Seminal plasma metabolites were isolated, purified, and then subjected to Ultra‐high Performance Liquid Chromatography‐Quadrupole Time‐of‐Flight Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC‐qTOF‐MS) procession. A total of 576 (Positive ion mode) and 377 (Negative ion mode) metabolites were identified in seminal plasma. Metabolites were identified and categorized according to their major chemical classes, including carboxylic acids and derivatives, organooxygen compounds, amino acids, peptides, and alogues, fatty amides, fatty acyls, benzene and substituted derivatives, purine nucleotides, pyrimidine nucleotides, glycosyl compounds, fatty acids and conjugates. The results showed that 4‐Aminobenzoate, Pro‐Asn, Ile‐Tyr, Homoveratric acid and D‐Biotin were higher in semen of boar with higher conception rate (HG) versus lower conception rate (LG) (p < .05), whereas L‐Serine, Butoxyacetic acid, S‐Methyl‐5'‐thioadenosine, Capsaicin and 1‐O‐(cis‐9‐Octadecenyl)‐2‐O‐acetyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphocholine (PAF) were lower in HG than in LG (p < .05). These metabolites may be considered as candidate biomarkers for different fertility in boars.  aPublisher supplied data  aC2017035cNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province  aLBH‐Z17010cHeilongjiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3aartificial insemination 3abenzene 3abiomarkers 3aboars 3acapsaicin 3aconception rate 3afructose 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3apeptides 3aprogeny 3apurine nucleotides 3apyrimidine nucleotides 3aseminal plasma 3aserine1 aLiu, Yan1 aLiang, Han‐lin1 aXu, Qian‐qian1 aLiu, Zhong‐hua1 aWeng, Xiao‐gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7474-84470 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.161-171dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.138613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245014200204300002000346500001500366520121900381592002801600596007401628650003001702650001101732650002001743650001301763650001201776650000901788650001001797650003101807650003601838650001501874650001901889650002301908650001001931651000901941653001901950700001401969700001501983773016901998856008102167852000902248655001202257IND60602047020221117185219.0180709e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060204702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2306-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaleel, Waqar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7688-073510aBiology, taxonomy, and IPM strategies of Bactrocera tau Walker and complex species (Diptera; Tephritidae) in Asia: a comprehensive review  ap. 19346-19361.  a2019-12-06  aBactrocera flies are the serious pests of fruit, vegetables, and nuts over the world. Bactrocera tau Walker is an economically important pest of agricultural crops. In Asia, approximately 30–40% losses of agricultural products are caused by B. tau infestation every year. In Asia, the B. tau contains a complex of sibling species that called the tau complex. However, the basic studies of B. tau and complex species are very important for integrated management. A comprehensive review of the B. tau and complex species has not been provided elsewhere. So, considering the importance of B. tau and complex species, this study provides the published information on ecology, nomenclature, identification tools, geographical distribution, potential invasion, and IPM tactics of B. tau and complex species, which would be more informative for publication facilitating related to integrated pest management (IPM) strategies of B. tau and complex species. In IPM of B. tau and complex species, the phytochemical and biological controls have not been applied successfully in Asia; there is an urgent need to study and applications of these two mentioned control techniques against the B. tau and complex species in Asia.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015BAD08B02cNational Science and Technology Pillar Program of China 3ageographical distribution 3afruits 3asibling species 3ataxonomy 3aecology 3anuts 3apests 3aintegrated pest management 3achemical constituents of plants 3avegetables 3aZeugodacus tau 3abiological control 3acrops 3aAsia 0aBactrocera tau1 aLu, Lihua1 aHe, Yurong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 July, v. 25, no. 20 p.19346-19361dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2306-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012300162300001600285520124900301592002801550596002801578596003101606650001301637650000901650650002901659650001401688650002501702650002601727650001701753650001701770650001501787650001501802650002001817650003101837650001501868650002101883650001501904650001501919700002001934700001701954700002201971700002201993773012502015856008102140852000902221655001202230IND60612728320221119041335.0180907e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061272832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00271-018-0576-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz, Sagi10aSize and stability of suspended aggregates in municipal effluents containing montmorillonite, bacteria and fulvic acid  ap. 203-216.  aUtilizing treated wastewater (TWW) for irrigation results in biological and chemical deposits. TWW components such as bacteria and suspend minerals interact under different environmental conditions, forming aggregates varying in size and stability that may adversely affect water flow in drippers. Our aim in this study was to characterize aggregates’ size and stability in suspensions of bacteria and clay particles, under different conditions prevailing in TWW. Flocculation value tests, thermal analysis, microscopy and particle size distribution were used to measure bacterial–clays interaction in suspension. Our results showed suspension stability increase with an increase in bacterial population. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) produced by bacteria or added as fulvic acid was found to be the most important parameter involved in determining aggregate size and stability under similar environmental condition. The presence of these components most commonly resulted in higher stability of the suspension, mainly smaller particles in suspension. A novel measurement aimed to determine size and stability parameters for suspended particles has been established and was found to be useful in predicting suspended compound interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  a02WA1297AcBMBF GERMANY  aWT1302/GR2444cMOST-Israel 3abacteria 3aclay 3adissolved organic carbon 3aeffluents 3aemitters (equipment) 3aenvironmental factors 3aflocculation 3afulvic acids 3airrigation 3amicroscopy 3amontmorillonite 3aparticle size distribution 3aprediction 3athermal analysis 3awastewater 3awater flow1 aWagner, Michael1 aHorn, Harald1 aTarchitzky, Jorge1 aChen, Y.q(Yona),0 tIrrigation science.g2018 Sept., v. 36, no. 4-5 p.203-216dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl11426x0342-71887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-018-0576-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011000170300002000280520116400300592002801464596005601492596010401548596004801652650002101700650002901721650001501750650002201765650001801787650001001805650001401815650001301829650001701842700006601859700001801925700002801943700004001971700002702011700001902038773016902057856008102226852000902307655001202316IND60602047120221117185234.0180709e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060204712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2372-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Miguel, Eduardo10aApplicability of radon emanometry in lithologically discontinuous sites contaminated by organic chemicals  ap. 20255-20263.  aThe applicability of radon (²²²Rn) measurements to delineate non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL) contamination in subsoil is discussed at a site with lithological discontinuities through a blind test. Three alpha spectroscopy monitors were used to measure radon in soil air in a 25,000-m² area, following a regular sampling design with a 20-m² grid. Repeatability and reproducibility of the results were assessed by means of duplicate measurements in six sampling positions. Furthermore, three points not affected by oil spills were sampled to estimate radon background concentration in soil air. Data histograms, Q-Q plots, variograms, and cluster analysis allowed to recognize two data populations, associated with the possible path of a fault and a lithological discontinuity. Even though the concentration of radon in soil air was dominated by this discontinuity, the characterization of the background emanation in each lithological unit allowed to distinguish areas potentially affected by NAPL, thus justifying the application of radon emanometry as a screening technique for the delineation of NAPL plumes in sites with lithological discontinuities.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARESOIL–CM (S2013/MAE-2739)cComunidad de Madrid  aCAREDENSE/DENSOIL (CTM2016-77151-C2-2-R)cSpanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness  aEPSPD/2015/46cIrish Research Council (IRC) 3acluster analysis 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3aoil spills 3aorganic compounds 3aradionuclides 3aradon 3ascreening 3asoil air 3aspectroscopy1 aBarrio-Parra, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5475-35671 aElío, Javier1 aIzquierdo-Díaz, Miguel1 aGarcía-González, Jerónimo Emilio1 aMazadiego, Luis Felipe1 aMedina, Rafael0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 July, v. 25, no. 20 p.20255-20263dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2372-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006500183245011800248300001800366506007600384520158400460592002802044506003702072650001602109650001502125650002002140650001602160650001502176650001502191650001202206650001002218650001302228650000902241650002202250650001602272650001302288650001402301650001602315700002402331700006102355700006002416773014702476856007702623852000902700655001202709IND60688553820221207140526.0200430e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068855382DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b117462doi7 aPMC71925242pmcid7 a321963262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAloisi, Claudia M.

The lack of strategies to measure DNA adducts within genomic loci, however, limits our understanding of chemical mutagenesis. The use of artificial nucleotides incorporated opposite DNA adducts by engineered DNA polymerases offers a potential basis for site-specific detection of DNA adducts, but the availability of effective artificial nucleotides that insert opposite DNA adducts is extremely limited, and furthermore, there has been no report of a quantitative strategy for determining how much DNA alkylation occurs in a sequence of interest. In this work, we synthesized an artificial nucleotide triphosphate that is selectively inserted opposite O⁶-carboxymethyl-guanine DNA by an engineered polymerase and is required for DNA synthesis past the adduct. We characterized the mechanism of this enzymatic process and demonstrated that the artificial nucleotide is a marker for the presence and location in the genome of O⁶-carboxymethyl-guanine. Finally, we established a mass spectrometric method for quantifying the incorporated artificial nucleotide and obtained a linear relationship with the amount of O⁶-carboxymethyl-guanine in the target sequence. In this work, we present a strategy to identify, locate, and quantify a mutagenic DNA adduct, advancing tools for linking DNA alkylation to mutagenesis and for detecting DNA adducts in genes as potential diagnostic biomarkers for cancer prevention.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA adducts 3aDNA damage 3aDNA replication 3aLewis acids 3aalkylation 3abiomarkers 3aenzymes 3agenes 3agenomics 3aloci 3amass spectrometry 3amutagenesis 3amutagens 3aneoplasms 3anucleotides1 aNilforoushan, Arman1 aZiegler, Nathalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1152-06451 aSturla, Shana J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6808-59500 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Mar. 20, v. 142, no. 15 p.6962-6969dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b117463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245015600169500001400325520149500339592002801834650000901862650001901871650001501890650001201905650002201917650001601939650001701955650001401972650001301986650002401999650001602023650001002039650001902049650001302068650001502081650002302096650001602119650001602135650000902151651001002160700002902170700002102199700002002220773012802240856007402368852000902442655001202451IND60724591020221123031305.0210122e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072459102DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130202032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMundaca-Moraga, Valeria 12aA Preliminary Study of Wave Energy Resource Using an HF Marine Radar, Application to an Eastern Southern Pacific Location: Advantages and Opportunities  aNAL-light  aAs climate change is of global concern, the electric generation through fossil fuel is progressively shifted to renewable energies. Among the renewables, the most common solar and wind, the wave energy stands for its high-power density. Studies about wave energy resource have been increasing over the years, especially in coastal countries. Several research investigations have assessed the global wave power, with higher values at high latitudes. However, to have a precise assessment of this resource, the measurement systems need to provide a high temporal and spatial resolution, and due to the lack of in-situ measurements, the way to estimate this value is numerical. Here, we use a high-frequency radar to estimate the wave energy resource in a nearshore central Chile at a high resolution. The study focuses near Concepción city (36.5° S), using a WERA (WavE RAdar) high frequency (HF) radar. The amount of annual energy collected is calculated. Analysis of coefficient of variation (COV), seasonal variability (SV), and monthly variability (MV) shows the area’s suitability for installing a wave energy converter device due to a relatively low variability and the high concentration of wave power obtained. The utility of HF radars in energy terms relies on its high resolution, both temporal and spatial. It can then compare the location of interest within small areas and use them as a complement to satellite measurements or numerical models, demonstrating its versatility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3aclimate change 3acomplement 3adensity 3aenergy conversion 3aexhibitions 3afossil fuels 3afrequency 3alatitude 3amathematical models 3ameasurement 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3avariability 3awater power 3awind 3aChile1 aAbarca-del-Rio, Rodrigo 1 aFigueroa, Dante 1 aMorales, James 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130202033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245007700180300001800257500001500275520162100290592002801911650001501939650001201954650002101966650001501987650002602002650001302028650002002041651001102061651001402072653001602086700001702102773010902119856005502228852000902283655001202292IND50067130620221119074418.0130615e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006713062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01101.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarthy, Michael A.,10aProfiting from prior information in Bayesian analyses of ecological data  ap. 1012-1019.  a2019-12-06  a1 Most ecological studies include prior information only implicitly, usually in their design or the discussion of results. In this study, two examples demonstrate that using Bayesian statistics to incorporate basic ecological principles and prior data can be very cost‐effective for increasing confidence in ecological research. 2 The first example is based on examining the effects of an experimental manipulation of the habitat of mulgara Dasycercus cristicauda, a marsupial of inland Australia. The second example is based on observational mark–recapture data to estimate the annual survival of the European dipper Cinclus cinclus, a passerine in France. 3 In the mulgara example, the prior information obtained from an observational study increased confidence that there was an adverse effect of experimental habitat manipulation on the species. The results suggested that the capture rate of mulgara was reduced to approximately one‐quarter by reduction of vegetation cover. 4 In the European dipper example, prior information based on the body mass of the species and estimates of annual survival of other European passerines was shown to be worth between 1 and 5 years of mark–recapture field data. 5 Synthesis and applications. Body mass can be used to predict annual survival of European passerines and other animals. Results of observational studies can provide prior information in experimental studies of impacts of habitat change. By using Bayesian methods, such prior information, if represented in a coherent and logical way, can be cost‐effective for adding certainty to ecological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3astatistics 3aanimals 3avegetation cover 3aMetatheria 3aobservational studies 3ahabitats 3aadverse effects 3aFrance 3aAustralia 0aMarsupialia1 aMASTERS, PIP0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2005 Dec., v. 42, no. 6 p.1012-1019dBlackwell Science Ltdx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01101.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009200174300001800266520156100284592002801845650002301873650005201896650001501948650002001963650001101983650001301994650001602007650001302023650001602036650001302052653001502065653001302080653002102093653002102114653002402135700002202159700001902181773009902200856008602299852000902385655001202394IND60742990220221119071214.0210813e20210816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074299022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujimoto, Akane B.10aSignificance of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody testing during COVID-19 vaccine allocation  ap. 5055-5063.  aTo assess the value of using SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody testing to prioritize the vaccination of susceptible individuals as part of a COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan when vaccine supply is limited.An extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The vaccine was modeled as a single dose vaccine with 90% and 70% efficacy. The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths.The use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest percentage reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed.Antibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantibodies 3adecision making 3amodels 3apandemic 3aprobability 3aserology 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aCOVID-19 0aNatural immunity 0aAntibody testing 0aResource allocation1 aKeskinocak, Pinar1 aYildirim, Inci0 tVaccine.g2021 Aug. 16, v. 39, no. 35 p.5055-5063dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010900166500001400275520137300289592002801662650001501690650000901705650001501714650001901729650002201748650001401770650001301784650000801797650001001805650002401815650001101839650001501850650001001865650001901875650001301894650002501907650001001932651001401942700002001956700002301976700002301999700002102022773012802043856007402171852000902245655001202254IND60724591220221123014811.0210122e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072459122DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130202052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHochreuther, Philipp 10aFully Automated Detection of Supraglacial Lake Area for Northeast Greenland Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series  aNAL-light  aThe usability of multispectral satellite data for detecting and monitoring supraglacial meltwater ponds has been demonstrated for western Greenland. For a multitemporal analysis of large regions or entire Greenland, largely automated processing routines are required. Here, we present a sequence of algorithms that allow for an automated Sentinel-2 data search, download, processing, and generation of a consistent and dense melt pond area time-series based on open-source software. We test our approach for a ~82,000 km² area at the 79 °N Glacier (Nioghalvfjerdsbrae) in northeast Greenland, covering the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Our lake detection is based on the ratio of the blue and red visible bands using a minimum threshold. To remove false classification caused by the similar spectra of shadow and water on ice, we implement a shadow model to mask out topographically induced artifacts. We identified 880 individual lakes, traceable over 479 time-steps throughout 2016–2019, with an average size of 64,212 m². Of the four years, 2019 had the most extensive lake area coverage with a maximum of 333 km² and a maximum individual lake size of 30 km². With 1.5 days average observation interval, our time-series allows for a comparison with climate data of daily resolution, enabling a better understanding of short-term climate-glacier feedbacks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aarea 3aautomation 3aclassification 3acomputer software 3adetection 3aglaciers 3aice 3alakes 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aponds 3aremote sensing 3asnowmelt 3atime series analysis 3awater 3aGreenland1 aNeckel, Niklas 1 aReimann, Nathalie 1 aHumbert, Angelika 1 aBraun, Matthias 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130202053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009100163300001800254520161600272592002801888650004401916650002201960650003001982650002302012650004302035650001202078650002402090650004402114650002202158650000702180650002102187653001002208653002402218653001402242653000802256653000902264653003002273700001802303700001602321773008102337856008102418852000902499655001202508IND60529243620221119082736.0161019e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Dong-Ya14aThe synthesis and process optimization of sulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin derivatives  ap. 3105-3112.  aA series of sulfobutyl ether β-Cyclodextrins (SBE-β-CDs) with specific average degree of substitution (DS) were successfully synthesized, using a three-step synthesis method, through the reaction between β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) and 1, 4-butane sultone in the sodium hydroxide solution. Although the ratio of β-CD and 1, 4-butane sultone is a dominant factor affecting the average degree of substitution of products, a typical optimization on other synthesis parameters is also necessary to precisely obtain these products. The optimization includes the addition of sodium hydroxide solution, the range of pH and reaction time in different reaction stages. Actually, each product is a mixture with various degrees of substitution and different positional isomers. Under the optimal conditions, the average degree of substitution and the characterizations of SBE-β-CDs were investigated by means of FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HRMS, Capillary Electrophoresis, DSC and HPLC. The results indicated that the substitution reaction occurred simultaneously on C6–OH and C2–OH in the moderate alkaline solution and the proportion of C2–OH substituted increased with the increase of DS. The DS of SBE-β-CDs had better reproducibility and the distribution of composition analyzed by capillary electrophoresis was a normal distribution. In the novel synthesis process, the yield of the products was significantly improved. For example, the yield of SBE7-β-CD reached up to 80%. Moreover, the DS of SBE7-β-CD was 6.68 and the purity of SBE7-β-CD was 96% in line with quality standards of United States Pharmacopeia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achemical reactions 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aisomers 3anormal distribution 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3asodium hydroxide 0aβ-CD 0a1, 4-Butane sultone 0aSBE-β-CD 0aNMR 0aHRMS 0aCapillary electrophoresis1 aZhang, Yi-Min1 aXu, Jing-Na0 tTetrahedron.g2016 June 02, v. 72 p.3105-3112dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245006300161520162600224592002801850650000801878650002301886650001501909650001601924650001001940650004201950650001601992650001902008650000902027650001402036700002102050700002202071700002202093700002302115700002402138700003102162700002102193700002102214700002302235773011802258856007702376852000902453655001202462IND60703059220221121084209.0200719e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070305922DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110605902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelova, Vera 10aNIPT Technique Based on the Use of Long Chimeric DNA Reads  aNon-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy on Chromosomes 21 (T21), 18 (T18) and 13 (T13) is actively used in clinical practice around the world. One of the limitations of the wider implementation of this test is the high cost of the analysis itself, as high-throughput sequencing is still relatively expensive. At the same time, there is an increasing trend in the length of reads yielded by sequencers. Since extracellular DNA is short, in the order of 140–160 bp, it is not possible to effectively use long reads. The authors used high-performance sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) libraries that went through additional stages of enzymatic fragmentation and random ligation of the resulting products to create long chimeric reads. The authors used a controlled set of samples to analyze a set of cfDNA samples from pregnant women with a high risk of fetus aneuploidy according to the results of the first trimester screening and confirmed by invasive karyotyping of the fetus using laboratory and analytical approaches developed by the authors. They evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, PPV (positive predictive value), and NPV (negative predictive value) of the results. The authors developed a technique for constructing long chimeric reads from short cfDNA fragments and validated the test using a control set of extracellular DNA samples obtained from pregnant women. The obtained sensitivity and specificity parameters of the NIPT developed by the authors corresponded to the approaches proposed earlier (99.93% and 99.14% for T21; 100% and 98.34% for T18; 100% and 99.17% for T13, respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical methods 3aaneuploidy 3achromosomes 3afetus 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3akaryotyping 3apregnant women 3arisk 3ascreening1 aPlakhina, Daria 1 aEvfratov, Sergey 1 aTsukanov, Kirill 1 aKhvorykh, Gennady 1 aRakitko, Alexander 1 aKonoplyannikov, Alexander 1 aIlinsky, Valery 1 aRebrikov, Denis 1 aKorostin, Dmitriy 0 tGenes.g2020 May 26, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110605903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03904naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245017300160300001800333520156000351536043601911592002802347596011402375596011402489596013002603650001202733650001902745650001202764650001202776650001702788650001602805650001902821650002102840650001402861650002002875650001102895650001602906650001502922650001502937651001002952651001802962653000802980653001002988653002302998653000803021653000803029700005503037700001403092700001803106700001603124773010803140856008103248852000903329655001203338IND60747539020221122224527.0210814e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074753902DNAL7 a10.1177/095968362110259662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jia10aBiogeochemical evidence for environmental and vegetation changes in peatlands from the middle Yangtze river catchment during the medieval warm period and little ice Age  ap. 1571-1581.  aThe reconstruction of past climates and vegetation can provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms of the variability of the East Asian summer monsoon in eastern China. In this study, organic geochemical evidence from the compositions of sedimentary leaf-wax stable isotopes and n-alkane parameters investigates the changes in vegetation and climate over the last 1200 years in the Xiyaohu peatland, Jiangxi Province, southeast China. Combined with temperature records, three climatic periods are presented: (a) a warm and humid period with an increase in C₄ plants from 900 to 1450 AD, which coincides with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP); (b) a cool and dry period with the expansion of C₃ plants from 1450 to 1800 AD, coinciding with the Little Ice Age (LIA); and (c) the Present Warm Period (PWP) from 1800 AD until the present, with warm and wet conditions. The sub-stages within the MWP and LIA intervals are also presented. The earlier MWP stage (900–1125 AD) was drier than the latter one (1125–1450 AD), and the earlier LIA stage (1450–1650 AD) was drier than the late LIA (1650–1800 AD). Increased solar irradiance and enhanced El Niño activities are related to the warm and humid climate during the MWP and PWP, whereas reduced solar irradiance and La Niña activities correspond to the cool and dry climate during the LIA. The present results provide insights into paleoclimatic changes in eastern monsoonal China and provide an understanding of centennial-scale climatic fluctuations and their driving factors.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41371202, 41671196, and 41977378), Major Social Science Project (20&ZD247), and the Global Change Program of the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant number 2016 YFA0600501).  aPublisher supplied data  a41371202cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a41671196cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2016YFA0600501cnational key research and development program of chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100012166 3aEl Nino 3aHolocene epoch 3aLa Nina 3aalkanes 3adry climates 3ahumid zones 3amonsoon season 3apaleoclimatology 3apeatlands 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aδD 0aδ13C 0aleaf-wax n-alkanes 0aLIA 0aMWP1 aMa, Chunmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3173-97781 aZhou, Bin1 aJiang, Jiawei1 aZhao, Cheng0 tHolocene.g2021 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1571-1581dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968362110259663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015400157500001400311520196000325592002802285650006702313650002502380650001902405650001502424650000902439650001502448650001602463650001102479650001902490650001202509650001902521650001002540650001902550650001002569650001102579650001402590651001002604700001602614700001702630700001602647773012802663856007402791852000902865655001202874IND60724591320221123014828.0210122e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072459132DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130202062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Shuo 10aMapping the Lithological Features and Ore-Controlling Structures Related to Ni–Cu Mineralization in the Eastern Tian Shan, NW China from ASTER Data  aNAL-light  aThe study of lithological features and tectonic evolution related to mineralization in the eastern Tian Shan is crucial for understanding the ore-controlling mechanism. In this paper, the lithological features and ore-controlling structure of the Huangshan Ni–Cu ore belt in the eastern Tian Shan are documented using advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) multispectral data based on spectral image processing algorithms, mineral indices and directional filter technology. Our results show that the algorithms of b2/b1, b6/b7 and b4/b8 from ASTER visible and near-infrared (VNIR)- shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands and of mafic index (MI), carbonate index (CI) and silica index (SI) from thermal infrared (TIR) bands are helpful to extract regional pyroxenite, external foliated gabbro bearing Ni–Cu ore bodies as well as the country rocks in the study area. The detailed interpretations and analyses of the geometrical feature of fault system and intrusive facies suggest that the Ni–Cu metallogenic belts are related to Carboniferous arc intrusive rocks and Permian wrench tectonics locating at the intersection of EW- and NEE-striking dextral strike-slip fault system, and the emplacement at the releasing bends in the southern margin of Kanggur Fault obviously controlled by secondary faults orthogonal or oblique to the Kanggur Fault in the post-collision extensional environment. Therefore, the ASTER data-based approach to map lithological features and ore-controlling structures related to the Ni–Cu mineralization are well performed. Moreover, a 3D geodynamic sketch map proposes that the strike-slip movement of Kanggur Fault in Huangshan-Kanggur Shear Zone (HKSZ) during early Permian controlled the migration and emplacement of three mafic/ultramafic intrusions bearing Ni–Cu derived from partial mantle melting and also favored CO₂-rich fluids leaking to the participation of metallogenic processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aCarboniferous period 3aPermian period 3aalgorithms 3aarea 3acarbonates 3aenvironment 3afluids 3aimage analysis 3amelting 3amineralization 3apaper 3aremote sensing 3arocks 3asilica 3atectonics 3aChina1 aAn, Yanfei 1 aShi, Pilong 1 aZhao, Tian 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130202063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245020600171300001600377520140600393536022301799592002802022596010402050596009102154650002202245650001002267650001402277650001802291650001302309650001002322650001402332650000902346650001302355650001002368651001102378700002002389700002102409700001902430700002102449700002202470700001702492700002202509773010402531856008602635852000902721655001202730IND60767348520221117212459.0220215e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076734852DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2022.20268752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatysek, Marcin10aWhat habitat parameters are important for the survival of ground nests in mountain forests? Recommendations for protection of Hazel Grouse Tetrastes bonasia based on an experiment with artificial nests  ap. 258-266.  aPredation risk of artificial nests resembling Hazel Grouse Tetrastes bonasia nests was reduced in more diverse habitats and when roads and trails were closer. To determine the importance of habitat structure and the presence of roads and hiking trails for the predation risk of artificial ground nests. We investigated predation on artificial nests in mountain spruce forests with high tourist numbers in the Tatra Mountains, Southern Poland, in 2012–2014. Some 174 artificial ground nests resembling those of Hazel Grouse were set up and monitored. For 98 artificial nests, we compared environmental variables at two area scales, and the forest structure between predated and surviving nests. At the local scale (within 5 m) artificial nests were more likely to be predated at sites with lower occurrence of ferns and lying dead wood. At the wider spatial scale (within 100 m), nests were more likely to survive if near to roads and tourist trails. The occurrence of different tree species in the forest stand did not significantly influence predation rate of artificial nests. The mean daily nest predation rate was not high and varied between years (0.003–0.009). Greater habitat diversity and the presence of roads and trails increased the survival of ground nests. These results are potentially important for conservation planning for threatened ground-nesting birds, such as the Tetraonidae.  aThis work was partly supported by the Institute of Nature Conservation, Polish Academy of Sciences and grant funding for PhD students and young scientists given from the Institute of Botany, Polish Academy of Sciences.  aPublisher supplied data  cInstitute of Nature Conservation, Polish Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004382  cInstitute of Botany, Polish Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004382 3aTetrastes bonasia 3abirds 3adead wood 3aforest stands 3ahabitats 3anests 3apredation 3arisk 3atourists 3atrees 3aPoland1 aGwiazda, Robert1 aFigarski, Tomasz1 aZięba, Filip,1 aKlimecki, Maciej1 aMateja, Radosław1 aKrzan, Piotr1 aPiątek, Grzegorz0 tBird study.g2021 Apr. 03, v. 68, no. 2 p.258-266dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11668x1944-67057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2022.20268753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245007800209300001800287506007600305520162100381592002802002506003702030650002102067650001302088650002202101650001902123650001502142650001402157650001702171700001702188700001602205700002002221700001702241773011702258856008102375852000902456655001202465IND60120565620221207121716.0150208e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012056562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-7123-72doi7 aPMC37301522pmcid7 a238128792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZellner, Phillip10aOff-chip passivated-electrode, insulator-based dielectrophoresis (OπDEP)  ap. 6657-6666.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, we report the first off-chip passivated-electrode, insulator-based dielectrophoresis microchip (OπDEP). This technique combines the sensitivity of electrode-based dielectrophoresis (eDEP) with the high-throughput and inexpensive device characteristics of insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP). The device is composed of a permanent, reusable set of electrodes and a disposable, polymer microfluidic chip with microposts embedded in the microchannel. The device operates by capacitively coupling the electric fields into the microchannel; thus, no physical connections are made between the electrodes and the microfluidic device. During operation, the polydimethylsiloxan (PDMS) microfluidic chip fits onto the electrode substrate as a disposable cartridge. OπDEP uses insulting structures within the channel as well as parallel electrodes to create DEP forces by the same working principle that iDEP devices use. The resulting devices create DEP forces which are larger by two orders of magnitude for the same applied voltage when compared to off-chip eDEP designs from literature, which rely on parallel electrodes alone to produce the DEP forces. The larger DEP forces allow the OπDEP device to operate at high flow rates exceeding 1 mL/h. In order to demonstrate this technology, Escherichia coli (E. coli), a known waterborne pathogen, was trapped from water samples. Trapping efficiencies of 100 % were obtained at flow rates as high as 400 μL/h and 60 % at flow rates as high as 1200 μL/h. Additionally, bacteria were selectively concentrated from a suspension of polystyrene beads.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3apathogens 3apolystyrenes1 aShake, Tyler1 aSahari, Ali1 aBehkam, Bahareh1 aAgah, Masoud0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 Aug., v. 405, no. 21 p.6657-6666dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-7123-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01611naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013700165300001800302520041500320592002800735650001400763650001100777650002300788650001400811653002100825653002300846653002800869653001200897653002200909700001600931700001400947700001500961700001600976700001200992700001301004700001301017773008101030856008101111852000901192655001201201IND60529243820221119082656.0161019e20160609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yaoling10aRu(III)-mediated intramolecular ortho-C(sp2)–H activation/oxidative acylation: one-pot synthesis of isatins from α-hydroxy amides  ap. 3193-3197.  aA novel and efficient synthesis of isatins from α-hydroxy amides via ruthenium-mediated aromatic C–H activation is described.

Based on data from 300 municipalities located in ten metropolitan areas in Poland over ten years, we identify whether we are faced with tax mimicking induced by political considerations in tax rates setting. In particular, we seek to identify whether the spatial interdependence of property tax rates set by local governments of Polish municipalities is driven by a yardstick competition mechanism.The analytical approach is based on the estimation of the spatial residential property tax reaction function by using spatial autoregressive panel models. In order to verify the presence of yardstick competition, we include a set of purely political variables in the models and test their impact on tax rate decisions.The results confirm the evidence of yardstick competition, which, however, is present only in a few of the examined metropolitan areas. We found nominal tax rates for residential buildings that were significantly lower in election years, and empirical evidence of several political factors influencing local tax policies in Poland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aland policy 3apolitics 3aproperty tax 3aresidential areas 3aPoland 0aD72 0aH30 0aH70 0aH71 0aH79 0aR00 0aR51 0aYardstick competition 0aTax mimicking 0aSpatial interdependence 0aMetropolitan areas 0aArea-based property tax1 aTelega, Agnieszka1 aGłuszak, Michał1 aMarona, Bartłomiej0 tLand use policy.g2021 Oct., v. 109 p.105613-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1056133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245009000181300001400271520118600285592002801471650002001499650001801519650001301537650001601550650002401566650001001590650000901600650001501609651001901624653001601643653002201659653002401681700001701705700002101722773010001743856008701843852000901930655001201939IND60537826120221121053639.0190405e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053782612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Rensburg, Thomas M.,10aWhat influences the probability of wind farm planning approval: Evidence from Ireland  ap. 12-22.  aThe purpose of this work is to explore the extent to which wind farm planning approvals in the Republic of Ireland are influenced by project technology, institutional processes, and site endowments. We use principal components data reduction, z-score data normalization, and Probit regression analyses on a unique revealed preference dataset covering 354 wind farm applications and planning authority decisions between 1990 and 2011. Notably, a unique measure of variable importance is employed that mitigates statistical problems and allows for the ranking of predictors according to their relative influences. Findings reveal that the duration of the local appeal process, decisions of local authorities and inspectors, identities of the appellants, and, projects that conflict with strategic development plans or generate visual externalities emerge as key influences affecting planning approval. Project technology features such as area, rated output capacity, and hub height, as well as site wind endowments, appear to be of less but significant importance. Alternatively, we find that proximity to dwellings, towns, or protected habitats does not influence planning outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afarm planning 3ahabitats 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3atowns 3awind 3awind farms 3aIrish Republic 0aWind-energy 0aPlanning-approval 0aRevealed-preference1 aKelley, Hugh1 aJeserich, Nadine0 tEcological economics.g2015 Mar., v. 111 p.12-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04254naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011000172300001600282520250000298536030402798592002803102596009603130650001103226650001903237650002103256650001603277650001403293650003003307650002503337650001503362650001103377650001303388650001903401650001303420650002203433650001703455650001203472650001503484650000903499651001003508651001103518700001703529700001203546773010803558856008503666852000903751655001203760IND60595663420221120121552.0180605e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059566342DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2018.14269772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichaelowa, Axel10aPolicy instruments for limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C – can humanity rise to the challenge?  ap. 275-286.  aIn order to mobilize the volume of mitigation required to reach a global emissions path consistent with 1.5°C, policy instruments need to be much more stringent than they have been to date. They will have to ensure full decarbonization of key economic sectors within one generation, which will require retirement of high-carbon assets before the end of their technical lifetime. However, political economy shows that only those instruments will be implemented that benefit well-organized interest groups while spreading costs as widely as possible. In the past, this has led to distortions such as emissions trading systems with systemic overallocation of allowances, or carbon taxes that exempt industry. Under favourable lobbying constellations strong subsidy schemes for mitigation can emerge. Renewable feed-in tariffs in Europe persisted for over two decades and were crucial for the breakthrough of wind and solar power technologies. But once competition from China led to the demise of European technology providers and the European population started to feel the pinch from the surcharges on their electricity bills, feed-in tariffs were abolished. Historically, rapid transformations of the nature required to reach 1.5°C built on either lavish public investment into the underlying infrastructure or a general notion of national emergency. Innovative forms of market mechanisms could convince policy makers that mitigation costs are lower than expected and thus accelerate mitigation. For the long-term success of far-reaching mitigation policies, it will be crucial whether they can be framed as harnessing an opportunity or whether they are seen as a grim, but grudgingly accepted response to a societal emergency. Key policy insights Interest groups play a key role in the design of mitigation policy instruments and reduce their efficiency as well as effectiveness. Instruments generating high carbon price levels may in the future be possible if redistribution of revenues is done in a way that soothes the key interest groups. A mixture of market mechanisms for mobilization of mature mitigation technologies with a dedicated public investment programme for emerging technologies seems promising, provided technologies can be ‘weaned off’ public support at the right point in time. For contentious, ‘emergency’ technologies such as Negative Emission Technologies (NETs) or Solar Radiation Management (SRM), governance mechanisms on the international level are critical.  aAxel Michaelowa and Perspectives Climate Research would like to thank the German Ministry of Education and Research for funding the project ‘Transformative Ambitionssteigerung – Der Beitrag effektiver Klimapolitikinstrumente (TABEK)’ (01LS1621A) in whose context this article has been written.  aPublisher supplied data  a01LS1621AcGerman Ministry of Education and Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003510 3aassets 3acarbon markets 3aeconomic sectors 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenvironmental engineering 3aenvironmental policy 3agovernance 3aincome 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3apolitics 3apublic investment 3asolar energy 3atariffs 3atechnology 3awind 3aChina 3aEurope1 aAllen, Myles1 aSha, Fu0 tClimate policy.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 18, no. 3 p.275-286dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19684x1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2018.14269773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010800168500001400276520211600290592002802406650001202434650003002446650000902476650001202485650001602497650001502513650001302528650001102541650001502552650001902567650000902586650001302595650003302608650001902641650001502660650002302675650001702698650002102715650001302736650001502749651001702764651001502781700002802796700001902824700002402843700002402867773012802891856007403019852000903093655001203102IND60724591620221123014723.0210122e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072459162DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130202012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharrua, Alberto  Bento10aImpacts of the Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique: A Multi-Temporal Landsat Satellite Imagery Analysis  aNAL-light  aThe Central Region of Mozambique (Sofala Province) bordering on the active cyclone area of the southwestern Indian Ocean has been particularly affected by climate hazards. The Cyclone Idai, which hit the region in March 2019 with strong winds causing extensive flooding and a massive loss of life, was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere. The aim of this study was to use pre- and post-cyclone Idai Landsat satellite images to analyze temporal changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) across the Sofala Province. Specifically, we aimed—(i) to quantify and map the changes in LULC between 2012 and 2019; (ii) to investigate the correlation between the distance to Idai’s trajectory and the degree of vegetation damage, and (iii) to determine the damage caused by Idai on different LULC. We used Landsat 7 and 8 images (with 30 m resolution) taken during the month of April for the 8-year period. The April Average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the aforementioned period (2012–2018, pre-cyclone) was compared with the values of April 2019 (post-cyclone). The results showed a decreasing trend of the productivity (NDVI 0.5 to 0.8) and an abrupt decrease after the cyclone. The most devastated land use classes were dense vegetation (decreased by 59%), followed by wetland vegetation (-57%) and shrub land (-56%). The least damaged areas were barren land (-23%), barren vegetation (-27%), and grassland and dambos (-27%). The Northeastern, Central and Southern regions of Sofala were the most devastated areas. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the relative vegetation change activity after Idai (NDVI%) and the distance to Idai’s trajectory was 0.95 (R-square 0.91), suggesting a strong positive linear correlation. Our study also indicated that the LULC type (vegetation physiognomy) might have influenced the degree of LULC damage. This study provides new insights for the management and conservation of natural habitats threatened by climate hazards and human factors and might accelerate ongoing recovery processes in the Sofala Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aadministrative management 3aarea 3aclimate 3acorrelation 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ahurricanes 3aimage analysis 3aland 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3atemporal variation 3atrajectories 3avegetation index 3awetlands 3awind speed 3aIndian Ocean 3aMozambique1 aPadmanaban, Rajchandar 1 aCabral, Pedro 1 aBandeira, Salomão 1 aRomeiras, Maria  M.0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130202013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245009900203300001800302520183400320592002802154650002302182650003102205650002102236650002402257650001902281650000902300650001502309650002502324650002302349650002402372650001102396650002202407650001702429700001902446700002102465700002602486700002202512700006502534700005702599773014702656856007602803852000902879655001202888IND60688554320200904000000.0200415e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068855432DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b132732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuladhar, Aashish1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2449-498410aIons Tune Interfacial Water Structure and Modulate Hydrophobic Interactions at Silica Surfaces  ap. 6991-7000.  aThe structure and ultrafast dynamics of the electric double layer (EDL) are central to chemical reactivity and physical properties at solid/aqueous interfaces. While the Gouy–Chapman–Stern model is widely used to describe EDLs, it is solely based on the macroscopic electrostatic attraction of electrolytes for the charged surfaces. Structure and dynamics in the Stern layer are, however, more complex because of competing effects due to the localized surface charge distribution, surface–solvent–ion correlations, and the interfacial hydrogen bonding environment. Here, we report combined time-resolved vibrational sum frequency generation (TR-vSFG) spectroscopy with ab initio DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD/DFT-MD) to get direct access to the molecular-level understanding of how ions change the structure and dynamics of the EDL. We show that innersphere adsorbed ions tune the hydrophobicity of the silica–aqueous interface by shifting the structural makeup in the Stern layer from dominant water–surface interactions to water–water interactions. This drives an initially inhomogeneous interfacial water coordination landscape observed at the neat interface toward a homogeneous, highly interconnected in-plane 2D hydrogen bonding (2D-HB) network at the ionic interface, reminiscent of the canonical, hydrophobic air–water interface. This ion-induced transformation results in a characteristic decrease of the vibrational lifetime (T₁) of excited interfacial O–H stretching modes from T₁ ∼ 600 fs to T₁ ∼ 250 fs. Hence, we propose that the T₁ determined by TR-vSFG in combination with DFT-MD simulations can be widely used for a quantitative spectroscopic probe of the ion kosmotropic/chaotropic effect at aqueous interfaces as well as of the ion-induced surface hydrophobicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3alandscapes 3aliquid-air interface 3amolecular dynamics 3aphysical properties 3asilica 3asimulation models 3aspectroscopy1 aDewan, Shalaka1 aPezzotti, Simone1 aBrigiano, Flavio Siro1 aCreazzo, Fabrizio1 aGaigeot, Marie-Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3409-58241 aBorguet, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0593-952X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 142, no. 15 p.6991-7000dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b132733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011100162300001800273520071600291592002801007650001201035650002301047650002301070650001001093650001701103650002101120650002201141653001801163653001701181653004701198653002001245700001401265700001401279700001701293700001601310773008101326856008101407852000901488655001201497IND60529244020221119082305.0161019e20160609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Fang12aA fluorescent probe for Cd2+ based on a diarylethene with pyridinepiperazine-linked hydroxyquinoline group  ap. 3213-3220.  aA new diarylethene containing a pyridinepiperazine-linked hydroxyquinoline group was synthesized.

In addition to vitamin D which is well established to have an association with osteoporosis, B vitamins, such as thiamine, folate (vitamin B9), and cobalamin (vitamin B12), could affect bone metabolism, bone quality, and fracture risk in humans by influencing homocysteine/folate metabolism. Despite the crucial role of B vitamins in bone metabolism, there are few studies regarding associations between B vitamin-related genes and osteoporosis. In this study, we investigated the genetic association of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 3’-untranslated regions of vitamin B-related genes, including TCN2 (encodes transcobalamin II), CD320 (encodes transcobalamin II receptor), SLC19A1 (encodes reduced folate carrier protein 1), and SLC19A2 (encodes thiamine carrier 1), with osteoporosis and osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). We recruited 301 postmenopausal women and performed genotyping of CD320 rs9426C>T,TCN2 rs10418C>T, SLC19A1 rs1051296G>T, and SLC19A2 rs16862199C>T using a polymerization chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. There was a significantly higher incidence of both osteoporosis (AOR 5.019; 95% CI, 1.533–16.430, p < 0.05) and OVCF (AOR, 5.760; 95% CI, 1.480–22.417, p < 0.05) in individuals with genotype CD320 CT+TT and high homocysteine concentrations. Allele combination analysis revealed that two combinations, namely CD320 C-TCN2 T-SLC19A1 T-SLC19A2 C (OR, 3.244; 95% CI, 1.478–7.120, p < 0.05) and CD320 T-TCN2 C-SLC19A1 G-SLC19A2 C (OR, 2.287; 95% CI, 1.094–4.782, p < 0.05), were significantly more frequent among the osteoporosis group. Our findings suggest that SNPs within the CD320 gene in 3´-UTR may contribute to osteoporosis and OVCF occurrences in some individuals. Furthermore, specific allele combinations of CD320, TCN2, SLC19A1, and SLC19A2 may contribute to increased susceptibility to osteoporosis and OVCF.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3aalleles 3abone metabolism 3adisease susceptibility 3afolic acid 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahomocysteine 3ahumans 3alongevity 3aosteoporosis 3apolymerization 3apostmenopause 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3athiamin 3avitamin B12 3avitamin D 3avitamin metabolism 3awomen1 aKim, Jung  Oh1 aAn, Hui  Jeong1 aPark, Han  Sung1 aChoi, Un  Yong1 aSohn, Seil 1 aKim, Kyoung Tae,1 aKim, Nam  Keun1 aHan, In-Bo 0 tGenes.g2020 June 02, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110606123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010400160300002000264520093400284592002801218650001501246650001601261650002001277650001701297650002101314650001401335650001401349650002601363700001801389700001901407700001701426700001901443773012401462856007401586852000901660655001201669IND60667566720221119054812.0190919e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066756672DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06144j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Kaiqiang12aA colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent probe for detection of palladium in the red light region  ap. 52516-52521.  aDeveloping probes for selective and sensitive detection of palladium in living organisms is of great importance. In this work, we synthesized a colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent probe (Probe 1) with red light emission (λₑₘ = 643 nm) by employing an isophorone based fluorescent dye as the fluorophore and an allylcarbamate group as the response unit. Based on the Pd⁰-triggered cleavage reaction, Probe 1 showed high response speed, selectivity, and sensitivity towards palladium species. Upon addition of palladium, the absorption and emission spectra of Probe 1 exhibited obvious red-shifts, which can be easily discriminated by the naked eye. In terms of palladium, the detection limit is as low as 24.2 nM and the signal-to-noise ratio in fluorescence intensity can reach 85-fold. As a red emitting ratiometric sensor, Probe 1 can be potentially used for quantitative detection of palladium in living organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3apalladium 3ared light 3asignal-to-noise ratio1 aLiu, Yunchang1 aLi, Changjiang1 aTian, Baozhu1 aZhang, Jinlong0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 15, v. 5, no. 65 p.52516-52521dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06144j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245013200173300001400305520116400319592002801483650002001511650001001531650001001541650001901551650001601570650001401586650001701600650001801617650001401635650002201649650001601671653002501687653003101712653002701743653003101770653003101801700001601832700001301848700001401861700001401875700001401889700001501903700001701918700001701935700001701952700001701969773009101986856009102077852000902168655001202177IND60611479220221120045101.0200427e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061147922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yitong10aMultifunctional melanin-like nanoparticles for bone-targeted chemo-photothermal therapy of malignant bone tumors and osteolysis  ap. 10-19.  aMalignant bone tumors associated with aggressive osteolysis are currently hard to be cured by the clinical strategies. Nevertheless, nanomedicine might provide a promising therapeutic opportunity. Here, we developed a multifunctional melanin-like nanoparticle for bone-targeted chemo-photothermal treatment of malignant bone tumors. The particle was originally fabricated from alendronate-conjugated polydopamine nanoparticle (PDA-ALN) that exhibited excellent photothermal effect and high affinity to hydroxyapatite. PDA/Fe-ALN significantly enhanced the magnetic resonance contrast of the bone tumors in vivo, suggesting that more PDA-ALN accumulated at the osteolytic bone lesions in the tumors compared with the non-targeting PDA. Chemodrug SN38 was efficiently loaded on PDA-ALN, and the drug release could be triggered by near-infrared irradiation and acidic stimulus. Finally, the combined chemo-photothermal therapy efficiently suppressed the growth of bone tumors and reduced the osteolytic damage of bones at a mild temperature around 43 °C. This study provides an efficient and robust nanotherapeutics for the treatment of malignant bone tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone resorption 3abones 3adrugs 3ahydroxyapatite 3airradiation 3amagnetism 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 3atemperature 0aMalignant bone tumor 0aMelanin-like nanoparticles 0aBone-targeted delivery 0aMagnetic resonance imaging 0aChemo-photothermal therapy1 aHuang, Quan1 aHe, Xiao1 aChen, Hui1 aZou, Yuan1 aLi, Yiwen1 aLin, Kaili1 aCai, Xiaopan1 aXiao, Jianru1 aZhang, Qiang1 aCheng, Yiyun0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Nov., v. 183 p.10-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024004100132040001800173100001900191245007500210300001600285506007600301506003100377520194800408592002802356596007002384596005802454506003702512650001302549650002402562650002102586650001202607650001102619650000902630650000902639650001602648650002202664650001902686650001002705650001702715650002202732650002102754650000902775650001102784650001502795653001702810653001602827653001402843653000802857653001802865700002002883700002502903700001802928700001902946773011602965856008503081961001303166852000903179655001203188IND60584920320221207072312.0190415e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058492032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2017.10.0172doi7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2017.10.0172chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabezón, F.A.10aEffect of floor cooling on late lactation sows under acute heat stress  ap. 113-120.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe objective was to evaluate the effects of floor cooling on late lactation sows under severe summer heat stress. Ten multiparous sows were provided with a cooling pad built with an aluminum plate surface, high-density polyethylene base and copper pipes. Treatments were randomly allotted to sows to receive a constant cool water flow of 0.00 (CONTROL, n = 4), 0.25 (LOW, n = 2), 0.55 (MEDIUM, n = 2) or 0.85 (HIGH, n = 2) L/min for 100min. The cooling was initiated 1h after the room reached 35°C. Respiration rates (RR), vaginal temperature (VT) and skin temperature (ST, 15cm posterior to the ear) were recorded before the trial, prior to cooling, and 5 times (20min intervals) after the cooling phase began. Rectal temperature (RT) was recorded before the trial, prior to cooling and in the last 20min of cooling. Water flow rates, inlet and outlet temperatures were recorded 5 times (20min intervals) to calculate heat removal after the cooling started. The procedure was repeated 8 times (2 times/d for 4 d), and treatments were randomly switched in each repetition. The mean room temperature and relative humidity during the trial were 35.1 ± 0.4°C and 68.4 ± 3.2%, respectively. Cooling treatments impacted RR, VT, ST and RT after 80min of cooling, where the mean RR's were 122, 76, 67 and 45 breaths/min for the CONTROL, LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH flow rate treatments, respectively (P < 0.001). After 80min of cooling, the mean VT, RT and ST were 40.1, 40.0 and 39.4°C, respectively for the CONTROL; 39.5, 39.5 and 39.0°C, respectively for the LOW; 39.4, 39.2 and 38.9°C, respectively for the MEDIUM; and 39.2, 39.0 and 38.6°C, respectively for the HIGH flow rate treatment (P < 0.001). Overall heat removal during the trial was 193, 321 and 365 W (SD=137) for the LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH flow rate treatments, respectively (P < 0.001). Cooling pads with LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH water flow rates reduced RR, RT and VT in lactating sows.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cPurdue Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000063770 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaluminum 3aambient temperature 3acell respiration 3acooling 3acopper 3aears 3aheat 3aheat stress 3alactating females 3alate lactation 3apipes 3apolyethylene 3arelative humidity 3askin temperature 3asows 3asummer 3awater flow 0aCooling pads 0aHeat stress 0aLactation 0aSow 0aFloor cooling1 aSchinckel, A.P.1 aMarchant-Forde, J.N.1 aJohnson, J.S.1 aStwalley, R.M.0 tLivestock science.g2017 Dec., v. 206 p.113-120dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2017.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245014900177300001400326520168800340592002802028650002702056650001402083650002502097650001402122650001102136650001002147650001502157650001702172650003102189650002602220650001402246650001702260650001102277650002402288650001402312650001302326650001302339650001302352650001302365653001702378653002602395653002202421653002602443653002302469700002302492700002302515700006602538700002602604700002002630700005602650700001902706773008902725856009002814852000902904655001202913IND60649448820221116222513.0190913e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064944882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Sinue I.10aFoliar persistence and residual activity of four insecticides of different mode of action on the predator Engytatus varians (Hemiptera: Miridae)  ap. 76-83.  aA greenhouse study was conducted to investigate the degradation kinetics of spinosad, flufenoxuron, dimethoate and imidacloprid in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) foliage and their residual toxicity on Engytatus varians (Distant) (Hemiptera: Miridae), a predator of the tomato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli (Sulcer) (Hemiptera: Triozidae). Insecticides were sprayed at 100% and 50% of their maximum field-registered concentrations (MFRC). Starting 6 h after spraying, leaf samples were taken every 10 d for 40 d and analyzed while E. varians adults were exposed to treated leaves to evaluate residual toxicity. Immediately after application at 100% MFRC, the residue concentrations were 73.34 μg g−1 spinosyn A and 59.2 μg g−1 spinosyn D, 9.21 μg g−1 flufenoxuron, 71.49 μg g−1 dimethoate and 31.74 μg g−1 imidacloprid. At 50% MFRC, initial residue concentrations were between 75% and 90% those at 100% MFRC. The estimated half-life (DT50) of spinosyns A and D, flufenoxuron, and dimethoate was between 34 and 40 d, while that of imidacloprid was 112 d. Flufenoxuron caused no mortality, while mortality due to spinosad was less than 10%, and only during the first 10 d. Mortality caused by either imidacloprid or dimethoate was around 100% up to 10 d after application, then decreased to around 30% after 40 d. Dimethoate toxicity was approximately proportional to residue concentration, while for imidacloprid there was an apparent threshold around 15 μg g−1. These results can be used to establish periods harmless for release of E. varians in the control of B. cockerelli on tomato crops under greenhouse conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactericera cockerelli 3aEngytatus 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aTriozidae 3aadults 3acrops 3adimethoate 3aflufenoxuron 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouse production 3ahalf life 3aimidacloprid 3aleaves 3amechanism of action 3amortality 3aspinosad 3aspraying 3atomatoes 3atoxicity 0aLeaf residue 0aDegradation half-life 0aResidual toxicity 0aZoophytophagous mirid 0aIntegrated control1 aMartínez, Ana M.,1 aFigueroa, José I.1 aCampos-García, Jesús1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8337-58301 aGómez-Tagle, Alberto1 aLobit, Philippe1 aSmagghe, Guy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-33131 aPineda, Samuel0 tChemosphere.g2019 Nov., v. 235 p.76-83dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.1633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009000162300001600252520153900268592002801807650001001835650003701845650002201882650002601904650001301930650001501943650002701958650001101985650002401996650001102020650002202031650002202053650001302075651001002088653002502098653002602123653001902149653001902168653001402187700002702201700002402228773012302252856007402375852000902449655001202458IND60131542120221122063617.0151127e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013154212DNAL7 a10.1676/12-129.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Christopher L.10aBrownsville Common Yellowthroats Maintain Genetic Diversity in a Fragmented Landscape  ap. 402-406.  aHabitat fragmentation is particularly severe in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas, where greater than 90% of the native wetland habitat has been replaced by agriculture and urban development. The Brownsville Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas insperata), a rare subspecies of the Common Yellowthroat restricted to this area, is a good model for studying the effects of this extensive fragmentation on avian genetics and ecology. In this study, three hypotheses addressing genetics and habitat fragmentation were tested: (1) the density of Brownsville Yellowthroats is greatest along the Rio Grande rather than away from the river; (2) individuals found on or near the Rio Grande are more closely related than individuals farther away; and (3) a source-sink metapopulation model is best fit to describe the population dynamics of this subspecies. We used 15 microsatellites to examine the genetic diversity of 128 individuals from Cameron and Hidalgo Counties (Texas) sampled during 2008–2009. The densities of yellowthroats at sites near the Rio Grande were not significantly different from densities at sites farther from the river. Genetic analysis indicated that individuals were as related to each other as would be expected in distant relatives and indicated the presence of a single, admixed population. The results suggest that the Brownsville Common Yellowthroat is able to move freely among isolated habitat patches and that wetlands along the Rio Grande do not act as an exclusive corridor for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3aurban agriculture 3aurban development 3awetlands 3aTexas 0aconservation concern 0ahabitat fragmentation 0ametapopulation 0amicrosatellite 0aParulidae1 aButler, Christopher J.1 aHaynie, Michelle L.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2013 June, v. 125, no. 2 p.402-406dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F12-129.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245009600203300001600299500002000315520084000335592002801175596005701203596005701260596006301317596006901380650001501449650001001464650002501474650001701499650001901516650001401535650001901549650002201568700002501590700002001615700001801635700001801653700006001671773011301731856008001844852000901924655001201933IND60786958420221119084825.0220807e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078695842DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.140322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUchida, Yutaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2790-687910aIdentification of chemical compounds regulating PD‐L1 by introducing HiBiT‐tagged cells  ap. 563-576.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProgrammed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) is a co‐inhibitory molecule expressed on tumor cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors focusing on the PD‐L1 mechanism are now being studied for the treatment of various cancer types. However, the regulatory mechanism of PD‐L1 is yet to be fully clarified, and a high‐throughput system for comparing the abilities of small compounds in regulating PD‐L1 has not yet been established. Therefore, we created a HiBiT‐tagged lung adenocarcinoma cell line, PC9‐KI, for easier and faster detection of changes in PD‐L1 protein expression. Using PC9‐KI cells, we screened 1280 chemical compounds from the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds and identified microtubule polymerization inhibitors and thapsigargin as PD‐L1 upregulators and a p97 inhibitor as a PD‐L1 downregulator.  aPublisher supplied data  a18K19603cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20H05696cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aAR050631cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health  aJP20gm0810008cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development 3acell lines 3alungs 3amedicinal properties 3amicrotubules 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolymerization 3aprotein synthesis1 aMatsushima, Takahide1 aKurimoto, Ryota1 aChiba, Tomoki1 aInutani, Yuki1 aAsahara, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5215-87450 tFEBS letters.g2021 Mar., v. 595, no. 5 p.563-576dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.140323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014800172500001400320520159100334592002801925650001901953650002801972650001502000650001202015650002202027650001002049650001002059650002102069650001702090650001002107650001002117653001602127653000802143653002102151653001402172653001402186653002002200653001302220700001602233700001702249700001802266773013302284856008702417852000902504655001202513IND60713034620221122001609.0201202e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071303462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2020.1041542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovegrove, M.R.10aDrosophila melanogaster and worker honeybees (Apis mellifera) do not require olfaction to be susceptible to honeybee queen mandibular pheromone  aNAL-light  aEusociality is characterised by the reproductive division of labour; a dominant female (queen) or females are responsible for the majority of reproduction, and subordinate females are reproductively constrained. Reproductive constraint can be due to behavioural aggression and/or chemical cues, so-called queen pheromones, produced by the dominant females. In the honeybee, Apis mellifera, this repressive queen pheromone is queen mandibular pheromone (QMP). The mechanism by which honeybee workers are susceptible to QMP is not yet completely understood, however it is thought to be through olfaction via the antennae and/or gustation via trophallaxis.We have investigated whether olfaction is key to sensing of QMP, using both Drosophila melanogaster- a tractable non-eusocial insect which is also reproductively repressed by QMP- and the target species, A. mellifera worker honeybees. D. melanogaster are still capable of sensing and responding to QMP without their antenna and maxillary palps, and therefore without olfactory receptors. When worker honeybees were exposed to QMP but unable to physically interact with it, therefore required to use olfaction, they were similarly not reproductively repressed. Combined, these findings support either a non-olfactory based mechanism for the repression of reproduction via QMP, or redundancy via non-olfactory mechanisms in both D. melanogaster and A. mellifera. This study furthers our understanding of how species are susceptible to QMP, and provides insight into the mechanisms governing QMP responsiveness in these diverse species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aaggression 3afemales 3ainsect physiology 3alabor 3apalps 3aqueen honey bees 3areproduction 3asmell 3ataste 0aEusociality 0aQMP 0aQueen pheromones 0aOogenesis 0aOlfaction 0aMaxillary palps 0aAntennae1 aKnapp, R.A.1 aDuncan, E.J.1 aDearden, P.K.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2020 Nov.,  Dec., v. 127 p.104154-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2020.1041543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011600159300002000275520186600295592002802161650002202189650001502211650002002226650001402246650001902260650000902279650001402288650001102302650001202313650002802325650001302353650002202366650001402388650001902402650001502421650001702436650003302453650002302486650002102509650002102530650003702551650001402588700002802602773012402630856007402754852000902828655001202837IND60667567020221119054801.0190919e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066756702DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06148b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakma, Sankar10aSonochemical synthesis of mesoporous ZrFe₂O₅ and its application for degradation of recalcitrant pollutants  ap. 53529-53542.  aIn this paper, we have reported the sonochemical synthesis and characterization of zirconium ferrite (ZrFe₂O₅), and its use as a catalyst in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using decolorization/degradation of azo and non-azo dyes as model processes. The efficacy of ZrFe₂O₅ for dye decolorization has been compared with the conventional catalyst TiO₂ synthesized using sonochemical sol–gel method. Sonochemically synthesized ZrFe₂O₅ and TiO₂ have been characterized using PSD, XRD, FESEM, TEM, DRS, BET and TGA. ZrFe₂O₅ is revealed to have a lower band gap energy than TiO₂. However, the α-Fe₂O₃ (hematite) phase in ZrFe₂O₅ acts as a recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes, which adversely affects the photo-activity of ZrFe₂O₅. In the context of degradation of recalcitrant pollutants, this adverse effect is compensated by Fenton activity of the α-Fe₂O₃ (hematite) phase which is stimulated by addition of H₂O₂. Sonochemically synthesized ZrFe₂O₅ also has high adsorption capacity for the textile dyes that assists their effective degradation through Fenton and photocatalytic mechanisms. The decolorization experiments have employed individual AOPs of sonolysis, photocatalysis, (heterogeneous) Fenton and various combinations of these as hybrid AOPs. Due to combined facets of photo- and Fenton-activity, ZrFe₂O₅ is a better catalyst for hybrid AOPs than TiO₂. Nonetheless, the Fenton-activity of ZrFe₂O₅ overwhelms the photo-activity in dye decolorization. The most efficient hybrid AOP is revealed to be sono-photo-Fenton, in which both photo- and Fenton- activities of ZrFe₂O₅ are utilized.

A rare form of NBPI, which maintains afferent muscle innervation despite motor denervation, does not cause contractures. As afferent innervation regulates various aspects of skeletal muscle homeostasis through NRG/ErbB signaling, our current study investigated the role of this pathway in modulating contracture development. Through pharmacologic modification with an ErbB antagonist and NRG1 isoforms, we discovered that NRG/ErbB signaling does not modulate the development of contractures in neonatal mice. Instead, ErbB inhibition impeded growth in nondenervated skeletal muscles, whereas increased ErbB activation exacerbated denervation‐induced skeletal muscle atrophy. This potential regulatory effect of NRG/ErbB signaling on neonatal muscle growth warrants deeper investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  cCincinnati Children's Hospital Junior Cooperative Society  cCincinnati Children's Hospital Division of Orthopaedic Surgery  aR01HD098280‐01cEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 3aantagonists 3acontracture 3ahomeostasis 3ainnervation 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3aplexus 3askeletal muscle1 aGoh, Qingnian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4108-29571 aNikolaou, Sia1 aHu, Liangjun1 aShay‐Winkler, Kritton1 aCornwall, Roger0 tFEBS letters.g2021 Mar., v. 595, no. 5 p.655-666dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.140343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013200156300002000288520092300308592002801231650001501259650002101274650001101295650002401306650002201330650001301352650001401365650001901379650001701398650001601415650002101431700001601452773012401468856007401592852000901666655001201675IND60667567120221119054826.0190919e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066756712DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06149k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Jinzhan10aHigh aspect ratio TiO₂ nanowires tailored in concentrated HCl hydrothermal condition for photoelectrochemical water splitting  ap. 53012-53018.  aTiO₂ nanowire/nanorod arrays grown on FTO substrate by hydrothermal reaction have attracted great attention because of favorable applications in dye-sensitized solar cells and quantum dot solar cells. In this paper, discrete vertically aligned TiO₂ nanowire arrays as long as 7.2 μm and diameter of less than 100 nm were successfully synthesized on FTO substrate via the hydrothermal method. The influence of hydrothermal precursor composition on morphologies of the grown wires was investigated. Photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance for nanowires with different lengths was studied; the best performance was observed for the longest array without a compact layer. The growth mechanism in concentrated HCl was also examined. The TiO₂ nanowire array developed in this paper provides an optimal structure for energy-harvesting applications requiring long and discrete nanowires as electron collectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollectors 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrochloric acid 3ananorods 3ananowires 3aphotochemistry 3aquantum dots 3asolar cells 3atitanium dioxide1 aGuo, Liejin0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 17, v. 5, no. 65 p.53012-53018dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06149k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015300162300001800315520137400333592002801707650001501735650001901750650002001769650003801789650001001827650000901837650001901846650000901865650000901874650001501883650001201898650002301910650001201933650001201945650001601957700001401973700002001987700001502007700001502022773009902037856008102136852000902217655001202226IND50089957120221122041554.0150215e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008995712DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-013-9750-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan12aA Sensitive Sandwich ELISA for the Rapid Detection of Mung Bean Protein: Development and Evaluation of the Effect of Thermal Processing on Detection  ap. 1305-1311.  aThe mung bean allergen has not yet attracted attention on a global scale for the potential hazards it poses to allergen-sensitive individuals. In the current study, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of trace amounts of mung bean proteins was established. Mung bean protein-specific antibodies produced in rabbits and mice immunized with protein extracted from mung bean flour were used as the capture and detection antibodies in the ELISA. The ELISA had a limit of detection of 4.99 ng/mL and did not show any cross-reactivity with nine different foods, which potentially coexisted in foodstuffs. Accuracy and repeatability were validated by spiking and recovery of mung bean protein in oat meal, milk, and soybean milk. The suitability of the ELISA for the detection of mung bean protein in thermally processed samples was established by subjecting mung bean protein, mung bean powder, and defatted mung bean powder to dry or moist heating. The results demonstrated that the accurate quantitation of mung bean protein can be established for samples processed by dry heating at ≤150 °C. Lower detection results could not be avoided for mung bean proteins subjected to either dry heating at temperatures >150 °C or with moist heat, most probably because of changes in protein solubility and structure of the mung bean protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflour 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3amice 3amilk 3amung beans 3aoatmeal 3aprotein solubility 3arabbits 3asoymilk 3atemperature1 aTan, Chao1 aZhang, Jieqiong1 aSheng, Wei1 aWang, Shuo0 tFood analytical methods.g2014 July, v. 7, no. 6 p.1305-1311dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-013-9750-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016400160300001800324520144400342592002801786650001201814650001701826650002501843650002901868650001001897650001301907650002801920650004301948650002201991650000702013650001602020650002402036700001302060700001402073700001402087773009902101856008102200852000902281655001202290IND50089957220221122053129.0150215e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008995722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-013-9751-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Jie10aCharacterization of Anthocyanins in Fruit of Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A.C. Smith by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS Analysis and Evaluation of Stability of the Major Anthocyanins  ap. 1312-1322.  aAnthocyanins in fruit of Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A.C. Smith were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole–time of flight mass spectrometry analysis. Contents of anthocyanins in K. coccinea fruit were determined by HPLC analysis. Colour stability, thermal degradation and antioxidant activity of purified cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside were further analysed. As a result, four anthocyanins were identified as delphinidin-3-xylosylrutinoside (1), cyanidin-3-glucosylrutinoside (2), cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside (3), and cyanidin-3-rutinoside (4). The individual content of anthocyanins identified was 4.36 ± 0.06, 3.01 ± 0.03, 49.92 ± 0.76 and 2.33 ± 0.04 mg/500 g deseeded K. coccinea fruit, respectively. Cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside was stable at pH around 1. Moreover, cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside was very sensitive to temperature change and it was even unstable at room temperature. Cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside tended to degrade into cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-sambubioside and cyanidin at high temperatures. Cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside exhibited much better 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical scavenging activities than those of butylated hydroxytoluene. However, cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside and other three anthocyanin components contributed little to the antioxidant activity of K. coccinea fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKadsura 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acolor 3acyanidin 3afree radical scavengers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3atemperature 3athermal degradation1 aZhu, Hui1 aLiu, Shun1 aLi, Heran0 tFood analytical methods.g2014 July, v. 7, no. 6 p.1312-1322dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-013-9751-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008200165300001600247520173500263592002801998650004402026650001502070650000802085650001702093650001502110650001602125650001802141650001202159650002402171650000902195650001902204650001802223650001302241650004402254650003102298650001202329650001102341650003302352650003702385653003002422653001502452653002402467653001902491653002902510653003802539653002502577700001802602700001902620700002002639700001602659700001902675700001802694700002002712700001602732700002102748700001602769773012502785856008302910852000902993655001203002IND60609467320221119224657.0181010e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060946732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGun'ko, V.M.10aBonding of doxorubicin to nanosilica and human serum albumin in various media  ap. 809-819.  aInteraction of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) (anti-cancer drug) with hydro-compacted nanosilica A-300 (cA-300) alone or cA-300/human serum albumin (HSA) at a small content of water (h = 0.4 g per gram of dry silica) in different dispersion media (air, chloroform, and chloroform/trifluoroacetic acid) was analyzed using low-temperature ¹H NMR spectroscopy, NMR cryoporometry and quantum chemistry to elucidate specific changes in the interfacial layers. Initial (bulk density ρb ≈ 0.046 g/cm³) and hydro-compacted (ρb ≈ 0.051–0.265 g/cm³ as a function of the hydration degree) nanosilicas were analyzed using nitrogen adsorption-desorption, gelatin adsorption, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), TEM, and infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Equilibrium adsorption of DOX onto cA-300 and cA-300/HSA was analyzed using ultraviolet–visible light spectroscopy. Photon correlation spectroscopy was used to analyze the particle size distribution in aqueous suspensions with various contents of components. DOX more strongly bound to HSA than silica also affects structure of interfacial water layers that depends on dispersion media because chloroform as immiscible with water changes the water organization to enlarge water structures. In aqueous media, DOX alone remains mainly in the form of nano/microparticles (50 nm–2 µm in size). However, with the presence of cA-300, cA-300/HSA, and HSA alone DOX transforms into pure nano-sized structures. These effects are explained by effective bonding of DOX to HSA having good transport properties with respect to drug molecules/ions that exceed similar properties of nanosilica alone, but cA-300/HSA can be a more effective composite as a drug carrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aair 3abulk density 3achloroform 3adoxorubicin 3adrug carriers 3agelatin 3ahuman serum albumin 3aions 3amicroparticles 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size distribution 3aphotons 3asilica 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aDoxorubicin hydrochloride 0aNanosilica 0aHuman serum albumin 0a1H NMR spectra 0aBound water organization 0aFreezing-melting point depression 0aDrug delivery system1 aKrupska, T.V.1 aAndriyko, L.S.1 aKlymenko, N.Yu.1 aSiora, I.V.1 aNovikova, O.A.1 aMarynin, A.I.1 aUkrainets, A.I.1 aCharmas, B.1 aShekhunova, S.B.1 aTurov, V.V.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 513 p.809-819dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245007000160300001600230520108100246592002801327650002601355650001301381650001601394650000901410650001201419650001501431650001201446650001401458650001001472650002001482651001101502651001801513651001501531653002001546653002001566653003001586653002601616653002301642653001701665700002201682700002401704700002101728773012301749856007401872852000901946655001201955IND60131542620221122055430.0151127e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013154262DNAL7 a10.1676/12-139.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, James A.10aNesting Ecology of McKay's Buntings on St. Matthew Island, Alaska  ap. 376-384.  aThe McKay's Bunting (Plectrophenax hyperboreus) is one of the rarest passerine species in North America and breeds solely on St. Matthew and Hall islands in the remote Bering Sea, Alaska. We examined the nesting ecology of this poorly studied species on St. Matthew Island in 1982, 1983, and 2003. We found that the high breeding density of the McKay's Bunting may account for the lower clutch size and number of young fledged per successful nest compared to its sister species, the Snow Bunting (P. nivalis). The proportion of eggs that successfully hatched was higher for McKay's Buntings than Snow Buntings breeding at other Arctic locations in North America. Daily nest survival declined during egg-laying and incubation and increased throughout the nestling period. Nesting chronology was earlier in 2003 compared to the 1980s; however, daily nest survival was similar between decades. To assess how McKay's Buntings are responding to climate-mediated changes to physical and biotic conditions, we recommend monitoring the species' reproductive rates and population size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlectrophenax nivalis 3abreeding 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3aislands 3amonitoring 3anesting 3anestlings 3anests 3apopulation size 3aAlaska 3aArctic region 3aBering Sea 0aMcKay's Bunting 0anesting ecology 0aPlectrophenax hyperboreus 0aPlectrophenax nivalis 0aSt. Matthew Island 0aSnow Bunting1 aDeCicco, Lucas H.1 aMatsuoka, Steven M.1 aSowls, Arthur L.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2013 June, v. 125, no. 2 p.376-384dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F12-139.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245013700160300001800297520148800315592002801803650001601831650001501847650002301862650003001885650002301915650002201938650002001960700005301980700005802033773013402091856007902225852000902304655001202313IND60741759520221120163741.0210618e20210603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074175952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c008392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Lihan10aAsymmetric Nucleophilic Allylation of α-Chloro Glycinate via Squaramide Anion-Abstraction Catalysis: SN1 or SN2 Mechanism, or Both?  ap. 8414-8424.  aThe nucleophilic substitution mechanism of enantioselective allylation of α-chloro glycinate catalyzed by squaramide organocatalysts was studied using density functional theory. Based on a comprehensive study of SN1 and SN2 pathways of a catalyst-free reaction, we found that the catalytic reaction slightly favors the SN1 mechanism, instead of the previously proposed SN2 mechanism. Further investigation of different leaving groups and nucleophiles revealed that this is not limited to the present reaction, and the SN1 mechanism might have been generally overlooked. For the squaramide-catalyzed reactions, the SN1 mechanism was predicted to be preferred. However, the rate-determining step of the SN1 pathway has changed from the chloride-leaving step to the C–C bond-formation step. Therefore, a first-order dependence on both substrates was predicted, in agreement with the observed second-order kinetics. Intriguingly, the lowest-energy enantioselective transition states (TSs) originate from different pathways; R-inducing TS corresponds to the SN1 pathway, while S-inducing TS corresponds to SN2. The calculated enantiomeric excesses of two squaramide catalysts agree well with the experimental values. Given the ubiquity of nucleophilic substitution reactions in chemistry and biology, we believe that our finding will inspire more studies that will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of important chemical reactions, and it may even lead to better catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aallylation 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aenantioselectivity 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganocatalysts1 aYang, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0435-67631 aWong, Ming Wah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2162-12200 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 June 03, v. 86, no. 12 p.8414-8424dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c008393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011500177300001600292520097200308592002801280650001601308650002701324650001601351650002201367650001301389650001401402650001901416650002101435650002201456650001401478650002101492650001701513653002601530700002701556700002601583700002801609700001901637700002801656700002901684773013501713856008701848852000901935655001201944IND60746580820221118233458.0211009e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074658082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.07.1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales-Sánchez, E.10aHeating-cooling extrusion cycles as a method to improve the physicochemical properties of extruded corn starch  ap. 620-627.  aThis work proposed a controlled method to modify the physicochemical properties of corn starch through heating and cooling extrusion (HCE) cycles. It was used native corn starch adjusted to 60% moisture. It was then subjected to 5 HCE cycles at 100 and 125 °C, at 10 rpm. Water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), resistant starch (RS), thermal properties, viscosity, FTIR, and X-ray were evaluated. For WAI and WSI, a gradual increase was observed on each HCE cycle. Thermal properties shown that enthalpy decrease with each HCE cycles due to more gelatinization. Viscosity properties shown a thermally stable starch conditions being directly proportional to HCE cycles. The RS increased for each 5 HCE. XRD revealed that HCE cycle changed the starch structure from an orthorhombic structure to V-type crystalline structure. Finally, it was concluded that HCE cycles is a method to produce corn starch with controlled physicochemical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acarbohydrate structure 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3aenthalpy 3aextrusion 3agelatinization 3aresistant starch 3athermal stability 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 3awater uptake 0aCrystalline structure1 aCabrera-Ramírez, A.H.1 aGaytán-Martínez, M.1 aMendoza-Zuvillaga, A.L.1 aVelázquez, G.1 aMéndez-Montealvo, M.G.1 aRodríguez-García, M.E.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 188 p.620-627dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.07.1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009300171300001600264520064400280592002800924650001900952650001700971650001800988650002101006650003201027650001101059650001401070650004401084650001801128653002401146653001701170653002001187653002001207700002001227700001901247700001801266700002601284700001801310700002701328773014001355856008501495852000901580655001201589IND60584921020221119043608.0190415e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058492102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2017.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgo, Trong Nghia10aCytotoxic cycloartane triterpenoids from the leaves of Markhamia stipulata var. canaense  ap. 251-254.  aFrom the most cytotoxic fraction of the ethyl acetate extract of Markhamia stipulata var. canaense V.S.

This article describes a bibliometric review of the literature on N. fowleri research indexed in WoS during a 51-year period. The VOSviewer visualization methodology was used to conduct a bibliometric study. The data included articles from the Web of Science database, nations, institutions, journals, keywords, co-authorship, co-citations, international collaborations, and citation rates. A total of 1106 articles were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The articles were cited 21,904 times in total (cited 12,138 times without self-citations). The average citation per article was 19.82. The Hirsch index was 63. The leading country according to the number of published articles was the United States of America (USA) (n = 447; 40.416%), followed by Mexico (n = 80; 7.233%), and Australia (n = 63; 5.696%). Other than these top three countries, the publications were from 74 countries globally. Especially after the 2000s, both the number of citations and the number of publications exhibited an increasing trend. The Virginia Commonwealth University (USA) (9.584%), Centers for Disease Control Prevention (USA) (8.770%), and Instituto Politecnico Nacional Mexico (4.069%) were the leading affiliations. Most of the leading affiliations were from the USA and Mexico. In conclusion, a bibliometric evaluation of N. fowleri was performed for the first time. Authors affiliated with institutions in the USA and Mexico have led scientific production on PAM. Efforts should be made to help developing countries with the highest prevalence of N. fowleri to develop scientific research networks with the USA and/or Mexico in order to increase research with interdisciplinary teams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNaegleria fowleri 3abibliometric analysis 3adatabases 3aAustralia 3aMexico 3aVirginia 0aNaegleria fowleri 0aPublications 0aBibliometric analysis1 aAlkan, Sevil1 aAydemir, Selahattin1 aGurbuz, Esra1 aUnlu, Ahmet Hakan0 tActa tropica.g2022 Oct., v. 234 p.106603-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03788naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245014500175300001600320520199400336592002802330650001202358650002902370650002802399650001602427650001202443650001202455650001602467650001902483650001802502650002202520650001002542650002402552650001302576650001402589650001502603650001402618650001502632650001402647650001102661650002402672650001402696650001102710650001702721650001802738650001502756651001002771651001802781653001402799653001602813653001302829653001902842653002302861700001502884700001502899700001602914700001802930773009102948856009003039852000903129655001203138IND60649449520221116222735.0190913e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064944952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yongdong10aLong-term changes of water quality in aquaculture-dominated lakes as revealed by sediment geochemical records in Lake Taibai (Eastern China)  ap. 297-307.  aThe rapid development and exploitation of the Yangtze River basin in order to ensure human food security and increase living space in recent decades has resulted in significant potential for degradation of water quality in the river and in hundreds of lakes. Understanding how lake environments have evolved to their present state under a variety of external influences is crucial for evaluating their current status and anticipating future scenarios of environmental changes. However, the lakes along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRY) are as yet little studied. Here, we described the long-term anthropogenic environmental transformations of a small lake (Lake Taibai) in the MRY area, based on a detailed quantitative geochemical analysis of the aliphatic hydrocarbons, nutrients (N and P), biogenic silica (BSi), and major and trace elements present in a dated sediment core retrieved from the lake. Our data revealed that levels of short-chain n-alkanes, αβ-hopanes and the trace elements arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) were all low for the entire record in sediments prior to ca. 1970, reflecting unpolluted natural state of the lake. Pronounced anthropogenic effects began to appear in sediments deposited in the subsequent years ca. 1970–1990, during which the levels of all these components were elevated, most likely driven by input of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) containing chemical fertilizers, pesticides and diesel oil respectively. Since ca. 1990, changes of short-chain n-alkane levels in the sediment suggested the lake had undergone dramatic eutrophication in which existing anthropogenic stressors were exacerbated by technological advances that extended the use of chemical fertilizer into aquaculture. This pattern contrasted with an otherwise comparable lake in the lower Yangtze River basin, Lake Changdang, in which trace element and petroleum pollution were much more prominent due to dramatic urbanization and industrialization of the catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aanthropogenic activities 3aanthropogenic stressors 3aaquaculture 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3adiesel fuel 3aeutrophication 3afood security 3aindustrialization 3alakes 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3apesticides 3apetroleum 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3arivers 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3asilica 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aBiomarker 0aLake Taibai 0aSediment 0aEutrophication 0aGeochemical record1 aYu, Jinlei1 aSu, Yaling1 aDu, Yingxun1 aLiu, Zhengwen0 tChemosphere.g2019 Nov., v. 235 p.297-307dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010600158300001600264520152500280592002801805650001301833650001101846650002401857650001401881650001201895650001301907650001001920650001401930650001101944650001101955650001201966651001301978653002201991653001902013653001602032653002302048653001802071653001902089653002102108700002202129773012302151856007402274852000902348655001202357IND60131542920221122063722.0151127e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013154292DNAL7 a10.1676/12-152.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Andrea K.10aAmerican Woodcocks' (Scolopax minor) Use Of Pine Plantation Habitat During Spring In Central Arkansas  ap. 322-328.  aWe evaluated sites on an industrial forest in central Arkansas that American Woodcocks (Scolopax minor) used for courtship during their spring migration. Our main objective was to determine the vegetation characteristics used by male woodcocks on their courtship sites within early successional pine stands. We quantified use within three stages of early successional pine stand; pine seedling (1 year old), young-pine sapling (2–3 years old), and old-pine sapling (4–5 years old). We used crespuscular surveys as an index to the number of woodcock using each stand. We completed surveys in January–March 2010 and 2011 on eight stands of each stage (n = 24) during 7–10 day sampling periods across spring migration. We quantified the vegetation structure of each stand including the percent of bare ground, standing herbaceous, flattened herbaceous, shrub, coarse woody debris, and canopy cover and horizontal density. We found that woodcocks used stands with greater shrub, standing herbaceous, and flattened herbaceous cover. This is different from other studies in the southern United States that have shown woodcocks to use areas with sparse vegetation and increased bare ground. We suggest this disparity occurred because previous studies assumed constant detection between stands with different vegetative structure, whereas we completed detection tests to determine how vegetative structure may influence detection between stand types and incorporated these differences in detection into our analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScolopax 3acanopy 3acoarse woody debris 3acourtship 3aforests 3ahabitats 3amales 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3aspring 3asurveys 3aArkansas 0aAmerican Woodcock 0acentral region 0ahabitat use 0aindustrial forests 0aloblolly pine 0aScolopax minor 0aspring migration1 aLocher, Alexandra0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2013 June, v. 125, no. 2 p.322-328dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F12-152.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03979naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015500169520211600324592002802440650002302468650002702491650002602518650001102544650001702555650001802572650001202590650000902602650001002611650000902621650002702630650001202657650001602669650001102685650001402696650001302710650001102723650001402734650001002748650001402758650001002772650001602782650001002798650002002808650001502828650001402843651001102857653002702868653001402895653002202909653002102931653001702952653002802969700002302997700002503020700002103045700001803066700002403084773011803108856008203226852000903308655001203317IND60713035320221121144517.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071303532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2020.1074772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkutse, Komivi S.10aCombining insect pathogenic fungi and a pheromone trap for sustainable management of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  aFall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a key invasive pest of maize and other crops in Africa. Entomopathogenic fungi play an important role in regulating the immature stages of this invasive pest as opposed to synthetic pesticides that are hazardous to human, environment and biodiversity. To tackle the adult stage of the pest (the moth) and to improve on the application strategy of the fungal-based biopesticides, this study evaluated the effect of various entomopathogenic fungi isolates on S. frugiperda moths. Twenty-two isolates (16 Metarhizium anisopliae and 6 Beauveria bassiana) were screened in the laboratory to assess their pathogenicity and virulence against S. frugiperda moths. The compatibility of the most pathogenic isolates with S. frugiperda pheromone FALLTRACT lure, the horizontal transmission of the inoculum among S. frugiperda moths, and the effect on oviposition were also determined under laboratory conditions. All 22 fungal isolates screened were pathogenic to the moths, but the mortality varied significantly among the isolates (P < 0.0001) seven days post-treatment. Beauveria bassiana ICIPE 621 and M. anisopliae ICIPE 7 outperformed all the other isolates by causing 100% mortality of the moths with the lowest LT₅₀ values of 3.6 ± 0.1 and 3.9 ± 0.0 days, respectively. Both isolates were also found compatible with FALLTRACT lure, as the lure had no effect on the conidial germination in the laboratory. Male and female moths were able to horizontally transmit conidia of both fungal isolates to untreated moths, causing high mortality of S. frugiperda in ‘donor’ and ‘recipient’ groups. In addition, the oviposition, hatchability of eggs and longevity of larvae were significantly affected on the fungal infected females. Although single moths still retained high conidial numbers 72 h post-inoculation, the number of conidia decreased with time. These results suggest that ICIPE 7 and ICIPE 621 could be used in combination with S. frugiperda pheromone in an autodissemination approach to suppress S. frugiperda population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aadults 3abiodiversity 3abiopesticides 3aconidia 3acorn 3acrops 3aeggs 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afemales 3agermination 3ahumans 3aimmatures 3ainoculum 3alarvae 3alongevity 3amales 3amortality 3amoths 3aoviposition 3apests 3apheromone traps 3apheromones 3avirulence 3aAfrica 0aEntomopathogenic fungi 0aPheromone 0aAutodissemination 0aAttract & infect 0aBiopesticide 0aLife-history parameters1 aKhamis, Fathiya M.1 aAmbele, Felicitas C.1 aKimemia, Jane W.1 aEkesi, Sunday1 aSubramanian, Sevgan0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2020 Nov., v. 177 p.107477-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.1074773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245008900157300001600246520148300262592002801745650001101773650001301784650001301797650002401810650001301834650001201847650002001859650001501879650002401894650002301918650002201941650002601963650001401989650001102003650002202014651001202036653001602048653001802064653001502082653002102097653001402118653001702132653002202149700002002171700002502191773012302216856007402339852000902413655001202422IND60131543020221122055510.0151127e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013154302DNAL7 a10.1676/12-153.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Tyler J.10aCommunity Patterns In Treatment Wetlands, Natural Wetlands, and Croplands In Florida  ap. 329-341.  aIn Florida, roughly 18,000 ha of treatment wetlands called Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) have been constructed on agricultural land to reduce phosphorous loads to the Everglades. Little is known about how avian communities in these STAs compare to those present on other similar land types. In 2008–2009, point counts were conducted seasonally in the STAs, nearby croplands, and natural Everglades marsh to compare avian communities among these habitats. Overall, avian densities were nearly three times greater in STAs than in the croplands and 38 times greater than in the natural marsh. Local species richness in the STAs was 78% greater than in croplands and nearly four times greater than in the natural marsh. Although natural marshes may have more structural complexity than the croplands and STAs, their oligotrophic status probably limits their ability to support a large bird community. Avian densities varied seasonally among habitat types; avian density was greatest in the winter in STAs as a result of high densities of migratory waterfowl. The STAs may be providing wintering habitat to a significant portion of the North American waterfowl population, including as much as 8% of the breeding population of American Coots (Fulica americana). If the trend of increasing numbers of treatment wetlands continues, it has the potential to alter the distribution of wetland birds, a group that has previously suffered population declines because of habitat loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFulica 3abreeding 3acropland 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amarshes 3amigratory birds 3aphosphorus 3apopulation dynamics 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3astormwater management 3awaterfowl 3awinter 3awintering grounds 3aFlorida 0aagriculture 0aAmerican Coot 0aEverglades 0ahabitat creation 0awaterfowl 0awetland loss 0awintering habitat1 aGawlik, Dale E.1 aPearlstine, Elise V.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2013 June, v. 125, no. 2 p.329-341dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F12-153.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245017700187520103700364592002801401650002201429650001001451650002701461650001401488650002001502650002101522650002101543650002001564650001701584650001401601650001501615650001501630650001701645650002101662650002001683650001701703650002001720650001401740651001101754653002201765653001901787653002601806653002801832653002501860700002401885700002801909700002101937773009701958856009002055852000902145655001202154IND60782682920221116222358.0220824e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078268292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehesa-Rodríguez, Génesis10aTrypanosoma cruzi blood trypomastigotes induce intense skeletal and cardiac muscle damage and Th1/ Th2 immune response in the acute phase of mice infected by the oral route  aOral acquisition of Trypanosoma cruzi is a foodborne transmission by juices and fruits contaminated with metacyclic trypomastigotes (MT) or by the ingestion of wild reservoirs infected with blood trypomastigotes (BT). In Mexico, hunting and food consumption of wild animals are current practices, which could represent a risk factor for oral infection in the rural population. In this work, Balb/c mice were inoculated by oral route with BT of a highly virulent T. cruzi Mexican strain (DTU I) to evaluate the establishment of the infection, and the humoral and cellular immune response in the acute phase of the infection. We show that BT induces blood and tissue parasitism producing an inflammatory process in the heart and skeletal muscle and low parasitism and inflammation in the digestive tract of orally infected mice. Besides, in the acute phase, the BT promotes splenomegaly, intense damage in skeletal and cardiac muscles, a humoral response dominated by the IgG isotype, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3ablood 3acell-mediated immunity 3acytokines 3adigestive tract 3afood consumption 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aingestion 3amyocardium 3aparasitism 3arisk factors 3arural population 3askeletal muscle 3asplenomegaly 3atrypomastigotes 3avirulence 3aMexico 0aTrypanosoma cruzi 0aOral infection 0aBlood trypomastigotes 0aHumoral immune response 0aCytokines expression1 aMartínez, Ignacio,1 aBastida-Jaime, Cristina1 aEspinoza, Bertha0 tActa tropica.g2022 Oct., v. 234 p.106605-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010500154300002000259520143600279592002801715650004401743650002301787650001301810650001301823650002001836650001601856650001001872650000901882650001801891650001801909650003301927650000901960650002201969650002101991700001702012700001202029700001402041700001402055700001702069700001302086773012402099856007402223852000902297655001202306IND60667567920221119055007.0190919e20150626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066756792DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06170a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei10aFabrication of carbon black coated flexible polyurethane foam for significantly improved fire safety  ap. 55870-55878.  aFire resistant coatings, composed of nanosized carbon black (CB) and polyurethane acrylate (PUA), were synthesized through a facile and low-cost method to improve the fire safety and thermal stability of flexible polyurethane foam (FPU). Scanning electron microscopy and total reflection Fourier transform infrared analysis results demonstrated the successful deposition of the coating on the surface of FPU foam and the morphology change of FPU with different concentrations of CB. Thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that the thermal stability of the coated FPU foams was significantly improved. The char residue of FPU/CB 8% was increased to 28.4% from 4.0 wt% of pure FPU. The coated FPU foam with a CB concentration of 8 wt% exhibited a great reduction of 80% in peak heat release rate (pHRR), attributing to the physical barrier effect of the CB filled coating. The observation of the char residue indicated that FPU/CB 4% exhibited the best shape char residue without collapse and cracking. Simultaneously, the SEM images of the char residues of the coated FPU foams showed that carbon black based coating promoted the generation of a compact char layer, suggesting a good physical blocking effect. Raman spectroscopy also confirmed that the graphitization degree of char residue FPU/CB 4% was the lowest, with the more stable structure. The coated FPU foam also has a certain inhibitory effect on the smoke release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acoatings 3acracking 3afire resistance 3afire safety 3afoams 3aheat 3ananomaterials 3apolyurethanes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoot 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aPan, Haifeng1 aYu, Bin1 aPan, Ying1 aSong, Lei1 aLiew, K.

One hundred and sixty meat samples were collected from ten different lots over a year. The PCR method included a 24-h primary enrichment step, a DNA extraction step, and a final 5′ nuclease real-time PCR assay, including an internal amplification control (IAC) and targeting the hlyA gene. Based on the analysis of 480 sub-units (three sub-units for each sample), the relative sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the real-time PCR assay were 77.3 %, 67.0 % and 73.1 %, respectively, corresponding to a Cohen’s kappa value of 0.69 (good agreement). Considering that real samples from the worse storage scenarios were included, these results suggest the PCR method as a rapid and accurate alternative method for the quick check of L. monocytogenes in meat lots before distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aListeria monocytogenes 3afood contamination 3agenes 3apork 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods1 aPasquali, Frédérique1 aLucchi, Alex1 aManfreda, Gerardo0 tFood analytical methods.g2014 July, v. 7, no. 6 p.1359-1365dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-014-9819-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009200154300002000246520134400266592002801610650004401638650002201682650003701704650001501741650001501756650002201771650001301793650002001806650002001826650001701846650002301863650001401886650001301900650001501913650003301928650002301961650001601984650002502000700001402025700001702039773012402056856007402180852000902254655001202263IND60667568020221119055009.0190919e20150604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066756802DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06178d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Lin10aAdsorption of Cr(vi) onto a magnetic CoFe₂O₄/MgAl-LDH composite and mechanism study  ap. 49791-49801.  aMagnetic materials as adsorbents can provide effective removal and quickly separate pollutants in wastewater treatment. A magnetic CoFe₂O₄/MgAl-LDH composite was successfully synthesized through a low saturation coprecipitation method. The adsorption behaviors of Cr(vi) from an aqueous solution by CoFe₂O₄/MgAl-LDH were investigated. The adsorbents were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Kinetic and equilibrium studies indicated that the experimental data of Cr(vi) adsorption were best described by pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir models. The maximum adsorption capacity of CoFe₂O₄/MgAl-LDH for Cr(vi) was found to be 72.4 mg g⁻¹ at an equilibrium time of 300 min and temperature of 283 K. Evaluation of the thermodynamics parameters (ΔH < 0, ΔS < 0 and ΔG < 0) revealed the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous. The mechanism study showed that the adsorption of Cr(vi) onto CoFe₂O₄/MgAl-LDH likely involved adsorption/surface complexation and an ion exchange interaction. This study demonstrated that the magnetic CoFe₂O₄/MgAl-LDH composite was an effective adsorbent for Cr(vi) removal with quick separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3acoprecipitation 3aheat production 3aion exchange 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3anitrogen 3apollutants 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment1 aShi, Zhou1 aPeng, Xiaoxu0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 04, v. 5, no. 61 p.49791-49801dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06178d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245009300170300001600263500002000279520086500299592002801164596004201192596005901234596007301293596004501366596005601411650002301467650002101490650001201511650002001523650001101543700002001554700002401574700002001598700002201618700005901640773011301699856008001812852000901892655001201901IND60786959520221119083702.0220807e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078695952DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.140262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTassis, Konstantinos10aSingle‐molecule studies of conformational states and dynamics in the ABC importer OpuA  ap. 717-734.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe current model of active transport via ABC importers is mostly based on structural, biochemical and genetic data. We here establish single‐molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assays to monitor the conformational states and heterogeneity of the osmoregulatory type I ABC importer OpuA from Lactococcus lactis. We present data probing both intradomain distances that elucidate conformational changes within the substrate‐binding domain (SBD) OpuAC, and interdomain distances between SBDs or transmembrane domains. Using this methodology, we studied ligand‐binding mechanisms, as well as ATP and glycine betaine dependences of conformational changes. Our work expands the scope of smFRET investigations towards a class of so far unstudied ABC importers, and paves the way for a full understanding of their transport cycle in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aERC‐STG 638536cEuropean Commission  aALF 47‐2012cEuropean Molecular Biology Organization  a722.012.012cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek  cZernike Institute for Advanced Materials  cRega Foundation Postdoctoral Programme of KU Leuven 3aLactococcus lactis 3aactive transport 3abetaine 3aenergy transfer 3amodels1 aVietrov, Ruslan1 ade Koning, Matthijs1 ade Boer, Marijn1 aGouridis, Giorgos1 aCordes, Thorben1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8598-54990 tFEBS letters.g2021 Mar., v. 595, no. 6 p.717-734dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.140263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245013800165300002000303520186800323592002802191650002202219650001402241650001202255650001902267650001402286650002302300650001402323650002502337650001102362650001802373650001802391650002802409650001302437650001902450650001102469650001402480650001302494650002202507650001602529650002102545700002102566700002702587700001702614700001502631700002102646773012302667856007402790852000902864655001202873IND60667568120221119055003.0190919e20150506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066756812DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06180f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutro, Jindrayani N.10aProduction of gamma-valerolactone from sugarcane bagasse over TiO₂-supported platinum and acid-activated bentonite as a co-catalyst  ap. 41285-41299.  aNowadays, biomass utilization has become the center of attention for researchers worldwide and is driven by the depletion of global petroleum supplies for the production of energy and valuable chemicals while easing the atmospheric CO₂ burden. We propose here a green strategy for transforming sugarcane bagasse into gamma-valerolactone (GVL), an attractive platform molecule that can be further converted into a variety of chemical derivatives for wide use in industrial applications. Our recent strategy involves the solid acid-catalyzed hydrothermal conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose derived from biomass to give an aqueous solution comprising levulinic acid (LA), followed by catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL. Native and acid-activated bentonites were used as solid acid catalysts to promote hydrothermal conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose. The maximum achievable yield of LA was 159.17 mg per gram of oven-dried biomass for 60 min reaction at 473.2 K in the presence of a 2% acid-activated bentonite catalyst. Catalytic hydrogenation reactions of LA to GVL over 1% Pt@TiO₂ and acid-activated bentonite as a co-catalyst were performed at temperatures of 393.2–473.2 K and residence times of 120–360 min. The combined solid catalyst gave an attractive performance with respect to LA conversion (∼100%) and GVL selectivity (95%) under milder reaction conditions in comparison to 1% Pt@TiO₂ without an acid co-catalyst. The spent catalyst could be reused for five consecutive hydrogenation cycles with a marginal decrease in the catalytic activity and GVL selectivity. Coke formation was believed to be the main cause of catalyst poisoning and calcination of the spent catalyst under a stream of pure oxygen at 723.2 K was applied for removing coke deposits from the active catalyst sites, thus restoring the catalytic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abentonite 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3achemical derivatives 3aenergy 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrogenation 3aindustrial applications 3alactones 3alevulinic acid 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3aplatinum 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aKurniawan, Alfin1 aSoetaredjo, Felycia E.1 aLin, Shi-Yow1 aJu, Yi-Hsu1 aIsmadji, Suryadi0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 06, v. 5, no. 51 p.41285-41299dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06180f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013000169300001600299520132600315592002801641650001001669650002101679650001801700650001401718650001401732650001401746650001401760650001901774650001701793650001501810650002101825650001701846650002001863650001801883650001401901650001001915650002201925650003701947650003901984650001102023650001002034653002702044653001202071653003002083653002402113700001402137700001702151700001302168700001902181700001202200700001602212700001602228700001302244700001202257700001202269773013502281856008702416852000902503655001202512IND60746581220221118233316.0211009e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074658122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.07.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Kunhong14aThe immunomodulatory function of the porcine β-defensin 129: Alleviate inflammatory response induced by LPS in IPEC-J2 cells  ap. 473-481.  aβ-defensin family plays a critical role in host defense against infections. In this study, we found that pBD129 are widely expressed in porcine tissues such as the intestine, liver, and spleen. Interestingly, the expression level of pBD129 in most tissues was higher in Tibetan pigs than in DLY (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) pigs (P < 0.05), and was significantly upregulated upon E. coli K88 infection (P < 0.05). The pBD129 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli and the molecule weight was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 37.2 kDa. Mass spectrometry verified the protein as a pBD129. The protein showed antibacterial activities against Streptococcus and E. coli DH5α with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 32 μg/mL. Hemolytic and cytotoxicity assays indicated that pBD129 had no detrimental effect on cell viability. Importantly, pBD129 significantly reduced the apoptosis of porcine intestinal epithelial cells exposure to bacterial endotoxins, which was associated with down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as the IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα (P < 0.05), and down-regulation of apoptosis-related genes such as the caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 (P < 0.05). These results suggested that pBD129 is a novel modulator of innate immunity involved in mammalian inflammatory responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptococcus 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aendotoxins 3aimmunomodulators 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-6 3alandraces 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aspleen 3aswine 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aE. coli 0aPorcine beta defensin 129 0aLipopolysaccharides1 aSu, Guoqi1 aChen, Daiwen1 aYu, Bing1 aHuang, Zhiqing1 aYu, Jie1 aZheng, Ping1 aLuo, Yuheng1 aYan, Hui1 aLi, Hua1 aHe, Jun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 188 p.473-481dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.07.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016900169500001900338520139600357592002801753650001301781650002601794650002601820650001101846650000901857650002401866650002201890650001001912650001101922650002401933650001501957650001301972650001401985650001301999650001202012651001002024653001602034653003302050653000902083653002502092653002402117700001602141700001102157700001802168700002402186700001602210700001402226700001302240773011402253856008602367852000902453655001202462IND60696270920221120180743.0201118e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069627092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1229842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiazhong10aExploring the disparity of inhalable bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance genes between hazy days and non-hazy days in a cold megacity in Northeast China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe physicochemical properties of inhalable particles during hazy days have been extensively studied, but their biological health threats have not been well-explored. This study aimed to explore the impacts of haze pollution on airborne bacteria and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) by conducting a comparative study of the bacterial community structure and functions, pathogenic compositions, and ARGs between hazy days and non-hazy days in a cold megacity in Northeast China. The results suggested that bacterial communities were shaped by local weather and customs. In this study, cold-resistant and Chinese sauerkraut-related bacterial compositions were identified as predominant genera. In the comparative analysis, higher proportions of gram-negative bacteria and pathogens were detected on hazy days than on non-hazy days. Pollutants on hazy days provided more nutrients (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) for bacterial metabolism but also caused more bacterial cell damage and death than on non-hazy days. This study also detected increases in the sub-types and average absolute abundance of airborne resistance genes on hazy days compared to non-hazy days. The results of this study revealed that particle pollution promotes the dissemination and exchange of pathogenic bacteria and ARGs among large urban populations, which leads to a higher potential for human inhalation exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial communities 3acities 3acold 3acommunity structure 3acomparative study 3adeath 3ahumans 3ainhalation exposure 3ametabolism 3anitrates 3apollution 3asulfates 3aweather 3aChina 0aBioaerosols 0a16S rRNA amplicon sequencing 0aqPCR 0aPathogenic bacterial 0aRedundancy analysis1 aLi, Dongmei1 aLi, Bo1 aSun, Shaojing1 aYabo, Stephen Dauda1 aGeng, Jialu1 aMa, Lixin1 aQi, Hong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Nov. 05, v. 398 p.122984-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1229843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04224naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010300172520242200275592002802697650002302725650002402748650002802772650002402800650001702824650001502841650001202856650001502868650001202883650002302895650001802918650002702936650002002963650001002983650001002993650002003003650001803023650002003041650002803061650001303089650001403102650002603116650002303142650001403165653001503179653002403194653002503218653002703243653002003270653002403290700002203314700002003336700002503356700002003381773011803401856008203519852000903601655001203610IND60713035620221121144537.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071303562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2020.1074802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolley, Victoria C.10aCordycepin, a metabolite of Cordyceps militaris, reduces immune-related gene expression in insects  aHypocrealean entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) (Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota) are natural regulators of insect populations in terrestrial environments. Their obligately-killing life-cycle means that there is likely to be strong selection pressure for traits that allow them to evade the effects of the host immune system. In this study, we quantified the effects of cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine), a secondary metabolite produced by Cordyceps militaris (Hypocreales, Cordycipitaceae), on insect susceptibility to EPF infection and on insect immune gene expression. Application of the immune stimulant curdlan (20 µg ml⁻¹, linear beta-1,3-glucan, a constituent of fungal cell walls) to Drosophila melanogaster S2r+ cells resulted in a significant increase in the expression of the immune effector gene metchnikowin compared to a DMSO-only control, but there was no significant increase when curdlan was co-applied with 25 µg ml⁻¹ cordycepin dissolved in DMSO. Injection of cordycepin into larvae of Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) resulted in dose-dependent mortality (LC₅₀ of cordycepin = 2.1 mg per insect 6 days after treatment). Incubating conidia of C. militaris and Beauveria bassiana (Hypocreales, Cordycipitaceae; an EPF that does not synthesize cordycepin) with 3.0 mg ml⁻¹ cordycepin had no effect on the numbers of conidia germinating in vitro. Co-injection of G. mellonella with a low concentration of cordycepin (3.0 mg ml⁻¹) plus 10 or 100 conidia per insect of C. militaris or B. bassiana caused a significant decrease in insect median survival time compared to injection with the EPF on their own. Analysis of predicted vs. observed mortalities indicated a synergistic interaction between cordycepin and the EPF. The injection of C. militaris and B. bassiana into G. mellonella resulted in increased expression of the insect immune effector genes lysozyme, IMPI and gallerimycin at 72 h post injection, but this did not occur when the EPF were co-injected with 3.0 mg ml⁻¹ cordycepin. In addition, we observed increased expression of IMPI and lysozyme at 48 h after injection with C. militaris, B. bassiana and sham injection (indicating a wounding response), but this was also prevented by application of cordycepin. These results suggest that cordycepin has potential to act as a suppressor of the immune response during fungal infection of insect hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aCordyceps militaris 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aGalleria mellonella 3abeta-glucans 3acell walls 3aconidia 3acordycepin 3acurdlan 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adose response 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3ainsect immunity 3alethal concentration 50 3alysozyme 3amortality 3asecondary metabolites 3aselection pressure 3asynergism 0aCordycepin 0aCordyceps militaris 0aSecondary metabolite 0aEntomopathogenic fungi 0aInsect immunity 0aGalleria mellonella1 aTeakle, Graham R.1 aPrince, Gillian1 ade Moor, Cornelia H.1 aChandler, David0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2020 Nov., v. 177 p.107480-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.1074803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04689naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001500162245016000177300001800337520242600355592002802781650001302809650001602822650002202838650001002860650001602870650000902886650001602895650001502911650001602926650001502942650002102957650001502978650001402993650002003007650001603027650001403043650001903057650001303076650000903089650001303098650001903111650002803130650002903158650001903187650001003206650002003216650001603236650001803252650001603270650007403286650001203360650001103372650001903383650002103402650003203423650001903455650001103474650002703485650004103512650003203553650003703585650001103622650001303633700001303646700001403659700001903673700001803692773009903710856007703809852000903886655001203895IND60083408720221120040848.0141101e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008340872DNAL7 a227209552pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-51212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, J.H.10aEffects of feeding crude glycerin on performance and ruminal kinetics of lactating Holstein cows fed corn silage- or cottonseed hull-based, low-fiber diets  ap. 4006-4016.  aThe objective was to determine whether crude glycerin could partially replace concentrate ingredients in corn silage- or cottonseed hull-based diets formulated to support minimal milk fat production without reducing milk production. Multiparous, lactating Holstein cows (n=24; 116±13d in milk) were assigned to dietary treatments arranged in a 2×3 factorial design; namely, 2 dietary roughage sources (cottonseed hulls or corn silage) and 3 dietary concentrations of glycerin [0, 5, or 10% on a dry matter (DM) basis]. Four different cows received each dietary treatment in each of 3 periods such that each diet was evaluated using 12 cows. Crude glycerin, produced using soybean oil, contained 12% water, 5% oil, 6.8% sodium chloride, and 0.4% methanol. Glycerin partially replaced ground corn, corn gluten feed, and citrus pulp. Diets of minimum fiber concentrations were fed to lactating dairy cows and resulted in low concentrations of milk fat (averaging 3.12% for cows fed diets without glycerin). The effects of glycerin on cow performance and ruminal measurements were the same for both dietary roughage sources with the exception of feed efficiency. Replacing concentrate with crude glycerin at 5% of dietary DM increased DM intake without increasing milk yield. Concentration and yield of milk fat were reduced when glycerin was fed at 10% of dietary DM. This was accompanied by a 30% reduction in apparent total-tract digestion of dietary neutral detergent fiber. Crude glycerin affected the microbial population in the rumen as evidenced by increased molar proportions of propionic, butyric, and valeric acids and decreased molar proportions of acetic acid. Efficiency of N utilization was improved as evidenced by lower concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and ruminal ammonia-N. Cows fed cottonseed hull-based diets consumed 5.3kg/d more DM but produced only 1.7kg/d more milk, resulting in reduced efficiency. Increased production of ruminal microbial protein, molar proportion of propionic acid, and passage of ruminal fluid resulted from feeding the cottonseed hull- versus corn silage-based diets, although apparent digestibilities of DM and neutral detergent fiber were reduced. Replacing 5 and 10% of concentrate ingredients with crude glycerin improved efficiency of 4% fat-corrected milk production when corn silage-based diets were fed but decreased it when cottonseed hull-based diets were fed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aacetic acid 3aammonium nitrogen 3ablood 3acitrus pulp 3acorn 3acorn gluten 3acorn husks 3acorn silage 3acottonseed 3acottonseed hulls 3adairy cows 3adigestion 3afeed conversion 3aingredients 3alactation 3alow fiber diet 3amethanol 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk fat yield 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritional intervention 3apropionic acid 3arumen 3asodium chloride 3asoybean oil 3aurea nitrogen 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCottonseed Oil 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fiberxpharmacology 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aGlycerolxpharmacology 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aRumenxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSilage 2aZea mays1 aWang, D.1 aKim, S.C.1 aAdesogan, A.T.1 aStaples, C.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.4006-4016dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-51213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012300165520144400288592002801732650001701760650002101777650002201798650002101820650003801841650001801879653001801897653001201915653003001927653003701957653002201994653002602016700005802042773010802100856008102208852000902289655001202298IND60782683320221116222924.0220824e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078268332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2022.1148062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimura, Hayato10aStrategies to simplify operation procedures for applying labeled antibody-based immunosensors to point-of-care testing  aPoint-of-care testing (POCT) is an ideal testing format for the rapid and on-site detection of analytes in patients, and facilitates disease diagnosis and monitoring. Molecular recognition elements are required for the specific detection of analytes, and biosensors that use antibodies as the molecular recognition elements are called immunosensors. Traditional immunosensors such as sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) require complicated procedures to form immunocomplexes consisting of detection antibodies, analytes, and capture antibodies. They also require long incubation times, washing procedures, and large and expensive specialized equipment that must be operated by laboratory technicians. Immunosensors for POCT should be systems that use relatively small pieces of equipment and do not require special training. In this review, to help in the construction of immunosensors for POCT, we have summarized the recently reported strategies for simplifying the operation, incubation, and washing procedures. We focused on the optical and electrochemical detection principles of immunosensors, compared the strategies for operation, sensitivity, and detection devices and discussed the ideal system. Combining detection devices that can be fabricated inexpensively and strategies that enable simplification of operation procedures and enhance sensitivities will contribute to the development of immunosensors for POCT.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3achemical species 3adisease diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunosensors 0aImmunosensors 0aASSURED 0aElectrochemical detection 0aSimplifying operation procedures 0aOptical detection 0aPoint-of-care testing1 aAsano, Ryutaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6795-83770 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 654 p.114806-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2022.1148063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007700166520119300243592002801436650002301464650005201487650002501539650002701564650002301591650002101614650001001635650001901645650001801664650002401682650002001706650001401726650002201740650002401762650001001786650002001796650002201816653001001838653002301848653002701871653004401898653003301942700001201975700001401987700001502001700001402016700001402030700001602044700001702060700001602077700001402093773011802107856008202225852000902307655001202316IND60713035720221121144505.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071303572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2020.1074812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Chuanfei10aTranscriptome analysis of the innate immune system of Hyalomma asiaticum  aTicks are considered to be the second most important vectors of human infectious diseases. The innate immune system is the key factor that affects its vector competence. Hyalomma asiaticum is the primary vector of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). However, the immune system of H. asiaticum remains virtually unknown. Here, a high throughput full-length mRNA sequencing method was adopted to define the immunotranscriptome of H. asiaticum infected with the fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana and gram-negative bacterium Enterobacter cloacae. The analysis yielded 22,300 isoforms with an average length of 3233 bps. In total, 68 potential immunity-related genes were identified based on similarity to the homologs known to be involved in immunity. These included most members of the Toll and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, but not the IMD signaling pathway. Moreover, two copies of Dicer-2 and five copies of Argonaute-2 were detected. These genes are postulated to be involved in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, which is an important defense against RNA viruses. Overall, this study provides the foundation for understanding the immune response of H. asiaticum to CCHFV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aHyalomma asiaticum 3aRNA interference 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3aimmune system 3ainfectious diseases 3ainnate immunity 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3aticks 3atranscriptomics 3avector competence 0aTicks 0aHyalomma asiaticum 0aImmunity-related genes 0aCrimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus 0aPattern recognition proteins1 aWu, Jia1 aPeng, Yun1 aLi, Yufeng1 aShen, Shu1 aDeng, Fei1 aHu, Zhihong1 aZhou, Jinlin1 aWang, Manli1 aZou, Zhen0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2020 Nov., v. 177 p.107481-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.1074813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245004400170300001800214520125700232536002701489592002801516596002501544650001401569650001101583650001301594650001301607650001801620651001801638653002201656653003101678653002201709700002201731700001801753773015201771856008401923852000902007655001202016IND60594686220221116171807.0180522e20171202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059468622DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2013.7821682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBawaneh, Khaled10aIndustrial facilities nonprocess energy  ap. 2259-2274.  aIn this study, published information on nonprocess energy use, which includes lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, humidity control, and particulate control, for industrial buildings has been analyzed and compiled and then represented in power intensity (W/ft²). More than thirty different sources of data related to industrial building energy use (covering about 82 buildings) were identified and analyzed. Energy receives a lot of consideration in analyzing prospective savings in industrial facilities since the industrial sector consumes more than 30% of the total energy in the US. The main objective of this study is to establish representative ranges for nonprocess energy use that can then be used with full process the life cycle for industrial products. The industrial manufacturing buildings were classified into six categories according to nonprocess energy use. The power intensity for each building category was estimated from the available data. Previous analyses of industrial energy use often expressed nonprocess energy as a percentage of total energy but without clear values of actual nonprocess energy. This information is a low value since the actual nonprocess energy is then dominated by the dominator which is unspecified.  aNSF (CNSFCMMI-053729).  aPublisher supplied data  aCNSFCMMI-053729cNSF 3abuildings 3aenergy 3ahumidity 3alighting 3amanufacturing 3aUnited States 0aEnergy efficiency 0aindustrial building energy 0anonprocess energy1 aOvercash, Michael1 aTwomey, Janet0 tCritical reviews in environmental science and technology.g2017 Dec. 2, v. 47, no. 23 p.2259-2274dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12197x1547-65377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2013.7821683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245010300207520185900310592002802169650002402197650003202221650002202253650003102275650001202306650001402318650001002332650001202342650001902354650002502373650001702398650001002415653001402425653001802439653001902457653001502476653001002491653001102501700002102512700001702533700005502550700006102605700002502666700006402691773012102755856008202876852000902958655001202967IND60782121220221122073248.0220830e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078212122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2022.1117092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMennigen, Jan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4117-665410aSocial status-dependent regulation and function of the somatotropic axis in juvenile rainbow trout  aJuvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) develop social hierarchies when competing for resources in a constrained environment. Among the physiological consequences of social status are changes in organismal energy metabolism, which generally favour anabolic pathways in dominant fish and catabolic pathways in subordinate fish. The somatotropic axis is an important regulator of metabolism and growth that could be involved in mediating metabolic changes in response to social status in juvenile rainbow trout. Here we used juvenile trout housed either in dyads or individually (sham controls) to determine whether social status changes indices of somatotropic axis function. Although pituitary growth hormone expression (gh1 and gh2) did not differ among groups, circulating growth hormone (GH) increased ∼12-fold in subordinate fish compared to sham and dominant fish. Social status caused consistent differential expression of GH receptor paralogues in liver and muscle, two principal target tissues of GH. Compared to dominant and/or sham fish, ghra paralogue expression (ghra1 and ghra2) was lower, while ghrb1 expression was higher in subordinate fish. Across tissues, ghra paralogue expression was generally positively correlated with expression of insulin growth factors (igf1, igf2), while ghrb1 expression was positively correlated with transcript abundance of hormone sensitive lipase (hsl1). Because igf and hsl expression are subject to context-dependent GH control in rainbow trout, these results suggest that increased circulating GH in conjunction with differential expression of ghr paralogues may translate into prioritization of downstream catabolic lipolytic pathways in subordinate rainbow trout. These findings support a social context-dependent role for GH signalling in mediating metabolic changes in juvenile rainbow trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression regulation 3ainsulin 3ajuveniles 3aliver 3amuscles 3aprioritization 3asocioeconomic status 3asomatotropin 3atrout 0aSalmonids 0aSocial status 0aGrowth hormone 0aParalogues 0aLiver 0aMuscle1 aMagnan, Julianne1 aTouma, Kenan1 aBest, Carol1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4769-42411 aCulbert, Brett M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2830-95901 aBernier, Nicholas J.1 aGilmour, Kathleen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9056-47040 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 554 p.111709-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2022.1117093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001500162245015400177300001800331520148900349592002801838650001301866650001601879650002201895650000901917650001401926650001201940650001801952650001901970650002101989650001502010650002202025650001302047650002002060650002302080650001702103650001402120650001202134650003002146650002702176650002202203650002402225650001902249650001102268650002802279650002202307650004202329650002802371650002702399650001002426650002802436700002002464700001402484700001602498700001502514773009902529856007702628852000902705655001202714IND60083408820221120040820.0141101e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008340882DNAL7 a227209112pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-50482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulido, E.10aEffect of reduction of milking frequency and supplementation of vitamin E and selenium above requirements on milk yield and composition in Assaf ewes  ap. 3527-3535.  aThe aim of this research was to study the effect of milking frequency and supplementation with a vitaminmineral complex above requirements on intake, body weight (BW), and milk yield and composition in highyielding Assaf ewes. Sixteen lactating Assaf ewes were used in this study, separated into 4 groups of 4 ewes each. Animals in 2 of the groups (control groups) did not receive any extra vitamin-mineral supplement, whereas animals in the other 2 groups (supplement groups) received daily an oral dose of 1g of vitamin E (1,000IU, dl-α-tocopherol acetate) and 0.4mg of selenium (sodium selenite anhydrous). The experiment consisted of 2 consecutive periods of 3 wk (twice-daily milking in both mammary glands) and 8 wk (once-daily milking in one mammary gland and twice-daily milking in the other gland). Intake, BW, and milk composition were controlled weekly, and milk production was recorded 3 times a week. Administration of the vitamin-mineral supplement had no effect on dry matter intake, BW, or milk production and composition. The reduction of milking from twice to once a day caused a decrease in milk production and lactose concentration and a significant increase in protein concentration, total solids, and somatic cell count, without affecting the fat content. Administration of a vitamin E and Se supplement at the doses used in the present study does not seem to exert, in the short term, a noticeable effect on the mammary gland when milking frequency is reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abody weight 3adry matter intake 3aewes 3alactation 3alactose 3alipid content 3amammary glands 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3amilking frequency 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3asomatic cell count 3atotal solids 3avitamin E 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDietary Supplements 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aLactosexanalysis 2aMilkxchemistryxcytologyxsecretion. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aSeleniumxpharmacology 2aSheep 2aVitamin Expharmacology1 aGiráldez, F.J.1 aBodas, R.1 aAndrés, S.1 aPrieto, N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.3527-3535dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-50483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008900170300001800259520125200277536041001529592002801939596005201967650001902019650002202038650002902060650002002089650002502109650002602134650001302160650001102173650001802184653002602202653002502228653001202253653001002265653001302275653002902288653003002317653002002347653001502367700002002382773015202402856008502554852000902639655001202648IND60594686320221116171823.0180522e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059468632DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2017.13709892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranz, Manuela10aCritical review on life cycle inventories and environmental assessments of LED-lamps  ap. 2017-2078.  aResource scarcity, hazardous waste, and climate change are the driving forces for developing energy efficient and low-toxic lighting sources. Currently, solid state lighting based on light-emitting diodes is expected to become the most dominant lighting technology of the future, mostly driven by its advantage with respect to energy efficiency. Parallel to the ongoing development of light-emitting diode-based lighting sources, a number of single case and comparative life cycle assessment studies of LED-lamps and components in varying study settings were carried out. However, these studies mostly rely to specific lamp designs, which limits general conclusions. This work includes a summary of the global market of lighting and LED-lamp technologies, followed by a comprehensive review and comparison of published life cycle assessment studies. In addition, we take also some aspects, which are relevant for the well-being of an end-user and which are usually not treated in life cycle assessment studies, like glare and health issues, into consideration. A critical interpretation of the assumptions and outcomes of these studies is given and questions that remain unsettled and therefore should be addressed in future studies are discussed.  aThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support of this work in the frame of the research project “Intelligent Color Conversion” (synonym “iCol”) by the “Klima- und Energiefonds, e!MISSION.at”, project No. 843877, launched by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, FFG.

Succinylation is a useful method of improving the functional properties of protein significantly. This study assessed the effects of succinylation on the functional properties of yak and cow caseins, including solubility, emulsifying property, water and oil absorption capacity, foaming property, and digestibility. Six succinylated levels of caseins were prepared by adding different amounts of succinic anhydride to caseins. The succinylated degree of yak and cow caseins was different when similar amounts of succinic anhydride were added. Succinylation improved solubility, emulsifying activity, water and oil absorption capacity, and reduced foam stability and digestibility of yak and cow native caseins. However, succinylation decreased foaming capacity and emulsion stability of cow caseins while increased them of yak caseins. The functional properties of caseins changed irregularly with increasing levels of succinylation. The findings of this study revealed that succinylation had different effects on the functional properties of different sources of caseins. The results will provide the basic data of functional properties of yak native caseins and succinylated yak caseins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3acows 3adigestibility 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3afoaming 3afoaming capacity 3afoams 3aresearchers 3asolubility 3ayaks1 aShi, Ying1 aWang, Pengjie1 aLiu, Hongna1 aWen, Pengcheng1 aRen, Fazheng0 tDairy science & technology.g2014 July, v. 94, no. 4 p.359-372dSpringer-Verlagx1958-55867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13594-014-0168-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009400172500001900266520131200285592002801597650001501625650002001640650002201660650001101682650001401693650001401707650001801721650001101739650000901750650001301759650002301772653001301795653002101808653003701829653001601866700002601882700002101908700002801929773011401957856008602071852000902157655001202166IND60696271320221120155822.0201124e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069627132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1229942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Madhu D.10aAssessment of cancer risk of microplastics enriched with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAbundance of microplastics in aquatic and marine ecosystems is contaminating the seafood and it is leading to transfer of toxic pollutants to human beings. In this article, we report the hazardous nature and cancer risk of microplastics which originate from e-waste. Capture of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) onto microplastics by adsorption phenomena and an assessment of probable cancer risk of ingested PAHs enriched microplastics by human beings have been investigated. The adsorption equilibrium was well fit for the Freundlich isotherm model. The adsorption capacity of carcinogenic PAHs on microplastics was ranged from 46 to 236 μg g⁻¹ and the maximum binding was achieved within 45 min in water. The leachate derived from microplastics of e-waste were highly hazardous in nature, for example, the sum of PAHs was 3.17 mg L⁻¹ which is about 1000 times higher than the standard for benzo[a]pyrene, a congener of PAHs. The calculated cancer risk in terms of lifetime of microplastic ingestion would be 1.13 × 10⁻⁵ for children and 1.28 × 10⁻⁵ for adults and these values are higher than the recommended value of 10⁶. The abundance of microplastics could transfer hazardous pollutants to seafood (e.g., fishes and prawns) leading to cancer risk in human beings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarcinogenicity 3aelectronic wastes 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aleachates 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3arisk 3aseafoods 3asorption isotherms 0aLeaching 0aVectoring effect 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aCancer risk1 aElanjickal, Anjana I.1 aMankar, Juili S.1 aKrupadam, Reddithota J.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Nov. 05, v. 398 p.122994-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1229943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245005600189300001800245520124600263592002801509650000801537650001201545650001501557650001101572650000801583650002101591650001201612650002201624650002701646650000901673650002301682650002901705650001001734650001501744650001301759650002801772650001301800650001601813700002801829700002401857700002201881700002101903700002501924700003301949700002201982700002102004773009402025856008102119990002302200852000902223655001202232IND60093866720221118225433.0141104e20111025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009386672DNAL7 a220321942pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapman, Jason W.10aAnimal Orientation Strategies for Movement in Flows  ap. R861-R870.  aFor organisms that fly or swim, movement results from the combined effects of the moving medium — air or water — and the organism's own locomotion. For larger organisms, propulsion contributes significantly to progress but the flow usually still provides significant opposition or assistance, or produces lateral displacement (‘drift’). Animals show a range of responses to flows, depending on the direction of the flow relative to their preferred direction, the speed of the flow relative to their own self-propelled speed, the incidence of flows in different directions and the proportion of the journey remaining. We here present a classification of responses based on the direction of the resulting movement relative to flow and preferred direction, which is applicable to a range of taxa and environments. The responses adopted in particular circumstances are related to the organisms' locomotory and sensory capacities and the environmental cues available. Advances in biologging technologies and particle tracking models are now providing a wealth of data, which often demonstrate a striking level of convergence in the strategies that very different animals living in very different environments employ when moving in a flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanimals 3alocomotion 3amodels 2aAir 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aAquatic Organisms 2aArthropodsxphysiology 2aCues 2aFishesxphysiology 2aGrasshoppersxphysiology 2aLarva 2aLocomotion 2aMovement 2aOrientationxphysiology 2aSwimming 2aTidal Waves1 aKlaassen, Raymond H.G.1 aDrake, V.

The institutional changes that follow the introduction of a CCA measure affect certain areas of governance, including social, political, policy, and other domains that are already exposed to prevailing institutions. Thus, understanding CCA necessitates analysis of the interplays between and among institutions that exist within a hierarchical structure, as well as the examination of how institutions across different scales define the challenges in CCA implementation. This article contributes to this discussion by investigating the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into local land use planning in Albay, Philippines. It applies a four-stage mixed methodology and uses a modified Institutional Analysis and Development framework as its primary analytical guide. Its findings imply that: (1) mainstreaming CCA is a multi-scale, multi-setting endeavour; (2) mainstreaming CCA operationalization involves networks of interacting institutions and institutional arrangements; and (3) addressing the challenges in mainstreaming needs extensive institutional transformations that reach across the various institutional settings within these networks. POLICY RELEVANCE This article advocates that, in designing strategies to address the challenges in mainstreaming CCA, analysts, planners, and policy makers must understand that the challenges exist within a network of institutional settings, and that these challenges encompass a chain of institutional interactions or interplays within this network. Accordingly, overcoming these challenges necessitates broad institutional reforms that go beyond the institutional setting where CCA is to be mainstreamed. Moreover, this article suggests that CCA policy making and analysis must focus on the vertical, horizontal, and network linkages and relationships created by institutional arrangements, as well as on the interplays facilitated by these arrangements. More importantly, there is a need to determine whether the institutional interplays between and among existing and planned institutions are complementary, counterproductive, conflicting, overlapping, neutral, or coexisting. Such knowledge will assist policy makers and analysts to understand the existing and potential barriers to, as well as identify opportunities for, adaptation. Consequently, the solutions to address the barriers, and the strategies that can take advantage of the opportunities, can be formulated effectively.  aThis work was supported by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-University of Queensland Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Scholarship [3018293].  aPublisher supplied data  a3018293cCSIRO-UQ INRM PhD Scholarship 3aclimate change 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3aland use planning 3apolitics 3aPhilippines 0aBarriers 0ainstitutions 0ainstitutional network 0ainstitutional interplay 0amainstreaming 0aopportunities0 tClimate policy.g2018 Apr. 21, v. 18, no. 4 p.499-511dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19684x1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.13142453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003700128040001800165100002500183245012400208300002000332520097600352592002801328596008301356650002201439650002001461650001401481650001001495650002101505650001901526650002001545650001401565650001101579650001001590650000901600650001501609650001701624653001701641653002101658653003901679653001001718653002001728653001601748700006001764773015001824856008101974852000902055655001202064IND60621989020221120174606.0181123e20181113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062198902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b032772doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b032772chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElhaj Baddar, Zeinah10aFunctionalized-ZnO-Nanoparticle Seed Treatments to Enhance Growth and Zn Content of Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Seedlings  ap. 12166-12178.  aThis study investigated the potential of ZnO-nanoparticle (NP) seed treatments for enhancing Zn nutrition in wheat (Triticum aestivum). We tested bare, ZnO core Zn₃(PO₄)₂ shell, dextran (DEX)-coated, and dextran sulfate (DEX(SO₄))-coated ZnO NPs and ZnSO₄ solution as an ionic control. We measured root and shoot Zn concentrations, lengths, biomasses, and seed germination upon termination of the assay. All ZnO NPs were more effective than ZnSO₄ in increasing tissue Zn concentrations and seedling growth. Exposure to higher concentrations of ZnSO₄ significantly decreased growth and germination rates relative to those of the controls and the ZnO-NP groups, whereas none of the ZnO NPs significantly affected seed germination. Bare and DEX–ZnO NPs increased Zn concentrations in wheat without decreasing growth. The results of this study demonstrated that ZnO NPs can be used as an effective seed treatment to enhance both Zn nutrition and plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aTriticum aestivum 3adextran sulfate 3anutrition 3aroots 3aseed germination 3aseed treatment 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3awheat 3azinc 3azinc oxide 3azinc sulfate 0aseed coating 0aZn fortification 0asurface-modified ZnO nanoparticles 0awheat 0aseedling growth 0agermination1 aUnrine, Jason M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3012-52610 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Nov. 13, v. 66, no. 46 p.12166-12178dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b032773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245019100166300001600357520170000373592002802073650001702101650002502118650002302143650002202166650001602188650002402204650001702228650001102245650002102256650001402277650002602291650001802317650001402335650002502349650001702374651001202391653001602403653003102419653000902450653001902459653000702478653000902485653001002494653000702504653000702511653000802518653000802526653000802534653001002542653000902552653001002561653000802571653000802579653000702587653000902594653000902603700001602612700001902628700001902647700001702666773012302683856008302806852000902889655001202898IND60742988020221118135739.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074298802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Gargi10aAssessment of clonal fidelity and phytomedicinal potential in micropropagated plants of Bulbophyllum odoratissimum - An endangered medicinal orchid of Indo Burma megabiodiversity hotspot  ap. 487-497.  aBulbophyllum odoratissimum (Sm.) Lindl. ex Wall. is widely used as traditional medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis, chronic inflammation and is listed as an endangered orchid due to over-exploitation and habitat destruction. The present study was carried out to establish a genetically stable in vitro regeneration protocol for mass multiplication using nodal segments and to determine phytochemical constituents, the antioxidant capacity of different parts (leaf, pseudobulb and root) of mother plants and acclimatized in vitro raised plants of B. odoratissimum. The synergistic effect of BA (4.0 mgl⁻¹) and IBA (0.5 mgl⁻¹) was found to be optimum for producing maximum shoot proliferation. IBA was found to be more effective for root proliferation than IAA, NAA and an average (3.08 roots/shoot) was obtained in 0.5 mgl⁻¹ IBA. The well rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized (more than 90% survival rate) in greenhouse, exhibiting normal development. The ISSR banding profiles confirmed high degree of genetic homogeneity among the clones. Extraction of all plant material from both mother plant and in vitro raised plant possess relevant TPC, TFC, radical scavenging activity (DPPH and ABTS) as well as total reducing power ability. HPLC chromatogram exhibited that phytochemical compounds detected in regenerated plants were similar to those present in mother plant and there was no remarkable difference. High regeneration frequency along with its genetic stability and secondary metabolite production validate the efficiency of this micropropagation protocol of B. odoratissimum for species recovery program as well as a potential source of commercial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBulbophyllum 3aantioxidant activity 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic stability 3agreenhouses 3ahabitat destruction 3ainflammation 3aleaves 3amicropropagation 3aplantlets 3asecondary metabolites 3asurvival rate 3asynergism 3atraditional medicine 3atuberculosis 3aMyanmar 0aAntioxidant 0aBulbophyllum odoratissimum 0aHPLC 0aPhytochemicals 0aMS 0aPGRs 0aNaOCl 0aCK 0aBA 0aNAA 0aIAA 0aIBA 0aANOVA 0aISSR 0aNTSYS 0aTPC 0aTFC 0aRP 0aDPPH 0aHPLC1 aSeal, Tapan1 aMao, Ashiho A.1 aVijayan, Deepu1 aLokho, Adani0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 Sept., v. 141 p.487-497dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04462naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245011000215300001100325500001900336520231500355592002802670596011602698596012902814596013202943596012203075596013203197650002603329650002703355650002103382650001403403650000903417650001803426650002603444650001703470700006103487700006203548700006403610700005403674700006003728773013603788856008303924852000904007655001204016IND60724695220221117233545.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072469522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-021-02966-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBăncilă, Raluca Ioana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7595-462110aFood level and light conditions affect the antipredator behavior in larvae of a stream-breeding amphibian  ap. 36.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding how long-term changes in environmental conditions influence the way that individuals cope with threats is essential in the context of behavioral adaptation to a rapidly changing world. However, little is known about the behavioral responses to predation risk for individuals that experienced different environmental conditions for extended periods of time, such as food levels and light conditions. In this experimental study, we tested whether previous long-term exposure to different food levels (low versus high) and light conditions (0-h light versus 8-h light) plays a significant role in shaping the antipredator response (i.e., the probability of emerging from the refuge and the distance moved) to stimuli from caged larval dragonflies, in larvae of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). Specifically, we quantified behavioral differences in the response to predation risk in larval salamanders that were reared in the laboratory for 2 months under controlled food and light conditions. The results of this study showed that the interaction between food level and light conditions affected the antipredator behavior of the larvae. Fire salamander larvae maintained at low food levels and in 8-h light conditions emerged from the refuge with a higher probability (i.e., took more risk) than larvae maintained at high food levels and all other combinations of light conditions. Thus, our results highlight the complexity of antipredator responses, pointing attention to the fact that interactions among environmental factors are likely to determine the magnitude of antipredator response. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Few studies have investigated the role of multiple environmental factors on the expression of predator-induced behavioral responses. Specifically, because no study has so far investigated the risk-taking behavior in individuals exposed to long-term, contrasting food levels, and light conditions, we investigated this in amphibian larvae. We showed that environmental conditions interactively determined antipredator behavior. This highlights the importance of considering long-term environmental conditions experienced by an organism and their interactions when experimentally studying behavioral variation to adequately understand its expression in natural conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a105BM/2017cUnitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii  aPN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-1536cUnitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii  aPN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2019-1233cUnitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii  a36355/23.05.2019cUnitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii  aPN-III-1.2-PCCDI-2017-0721cUnitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii 3aSalamandra salamandra 3aantipredatory behavior 3achronic exposure 3apredation 3arisk 3arisk behavior 3asalamanders and newts 3asociobiology1 aPlăiaşu, Rodica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9260-84991 aStănescu, Florina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6872-664X1 aSchmidt, Benedikt R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4023-10011 aNae, Ioana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4062-29231 aDenoël, Mathieu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3586-83230 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2021 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.36-36dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-021-02966-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011000173300001600283500001500299520190000314592002802214650001002242650001602252650001102268650001102279650001002290650001202300650003102312650001302343650001802356653001002374700002502384700003002409700002702439773008802466856008502554852000902639655001202648IND60111838020221119081343.0150812e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011183802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRacine, François10aEvidence of social information on food location in a ring-billed gull colony, but the birds do not use it  ap. 175-182.  a2019-12-04  aBird colonies are potentially rich sources of social information that can be used to compensate for the numerous disadvantages of communal life. This information can reduce uncertainty about nest locations, mates or food sources. However, there is little empirical evidence that colonies can actually serve as an information exchange point. We asked whether a large nesting colony of ring-billed gulls, Larus delawarensis, could provide its members with social information about the quality and location of food resources during the chick-rearing period. We first determined whether social information was available in the colony, then whether it was signalled by some reliable cue, and finally, whether the birds used it by following knowledgeable individuals. We combined observations of flight departure bearings at the colony with flight tracks obtained from birds fitted with global positioning system (GPS) data loggers. We found that reliable information about feeding site locations could be obtained by observing the vanishing bearings of gulls leaving their nest. Birds nesting in different parts of the colony flew in different directions to reach their feeding grounds, but this did not influence the type of food brought to the chicks. To test whether gulls actually followed departing individuals, we searched for temporal clumping of departures and bearings for different time intervals during a day. We found that departures of gulls nesting in the same neighbourhood were not temporally clustered, nor did the gulls tend to leave in the same direction as their previously departing neighbours. We conclude that ring-billed gulls do not appear to use social information at the nest site to locate foraging opportunities. However, stopovers on nearby water or along the colony edge after a short flight from the nest could allow exchange of information that we could not document.  aPublisher supplied data 3anests 3auncertainty 3achicks 3aflight 3aLarus 3anesting 3aglobal positioning systems 3aforaging 3anesting sites 0abirds1 aGiraldeau, Luc-Alain1 aPatenaude-Monette, Martin1 aGiroux, Jean-François0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 July, v. 84, no. 1 p.175-182dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003000143245019500173520184300368592002802211650002502239650002502264650001902289650001602308650000902324650001902333650002202352650002302374650002102397650001402418650001002432650002202442650001302464650001502477650001302492650003002505650001302535650002802548650002102576650001002597650003502607650002602642650001202668650001702680651001302697651001402710700002802724700002902752700002502781700002602806700002302832773011902855856007702974852000903051655001203060IND60703056920221117194458.0200719e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070305692DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110606992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro Aviles, Alejandro 10aIdentification of QTLs for Resistance to Fusarium Head Blight Using a Doubled Haploid Population Derived from Southeastern United States Soft Red Winter Wheat Varieties AGS 2060 and AGS 2035  aFusarium head blight (FHB), caused primarily by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat, causing significant loss of yield and quality worldwide. Warm and wet conditions during flowering, a lack of resistant wheat varieties, and high inoculum pressure from corn stubble contribute to frequent FHB epidemics in the southern United States. The soft red winter wheat variety AGS 2060 is moderately susceptible (as opposed to susceptible) to FHB and regularly found in pedigrees of resistant breeding lines. AGS 2060 does not carry any known resistance genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL). A QTL mapping study was conducted to determine the location and genetic effect of its resistance using a doubled haploid mapping population produced from a cross between wheat varieties AGS 2060 and AGS 2035 (FHB susceptible). The population was genotyped using the Illumina iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array for wheat and phenotyped in Baton Rouge and Winnsboro, Louisiana and Newport, Arkansas in 2018 and 2019. The effect of genotype was significant for Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK) and deoxynivalenol (DON) content across all locations and years, indicating genetic variation in the population. The study detected 13 QTLs (one each on chromosome 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B, and two each on 5A and 5B) responsible for the reduction of FDK and/or DON. Of these, nine QTLs for FHB resistance were identified in Winnsboro, Louisiana, in 2019. QTLs on chromosomes 2A and 7A could be valuable sources of resistance to both DON and FDK over several environments and were likely the best candidates for use in marker-assisted selection. Consistently expressed QTLs on chromosomes 5A, 6B, and 7A were potentially newly identified sources of resistance to FHB in soft red winter wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3abreeding lines 3achromosomes 3acorn 3adeoxynivalenol 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease resistance 3adoubled haploids 3aflowering 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ainoculum 3amarker-assisted selection 3apedigree 3aquantitative trait loci 3aresistance genes 3aseeds 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoft red winter wheat 3astubble 3awinter wheat 3aArkansas 3aLouisiana1 aAlan Harrison, Stephen 1 aJoseph Arceneaux, Kelly 1 aBrown-Guidera, Gina 1 aEsten Mason, Richard 1 aBaisakh, Niranjan 0 tGenes.g2020 June 25, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110606993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03742naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016000170300001600330520190100346592002802247650001302275650002702288650001102315650002002326650001602346650001202362650001602374650003002390650001302420650001302433650002602446650001902472650002102491650001302512650001202525650001802537650000902555650002202564650002402586650003002610650001302640650001502653651002102668653001202689653001202701653002002713653002602733653001302759653001602772700001702788700002002805700005702825700001802882700001802900773010202918856008703020852000903107655001203116IND60545753820221119123215.0170719e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054575382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Heejung10aIdentifying the sources of nitrate contamination of groundwater in an agricultural area (Haean basin, Korea) using isotope and microbial community analyses  ap. 566-575.  aAn integrated study based on hydrogeochemical, microbiological and dual isotopic approaches for nitrate and sulfate was conducted to elucidate sources and biogeochemical reactions governing groundwater contaminants in different seasons and under different land use in a basin of Korea. The land use in the study area is comprised of forests (58.0%), vegetable fields (27.6%), rice paddy fields (11.4%) and others (3.0%). The concentrations of NO3–N and SO42− in groundwater in vegetable fields were highest with 4.2–15.2mgL−1 and 1.6–19.7mgL−1 respectively, whereas under paddy fields NO3–N concentrations ranged from 0 to 10.7mgL−1 and sulfate concentrations were ~15mgL−1. Groundwater with high NO3–N concentrations of >10mgL−1 had δ15N–NO3− values ranging from 5.2 to 5.9‰ and δ18O values of nitrate between 2.7 and 4.6‰ suggesting that the nitrate was mineralized from soil organic matter that was amended by fertilizer additions. Elevated concentrations of SO42− with δ34S–SO42− values between 1 and 6‰ in aquifers in vegetable fields indicated that a mixture of sulfate from atmospheric deposition, mineralization of soil organic matter and from synthetic fertilizers is the source of groundwater sulfate. Elevated δ18O–NO3− and δ18O–SO42− values in samples collected from the paddy fields indicated that denitrification and bacterial sulfate reduction are actively occurring removing sulfate and nitrate from the groundwater. This was supported by high occurrences of denitrifying and sulfate reducing bacteria in groundwater of the paddy fields as evidenced by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing analysis. This study shows that dual isotope techniques combined with microbial data can be a powerful tool for identification of sources and microbial processes affecting NO3− and SO42− in groundwater in areas with intensive agricultural land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aatmospheric deposition 3abasins 3adenitrification 3afertilizers 3aforests 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aisotopes 3aland use 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3apaddies 3aribosomal RNA 3arice 3asequence analysis 3asoil organic matter 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 3avegetables 3aKorean Peninsula 0aNitrate 0aSulfate 0aStable isotopes 0aMicrobial communities 0aLand use 0aAgriculture1 aKaown, Dugin1 aMayer, Bernhard1 aLee, Jin-Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5996-78011 aHyun, Yunjung1 aLee, Kang-Kun0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 533 p.566-575dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245011600213300001800329520135500347592002801702650001201730650001001742650002101752650001101773650001901784650001601803650001201819650002201831650003401853650000901887650001901896650005601915700001601971700002001987700002402007773009402031856008102125990002302206852000902229655001202238IND60093867120221118225223.0141104e20111025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009386712DNAL7 a220001062pmid7 aPMC32105732pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimabukuro, Katsuya10aReconstitution of Amoeboid Motility In Vitro Identifies a Motor-Independent Mechanism for Cell Body Retraction  ap. 1727-1731.  aCrawling movement in eukaryotic cells requires coordination of leading-edge protrusion with cell body retraction [1–3]. Protrusion is driven by actin polymerization along the leading edge [4]. The mechanism of retraction is less clear; myosin contractility may be involved in some cells [5] but is not essential in others [6–9]. In Ascaris sperm, protrusion and retraction are powered by the major sperm protein (MSP) motility system instead of the conventional actin apparatus [10, 11]. These cells lack motor proteins [12] and so are well suited to explore motor-independent mechanisms of retraction. We reconstituted protrusion and retraction simultaneously in MSP filament meshworks, called fibers, that assemble behind plasma membrane-derived vesicles. Retraction is triggered by depolymerization of complete filaments in the rear of the fiber [13]. The surviving filaments reorganize to maintain their packing density. By packing fewer filaments into a smaller volume, the depolymerizing network shrinks and thereby generates sufficient force to move an attached load. Our work provides direct evidence for motor-independent retraction in the reconstituted MSP motility system of nematode sperm. This mechanism could also apply to actin-based cells and may explain reports of cells that crawl even when their myosin activity is compromised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscaris 3aactin 3aeukaryotic cells 3amyosin 3apolymerization 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aAscarisxcytology 2aHelminth Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatozoaxcytologyxmetabolismxultrasonography.1 aNoda, Naoki1 aStewart, Murray1 aRoberts, Thomas M.,0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Oct. 25, v. 21, no. 20 p.1727-1731dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04201naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245018900168300001600357520216100373592002802534650001602562650002202578650001302600650002702613650001102640650000902651650000902660650001802669650001202687650001602699650001102715650001602726650001902742650001002761650001102771650001102782650001802793650002202811650002102833650002702854650001302881650000902894650002002903650001002923650000902933650001302942650001002955650001002965651001002975653001002985653001502995653001103010653002003021653001903041653001603060700005803076700001403134700001703148700003403165700002303199700001603222700001703238700001303255773010503268856008503373852000903458655001203467IND60636634420221122131222.0190606e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063663442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhaoyang10aMultiple crop bioaccumulation and human exposure of perfluoroalkyl substances around a mega fluorochemical industrial park, China: Implication for planting optimization and food safety  ap. 671-684.  aPerfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have become a recognized concern due to their mobility, persistence, ubiquity and health hazards in the environment. In this study, ten types of vegetables and three types of grain crops were collected in two open-air fields with different distances (0.3 km, 10 km) from a mega fluorochemical industrial park (FIP), China. Bioaccumulation characteristics of PFASs in light of crop types and organs were explored, followed by analyzing human exposure and risks to local residents with different age groups and dietary habits. Elevated levels of ∑PFASs were found nearby the FIP ranging from 79.9 ng/g to 200 ng/g in soils and from 58.8 ng/g to 8085 ng/g in crops. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the predominant PFAS component in soil; while shorter-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), especially perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), were the major PFAS contaminants in multiple crops, resulting from their bioaccumulation preference. Depending on the crop types, the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of ∑PFASs for edible parts varied from 0.36 to 48.0, and the highest values were found in shoot vegetables compared with those in fruit vegetables, flower vegetables, root vegetables and grain crops. For typical grains, the BAFs of ∑PFASs decreased in the order of soybean (Glycine max (Linn.) Merr.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.), possibly related to their protein and lipid content. Among specific organs in the whole plants, leaves exhibited the highest BAFs of ∑PFASs compared with corresponding roots, stems, husks or grains. With increasing carbon chain lengths of individual PFCAs (C4-C8), the logarithm of their BAFs for edible parts of various crops showed a linear decrease (0.1–1.16 log decrease per CF2 unit), and the largest decrease was observed in grains. Human exposure to PFOA via the consumption of contaminated crops represents a health risk for local residents, especially for low-age consumers or urban consumers with higher vegetable diet. Implications for planting optimization and food safety were provided aiming to reduce health hazards of PFASs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3abioaccumulation factor 3acarbon 3acorn 3adiet 3aeating habits 3aflowers 3afood safety 3afruits 3agrain crops 3ahealth hazards 3ahulls 3ahumans 3aleaves 3alipid content 3amultiple cropping 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aplanting 3arisk 3aroot vegetables 3aroots 3asoil 3asoybeans 3astems 3awheat 3aChina 0aPFASs 0aVegetables 0aGrains 0aBioaccumulation 0aHuman exposure 0aHealth risk1 aLü, Yonglong,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3338-42101 aSong, Xin1 aJones, Kevin1 aSweetman, A.

Here we show evidence of an increase in thermocline feedback in the western-central equatorial Pacific over the last 50 years, and in particular after the climate shift of 1976. It is demonstrated that the thermocline feedback becomes more effective due to the increased stratification in the vicinity of the mean thermocline. This leads to an increase in vertical advection variability twice as large as the increase resulting from the stronger ENSO amplitude (positive asymmetry) in the eastern Pacific that connects to the thermocline in the western-central Pacific through the basin-scale ‘tilt’ mode. Although the zonal advective feedback is dominant over the western-central equatorial Pacific, the more effective thermocline feedback allows for counteracting its warming (cooling) effect during warm (cold) events, leading to the reduced covariability between SST and thermocline depth anomalies in the NINO4 (160°E–150°W; 5°S–5°N) region after the 1976 climate shift. This counter-intuitive relationship between thermocline feedback strength as derived from the linear relationship between SST and thermocline fluctuations and stratification changes is also investigated in a long-term general circulation coupled model simulation. It is suggested that an increase in ENSO amplitude may lead to the decoupling between eastern and central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies through its effect on stratification and thermocline feedback in the central-western Pacific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aclimate 3acold 3acooling 3asimulation models 3asurface water temperature1 aYeh, Sang-Wook1 aThual, Sulian0 tClimate dynamics.g2013 Aug., v. 41, no. 3-4 p.819-830dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-012-1504-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012400171300001600295520123000311592002801541650001301569650002001582650003201602650001401634650001101648700001701659700002401676773008801700856008501788852000901873655001201882IND60111838120221119081310.0150812e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011183812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Rulon W.10aField video recordings reveal factors influencing predatory strike success of free-ranging rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.)  ap. 183-190.  aResearch on predator–prey interactions often focuses largely on prey behaviour, treating predators as static danger, rather than as active behavioural participants that can respond adaptively to prey choices. A complete understanding of the functional significance of both predator attack behaviours and prey escape behaviours can only come from examining the interaction between both parties. For example, although the predatory strike of venomous snakes has been studied extensively in the laboratory, we have little understanding of the proximate factors influencing snake strike behaviour under natural conditions. Here, we report details of the analysis of predatory strikes of free-ranging rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) towards their natural prey. We found that over half of strike attempts were unsuccessful, and the most significant factor influencing strike success was the ability of prey animals to initiate a rapid evasive dodge manoeuvre in the fraction of a second after snakes initiated strikes, but before snake strikes contacted them. Snakes, in turn, initiated strikes most frequently towards the flank of laterally moving prey, which is probably an attempt to counter the ability of prey to dodge strikes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrotalus 3aanimal behavior 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3asnakes1 aTangco, Sean1 aBarbour, Matthew A.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 July, v. 84, no. 1 p.183-190dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245014300160300001800303520044700321592002800768650001200796650002300808650002300831650001600854650002000870653002300890653002900913653002100942653001800963653001100981700001900992700002501011700001601036773008101052856008101133852000901214655001201223IND60529241520221119082621.0161019e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Hui10aRh(II)-catalyzed intramolecular annulation of N-sulfonyl 1,2,3-triazoles with indole derivatives: a new method for synthesis pyranoindoles  ap. 3014-3021.  aA direct and highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of Z-alkenyl-pyranoindoles had been developed by utilizing Rh(II)-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles with indole derivatives.

We tested this hypothesis by analyzing repeat photographs from 16 sites at Cape St Francis in the south-eastern Cape Floristic Region. The period of monitoring ranged from 55 to 17 year and most sites had been last burnt between 30 and 50 years ago. We divided the sites into coastal (salt wind-exposed) and inland zones and computed, for each pair of photographs, the rate of change of four plant types, namely thicket shrubs, fynbos woody, fynbos herbaceous and grass. Coastal zone sites showed a significant increase in thicket shrub cover and a significant decline in both grass and fynbos herbaceous cover. Fynbos woody cover declined in the face of thicket invasion, but increased in grassy sites, most likely due to a decline in herbivory intensity. No significant changes in plant types were observed in the inland sites, although thicket shrub cover did increase marginally at the expense of fynbos woody plants. However, thicket invasion was restricted to swales and lower dune slopes; the dune fynbos of the upper slopes and crests remains uninvaded by thicket and surprisingly vigorous after 30–50 year without fire. This is consistent with the notion that fynbos species occupy drier sites than thicket in these dune landscapes and regular fire is not a prerequisite for its persistence. Overall, we showed a large increase in woody plant cover throughout the study area. While this pattern is consistent with predictions for vegetation change in response to atmospheric [CO2] pollution, it can also be explained by land use changes experienced in the study area, starting in the early 1960s, involving a shift from subsistence agriculture to holiday resort development and tourism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3abotany 3acoasts 3afynbos 3agrasses 3aherbivores 3apollution 3aresorts 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asubsistence farming 3atourism 3awoody plants 0aGrazing lawn 0aLand-use change 0aResprouting 0aWoody plant invasion1 aHoffman, M.T.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 Nov., v. 142 p.73-81dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01572naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001600167245005500183300001600238500000900254520054100263592002800804650002400832650002600856650001200882650001500894650002300909650001700932650002200949700001700971700001800988773012201006852000901128856009701137655001201234991563273820742620221119134516.0191122e197103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7190634842DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1971.00021962006300020025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBond, J.

It has severely shrunk the global economy in the year 2020, including India. The blue economy and especially the small-scale fisheries sector in India have dwindled due to disruptions in the fish catch, market, and supply chain. This research presents the applicability of satellite data to monitor the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown on the Indian fisheries sector. Three harbors namely Mangrol, Veraval, and Vankbara situated on the north-western coast of India were selected in this study based on characteristics like harbor’s age, administrative control, and availability of cloud-free satellite images. To analyze the impact of COVID in the fisheries sector, we utilized high-resolution PlanetScope data for monitoring and comparison of “area under fishing boats” during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown phases. A support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm was used to identify the area under the boats. The classification results were complemented with socio-economic data and ground-level information for understanding the impact of the pandemic on the three sites. During the peak of the lockdown, it was found that the “area under fishing boats” near the docks and those parked on the land area increased by 483%, 189%, and 826% at Mangrol, Veraval, and Vanakbara harbor, respectively. After phase-I of lockdown, the number of parked vessels decreased, yet those already moved out to the land area were not returned until the south-west monsoon was over. A quarter of the annual production is estimated to be lost at the three harbors due to lockdown. Our last observation (September 2020) result shows that regular fishing activity has already been re-established in all three locations. PlanetScope data with daily revisit time has a higher potential to be used in the future and can help policymakers in making informed decisions vis-à-vis the fishing industry during an emergency situation like COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aage 3aarea 3acase studies 3aclassification 3acoasts 3aexhibitions 3afish 3afisheries 3afishing boats 3ainformation 3aland 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3apandemic 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asocioeconomics 3asupply chain 3asupport vector machines 3aIndia1 aSingh, Deepak 1 aUmarhadi, Deha  Agus1 aYunus, Ali  P.1 aMisra, Prakhar 1 aDesai, Pranav N.,1 aKouser, Asma 1 aKurniawan, Tonni Agustiono,1 aPhanindra, KBVN 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130201833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245007800164300001600242520190100258536007702159592002802236596007402264650001202338650001202350650001902362650001402381650002602395650002602421650002502447650001502472650002102487650003402508650001302542651001002555653002902565653001002594653001802604653001902622653001502641700001302656700001302669773010702682856008502789852000902874655001202883IND60595661320221120140458.0180605e20180528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059566132DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2017.13319032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pu12aA review of China’s climate governance: state, market and civil society  ap. 664-679.  aThis article disaggregates the often complex, hierarchical and still-evolving structure of China’s climate governance into three dimensions: the state, the market and civil society. The three dimensions are not exclusive of each other but overlap in many important respects, and their roles and relative levels of importance in China’s climate governance have changed over time. The state determines the blueprint of all climate change policies and management, reflecting an essential condition of China’s political economy and public administration. It sets overall targets and goals, and also acts as a supervising framework, sometimes enabling, at other times constraining, the activities of the market and civil society. The latter two dimensions, however, have become more important in recent years. Market-based policies, particularly emissions trading systems, are becoming an important tool for emissions control. Civil society has also begun to play a more active role in climate governance, an indication of which is the growing number of environmental NGOs, and their growing collaboration with international counterparts. All three dimensions and the ways in which they overlap will remain crucial to climate governance in China into the foreseeable future. Key policy insights As the world’s largest GHG emitter, China faces increasing pressure to control its emissions and shift to a low-carbon economy. This pressure is both international and domestic, reflecting China’s central role in global mitigation efforts, as well as the growing demand by citizens for better environmental conditions. In the period after the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, the evolution of China’s climate governance – with corresponding shifts in the roles of state, market and civil society – will continue to have significant implications for the global effort to combat climate change.  aThis work was supported by Sichuan University [grant number skqx201605].  aPublisher supplied data  askqx201605cSichuan Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004912 3aarsenic 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental markets 3aenvironmental policy 3agovernance 3agreenhouse gases 3anongovernmental organizations 3apolitics 3aChina 0aCarbon emissions trading 0aChina 0acivil society 0aclimate change 0agovernance1 aLiu, Lei1 aWu, Tong0 tClimate policy.g2018 May 28, v. 18, no. 5 p.664-679dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19684x1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.13319033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006100169300001600230520118800246592002801434650002101462650001601483650001601499650001701515650001401532650001101546650001701557650001501574650001201589650001801601650002601619650001801645650001101663650002501674653001501699653001701714653001601731653003201747653001501779653001501794700001801809700002101827700001301848700001601861700001701877700001801894700001801912700002101930700002001951773010501971856008502076852000902161655001202170IND60636634720221122044040.0190606e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063663472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.03.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsang, Yiu Fai10aProduction of bioplastic through food waste valorization  ap. 625-644.  aThe tremendous amount of food waste from diverse sources is an environmental burden if disposed of inappropriately. Thus, implementation of a biorefinery platform for food waste is an ideal option to pursue (e.g., production of value-added products while reducing the volume of waste). The adoption of such a process is expected to reduce the production cost of biodegradable plastics (e.g., compared to conventional routes of production using overpriced pure substrates (e.g., glucose)). This review focuses on current technologies for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from food waste. Technical details were also described to offer clear insights into diverse pretreatments for preparation of raw materials for the actual production of bioplastic (from food wastes). In this respect, particular attention was paid to fermentation technologies based on pure and mixed cultures. A clear description on the chemical modification of starch, cellulose, chitin, and caprolactone is also provided with a number of case studies (covering PHA-based products) along with a discussion on the prospects of food waste valorization approaches and their economic/technical viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abioplastics 3abiorefining 3acase studies 3acellulose 3achitin 3afermentation 3afood waste 3aglucose 3amixed culture 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3araw materials 3astarch 3avalue-added products 0aFood waste 0aValorization 0aBiorefinery 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) 0aBiopolymer 0aBioplastic1 aKumar, Vanish1 aSamadar, Pallabi1 aYang, Yi1 aLee, Jechan1 aOk, Yong Sik1 aSong, Hocheol1 aKim, Ki Hyun,1 aKwon, Eilhann E.1 aJeon, Young Jae0 tEnvironment international.g2019 June, v. 127 p.625-644dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.03.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245011200201300001800313520109500331592002801426650001801454650001701472650002001489650001901509650001401528650001901542700001701561700005301578700005701631773014701688856007601835852000901911655001201920IND60688552320221118131436.0200415e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068855232DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c017222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yuanchang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1458-532110aCellular Force Nanoscopy with 50 nm Resolution Based on Integrin Molecular Tension Imaging and Localization  ap. 6930-6934.  aIntegrin-transmitted cellular forces have rich spatial dynamics and are vital to many cellular functions. To advance the sensitivity and spatial resolution of cellular force imaging, we developed a force-activatable emitter reporting single-molecular tension events and the associated cellular force nanoscopy (CFN). Immobilized on a surface, the emitters are initially dark (>99.8% quenched), providing a low fluorescence background despite the high coating density (>2000/μm²) required for sampling cellular force properly. The emitters fluoresce brightly once switched on by integrin tensions and can be switched off by photobleaching, enabling continuous real-time imaging of integrin molecular tensions in live cells. With multiple cycles of molecular tension imaging and localization, CFN reproduces cellular force images with 50 nm resolution. Applied to both migratory cells and stationary cells, CFN revealed ultranarrow distribution of integrin tensions at the cell leading edge, and showed that force distribution in focal adhesions (FAs) is off-centered and FA size-dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell movement 3afluorescence 3afocal adhesions 3aimage analysis 3aintegrins 3aphotobleaching1 aPal, Kaushik1 aDu, Ying,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7770-98761 aWang, Xuefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3301-31960 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 142, no. 15 p.6930-6934dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c017223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009800161300001100259520102800270592002801298596006401326596005901390596005901449596010601508650002601614650001701640650001401657650001501671650003701686700001601723700001501739700001301754700001601767700001201783700001401795700001301809700001301822700002001835773010601855856008301961852000902044655001202053IND60767346620221117212448.0221003e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076734662DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-022-05175-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yang10aCPR63 promotes pyrethroid resistance by increasing cuticle thickness in Culex pipiens pallens  ap. 54.  aThe cuticle protein (CP) encoded by CPR63 plays a role in deltamethrin resistance in Culex pipiens pallens. Herein, we investigated the distribution of CPR63 transcripts in this organism and observed high expression levels in legs and wings. Furthermore, expression of CPR63 in the legs of deltamethrin-resistant (DR) strains was 2.17-fold higher than in deltamethrin-susceptible (DS) strains. Cuticle analysis of small interfering RNA (siRNA) groups by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a significantly thinner cuticle of the tarsi in the siCPR63 group than in the siNC (negative control siRNA) group. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the exocuticle and endocuticle thickness of the tarsi were significantly thinner, which contributes the thinner procuticle of tarsi in the siCPR63 group than in the siNC group. Our results suggested that CPR63 might contribute to the resistance phenotype by thickening the cuticle and thereby possibly increasing the tolerance of mosquitoes to deltamethrin.  aPublisher supplied data  aNos. 81672056cnational natural science foundation of china  a81772227cnational natural science foundation of china  a81672058cnational natural science foundation of china  a2017ZX10303404-002-006cthe National Critical Project for S & T on Infectious diseases P.

We investigated its mode of action, and our studies indicated that YZK-C22 showed no cross resistance against Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants with classic fungicide targets. Mec1 and Rad53 are two kinases that respond to DNA-replication damage, and the efficacy test showed that YZK-C22 could not perform its fungicidal activity by inhibiting DNA repair. Target screening by drug-affinity-responsive target stability (DARTS) showed that pyruvate kinase (PK), a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, was the potent new fungicidal target of YZK-C22. Fifty-eight differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) primarily involved in the metabolic process were identified by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification analysis (iTRAQ) in S. cerevisiae, and protein expression in the citrate cycle decreased with treatment of 5 mg/L YZK-C22, which was consistent with the results of DARTS. Molecular-docking analysis further validated that YZK-C22 could dock into the active center of PK instead of phosphoenolpyruvate. The enzyme activity of PK from S. cerevisiae was competitively inhibited with a Kᵢ of 3.33 ± 0.28 μmol/L, and the cell-growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae was released by supplementation with pyruvic acid, whereas the growth of S. cerevisiae was not recovered by adding PK’s substrate (phosphoenolpyruvate) or allosteric regulator (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate). The present studies uncovered and validated the primary target of the new, potent fungicidal candidate YZK-C22; our results provide a successful, valuable, and applicable case of target discovery and identification for novel-fungicide development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantifungal properties 3acell growth 3acomputer simulation 3across resistance 3afungicides 3aglycolysis 3amechanism of action 3amutants 3aprotein synthesis 3apyruvate kinase 3apyruvic acid 3ascreening 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0afungicide candidate 0amode of action 0adrug-affinity-responsive target stability 0aisobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification 0apyruvate kinase 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aFan, Sijia1 aFan, Zhijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5565-09491 aWang, Haixia1 aZhang, Nailou1 aGuo, Xiaofeng1 aYang, Dongyan1 aWu, Qifan1 aYu, Bin1 aZhou, Shuang0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Oct. 16, v. 66, no. 46 p.12439-12452dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b037973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003200145245010100177300001600278520161600294592002801910650002601938650000901964650001501973650002601988650002902014650002002043650001402063650001802077650001102095650001302106650001302119773014202132856007902274852000902353655001202362IND60747537020221122224534.0210814e20210813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074753702DNAL7 a10.1656/058.020.0sp11132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulas-Wroblewski, Bonnie E.10aInfectious Diseases of Eastern Spotted Skunks (Spilogale putorius) within a One Health Framework  ap. 126-172.  aOwing to their omnivorous diet, den-site habits, foraging activities, mating behaviors, and other pertinent habitat-use and natural-history traits, Spilogale putorius (Eastern Spotted Skunk [ESS]) are exposed to a wide variety of pathogenic agents. Understanding the diversity of infectious diseases affecting ESS in conjunction with the role this species plays in the disease ecology of these pathogens is crucial not only for devising efficacious management strategies, but also in formulating comprehensive veterinary and public health strategies for combatting zoonotic diseases associated with this species. Herein I review the reported infectious diseases of ESS. I address the implications of these pathogens for current and future population health of the species with reference to the changing dynamics of ESS disease ecology, influenced by increasing habitat fragmentation, exposure to pathogens across the domestic–wildlife interface, fluctuating climatic patterns, antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and the profusion of immunosuppressant chemicals throughout the environment. Employing a One Health framework to evaluate the role that ESS play in the disease ecology of zoonoses further highlights the interrelationships of ESS health to the health of humans, domestic animals, and other wildlife. The potential for ESS to serve as hosts, “dilutors”, and/or sentinels for zoonoses underscores their importance in public health and provides an opportunity to leverage their potential disease-mitigating attributes for the conservation of ESS aligned with their provision of ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3adiet 3aecosystems 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aimmunosuppressive agents 3anatural history 3aomnivores 3apublic health 3askunks 3awildlife 3azoonoses0 tSoutheastern naturalist.g2021 Aug. 13, v. 20, no. sp11 p.126-172dHumboldt Field Research InstitutewJournal:jnl4053496x1528-70927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.020.0sp11133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010300172300001800275520077500293592002801068650002201096650002301118650002201141650001201163650004401175650002201219650002501241653002801266653001901294653002701313653003101340653001601371700001801387700001701405700002901422773008101451856008101532852000901613655001201622IND60529241920221119081612.0161019e20160609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHettstedt, Christina10aSynthesis of the first representatives of amino bis(picolyl) and amino bis(quinaldinyl) phosphines  ap. 3162-3170.  aFirst amino bis(picolyl) and amino bis(quinaldinyl) phosphines were synthesized by reaction of the corresponding amino dichlorophosphines – the new carbazolyl dichlorophosphine (1) and diisopropylamino dichlorophosphine (2) with either picolylTMS (6), quinaldinylTMS (15) or their respective lithium derivatives 12 and 16.

Despite much interest that climate change impacts have on coffee (Coffea arabica), relatively little is known about the driving factors determining its phenophases. Using high-resolution microclimatic data, this study provides initial insights on how climate change is impacting C. arabica phenophases in Tanzania. In particular, we use generalized additive models to show how warming nocturnal temperatures (Tₙᵢgₕₜ), as opposed to day-time or maximum temperatures, have a superseding effect on the ripening of coffee and subsequent timing of harvest. A warm night index (WNI), generated from mean nocturnal temperature, permits accurate prediction of the start of the harvest season, which is superior to existing methods using growing degree days (GDD). The non-linear function indicates that a WNI of 15 °C is associated with the latest ripening coffee cherries (adjusted R² = 0.95). As the WNI increases past the inflection point of ~ 16 °C, ripening occurs earlier and progresses more or less linearly at a rate of ~ 17 ± 1.95 days for every 1 °C increase in WNI. Using the WNI will thus not only allow farmers to more accurately predict their harvest start date, but also assist with identifying the most suitable adaptation strategies which may reduce harvest-related costs and buffer potential losses in quality and production.  aPublisher supplied data  aD126CL10cBundesministerium für Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (DE) 3aCoffea arabica 3abioclimatology 3aclimate change 3aharvest date 3amicroclimate 3anight temperature 3aprediction 3aTanzania1 aVan Asten, P.

Hence, this study is formulated with the objective of using existing meta-analysis data together with our research population to study the correlation between PPARG Pro12Ala gene polymorphism and CKD and evaluate whether an accurate result can be obtained. Methods: First, literature related to CKD and PPARG Pro12Ala available on the PubMed and EMBASE databases up to December 2016 was gathered from 20 publications. Then, the gathered results were combined with our case-control study of 1693 enrolled subjects and a trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to verify existing evidence and determine whether a firm conclusion can be drawn. Results: The TSA results showed that the cumulative sample size for the Asian sample was 6078 and was sufficient to support a definite result. The results of this study confirmed that there is no obvious correlation between PPARG Pro12Ala and CKD for Asians (OR = 0.82 (95% CI = 0.66–1.02), I² = 63.1%), but this was not confirmed for Caucasians. Furthermore, the case-control sample in our study was shown to be the key for reaching this conclusion. Conclusions: The meta-analysis results of this study suggest no significant correlation between PPARG Pro12Ala gene polymorphism and CKD for Asians after adding our samples, but not for Caucasian.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsians 3aWhites 3aalanine 3acase-control studies 3adatabases 3agenetic polymorphism 3akidney diseases 3ameta-analysis 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aproline 3asample size1 aChen, Wei-Teing 1 aSung, Tzu-Ling 1 aTsai, Dung-Jang 1 aLin, Jin,1 aSu, Hao 1 aLin, Yuh-Feng 1 aChiu, Hung-Yi 1 aSu, Sui-Lung 0 tGenes.g2020 June 26, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110607053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014000160500001400300520183000314592002802144650002402172650001302196650001702209650001502226650001202241650001102253650001102264650001602275650001102291650001502302650001002317650001902327650001602346650001502362700001802377700001702395700001502412700002002427700001702447773012802464856007402592852000902666655001202675IND60724589420221119055825.0210122e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072458942DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130201862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Xiangxing 10aForest Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Multi-Features Extracted by Fitting Vertical Backscattered Power Profile of Tomographic SAR  aNAL-light  aForest aboveground biomass (AGB), which plays an important role in the study of global carbon cycle, is one of the most important indicators in forest resource monitoring. Thus, how to estimate and map regional forest AGB quickly and accurately attracts more interests of researchers. Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) is an advanced SAR technique developed in recent years, which has a wide range application in forest AGB estimation. In this paper, we proposed a multi-feature-based modeling method to estimate forest AGB by fitting backscattered power of TomoSAR vertical profile. The procedure of the proposed method includes four parts: (1) Processing TomoSAR data to obtain the backscattered power of vertical profile. (2) Fitting the backscattered power of the vertical profile. (3) Analyzing the fitted backscattered power distribution characteristic of the vertical profile. (4) Extracting the TomoSAR vertical profile features according to the forest AGB measurement factors based on the dendrometry theory. In this paper, we proposed two new features like the forest average height weighted by backscattered power (BPFAH) and the total length of the backscattered power curve (LBPC) as supplement features to estimate forest AGB by TomoSAR technique. We also used the traditional TomoSAR features including backscattered power at specific height layer of vertical power profile (BPV) and forest average height (FAH) for AGB estimation. After the feature selection, the selected features and the ground field data of the forest AGB were used for regression and modeling. Then the forest AGB was estimated and the accuracy was validated. The results showed that the accuracy of proposed method is 90.73%, and RMSE is 42.45 t/ha. Finally, we discussed the performance of our proposed method compared with traditional methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aaccuracy 3acarbon cycle 3aestimation 3aforests 3aheight 3alength 3ameasurement 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apaper 3aremote sensing 3aresearchers 3atomography1 aLi, Zengyuan 1 aChen, Erxue 1 aZhao, Lei 1 aZhang, Wangfei 1 aXu, Kunpeng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130201863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015400209300001600363500001900379520148200398592002801880596007001908596005701978596005702035596009002092650001602182650001902198650001202217650001902229650001102248650001102259650001102270650001602281651001302297700001802310700002102328700001802349700001702367700001902384700001802403700002302421700002502444773014302469856008202612852000902694655001202703IND60724695920221117233524.0210123e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072469592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-020-02033-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJevšenak, Jernej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4811-362410aGrowth-limiting factors and climate response variability in Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) along an elevation and precipitation gradients in Slovenia  ap. 311-324.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNorway spruce (Picea abies L.) is among the most sensitive coniferous species to ongoing climate change. However, previous studies on its growth response to increasing temperatures have yielded contrasting results (from stimulation to suppression), suggesting highly site-specific responses. Here, we present the first study that applies two independent approaches, i.e. the nonlinear, process-based Vaganov-Shashkin (VS) model and linear daily response functions. Data were collected at twelve sites in Slovenia differing in climate regimes and ranging elevation between 170 and 1300 m a.s.l. VS model results revealed that drier Norway spruce sites at lower elevations are mostly moisture limited, while moist high-elevation sites are generally more temperature limited. Daily response functions match well the pattern of growth-limiting factors from the VS model and further explain the effect of climate on radial growth: prevailing growth-limiting factors correspond to the climate variable with higher correlations. Radial growth correlates negatively with rising summer temperature and positively with higher spring precipitation. The opposite response was observed for the wettest site at the highest elevation, which positively reacts to increased summer temperature and will most likely benefit from a warming climate. For all other sites, the future radial growth of Norway spruce largely depends on the balance between spring precipitation and summer temperature.  aPublisher supplied data  aARRS BI-RU/19-20-016cJavna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS  aV4-1614cJavna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS  aP4-0107cJavna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS  a#FSRZ-2020-0010 and #FSRZ-2020-0014cRussian Ministry of Science and Higher Education 3aPicea abies 3abioclimatology 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3amodels 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aSlovenia1 aTychkov, Ivan1 aGričar, Jožica1 aLevanič, Tom1 aTumajer, Jan1 aPrislan, Peter1 aArnič, Domen1 aPopkova, Margarita1 aShishov, Vladimir V.0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2021 Feb., v. 65, no. 2 p.311-324dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-020-02033-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132024004200167040001800209100001400227245015200241300001600393520170100409592002802110596008302138650001902221650001202240650001502252650001602267650002102283650002002304650002402324650002902348650001902377650001202396650001802408650001302426650002502439650001802464650002402482650001702506650001202523700002002535700002602555773013302581856008102714852000902795655001202804IND60572688920221119100332.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057268892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-017-9836-z2chorus7 a10.1007/s10705-017-9836-z2doi7 a10.1007/s10705-017-9836-z2chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zhen10aN2O emissions from grain cropping systems: a meta-analysis of the impacts of fertilizer-based and ecologically-based nutrient management strategies  ap. 335-355.  aUnderstanding how agricultural management practices impact nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions is prerequisite for developing mitigation protocols. We conducted a meta-analysis on 597 pairwise comparisons (129 papers) to assess how management affects N₂O emissions. Pairwise comparisons of practices aimed at improving fertilizer use efficiency (39%) and tillage (30%) dominated the dataset, while ecologically-based nutrient management (ENM) practices constituted 15% of the pairs. In general, across management practices, the quantity of N added was a more significant driver of N₂O fluxes than was the form of N (fertilizer, legume biomass or animal manures). Manure interacted with soil texture so that in coarse soils, N₂O emissions from manures tended to be higher compared to inorganic N fertilizers. The studies of ENM strategies frequently involved over-application of N inputs in the ENM treatments. Cover crops reduced N₂O emissions compared to bare fallows. However, during the cash crop growing season, when differences in N added and N source were confounded, the extra N inputs from cover crops were significantly correlated with the differences in N₂O emissions between treatments with and without cover crops. Overall, in 38% of the data pairs, N₂O emissions were reduced with limited impacts on yields; in half of these pairs, yields were maintained or increased while in the other half they were reduced by only ≤10%. Knowledge gaps on mitigation of agricultural N₂O emissions could be addressed by applying an ecosystem-based, cross-scale perspective in conjunction with the N saturation conceptual framework to guide research priorities and experimental designs.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aanimal manures 3abiomass 3acash crops 3acover crops 3acropping systems 3adata collection 3aexperimental design 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowing season 3alegumes 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3anutrient management 3asoil texture 3atillage1 aWalter, M.

The influence of water treatment procedures on the bacterial antibiotic resistance rate and the changes that bacteria underwent when exposed to the five antibiotics at concentration levels ranging from 1 to 100μg/mL were studied. Multi-drug resistance was also analyzed using drug sensitivity tests. The results indicated that bacteria derived from water treatment plant effluent that used the Huangpu River rather than the Yangtze River as source water exhibited higher antibiotic resistance rates against AMP, STR, RFP and CM but lower antibiotic resistance rates against KAN. When the antibiotic concentration levels ranged from 1 to 10μg/mL, the antibiotic resistance rates of the bacteria in the water increased as water treatment progressed. Biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration played a key role in increasing the antibiotic resistance rate of bacteria. Chloramine disinfection can enhance antibiotic resistance. Among the isolated ARB, 75% were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Ozone oxidation, BAC filtration and chloramine disinfection can greatly affect the relative abundance of bacteria in the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abacterial communities 3achloramphenicol 3adisinfection 3adrugs 3aeffluents 3afiltration 3akanamycin 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoxidation 3aozone 3arifampicin 3arivers 3astreptomycin 3awater treatment 3awater utilities 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aDrinking water 0aWater treatment process 0aAntibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) 0aBiological activated carbon 0aMultidrug resistance1 aMa, Xiaolin1 aXu, Fengming1 aLi, Jing1 aZhang, Hang1 aXiao, Xiang0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 533 p.24-31dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008300168300001600251520197900267592002802246650005002274650001102324650002002335650001902355650001302374650001902387650002402406650002302430650004302453650002402496650001102520650001602531650001502547650001202562650001502574650001402589650002402603650000902627650002002636650002502656650002902681650001002710651001102720653001702731653001302748653001702761653001602778653002602794653001102820700002002831700002102851700002502872700002502897700002002922700001802942700002702960700002102987773010503008856008503113852000903198655001203207IND60636635220221122062121.0190606e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063663522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarí, Mercè10aDeterminants of phthalate exposure and risk assessment in children from Poland  ap. 742-753.  aPhthalates are a group of widely used chemicals and humans are exposed to them in their daily life. Some phthalates may affect the hormonal balance in both children and adults. The aim of this study was to assess the phthalate exposure and its determinants among children at age of 7 years from the Polish Mother and Child Cohort Study (REPRO_PL). 250 urine samples collected in 2014–2015 were analysed for 21 metabolites of 11 parent phthalates using on-line high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). This represents the most extensive set of phthalate metabolites ever determined for Poland. Ten metabolites were quantifiable in 100% of the samples, another eight in >90%. The highest median concentrations were found for the primary monoester metabolites of di-iso-butyl (MiBP, 72.4 μg/l), di-n-butyl (MnBP, 56.3 μg/l) and diethyl (MEP, 42.0 μg/l) phthalate, followed by the sum of di-2-ethylhexyl (ΣDEHP, 89.3 μg/l) and di-iso-nonyl (ΣDiNP, 21.9 μg/l) phthalate metabolites. Metabolite concentrations were higher in children at 7 years than in the same children at age 2 or in their mothers during pregnancy. Generally, phthalate exposures in this study were much higher than exposures reported in other European populations. Multivariate regression models showed that body mass index, place of residence, breastfeeding duration, socio-economic status and parental education were associated with the metabolite levels in the 7-year old children. Daily intake and hazard index calculations revealed that a small percentage of children (around 3–10%) exceeded the tolerable daily intakes established by international institutions such as EFSA and U.S. EPA indicating that these children might be at risk of anti-androgenic effects from the individual and cumulative exposure to phthalates. Thus, further monitoring of this population, by educational programs and follow-up interventions, is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aadults 3abody mass index 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3acohort studies 3acumulative exposure 3aeducation programs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahormone antagonists 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3amothers 3aphthalates 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asocioeconomic status 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 3aPoland 0aBirth cohort 0aChildren 0aDaily intake 0aHazard risk 0aPhthalate metabolites 0aPoland1 aKoch, Holger M.1 aPälmke, Claudia1 aJankowska, Agnieszka1 aWesołowska, Ewelina1 aHanke, Wojciech1 aNowak, Dennis1 aBose-O'Reilly, Stephan1 aPolańska, Kinga0 tEnvironment international.g2019 June, v. 127 p.742-753dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245014700158300001800305520062100323592002800944650001400972650002500986650002301011650002301034650003601057650001901093650004401112650002201156653003801178653002601216653002201242653001501264653001201279700001901291700001301310773008101323856008101404852000901485655001201494IND60529242320221119221514.0161019e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Ye10aUnusual adamantane type polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols with an oxirane unit and their structural transformation from Hypericum hookerianum  ap. 3057-3062.  aHookeriones A–D (1–4), adamantane type polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs), and hookeriones E–H (5–8), 1,9-seco-adamantane type PPAPs, were isolated from Hypericum hookerianum, along with six known analogues.

Urban green infrastructure, particularly trees, can mitigate this issue through cooling due to transpiration, and shading. Temperature regulation by trees depends on feedbacks among the climate, water supply, and plant physiology. However, in contrast to forest or general ecosystem models, most current urban tree models still lack basic processes, such as the consideration of soil water limitation, or have not been evaluated sufficiently. In this study, we present a new model that couples the soil water balance with energy calculations to assess the physiological responses and microclimate effects of a common urban street-tree species (Tilia cordata Mill.) on temperature regulation. We contrast two urban sites in Munich, Germany, with different degree of surface sealing at which microclimate and transpiration had been measured. Simulations indicate that differences in wind speed and soil water supply can be made responsible for the differences in transpiration. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall energy balance showed that the shading effect, which depends on the leaf area index and canopy cover, contributes the most to the temperature reduction at midday. Finally, we demonstrate that the consideration of soil water availability for stomatal conductance has realistic impacts on the calculation of gaseous pollutant uptake (e.g., ozone). In conclusion, the presented model has demonstrated its ability to quantify two major ecosystem services (temperature mitigation and air pollution removal) consistently in dependence on meteorological and site conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTilia cordata 3aair pollution 3abioclimatology 3acanopy 3acooling 3aecosystems 3aenergy balance 3agreen infrastructure 3ahuman health 3aleaf area index 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3aozone 3aplant available water 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asoil water balance 3astomatal conductance 3atemperature 3awater supply 3awind speed 3aGermany1 aDe Fino, Francesco1 aRahman, Mohammad A.1 aPauleit, Stephan1 aNowak, David J.1 aGrote, Rüdiger0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2021 Feb., v. 65, no. 2 p.277-289dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-020-02030-83Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018600168300001600354520068900370592002801059650002201087650001701109650000801126650001201134650001001146650003001156650004501186650004801231700002201279700002901301700002901330700002201359700002401381700002001405700001901425700001601444700002201460700002501482773011101507856004801618852000901666655001201675IND50072998720221121234558.0140214e200202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007299872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-001-0457-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehbein, Hartmut10aDifferentiation of raw or processed eel by PCR-based techniques: restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP)  ap. 171-177.  aPCR-based methods were developed to differentiate 4 commercially important species of eels (Anguillaanguilla, A.rostrata, A.japonica, A.australis).

During a study on the den-site selection of S. p. ambarvalis (Florida Spotted Skunk) in the dry prairie of south-central Florida in 2016 and 2017, we tracked individuals to discernible aboveground structures composed of vegetation on 25 occasions. These structures were 1 of 2 easily distinguishable types: large mounds of vegetation primarily composed of shredded Serenoa repens (Saw Palmetto), or smaller cup-like structures with a horizontal entrance that resembled a ground-nesting bird's nest. These sites were occasionally reused by individual skunks, and on 1 occasion we observed 2 female spotted skunks occupying a site at the same time. Due to the absence of other wildlife species in the study area capable of making such structures, we believe that these structures were created by the skunks themselves. While Eastern Spotted Skunks are known to pull vegetation into their underground burrows, and have been documented occupying man-made structures (e.g., haystacks) as den sites, our observations represent the first documentation of aboveground, self-constructed structures being repeatedly used by this species. Use of these structures might be unique to Florida Spotted Skunk due to reduced predation risk or occasional flooding in the region that temporarily reduces availability of underground den sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerenoa repens 3abirds 3acarnivores 3afemales 3anests 3apredation 3arisk 3askunks 3asolar radiation 3avegetation 3awildlife 3aFlorida1 aJachowski, David S.0 tSoutheastern naturalist.g2021 Aug. 13, v. 20, no. sp11 p.225-233dHumboldt Field Research InstitutewJournal:jnl4053496x1528-70927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.020.0sp11193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245011000156300001800266520112700284592002801411653001501439653001401454653001901468653002401487653004301511653002501554700002501579700002101604773010601625856007201731852000901803655001201812IND60127122120221121183417.0151110e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012712212DNAL7 a10.1554/02-4442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolmgren, Kjell10aContrasting flowering phenology and species richness in abiotically and biotically pollinated angiosperms  ap. 2001-2011.  aBiotic pollination is thought to correlate with increased interspecific competition for pollination among plants and a higher speciation rate. In this study we compared patterns of flowering phenology and species richness between abiotically (wind) and biotically pollinated plants, using phylogenetically independent contrasts. We compiled phenological data from eight local seasonal floras, in which we found geographically overlapping sister clades. Of 65 documented origins of wind pollination, we were able to use up to 17 independent contrasts. In contrast to previous studies we found no difference in global species richness between wind- and biotically pollinated sister clades. Regarding phenology, we found wider phenological spread in biotically pollinated clades, earlier flowering onset in wind-pollinated trees, but no difference in duration of flowering between pollination modes. These results corroborate previous views that niche space is more constrained for wind-pollinated species, and that niche partitioning is less important between wind-pollinated plants compared to plants pollinated by animals.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnemophily 0adiversity 0aflowering time 0aphenological spread 0aphylogenetically independent contrasts 0apollination syndrome1 aEriksson, O.q(Ove),1 aPeter Linder, H.0 tEvolution.g2003 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.2001-2011dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F02-4443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011400170300001600284520176700300592002802067650002302095650002402118650001502142650002402157650001302181650001502194650001502209650002102224650002402245650001402269650001202283651001402295651001702309700002202326700002602348773009602374856008102470852000902551655001202560IND60572689120221119100436.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057268912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-017-0500-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahan, Jessica L.10aGrassland songbird occurrence on remnant prairie patches is primarily determined by landscape characteristics  ap. 971-988.  aCONTEXT: North American grassland songbird populations have declined significantly due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Understanding the influence of the surrounding landscape on prairie fragment occupancy is vital for predicting the fate of grassland birds in these heavily altered landscapes. OBJECTIVES: We examined the relative importance of local and landscape variables on grassland bird occupancy of prairie fragments using a focal-patch study. We also investigated the spatial scale at which landscape variables were most influential. METHODS: We surveyed birds on 29 unplowed prairie fragments in western Minnesota and eastern North and South Dakota. We quantified local habitat on the fragment using vegetation surveys and aerial photographs and the landscape surrounding the fragment out to 4 km using aerial photographs. We analyzed occupancy using multi-model approaches applied to multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 38 species encountered, nine were neither too rare nor too abundant to be analyzed. Predictors of patch occupancy were unique for each bird species, yet general patterns emerged. For eight species, landscape variables were more important than local variables. Mostly, those landscape variables measured configuration (e.g., edge density) and not composition (e.g., percent cover of a particular matrix element). Landscape effects were mostly from variables measured at the greatest extents from the prairie fragment. CONCLUSIONS: Using a focal-patch study design we demonstrated the importance of the surrounding landscape, often out to 4 km from the fragment edge, on prairie occupancy by grassland birds. Effective management of grassland songbirds will require attention to the landscape context of prairie fragments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3aexperimental design 3agrasslands 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aprediction 3arange management 3aregression analysis 3asongbirds 3asurveys 3aMinnesota 3aSouth Dakota1 aGoodwin, Brett J.1 aRundquist, Bradley C.0 tLandscape ecology.g2017 May, v. 32, no. 5 p.971-988dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-017-0500-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010900164300001600273500001900289520170000308592002802008596007502036596013302111596014002244650001302384650001902397650001002416650001602426650001802442650001902460650001302479650003702492650001102529700001602540700001702556700001502573700001402588700001802602700001902620700001602639700001502655700001802670773014302688856008202831852000902913655001202922IND60724696320221117233515.0210123e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072469632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00484-020-02025-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Caiyun10aEffects of seasonal ambient heat stress on expression of microRNAs in the mammary gland of Holstein cows  ap. 235-246.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was conducted to assess the link of miRNA expressions in cow’s mammary gland undergoing heat stress. Twelve Holstein cows were allocated either to undergo heat stress (HS) or remain in a thermoneutral environment (non-heat stress, NS), respectively. The experiment with HS cows was carried out in August, and the experiment with NS cows was done in November. After a month, three cows from each group were slaughtered, and mammary gland samples were obtained, and then miRNA were extracted from the samples for later sequencing. From the miRNA-seq, we obtained a total of 124 differentially expressed miRNAs in HS and NS cows’ mammary gland. The differentially expressed miRNA could be predicted to influence multiple target genes. The target interleukin-1 (IL-1), which play a role in regulating the function of mammary gland in dairy cows, could be affected by bta-let-7c, bta-let-7e, bta-miR-181d, bta-miR-452, and bta-miR-31. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays an important role in the mammary glands of dairy cows and bta-miR-25 and bta-miR-382 may influence MAPK pathway through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) gene to affect the function of mammary gland in HS cows. In conclusion, this study characterized expression profile of miRNAs in the Holstein cows’ mammary gland under summer heat stress or not. We observed miRNA expression during heat stress, which was significantly different from non-heat stress states. A comprehensive analysis of the miRNA’s expression will be helpful to further study the link of miRNAs with mechanisms regulating heat stress in the cow mammary gland.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0500503cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aShanghai Agriculture Science Promotion Project (2019) No. 1-2cShanghai Science and Technology Promotion Project for Agriculture  aAKLGRCB2017006cOpen Fund of Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry, Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding 3aHolstein 3abioclimatology 3agenes 3aheat stress 3ainterleukin-1 3amammary glands 3amicroRNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asummer1 aHu, Ruiting1 aFan, Haixiao1 aYang, Ying1 aGong, Bin1 aZhang, Shaoze1 aDing, Jianping1 aSu, Yanjing1 aZhuo, Zhao1 aCheng, Jianbo0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2021 Feb., v. 65, no. 2 p.235-246dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-020-02025-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001800274520040200292592002800694650000800722650001200730650002300742650002300765650001800788650001300806653001900819653001900838653002500857653001000882653002900892700001500921700001800936700001900954700001500973700001700988773008101005856008101086852000901167655001201176IND60529242520221119082515.0161019e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052924252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Xiao-Feng10aAcid-catalyzed C–O coupling of styrenes with N-hydroxyphthalimide: trapping alkenyl radicals by TEMPO  ap. 3068-3072.  aA mild metal-free acid-catalyzed 1,2-dihydroxylaminations of alkenes with N-hydroxyphthalimide and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxyl (TEMPO) has been demonstrated under air conditions to furnish the dioxygenated products in good to excellent yields.

While such coupling of models can mirror the conceptual representation of the water-cycle, potential uncertainty propagation and aggregation across the sub-models may limit their overall performance. There are limited studies dealing with uncertainty in coupled hydrological models due to the high computational needs, the absence of detailed data, and the lack of efficient uncertainty propagation frameworks. This study presents an effective uncertainty propagation framework using a combination of statistical techniques, multi-variable calibration, and parallel computation. The framework was tested using a synthetic mathematical coupled model and a real‐world, coupled surface water (PRMS) and subsurface (MODFLOW) model. For the synthetic coupled model, the framework has shown its effectiveness to reveal the interplay of input variables, quantify the uncertainties within each sub-model and track their propagation through the coupled modeling system. For the PRMS-MODFLOW model, the framework has demonstrated how uncertainty in input precipitation, surface water, and subsurface water sub-models influences the different segments of a hydrograph. The results also indicate that improved predictions of high flow require a better quantification of input uncertainty. In contrast, baseflow and recession flow uncertainties largely depend on the subsurface and surface water sub-models, respectively. The presented framework, in addition to providing relatively comprehensive uncertainty information on the integrated model outputs, it helps to identify the potential sources of uncertainty that can be used for further model improvement and guide new data collection campaigns.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3adata collection 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic models 3asurface water 3auncertainty 0aUncertainty propagation 0aCoupled models 0aHydrological model uncetainty 0aHydrologic modeling 0aIntegrated models 0aNSMC 0aWS 0aMODFLOW 0aPRMS 0aGSFLOW 0aUA 0aPEST 0aBeoPEST 0aBMV 0aTMV1 aDemissie, Yonas1 aLi, Hongyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9807-38510 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Oct., v. 589 p.125341-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1253413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012700170520098000297592002801277650002501305650002401330650001101354650001401365650001501379650001401394650002601408650001101434650001101445650002001456653002501476653002501501653002001526653001701546653001501563700002701578700006201605773011801667856008601785852000901871655001201880IND60760266120221117225449.0220222e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076026612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1143372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatami, Kasra10aPure cultures for synthetic culture development: Next level municipal waste treatment for polyhydroxyalkanoates production  aPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), as bio-based plastics, promise a transition from petroleum products to green and sustainable alternatives.

It was demonstrated that volatile fatty acids (VFAs) derived from food waste and primary sludge are cheap carbon sources for maintaining high production yields in the synthetic cultures. The maximum obtained PHA was 77.54 ± 5.67% of cell dried weight (CDW) (1.723 g/L) from Cupriavidus necator and 54.9 ± 3.66% of CDW (1.088 g/L) from Burkholderia cepacia. The acquired results are comparable to those in literature using sugar substrates. Comparatively, lower PHA productions were obtained from the co-cultivations ranging between 36-45 CDW% (0.39–0.48 g/L).

To date, only polyprenol reductases (PR‐Dol) involved in dolichol biosynthesis have been identified as enzymes capable of reducing Z,E‐mixed prenyl groups. Although C₃₅‐isoprenoids with reduced Z,E‐mixed prenyl groups are found in mycobacteria, Z,E‐mixed heptaprenyl reductase (HepR) remains unidentified. In the present study, the identification and functional analysis of HepR was performed. No PR‐Dol homolog gene was detected in the genome of Mycolicibacterium vanbaalenii. However, a homolog of geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR), which reacts with an all‐E prenyl group as a substrate, was encoded in the genome; thus, we analyzed it as a HepR candidate. In vitro enzymatic assay and in vivo gene suppression analysis identified the GGR homolog as HepR and revealed that HepR catalyzes the reduction of ω‐ and E‐ prenyl units in Z,E‐mixed heptaprenyl diphosphates, and C₃₅‐isoprenoids are mainly biosynthesized using E,E,E‐geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a precursor. Thus, it was demonstrated that the Z,E‐mixed prenyl reductase family exists in the GGR homologs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of a new type of Z,E‐mixed prenyl reductase with no sequence homology to PR‐Dol. The substrate specificity of HepR significantly differed from that of GGR, suggesting that it is a new enzyme. HepR homologs are widely distributed in mycobacterial genomes, and lipid analysis suggests that many strains, including pathogenic species, produce HepR metabolites. The discovery of this new enzyme will promote further research on Z,E‐mixed isoprenoids.  aPublisher supplied data  aJ21J0076cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  a18H02145cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a19K22273cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20K15455cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a21J14050cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3alipids 3ametabolites 3aoxidoreductases 3asequence homology 3asubstrate specificity1 aHakamata, Mariko1 aNishiyama, Akihito1 aTateishi, Yoshitaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1200-00001 aMatsumoto, Sohkichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6106-75381 aHemmi, Hisashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9538-809X1 aUeda, Daijiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9870-76901 aSato, Tsutomu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1130-90250 tFEBS journal.g2022 Aug., v. 289, no. 16 p.4981-4997dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.164123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03945naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010400162300001600266520235600282592002802638650001302666650001502679650001702694650002102711650002702732650001602759650001902775650001602794650001702810650001902827650001302846650001402859650001802873650001902891650001602910650001702926650001002943650001102953650000902964650001102973650001202984651001002996653000903006653002203015653001803037653001703055700001603072700001803088700001403106700001403120700001803134773011203152856008203264852000903346655001203355IND60611882120221117215547.0190411e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061188212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2016.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zheng10aEffects of integrated agronomic practices management on root growth and development of summer maize  ap. 140-151.  aRoot growth and development of summer maize (Zea mays L.) is an important process in determining grain yield. In comparison to the information on above ground plant responses only limited knowledge exists on the response of root growth and development to integrated agronomic practices management (defined as a comprehensive management framework consisted of tillage method, plant density, seeding and harvest date, and fertilizer application) under field conditions. Two experiments, integrated agronomic practices management (IAPM) and nitrogen rate testing (NAT) were used to determine the effects on summer maize root system in the course of five years in North China. IAPM consisted of four treatments (CK: local conventional cultivation practices, Opt-1: an optimized combination of cropping system and fertilizer treatment, HY: treatment based on high-yield studies, and Opt-2: a further optimized combination of cropping system and fertilizer treatment). NAT had four treatments of nitrogen rate (0, 129.0, 184.5, and 300.0kgNha−1).Individual/population root dry weight, individual/population absorption area, surface, volume, and length density of root and grain yield were measured. Roots were sampled per plot at six-leaf stage (V6), tasseling stage (VT), milk stage (R3) and physiological maturity stage (R6). The results from IAPM revealed that Opt-2 significantly increased dry weight, volume, superficial area, and length density of root across the 0–30cm soil layer of whole growth period. Root active absorption area of Opt-2 exhibited a significant increase in the 0–30cm soil layer of whole growth period except V6. In compare with root/shoot ratio of CK, this of Opt-2 increased by 14.5% at VT and 16.3% at R6. Results from NAT revealed that N with a range from 0 to 184.5kgNha−1 played a positive role in root growth and development. Dry weight, absorbing area of root, and the root/shoot ratio increased as N rate rise within certain limits and then decreased significantly. Dry weight, the proportion of deeply distributed, absorption area, length density of root, and root/shoot ratio increased due to appropriate population, reasonable fertilizer management, and suitable harvest date, which provided sufficient nutrients and moisture to aboveground parts for growth, development, and high grain yield of summer maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aabsorption 3aaerial parts 3acropping systems 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3afilling period 3agrain yield 3aharvest date 3amaturity stage 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aplant density 3aplant response 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3asowing 3atillage 3aChina 0aRoot 0aAgronomic pattern 0aNitrogen rate 0aSummer maize1 aZhu, Kunlun1 aDong, Shuting1 aLiu, Peng1 aZhao, Bin1 aZhang, Jiwang0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2017 Mar., v. 84 p.140-151dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2016.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245008800167300001600255520158300271592002801854650001901882650001101901650002501912650001501937650001501952650001201967650001301979650002501992650002602017650001002043650001402053651001102067653002202078653002002100653001402120653001402134653001002148653000902158653003502167653001202202653002002214653001002234700002202244700002102266700002102287773011802308856007802426852000902504655001202513IND60515879120221121030040.0160321e20140324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587912DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-04022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldron, Kaysandra10aComparisons of spatial patterns between windthrow and logging at two spatial scales  ap. 740-749.  aWindthrow is a dominant natural disturbance in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. To provide the range of variability of a natural disturbance, its spatial distribution and patch metrics at stand and landscape scales have to be considered, together with the characterization of its severity. Our study characterized both partial windthrow (PW) and total windthrow (TW) spatial distributions at the landscape scale and patchiness within affected stands (stand scale). Landscape scale corresponded to three areas of about 5000 ha. Stand scale was the finest scale of analysis and corresponded to each affected stand within landscapes. In addition, windthrow spatial characteristics were compared with spatial characteristics of harvested areas (CUT). At the landscape scale, our results showed that TW stands were more isolated than PW stands and that mean shape complexity of disturbed stands was low, regardless of whether the disturbance was a windthrow or a harvested area. At the affected stand scale, residual trees covered a significantly higher proportion of PW stands than TW stands and CUT. CUT and TW did not share many spatial characteristics at the stand scale. CUT had a significantly higher proportion of complete canopy openness than TW. Our results showed that PW are spatially heterogeneous at both landscape and stand scales. In an ecosystem management context, i.e., a management that reduces the discrepancy between natural and managed forests, our results showed that forest managers could practice a variety of harvesting methods of different intensities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3acanopy 3aecosystem management 3aharvesting 3alandscapes 3alogging 3amanagers 3aspatial distribution 3astand characteristics 3atrees 3awindthrow 3aCanada 0apartial windthrow 0atotal windthrow 0aclearcuts 0alandscape 0astand 0asize 0amean nearest-neighbor distance 0adensity 0acanopy openness 0ashape1 aRuel, Jean-Claude1 aGauthier, Sylvie1 aGoulet, Philippe0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2014 Mar. 24, v. 44, no. 7 p.740-749dNRC Research Pressx1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-04023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012600171300001800297520154100315592002801856650001501884650002001899650002301919650001901942650002401961650001301985650001401998650001902012650001102031650001902042650001702061650001402078650001302092650002002105650001602125650001702141650001302158650001302171700002202184700002502206700002402231700002202255700002102277700002602298700001302324700001702337700002502354700001802379700001502397773015002412856008102562852000902643655001202652IND60614120320221119085027.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061412032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-018-2771-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Paoli, Silvia H.10aDissecting the biochemical architecture and morphological release pathways of the human platelet extracellular vesiculome  ap. 3781-3801.  aPlatelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs) have emerged as potential mediators in intercellular communication. PEVs exhibit several activities with pathophysiological importance and may serve as diagnostic biomarkers. Here, imaging and analytical techniques were employed to unveil morphological pathways of the release, structure, composition, and surface properties of PEVs derived from human platelets (PLTs) activated with the thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP). Based on extensive electron microscopy analysis, we propose four morphological pathways for PEVs release from TRAP-activated PLTs: (1) plasma membrane budding, (2) extrusion of multivesicular α-granules and cytoplasmic vacuoles, (3) plasma membrane blistering and (4) “pearling” of PLT pseudopodia. The PLT extracellular vesiculome encompasses ectosomes, exosomes, free mitochondria, mitochondria-containing vesicles, “podiasomes” and PLT “ghosts”. Interestingly, a flow cytometry showed a population of TOM20⁺LC3⁺ PEVs, likely products of platelet mitophagy. We found that lipidomic and proteomic profiles were different between the small PEV (S-PEVs; mean diameter 103 nm) and the large vesicle (L-PEVs; mean diameter 350 nm) fractions separated by differential centrifugation. In addition, the majority of PEVs released by activated PLTs was composed of S-PEVs which have markedly higher thrombin generation activity per unit of PEV surface area compared to L-PEVs, and contribute approximately 60% of the PLT vesiculome procoagulant potency.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood platelets 3acell communication 3acentrifugation 3aelectron microscopy 3aexosomes 3aextrusion 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amitochondria 3amitophagy 3apeptides 3aplasma membrane 3apseudopodia 3asurface area 3athrombin 3avacuoles1 aTegegn, Tseday Z.1 aElhelu, Oumsalama K.1 aStrader, Michael B.1 aPatel, Mehulkumar1 aDiduch, Lukas L.1 aTarandovskiy, Ivan D.1 aWu, Yong1 aZheng, Jiwen1 aOvanesov, Mikhail V.1 aAlayash, Abdu1 aSimak, Jan0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2018 Oct., v. 75, no. 20 p.3781-3801dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2771-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245020700171300001600378520153900394592002801933650001901961650001401980650001001994650001302004650001602017650001102033650001802044650001202062650003102074650001502105650001202120650002202132650001602154650001202170650002302182650001402205653001402219653001502233653001102248653001702259653001102276700002802287700002102315773012802336856008102464852000902545655001202554IND60540048620221119185017.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054004862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2014.08.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAidoo, Roger Philip10aRheological properties, melting behaviours and physical quality characteristics of sugar-free chocolates processed using inulin/polydextrose bulking mixtures sweetened with stevia and thaumatin extracts  ap. 592-597.  aDemand for use of natural sweeteners and prebiotic compounds for manufacture of sugar-free chocolates has dramatically increased over the past decennium. However, their applicability in product formulation and how these will affect the flow (rheological) and physical quality characteristics still remains a big challenge. This study investigated the rheological properties, melting behaviours and other physical quality characteristics of sugar-free chocolates processed from inulin and polydextrose mixtures as bulking agents sweetened with stevia and thaumatin extracts. Standard reference chocolate was developed using sucrose and the effects of the inulin/polydextrose and stevia/thaumatin ingredients on the rheological properties, melting profiles, colour and hardness of the derived products measured using standard methods. Generally, the sugar-free chocolates showed similar flow (rheological) and melting properties as compared to the reference chocolate. Sucrose replacement with the inulin/polydextrose and stevia/thaumatin extracts resulted in significantly higher Casson viscosity. There were however no significant differences in the melting behaviour and texture of the sugar-free chocolates and the reference. Chocolates containing the sugar substitutes recorded lower onset temperatures and higher peak widths than the reference sample. Inulin and polydextrose mixtures could be used for sugar-free chocolate manufacture with satisfactory physicochemical properties when sweetened with stevia or thaumatin extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulking agents 3achocolate 3acolor 3ahardness 3aingredients 3ainulin 3amanufacturing 3amelting 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprebiotics 3asucrose 3asugar substitutes 3atemperature 3atexture 3athermal properties 3aviscosity 0aChocolate 0aSugar-free 0aInulin 0aPolydextrose 0aStevia1 aAfoakwa, Emmanuel Ohene1 aDewettinck, Koen0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 June, v. 62, no. 1 p.592-597dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2014.08.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04191naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012600165500001400291520239200305592002802697650002602725650002202751650003002773650001602803650001902819650001602838650001802854650001202872650001202884650001102896650001602907650002602923650001102949650001602960650001402976650000902990650002402999650001503023650002203038650001903060650000803079650001003087650001403097650001503111650001003126650001903136651001203155653002803167653002203195653001803217653001603235700002303251700002003274700002103294700002103315773012503336856008303461852000903544655001203553IND60716078120221118170301.0210212e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071607812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2020.1071872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Marion10aReintroduction of rare arable plants in extensively managed fields: Effects of crop type, sowing density and soil tillage  aNAL-light  aVegetation of arable fields has changed significantly over the past decades as indicated by a marked decline in the abundance and diversity of arable plants. Thus, beyond the preservation of remnant populations, introduction of autochthonous seeds is a necessary measure to promote threatened arable plants and to restore agro-ecosystems. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the most suitable agricultural methods for plant establishment. This topic was investigated for three winter annuals (Legousia speculum-veneris, Consolida regalis, Lithospermum arvense) in a three-year field experiment in southern Germany. We established 14 management treatments with five replicates in a completely randomized block design. In year 1, arable plants were sown in a mixture of 850 seeds m⁻² either without crop or with cereal crops in different sowing densities (25 %, 100 %). After crop harvest different types of soil tillage were applied (rotary cultivator, mouldboard plough). In year 2, four different crop types (autumn-sown spelt, spring-sown triticale, pea, clover-grass) were sown, and in year 3, rye was cultivated. Establishment was measured yearly as seed production of the rare arable plants, and their overall population growth rates were calculated at the end of the study period. Highest population growth rates were observed in L. speculum-veneris, followed by C. regalis and L. arvense. Population growth of the target plants decreased significantly with crop and weed cover averaged over the study period. Initial crop sowing densities had a significant impact on first-year establishment, with persisting effects in years 2 and 3. Best results were obtained without cover crop compared to cereals sown with 25 or 100 % sowing density. The establishment of target plants was also affected by crop type in year 2 (spelt > pea > spring triticale > clover-grass). However, establishment was overall high in year 3, when all plots were cultivated with rye. Type of soil tillage had no effect within the crop rotation ‘rye–clover-grass–rye’, while rotary cultivation in ‘without crop–rye–rye’ was positive for the establishment of L. speculum-veneris and L. arvense. The results indicate good opportunities for the reintroduction of rare arable plants under different crop rotations with best results for extensively managed fields with low crop competition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBuglossoides arvensis 3aConsolida regalis 3aadministrative management 3aagriculture 3aagroecosystems 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3adecline 3adensity 3adesign 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3afields 3agrain crops 3aknowledge 3apeas 3aplant establishment 3apopulation 3apopulation growth 3arotary tillage 3arye 3aseeds 3atriticale 3avegetation 3aweeds 3awinter annuals 3aGermany 0aAgricultural management 0aAgro-biodiversity 0aEstablishment 0aRestoration1 aKollmann, Johannes1 aPrestele, Julia1 aWiesinger, Klaus1 aAlbrecht, Harald0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 306 p.107187-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.1071873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03917naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245013600207300001800343500001500361520248300376592002802859650001202887650002202899650003002921650001202951650002302963650001002986650002802996650001603024650001903040650001903059650002403078650002403102650002103126650002103147650001703168651000903185700001903194700002203213773014503235856008203380852000903462655001203471IND60708403820221119202441.0200825e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070840382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-019-00509-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArekhi, Maliheh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2919-288910aDrought monitoring and assessment using Landsat TM/OLI data in the agricultural lands of Bandar-e-Turkmen and Gomishan cities, Iran  ap. 6691-6708.  agolden set  aInvestigating agricultural drought is very important in semiarid areas, and it has a significant impact on people’s livelihood, which depends on farming. This research tried to examine the capability of six Landsat surface reflectance bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and drought indices (DIs) for drought monitoring in the agricultural lands of Bandar-e-Turkmen and Gomishan cities in 1986 and 2015. Statistical analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and correlation matrices between the VIs and DIs with land surface temperature (LST) were monitored separately for each date. In addition, the spatial and temporal drought extents using the Standardized Evapotranspiration Precipitation Index (SPEI) and the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) approaches were determined and compared for both study periods. The correlations between the LST and VIs were negative and significant in both study periods. The range of VI values decreased with increasing temperature in 2015 compared to 1986. The mean surface reflectance of the visible bands (blue, green, red), NIR (near-infrared), SWIR (shortwave infrared), and MWIR (mid-wave infrared) increased in 2015 compared to 1986. A higher spectral reflectance of the visible bands indicated a reduction in vegetation cover or increase in stress in 2015 compared to 1986. Meanwhile, the SWIR and MWIR bands showed that the average surface reflectance increased in 2015, while they showed a lower reflectance in 1986. The results of the Water Supplying Vegetation Index (WSVI) implied that the crop water stress in 2015 was more than that in 1986. The VHIs were separately compared with the NDVI and LST in each period of study. The maximum LST increased from 38 °C in 1986 to 44 °C in 2015. The moderate drought extent was 65% in 2015, while the study area did not experience any drought in 1986. The SPEI maps showed that the entire study area experienced moderate drought in 2015, while no drought was observed in 1986. The results showed that the DIs and VIs and the visible, SWIR and MWIR surface reflectance bands can be effectively used by sampling plots in future drought assessment studies. The present study also emphasizes that there is a similarity between traditional and remote sensing methods and indicates that remote sensing data can be effectively used instead of traditional approaches when there is no meteorological station. The results would be useful in food security and sustainable agriculture management plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural land 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3alight 3anear infrared radiation 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asemiarid zones 3ashortwave radiation 3asurface temperature 3avegetation cover 3avegetation index 3awater stress 3aIran1 aSaglam, Serhun1 aOzkan, Ulas Yunus0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Oct., v. 22, no. 7 p.6691-6708dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-019-00509-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016100160300001800321500002000339520128300359592002801642596006701670650002101737650002501758650002201783650001201805650002001817650002101837650001201858650001801870650005201888650001101940650001901951650001301970650001901983700002802002700003002030700006402060700005802124700001702182773012202199856007302321852000902394655001202403IND60701652920221121091953.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070165292DNAL7 a10.1111/are.146442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Mayte10aInduction of spawning in Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone, 1931) by injection of its molt inhibiting hormone isoform II produced in E. coli  ap. 3100-3108.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe optimization of reproductive parameters in shrimp farming continues to be a challenge for most producing countries. Although the crustacean neuropeptides have been studied extensively in the last two decades, the functions of most of these neuropeptides remained putative. Among them, molt‐inhibiting hormone isoform II (MIH II) has shown an important role in vitellogenesis. In this study, the cDNA encoding mature MIH II peptide was isolated by RT‐PCR from the L. vannamei eyestalk. The cDNA was cloned into pET28a bacterial expression vector. Recombinant MIH II was obtained in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies and purified to ~88% purity. Two doses of rMIH II and a negative control group were assayed in vivo. The stages of ovarian maturation and spawning were recorded during 72 hr post‐injection. The results showed that ovarian maturation occurred approximately in 9% and 33% of females injected with rMIH II at the doses of 300 and 600 ng/gbw respectively. Neither maturation nor spawning was detected in the negative control group. Females injected with 600 ng/gbw, which showed vitellogenic stages III and IV, spawned. These preliminary results argue that the hormone rMIH II could be a promising candidate to induce spawning in L. vannamei shrimp.  aPublisher supplied data  cCenter for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana, Cuba 3aEscherichia coli 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3acomplementary DNA 3afemales 3agenetic vectors 3ainclusion bodies 3amolting 3aneuropeptides 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3aspawning 3avitellogenesis1 aBetancourt, Jesús Luis1 aRodríguez‐Ramos, Tania1 aEstrada, Mario Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6238-36631 aCarpio, Yamila1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8892-29631 aRamos, Laida0 tAquaculture research.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.3100-3108dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017800153300002000331520152400351592002801875650001501903650003401918650002701952650001601979700001301995700001502008700001602023700001902039700001802058700001702076700001502093700001202108700001702120773014202137856007402279852000902353655001202362IND60643139520221122031435.0190509e20190507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064313952DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta02283j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Wei10aSimultaneously increasing open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current to minimize the energy loss in organic solar cells via designing asymmetrical non-fullerene acceptor  ap. 11053-11061.  aThe inevitable energy loss (Eₗₒₛₛ) in organic solar cells (OSCs) makes it a challenge to simultaneously enhance the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC). Herein, we designed and synthesized an asymmetrical non-fullerene small molecule acceptor (SMA), namely a-BTTIC, with a novel eight-fused ladder-type donor unit. Compared to its symmetrical analogue (BTTIC), a-BTTIC shows a red-shifted absorption (by over 20 nm) and an elevated LUMO level (by 0.07 eV), which was beneficial for boosting VOC and JSC concurrently. As a result, OSCs based on a-BTTIC achieved higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 13.60% with simultaneously increased VOC and JSC and a significantly lower Eₗₒₛₛ of 0.526 eV than the BTTIC-based OSCs. We noted that the 13.60% PCE and the 0.526 eV Eₗₒₛₛ were the best values among OSCs based on commercialized PBDB-T. Through various electrical and morphological characterizations, we observed that the simultaneous enhancement of VOC and JSC in a-BTTIC-based OSCs was attributed to the different molecular conformations and the small change in LUMO level from neutral to ion state of asymmetrical SMAs. Overall, our design route for asymmetrical SMAs serves the dual roles of minimizing the Eₗₒₛₛ and promoting the PCE. These results shed light on how to further reduce Eₗₒₛₛ for high-performance OSCs with Eₗₒₛₛ below 0.6 eV, which thus provides a promising molecular design strategy for further PCE breakthroughs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectric potential difference 3amolecular conformation 3asolar cells1 aLiu, Tao1 aLi, Jiewei1 aXiao, Yiqun1 aZhang, Guangye1 aChen, Yuzhong1 aZhong, Cheng1 aLu, Xinhui1 aYan, He1 aYang, Chuluo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 May 7, v. 7, no. 18 p.11053-11061dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta02283j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009600164300001600260520136400276592002801640650002601668650001801694650002301712650001101735650001201746650001601758650001301774650001401787650001601801650001001817651001101827653002201838653002301860653001801883653001901901653002601920700002601946700001801972700002201990700001902012773011802031856007802149852000902227655001202236IND60515879620221121030145.0160321e20140318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587962DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-05112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrobyshev, Igor10aEnvironmental controls of the northern distribution limit of yellow birch in eastern Canada  ap. 720-731.  aTo evaluate environmental controls of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) distribution at its northern distribution limit in eastern Canada, we analyzed abundance, age structure, biomass accumulation rate, and growth sensitivity to climate of this species at 14 sites along a 200 km latitudinal gradient spanning three bioclimatic domains and reaching frontier populations of this species in western Quebec. We observed a large variability in seedling density across domains and presence of sites with abundant yellow birch regeneration within all three bioclimatic domains. Seedling density was positively correlated to mean age and abundance of yellow birch trees in the canopy, while sapling density was positively associated with dryer habitats. Growth patterns of canopy trees showed no effect of declining temperatures along the south–north gradient. Environmental controls of birch distribution at its northern limit were realized through factors affecting birch regeneration and not growth of canopy trees. At the stand scale, regeneration density was strongly controlled by local site conditions and not by differences in climate among sites. At the regional scale, climate variability could be an indirect driver of yellow birch distribution, affecting disturbance rates and, subsequently, availability of suitable sites for regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula alleghaniensis 3aage structure 3abiomass production 3acanopy 3aclimate 3acorrelation 3ahabitats 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3atrees 3aQuebec 0aclimatic envelope 0adisturbance regime 0amixed forests 0aclimate change 0aBetula alleghaniensis1 aGuitard, Marc-Antoine1 aAsselin, Hugo1 aGenries, Aurélie1 aBergeron, Yves0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2014 Mar. 18, v. 44, no. 7 p.720-731dNRC Research Pressx1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-05113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006000167300001800227520089800245592002801143650001301171650001201184650001201196650001301208650001101221650001101232650001501243650000901258650001101267650000901278650001201287650001301299650000901312651001201321653002301333653001701356653001801373653001601391653001901407653001801426700001801444700001801462773009601480856008101576852000901657655001201666IND60724920020221119061506.0210124e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072492002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdagunodo, T.A.10aHeavy metals' data in soils for agricultural activities  ap. 1847-1855.  aIn this article, the heavy metals in soils for agricultural activities were analyzed statistically.

E.10aPyruvate Occupancy in the Carboxyl Transferase Domain of Pyruvate Carboxylase Facilitates Product Release from the Biotin Carboxylase Domain through an Intermolecular Mechanism  ap. 3447-3460.  aProtein structure, ligand binding, and catalytic turnover contributes to the governance of catalytic events occurring at spatially distinct domains in multifunctional enzymes. Coordination of these catalytic events partially rests on the ability of spatially discrete active sites to communicate with other allosteric and active sites on the same polypeptide chain (intramolecular) or on different polypeptide chains (intermolecular) within the holoenzyme. Often, communication results in long-range effects on substrate binding or product release. For example, pyruvate binding to the carboxyl transferase (CT) domain of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) increases the rate of product release in the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain. In order to address how CT domain ligand occupancy is “sensed” by other domains, we generated functional, mixed hybrid tetramers using the E218A (inactive BC domain) and T882S (low pyruvate binding, low activity) mutant forms of PC. The apparent Kₐ ₚyᵣᵤᵥₐₜₑ for the pyruvate-stimulated release of Pᵢ catalyzed by the T882S:E218A[₁:₁] hybrid tetramer was comparable to the wild-type enzyme and nearly 10-fold lower than that for the T882S homotetramer. In addition, the ratio of the rates of oxaloacetate formation to Pᵢ release for the WT:T882S[₁:₁] and E218A:T882S[₁:₁] hybrid tetramer-catalyzed reactions was 0.5 and 0.6, respectively, while the T882S homotetramer exhibited a near 1:1 coupling of the two domains, suggesting that the mechanisms coordinating catalytic events is more complicated that we initially assumed. The results presented here are consistent with an intermolecular communication mechanism, where pyruvate binding to the CT domain is “sensed” by domains on a different polypeptide chain within the tetramer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abiotin 3amutants 3apolypeptides 3aprotein structure 3apyruvate carboxylase 3apyruvic acid1 aAdams, Stephanie L.1 aBergman, Hanna L.1 aZeczycki, Tonya N.0 tBiochemistry.g2016 June 21, v. 55, no. 24 p.3447-3460dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.6b003723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245015100166300001800317520098900335650002001324650002001344650001501364650003701379650000901416650001401425650002001439650001001459650002201469650002301491650001501514650001301529650001001542650001001552650001201562651001901574700002201593700001501615700002101630700002201651700002301673700001801696700001801714773016201732856004701894852000901941655001201950IND60522202820221119181651.0160602e20160323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052220282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b000642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarbaix, Helene10aIdentification of Proteins and Peptide Biomarkers for Detecting Banned Processed Animal Proteins (PAPs) in Meat and Bone Meal by Mass Spectrometry  ap. 2405-2414.  aThe outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom in 1986, with processed animal proteins (PAPs) as the main vector of the disease, has led to their prohibition in feed. The progressive release of the feed ban required the development of new analytical methods to determine the exact origin of PAPs from meat and bone meal. We set up a promising MS-based method to determine the species and the source (legal or not) present in PAPs: a TCA–acetone protein extraction followed by a cleanup step, an in-solution tryptic digestion of 5 h (with a 1:20 protein/trypsin ratio), and mass spectrometry analyses, first without any a priori, with a Q-TOF, followed by a targeted triple-quadrupole analysis. Using this procedure, we were able to overcome some of the major limitations of the official methods to analyze PAPs, detecting and identifying prohibited animal products in feedstuffs by the monitoring of peptides specific for cows, pigs, and sheep in PAPs. 3aanimal products 3aanimal proteins 3abiomarkers 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3acows 3adigestion 3adisease vectors 3afeeds 3amass spectrometry 3ameat and bone meal 3amonitoring 3apeptides 3asheep 3aswine 3atrypsin 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBudinger, Dimitri1 aDieu, Marc1 aFumiere, Olivier1 aGillard, Nathalie1 aDelahaut, Philippe1 aMauro, Sergio1 aRaes, Martine0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Mar. 23, v. 64, no. 11 p.2405-2414dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00064  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300001800270520133900288592002801627596001801655650001101673650001501684650002001699650001201719650002901731650001601760650000901776650001101785650001901796650001401815650002201829650001701851650001201868650002601880700002501906700002101931700002701952700002301979700002002002700001902022700002102041700002002062700002402082700006302106773015002169856008102319852000902400655001202409IND60614120820221119084939.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061412082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-018-2832-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaron, Nicolas10aProliferation of hippocampal progenitors relies on p27-dependent regulation of Cdk6 kinase activity  ap. 3817-3827.  aNeural stem cells give rise to granule dentate neurons throughout life in the hippocampus. Upon activation, these stem cells generate fast proliferating progenitors that complete several rounds of divisions before differentiating into neurons. Although the mechanisms regulating the activation of stem cells have been intensively studied, little attention has been given so far to the intrinsic machinery allowing the expansion of the progenitor pool. The cell cycle protein Cdk6 positively regulates the proliferation of hippocampal progenitors, but the mechanism involved remains elusive. Whereas Cdk6 functions primarily as a cell cycle kinase, it can also act as transcriptional regulator in cancer cells and hematopoietic stem cells. Using mouse genetics, we show here that the function of Cdk6 in hippocampal neurogenesis relies specifically on its kinase activity. The present study also reveals a specific regulatory mechanism for Cdk6 in hippocampal progenitors. In contrast to the classical model of the cell cycle, we observe that the Cip/Kip family member p27, rather than the Ink4 family, negatively regulates Cdk6 in the adult hippocampus. Altogether, our data uncover a unique, cell type-specific regulatory mechanism controlling the expansion of hippocampal progenitors, where Cdk6 kinase activity is modulated by p27.  aPublisher supplied data  aP7/07cBelspo 3aadults 3acell cycle 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahippocampus 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aneural stem cells 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3atranscription factors1 aGenin, Emmanuelle C.1 aMarlier, Quentin1 aVerteneuil, Sébastien1 aBeukelaers, Pierre1 aMorel, Laurence1 aHu, Miaofen G.1 aHinds, Philip W.1 aNguyen, Laurent1 aVandenbosch, Renaud1 aMalgrange, Brigitte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8957-25280 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2018 Oct., v. 75, no. 20 p.3817-3827dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2832-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016900154300002000323520148100343592002801824650002401852650002901876650001401905650001601919650001701935650001701952650001501969650001901984650002202003650002502025650002202050700001702072700001302089700001402102700001602116773014202132856007402274852000902348655001202357IND60643139720221122041816.0190509e20190507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064313972DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta02314c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Min10aHigh-performance binary cross-linked alkaline anion polymer electrolyte membranes for all-solid-state supercapacitors and flexible rechargeable zinc–air batteries  ap. 11257-11264.  aDevelopment of a high-performance alkaline anion-exchange membrane (AAEM) is a subject of intense research owing to its potential applications in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, supercapacitors and zinc–air batteries. However, high ionic conductivity is still a major challenge for AAEM. Herein, we developed a novel binary cross-linking strategy by employing glutaraldehyde (GA) and pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (PCL) as binary cross-linkers for fabricating a highly conductive, flexible and thin AAEM composed of poly(vinyl alcohol)/guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride (PGG-GP). The resultant PGG-GP membrane delivered an exceptional hydroxide conductivity of 0.123 S cm⁻¹ at room temperature, while retaining high swelling resistance, outstanding mechanical strength and excellent thermal stability. An activated carbon-based all-solid-state supercapacitor exploiting the PGG-GP membrane as an electrolyte demonstrated a long cycling life of 8000 charge/discharge cycles with 87.5% capacitance retention. Moreover, the flexible all-solid-state zinc–air batteries comprising the PGG-GP polymer electrolyte displayed a peak power density of 50.2 mW cm⁻² and a superior cycling stability (9 h @ 2 mA cm⁻²). These merits make the PGG-GP membrane very promising for application in both all-solid-state supercapacitors and flexible, rechargeable zinc–air batteries, providing new opportunities for improving the ionic conductivity in all-solid-state devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanion-exchange membranes 3abatteries 3acapacitance 3acrosslinking 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3aglutaraldehyde 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal stability1 aXu, Nengneng1 aFu, Jing1 aLiu, Yuyu1 aQiao, Jinli0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 May 7, v. 7, no. 18 p.11257-11264dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta02314c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015500166520136000321592002801681650001301709650001501722650001501737650002201752650002901774650001501803650001601818650001701834650001801851650001301869650001101882650001801893650001501911650001301926650003401939650001401973650001501987650001602002653002502018653001802043653001502061653001902076700001702095700001802112700001502130700001602145773011402161856008602275852000902361655001202370IND60760267020221117225425.0220531e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076026702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1280742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qikai12aA novel cationic graphene modified cyclodextrin adsorbent with enhanced removal performance of organic micropollutants and high antibacterial activity  aThe coexistence of pathogenic microorganisms and refractory organic chemicals in water nurtures certain biological and chemical risks to human beings and the water environment as a whole. For an environmentally friendly utilization of water cleaning and recycling technologies, a bifunctional cationic cyclodextrin material (GD-DTAC) with adsorption and bactericidal function was designed. By a simple crosslinking method, GD-DTAC was prepared with graphene supported citric acid-β-cyclodextrin polymer (GD) and dimethyldodecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride (DTAC). Following the introduction of rich quaternary ammonium groups by DTAC, GD-DTAC realized a double regulation of surface positive charge and wettability. The maximum adsorption capacities of Roxarsone (ROX), Methyl Orange (MO) and Bisphenol A (BPA) were 153.59 mg/g, 445.60 mg/g and 237.90 mg/g, respectively. Antibacterial activity tests showed the efficiency of DTAC not only for enhanced adhesion resistance, but it also realized the sterilization function. This work displays the potential of the prepared bifunctional materials for the removal of pollutants from wastewater as well as the suppression of micro-pollutants. The successful preparation of GD-DTAC provided a basis for the bifunctional material, which showed a great potential in adsorption and antibiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aammonium chloride 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiosis 3abisphenol A 3acrosslinking 3acyclodextrins 3agraphene 3ahumans 3amethyl orange 3apollutants 3apolymers 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3aroxarsone 3awastewater 3awettability 0aCyclodextrin complex 0aAntibacterial 0aAdsorption 0aQuaternization1 aWang, Jianyu1 aDuan, Chengyu1 aWang, Tong1 aZhou, Yanbo0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 426 p.128074-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1280743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01544naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009200175300001600267520029000283592002800573650001500601650004400616650000800660653002000668653002300688653002300711700002100734700002100755700001600776700002100792700002200813700001700835700001900852700001900871700002200890773014000912856008501052852000901137655001201146IND60527871220221119020734.0190415e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052787122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2016.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaees, Muhammad Adil10aDesflavasides A-D: Four new tetrasaccharide pregnane glycosides from Desmidorchis flava  ap. 230-235.  aFour new pregnane glycosides named desflavasides A-D (1–4) were isolated from the sap of Desmidorchis flava (N.E.Br) Meve & Liede.

Previously we experimentally showed the aphrodisiac effect of a chemically characterized aqueous extract of Turnera diffusa in male rats. However, the mechanism of action underlying such effects has not been studied. STUDY AIMS: As part of our systematic studies of pharmacological properties of Turnera diffusa, we aimed to analyze whether the increased sexual motivation and the augmented sexual performance of sexually sluggish (SL) male rats treated with Turnera diffusa involves the NO pathway. Additionally we analyzed whether such effects were exerted at the level of the brain or the spinal cord. Finally, anxiety levels and ambulatory activity were also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Turnera diffusa (10–40mg/kg) and sildenafil citrate (10mg/kg) with or without a nonspecific inhibitor of NO synthase, Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl esther (l-NAME, 12.5mg/kg) were evaluated in SL rats, in a standard sexual behavior test and in the fictive ejaculation model in spinal cord transected and urethane-anaesthetized SL rats. Anxiety levels or ambulation were assessed in the burying behavior and open-field tests. RESULTS: Turnera diffusa and sildenafil (both at 10mg/kg) facilitated expression of male sexual behavior by shortening mainly ejaculation latency. Treatments also facilitated the number of discharges in the ejaculatory motor pattern as well as the number of ejaculatory motor patterns and its associated penile erections. l-NAME prevented the pro-sexual effects of treatments on both experimental models. Besides, the extract of Turnera diffusa (10mg/kg) produced an anxiolytic-like effect in male rats without affecting ambulation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the present work support the notion that pro-sexual effect of the aqueous extract of Turnera diffusa in rats involves the participation of NO pathway, mainly at central level. The anxiolytic-like effect of Turnera diffusa is an advantage to its use for improving sexual performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurnera diffusa 3aanxiety 3abrain 3acitrates 3aejaculation 3amale effect 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3amotivation 3anitric oxide 3arats 3asexual behavior 3aspinal cord 3atraditional medicine 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Anxiety Agentsxpharmacology 2aEjaculationxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMotor Activityxdrug effects 2aNitric Oxidexphysiology 2aPiperazinesxpharmacology 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlant Leaves 2aPurinesxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aSulfonesxpharmacology 2aTurnera1 aCarro-Juárez, M.1 aMartínez-Mota, L.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Mar. 7, v. 146, no. 1 p.164-172dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011600208300001600324520178300340592002802123650001902151650001402170650001102184650002302195650001502218651001002233653004102243653002902284653001802313653001602331653001602347700001602363700001702379700001502396700001702411700001502428773010502443856008602548852000902634655001202643IND60615941520221118081446.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061594152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.09.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xiaojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2950-470X10aSpatial-temporal changes in the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in the Taihu Plain, China  ap. 846-859.  aThe longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the process-based connections between upstream and downstream areas and is fundamental to understanding the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological behaviour of river basins. However, the quantification of such connectivity remains a challenge due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods, especially in delta plains. In this study, based on the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations, a new and quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index (LFCI) was developed for delta plains. Focusing on the Taihu Plain, we then analysed the spatial-temporal changes in the LFCI during 1960–2012 and investigated the correlations between the LFCI and climate change and human activities. We found that the decadal, annual and seasonal changes in the average LFCI all presented slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period, but the annual average LFCI increased significantly after 1978; the average LFCIs in June, July, and August of the flood season were less than those in other months in the Taihu Plain. We also found that the spatial-temporal changes in the average LFCI exhibited larger differences at the subregional and station scales; those in the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu subregion were least, and the average LFCIs at stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations. Moreover, we found that the average LFCI had significant correlations with precipitation, river density and water surface ratio. Our results were consistent with common sense facts, which demonstrated that the indicator developed in this study can quite effectively quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3ahydrology 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aLongitudinal functional connectivity 0aSpatial-temporal changes 0aRiver systems 0aWater level 0aTaihu Plain1 aXu, Youpeng1 aHan, Longfei1 aSong, Song1 aXu, Guanglai1 aXiang, Jie0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Nov., v. 566 p.846-859dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.09.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03777naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015200209300001800361500001400379520196600393592002802359596010402387596010502491650002202596650001202618650001902630650002702649650002502676650001202701650001602713650001202729650001702741650001802758650001502776650002402791650001302815650001602828650002202844650001502866650001102881651001002892651001202902651001102914700006602925700003202991773014503023856008203168852000903250655001203259IND60708404620221119203750.0200825e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070840462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-019-00514-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFadairo, Olushola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1222-813910aPerceived livelihood impacts and adaptation of vegetable farmers to climate variability and change in selected sites from Ghana, Uganda and Nigeria  ap. 6831-6849.  aNAL-light  aIn the wake of deepened situations of changing climate, a clear understanding of the perceived impacts and adaptation of climate variability and change on livelihoods of vegetable farmers in Western and Eastern Africa, which is not readily available, is critical for sustainable vegetable production in Africa. Development planning for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessment was utilised in the study. Using multi-stage sampling procedure, 193 vegetable farmers in selected sites prominent for vegetable production from Uganda, Ghana and Nigeria were used. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and linear regression at α₀.₀₅. Awareness of climate variability and change was high among most respondents from the three countries, but highest among respondents from Uganda (78.3%). Awareness was highest for long dry spell ([Formula: see text] = 1.90) and drought ([Formula: see text] = 1.81) and lowest for harmful gas emissions ([Formula: see text] = 0.76). Changes in climate variability and trends were perceived to be highest in terms of flood volume/damage caused by flood to farmlands in Nigeria ([Formula: see text] = 3.85) and Uganda ([Formula: see text] = 5.0), but in terms of increased temperature for Ghana ([Formula: see text] = 4.93). Impact of climate-related changes on vegetable farming was high in Ghana (98.3%) and Nigeria (46.6%) but low in Uganda (5.0%). Awareness (β = 0.14), perception (β = 0.15) use of adaptation strategies (β = 0.10) and household size (β = − 0.19) predicted change in perceived impact of climate variability among vegetable farmers. Vegetable farmers in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda are affected differently by climate variability. Farmers in these countries also have different priorities for adaptation strategies. Locality-specific climate adaptation strategies would help ease farmers burden due to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aUnder the Climate Impact Research CapacitycDepartment for International Development, UK Government  aLeadership Enhancement Fellowship programmecDepartment for International Development, UK Government 3aagricultural land 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adescriptive statistics 3adevelopment planning 3adrought 3aenvironment 3afarmers 3aflood damage 3agas emissions 3alivelihood 3aregression analysis 3asampling 3atemperature 3avegetable growing 3avegetables 3avolume 3aGhana 3aNigeria 3aUganda1 aWilliams, Portia Adade1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5919-39301 aNalwanga, Faridah Sendagire0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Oct., v. 22, no. 7 p.6831-6849dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-019-00514-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016100159300002000320520127100340592002801611650001101639650001301650650002201663650002101685650002201706650001501728650001301743700001301756700001801769700001701787700001401804700001401818700001801832700001801850700001701868700001701885773014501902856007402047852000902121655001202130IND60641839520221119072702.0190506e20160913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064183952DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta05091c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xingchao10aSimple in situ synthesis of carbon-supported and nanosheet-assembled vanadium oxide for ultra-high rate anode and cathode materials of lithium ion batteries  ap. 13907-13915.  aA simple and efficient precipitation method has been developed for the in situ synthesis of a two-dimensional vanadium oxide@carbon nanosheet (2D V₂O₅@C NS). The crystalline structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared material were characterized systematically. The results demonstrate that the thickness of nanosheet is about 50 nm, and a thin C shell is successfully coated in situ on the surface of the V₂O₅ NS core. Benefiting from the intrinsic increased conductivity of the 2D V₂O₅@C NS and its robust NS structure, when the as-synthesized material is used as an anode material, it exhibits large reversible discharge capacity (860 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.5 A g⁻¹), good cycling performance (a high capacity of 802 mA h g⁻¹ at 1.0 A g⁻¹ after 200 cycles) and an ultra-high rate capability (reversible capabilities of 705 mA h g⁻¹ at 2.0 A g⁻¹, and 554 mA h g⁻¹ at 3.0 A g⁻¹). As a cathode material, the material also shows superior rate performance (reversible capabilities of 189, 166, 147, 139, 132, and 126 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 A g⁻¹, respectively). This work demonstrates a novel method for preparing vanadium-based NS material for high-performance lithium ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3ananosheets 3avanadium1 aJia, Wei1 aWang, Luxiang1 aHuang, Yudai1 aGuo, Yong1 aSun, Ying1 aJia, Dianzeng1 aPang, Weikong1 aGuo, Zaiping1 aTang, Xincun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Sept. 13, v. 4, no. 36 p.13907-13915dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta05091c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011800169300001800287520147900305592002801784650001501812650001501827650001201842650001401854650002001868650002801888650001401916650001601930650001101946650001501957650001401972650000701986650001701993650001402010650000902024650001302033650001102046650002802057650002102085650001902106651001002125653002602135653001302161653001002174700001702184700002202201773009602223856008102319852000902400655001202409IND60724920520221119061526.0210124e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072492052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcharya, Sanigdha10aAssessment of groundwater quality by water quality indices for irrigation and drinking in South West Delhi, India  ap. 2019-2028.  aGroundwater quality should be continuously monitored for irrigation and drinking purpose so that risk from geochemical contaminants can be reduced by appropriate treatment method. Therefore, the focus of the present study was to determine the suitability of groundwater collected from South West Delhi, India, for irrigation and drinking purpose on the basis of various water quality indices. In order to assess the groundwater quality, 50 samples were collected from different sites of selected study area and parameters such as pH, EC (electrical conductivity), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, total hardness (TH), total alkalinity (HCO₃⁻), calcium (Ca⁺²), magnesium (Mg⁺²), sodium (Na⁺), potassium (K⁺), chloride (Cl⁻), Fluoride (F⁻), sulfates (SO₄⁻²) and Nitrates (NO₃⁻) were determined. Based on the above parameters, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), soluble sodium percentage (SSP), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), Kelley's ratio (KR) and Na% were calculated. Water quality index (WQI), which is an important and unique rating to represent the overall water quality in a single term that is useful to determine the suitability of water for human consumption, was also estimated. The present dataset demonstrated the application of water quality indices that would be helpful to policymakers for appropriate management, treatment and sustainable societal development at large.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalkalinity 3acalcium 3achlorides 3adata collection 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3airrigation 3amagnesium 3apH 3apermeability 3apotassium 3arisk 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asodium carbonate 3awater hardness 3aIndia 0aWater quality indices 0aDrinking 0aDelhi1 aSharma, S.K.1 aKhandegar, Vinita0 tData in Brief.g2018 June, v. 18 p.2019-2028dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003000146245013400176300001800310500001500328520155100343650001801894650003601912650001901948650002101967650002501988650003102013650001902044650001302063650001102076650001202087650001302099650001502112650001402127650002502141650001602166650001502182653001702197700001602214700002602230773016202256856004702418852000902465655001202474IND60522203120221119183147.0160602e20160323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052220312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b004182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajendran, Subin R.

This study was focused on using bioinformatics and peptidomics to evaluate the specificity of peptide release and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in a peptic digest of potato protein isolate. Peptides in the protein hydrolysate were identified by LC–MS/MS and subsequently aligned to their parent potato tuber proteins. Five major proteins were selected for further analysis, namely, lipoxygenase, α-1,4-glucan phosphorylase, annexin, patatin, and polyubiquitin, based on protein coverage, abundance, confidence levels, and function. Comparison of the in silico peptide profile generated with ExPASy PeptideCutter and experimental peptidomics data revealed several differences. The experimental peptic cleavage sites were found to vary in number and specificity from PeptideCutter predictions. Average peptide chain length was also found to be higher than predicted with hexapeptides as the smallest detected peptides. Moreover, PTMs, particularly Met oxidation and Glu/Asp deamidation, were observed in some peptides, and these were unaccounted for during in silico analysis. PTMs can be formed during aging of potato tubers, or as a result of processing conditions during protein isolation and hydrolysis. The findings provide insights on the limitations of current bioinformatics tools for predicting bioactive peptide release from proteins, and on the existence of structural modifications that can alter the peptide bioactivity and functionality. 3aphosphorylase 3apost-translational modification 3apotato protein 3aprotein isolates 3abioactive properties 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3abioinformatics 3apeptides 3atubers 3apatatin 3apotatoes 3ahydrolysis 3aoxidation 3aprotein hydrolysates 3adeamidation 3aprediction 0alipoxygenase1 aMason, Beth1 aUdenigwe, Chibuike C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Mar. 23, v. 64, no. 11 p.2432-2437dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00418  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245014300162300001800305500002000323520164200343592002801985596014402013596006802157596006302225596006302288596007902351650000802430650001602438650001602454650001302470650001302483650002302496650001602519650001402535650000902549650001002558650002002568650001302588650002302601650001102624650003002635650001602665651001002681700001702691700001602708700001202724700001402736700001602750700001602766700001502782700002002797700001702817700005602834773012602890856007903016852000903095655001203104IND60647178820221118061018.0190617e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064717882DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.130212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xuefen10aChromosome‐level genome assembly of Triplophysa tibetana, a fish adapted to the harsh high‐altitude environment of the Tibetan Plateau  ap. 1027-1036.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTriplophysa is an endemic fish genus of the Tibetan Plateau in China. Triplophysa tibetana, which lives at a recorded altitude of ~4,000 m and plays an important role in the highland aquatic ecosystem, serves as an excellent model for investigating high‐altitude environmental adaptation. However, evolutionary and conservation studies of T. tibetana have been limited by scarce genomic resources for the genus Triplophysa. In the present study, we applied PacBio sequencing and the Hi‐C technique to assemble the T. tibetana genome. A 652‐Mb genome with 1,325 contigs with an N50 length of 3.1 Mb was obtained. The 1,137 contigs were further assembled into 25 chromosomes, representing 98.7% and 80.47% of all contigs at the base and sequence number level, respectively. Approximately 260 Mb of sequence, accounting for ~39.8% of the genome, was identified as repetitive elements. DNA transposons (16.3%), long interspersed nuclear elements (12.4%) and long terminal repeats (11.0%) were the most repetitive types. In total, 24,372 protein‐coding genes were predicted in the genome, and ~95% of the genes were functionally annotated via a search in public databases. Using whole genome sequence information, we found that T. tibetana diverged from its common ancestor with Danio rerio ~121.4 million years ago. The high‐quality genome assembled in this work not only provides a valuable genomic resource for future population and conservation studies of T. tibetana, but it also lays a solid foundation for further investigation into the mechanisms of environmental adaptation of endemic fishes in the Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data  cthe Finance Special Fund of the Ministry of Agriculture, China (Fisheries resources and environment survey in the key water areas of Tibet)  a2017CZZX003cthe special finance of the Tibet autonomous region  a31560144cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31602207cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFC1200500cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China 3aDNA 3aDanio rerio 3aTriplophysa 3aaltitude 3aancestry 3aaquatic ecosystems 3achromosomes 3adatabases 3afish 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3agenomics 3aindigenous species 3amodels 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atransposons 3aChina1 aLiu, Haiping1 aMa, Zhihong1 aZou, Yu1 aZou, Ming1 aMao, Youzhi1 aLi, Xiaomei1 aWang, Huan1 aChen, Tiansheng1 aWang, Weimin1 aYang, Ruibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0888-63470 tMolecular ecology resources.g2019 July, v. 19, no. 4 p.1027-1036dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.130213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009300176300001600269520108300285592002801368650001701396650001701413650001201430650001801442650003301460651001501493653001701508653001601525653001501541653001101556653001301567653001201580773009301592856008501685852000901770655001201779IND60560817520221121015457.0170110e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056081752DNAL7 a10.1080/0269249X.2016.12563502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmspoker, Michael C.10aEunotogramma litorale sp. nov., a marine epipsammic diatom from Southern California, USA  ap. 389-395.  aEunotogramma litorale sp. nov. is described from marine littoral epipsammic assemblages collected from San Diego County, Southern California, USA. The valves of this common species are semi-elliptical in outline with a curved dorsal margin and a more or less straight ventral margin. Each valve has 1–6 transapical costae. Areolae are absent on the valve face; a small rimoportula is usually present on the valve face or uppermost mantle near each pole. One or more rimoportulae are usually found in a row along the dorsal mantle between the costae. Small areolae, visible only with SEM, are typically found between costae on the ventral mantle and along the ventral portion of the pars exterior of the valvocopulae. E. litorale can be distinguished from three other Eunotogramma species with hyaline valve faces by the semi-elliptical shape of its valve outline. The similarity of the internal openings of the rimoportuale of E. litorale and some Aulacodiscus species suggests that E. litorale may be allied with Aulacodiscus , a marine genus associated with inshore beaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAulacodiscus 3aEunotogramma 3abeaches 3alittoral zone 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aCalifornia 0aEunotogramma 0anew species 0aepipsammic 0amarine 0ataxonomy 0adiatoms0 tDiatom research.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 31, no. 4 p.389-395dTaylor & Francisx2159-83477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.2016.12563503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01406naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009400157300002000251520031700271592002800588650001500616650002300631650002300654650001700677650001300694650002000707700001600727700001400743700001800757700001400775700001800789700001900807773013500826856007400961852000901035655001201044IND60639701420221119181656.0190502e20171205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063970142DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc08052b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Gongwei12aA combinatorial immunoassay for multiple biomarkers via a stable isotope tagging strategy  ap. 13075-13078.  aA combinatorial immunoassay method for biomarker detection based on a stable isotope tagging strategy was proposed.

However, because of a sparse fossil record, little is known about the earliest diatom representatives that signalled this important ecological and evolutionary event. We describe a new centric diatom genus, Fideliacyclus , from lake sediments deposited during the Paleocene in the Canadian Arctic. This organism, one of the oldest known freshwater diatoms reported to date, has a unique, highly complex wall structure composed of areolae with large, bulbous, spherical shaped chambers that are open to the external environment but rest on a solid siliceous surface referred to as the solum, and are surrounded by an open space, or hypocaust. The solum is only perforated by marginal labiate processes, which largely isolates the protoplast from ambient conditions hence limiting exchange; this may have represented an adaptive response to living in freshwater. Given the complement of microfossils found in the fossil locality, the lake was an unambiguously softwater, slightly acidic, limnic system of moderate nutrient content. Although the exact taxonomic position of Fideliacyclus remains uncertain, it appears to be most closely allied to Actinocyclus (Class: Coscinodiscophyceae) or possibly Spumorbis given the range of synapomorphies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinocyclus 3aBacillariophyceae 3acomplement 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amicrofossils 3anutrient content 3aopen space 3aprotoplasts 3asediment deposition 3asynapomorphy 3aArctic region 3aCanada 0anon-marine fossil diatoms 0aPaleocene 0asolum 0ahypocaust 0aFideliacyclus 0aActinocyclus 0aSpumorbis1 aWolfe, Alexander P.1 aEdlund, Mark B.0 tDiatom research.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 31, no. 4 p.397-408dTaylor & Francisx2159-83477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.2016.12563513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245012600203300001600329500002000345520239700365592002802762596004502790596004502835650001302880650002102893650002002914650001402934650000802948650001502956650002302971650001502994650002103009650002403030650001103054650002503065650000903090650002203099650002003121650002003141650002503161650001203186650001603198650001503214650001903229650001503248651001403263651001803277700005803295700001903353700006203372700006003434773012603494856007303620852000903693655001203702IND60679433620221120234403.0191228e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067943362DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.135762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunksgaard, Niels C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4906-154410aCoupled rainfall and water vapour stable isotope time series reveal tropical atmospheric processes on multiple timescales  ap. 111-124.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHigh‐frequency stable isotope data are useful for validating atmospheric moisture circulation models and provide improved understanding of the mechanisms controlling isotopic compositions in tropical rainfall. Here, we present a near‐continuous 6‐month record of O‐ and H‐isotope compositions in both water vapour and daily rainfall from Northeast Australia measured by laser spectroscopy. The data set spans both wet and dry seasons to help address a significant data and knowledge gap in the southern hemisphere tropics. We interpret the isotopic records for water vapour and rainfall in the context of contemporaneous meteorological observations. Surface air moisture provided near‐continuous tracking of the links between isotopic variations and meteorological events on local to regional spatial scales. Power spectrum analysis of the isotopic variation showed a range of significant periodicities, from hourly to monthly scales, and cross‐wavelet analysis identified significant regions of common power for hourly averaged water vapour isotopic composition and relative humidity, wind direction, and solar radiation. Relative humidity had the greatest subdiurnal influence on isotopic composition. On longer timescales (weeks to months), isotope variability was strongly correlated with both wind direction and relative humidity. The high‐frequency records showed diurnal isotopic variations in O‐ and H‐isotope compositions due to local dew formation and, for deuterium excess, as a result of evapotranspiration. Several significant negative isotope anomalies on a daily scale were associated with the activity of regional mesoscale convective systems and the occurrence of two tropical cyclones. Calculated air parcel back trajectories identified the predominant moisture transport paths from the Southwest Pacific Ocean, whereas moisture transport from northerly directions occurred mainly during the wet season monsoonal airflow. Water vapour isotope compositions reflected the same meteorological events as recorded in rainfall isotopes but provided much more detailed and continuous information on atmospheric moisture cycling than the intermittent isotopic record provided by rainfall. Improved global coverage of stable isotope data for atmospheric water vapour is likely to improve simulations of future changes to climate drivers of the hydrological cycle.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP150100588cAustralian Research Council  aLE110100144cAustralian Research Council 3aair flow 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3adeuterium 3adew 3adry season 3aevapotranspiration 3ahurricanes 3ahydrologic cycle 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amoisture diffusivity 3arain 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3astable isotopes 3atime series analysis 3atropics 3awater vapor 3awet season 3awind direction 3awind power 3aAustralia 3aPacific Ocean1 aZwart, Costijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2450-05311 aHaig, Jordahna1 aCernusak, Lucas A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7575-55261 aBird, Michael I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1801-87030 tHydrological processes.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 34, no. 1 p.111-124dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.135763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01661naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245014000200300002000340520037900360592002800739650000800767650003200775650002100807650002300828650001600851650002900867650001100896700002300907700001900930700002300949700002400972700002200996700001801018700002001036773013601056856007401192852000901266655001201275IND60639701520221119181734.0190502e20171212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063970152DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc08053k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanouškováThese authors contributed equally., Martina10a5-(Hydroxymethyl)uracil and -cytosine as potential epigenetic marks enhancing or inhibiting transcription with bacterial RNA polymerase  ap. 13253-13255.  aDNA templates containing 5-hydroxymethyluracil or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine were used in an in vitro transcription assay with RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli.

A study on the effects of CO₂ dilution and CH₄ addition on flame propagating characteristics of syngas at high pressure was conducted using the heat flux method and kinetic simulations. This paper presents the laminar burning velocity, SL of H₂/CO/CO₂/O₂/diluent mixtures and H₂/CO/CH₄/O₂/diluent at ϕ = 0.5–2.5, elevated pressures one-11 atm and H₂–CO mole fraction ratios 0.25:0.75 to 0.75:0.25. The effects of CO₂ mole fraction dilution in the fuel (from 0.0 to 0.4), CH₄/(CH₄+CO) (from 0.0 to 1.0), and pressure dependence on SL were experimentally investigated and compared to the simulated results from three kinetic mechanisms. The increase of the hydrogen mole fraction, or the decrease of the CO₂ mole fraction in the fuel, both lead to an increase of SL; the decreased mole fraction enhanced SL significantly more in over-rich conditions. The dilution, thermal-diffusion, and chemical effects (including the direct reaction and three-body effects) of CO₂ dilution were quantitively distinguished at different pressures and H₂ contents. The results showed that increasing the pressure and CO₂ mole fraction in the fuel enhanced the competition of H consuming reactions, and the retarding effect of CO₂ dilution was found to be favored at high hydrogen content syngas conditions. Both CO₂ dilution and CH₄ addition decreased the overall reaction order of the syngas flames by decreasing the adiabatic flame temperature. Increasing the pressure and H₂ content increased the syngas heat release rate by enhancing three-body collision reactions and enrichment of H radical, and their effects were reversed on syngas flame speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3ahydrogen 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aWang, Zhihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7521-29001 aElbaz, Ayman M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4215-24891 aHe, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7037-90071 aChen, Chenlin1 aZhu, Yanqun1 aRoberts, William L.0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Oct. 29, v. 35, no. 22 p.18733-18745dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c029013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010900167300001800276520120900294592002801503650002801531650002301559650002901582650001701611650001401628650001701642650000901659700001901668773011301687856008301800852000901883655001201892IND60749018020221118020919.0211017e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074901802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaphaeli, Orit10aTowards personalized nutritional treatment for malnutrition using machine learning-based screening tools  ap. 5249-5251.  aEarly identification of patients at risk of malnutrition or who are malnourished is crucial in order to start a timely and adequate nutritional therapy. Yet, despite the presence of many nutrition screening tools for use in the hospital setting, there is no consensus regarding the best tool as well as inadequate adherence to screening practices which impairs the achievement of effective nutritional therapy.In recent years, artificial intelligence and machine learning methods have been widely used, across multiple medical domains, to aid clinical decision making and to improve quality and efficiency of care. Therefore, Yin and colleagues propose a machine learning based individualized decision support system aimed to identify and grade malnutrition in cancer patients by applying unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods on nationwide cohort.This approach, demonstrate the ability of machine learning methods to create tools to recognize malnutrition. The machine learning based screening serves as a first layer in a nutritional therapy workflow and provides improved support for decision making of health professionals to fit individualized nutritional therapy in at-risk patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aclinical nutrition 3adecision support systems 3adiet therapy 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3arisk1 aSinger, Pierre0 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Oct., v. 40, no. 10 p.5249-5251dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011200175520159900287592002801886650002201914650001901936650001701955650001501972650000901987650001401996650002002010650000902030650001702039650002302056650001502079650001402094650001002108650001302118650002502131650001802156653001102174653002102185653001802206653002602224653002202250653001202272700002702284700001902311700002402330700003402354700002102388773009902409856009002508852000902598655001202607IND60793035420221117184126.0220921e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079303542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7388152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPěnka, Tomáš10aEvaluation of different feeding frequencies in RAS-based juvenile pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) aquaculture  aFeeding regime, which involve selection of appropriate diet and application of feed itself is a decisive factor in intensive, RAS-based production system – more so, for carnivorous fish culture. It is critical for the economics, resource (feed/nutrients) use efficiency and final profit yield. The present study examined different feeding strategies in juvenile pikeperch reared in RAS for growth performance, survivability, feed utilization, and fish welfare. Juvenile pikeperch (106.59 ± 24.84 g) were cultured in RAS for 112 days and fed at five different feeding intervals (2-h, 4-h, 6-h, 8-h and 12-h) using automatic feeder Imetronic® (Pessac, France). Fishes were fed a commercially standardized pikeperch diet. A higher degree of growth heterogeneity was observed in groups fed in shorter feeding intervals (2-h, 4-h and 6-h). At the end of the experiment, slightly higher fin damage was observed in all tested groups compared to fin conditions of stocked fish especially for dorsal and caudal fins. No significant differences were observed in selected biochemical parameters indicating liver, pancreas, and intestinal function. All tested fish were adequately fed providing sufficient nutrients for proper pikeperch growth and welfare. Nevertheless, the feeding interval 8-hour was evaluated as optimal. This frequency supports higher fish conditions (Fulton's coefficient) and the specific growth rate (SGR), survival rate (SR), weight heterogeneity (CV₂), lower fin erosion compared to the other tested frequency and optimal level of biochemical parameters in blood plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander lucioperca 3aanimal welfare 3ablood plasma 3acarnivores 3adiet 3aeconomics 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish culture 3agrowth performance 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3aliver 3apancreas 3aspecific growth rate 3asurvival rate 0aGrowth 0aFeed utilization 0aFin condition 0aIntensive aquaculture 0aSander lucioperca 0aWelfare1 aMalinovskyi, Oleksandr1 aImentai, Aiman1 aKolářová, Jitka,1 aKučera, Václav,d1929-2017,1 aPolicar, Tomáš0 tAquaculture.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 562 p.738815-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7388153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245014400182300001600326520138500342592002801727650001401755650001601769650001201785650001301797650001501810650001601825650000901841650001001850650001501860650002001875650005001895650001501945650001601960650001901976650001301995651001302008700002502021773009802046856008502144852000902229655001202238IND60132230520221118075013.0150505e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013223052DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2015.10348882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguy-Robertson, Anthony L.10aAlgorithms for estimating green leaf area index in C3 and C4 crops for MODIS, Landsat TM/ETM+, MERIS, Sentinel MSI/OLCI, and Venµs sensors  ap. 360-369.  aThis study developed a set of algorithms for satellite mapping of green leaf area index (LAI) in C3 and C4 crops. In situ hyperspectral reflectance and green LAI data, collected across eight years (2001–2008) at three AmeriFlux sites in Nebraska USA over irrigated and rain-fed maize and soybean, were used for algorithm development. The hyperspectral reflectance was resampled to simulate the spectral bands of sensors aboard operational satellites (Aqua and Terra: MODIS, Landsat: TM/ETM+), a legacy satellite (Envisat: MERIS), and future satellites (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and Venµs). Among 15 vegetation indices (VIs) examined, five VIs – wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), green WDRVI, red edge WDRVI, and green and red edge chlorophyll indices – had a minimal noise equivalent for estimating maize and soybean green LAI ranging from 0 to 6.5 m ² m ⁻². The algorithms were validated using MODIS, TM/ETM+, and MERIS satellite data. The root mean square error of green LAI prediction in both crops from all sensors examined in this study ranged from 0.73 to 0.95 m ² m ⁻² and coefficient of variation ranged between 17.0 and 29.3%. The algorithms using the red edge bands of MERIS and future space systems Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and Venµs allowed accurate green LAI estimation over areas containing maize and soybean with no re-parameterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aGlycine max 3aLandsat 3aZea mays 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3acrops 3airrigation 3aleaf area index 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asoybeans 3aNebraska1 aGitelson, Anatoly A.0 tRemote sensing letters.g2015 May 4, v. 6, no. 5 p.360-369dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2015.10348883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010600160300001100266520183300277592002802110650001802138650002602156650001602182650001202198650001402210650002002224650003102244650002902275650001002304650002002314650001302334650001702347650001002364650001602374650001302390650001202403650001402415650001102429650001902440650002202459650001702481650002402498650001602522650002902538650002602567650002002593700001902613700001902632700001502651773012702666856008202793852000902875655001202884IND60550626820221119055648.0180619e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055062682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-016-1055-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Hai10aTranscriptome analysis of the male-to-hermaphrodite sex reversal induced by low temperature in papaya  ap. 94.  aPapaya (Carica papaya L.) is a trioecious plant species, producing three sex forms, male, female, and hermaphrodite. Although the major sex types are genetically determined, the phenotypic sex expression of papaya is influenced by environmental factors. We investigated differential gene expression analysis between the non-functional rudimentary pistils from normal male flowers and developed and functional pistils from the male-to-hermaphrodite sex reversal flowers induced by low temperature aiming to understanding the gene regulatory network that determinates the phenotypic sex expression in papaya. Our differential gene expression analysis revealed 1756 differentially expressed genes between normal male and male-to-hermaphrodite sex reversal flowers. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed transcription factors, flower development, histone H3-K9 methylation, and plant hormone signal transduction were among the most significantly enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways. Small RNA analysis was also performed on the pistils from normal male and the male-to-hermaphrodite sex reversal flowers. Our result showed the 24 nt small RNAs were the most abundant in the pistils from both normal and sex reversal flowers, followed by 21 nt small RNAs. We detected expression of 40 plant-conserved miRNAs and 14 papaya-specific miRNAs in the pistils from one or both normal and sex reversal flowers. Sixteen miRNAs exhibited high-expression level and ten of them showed differential expression between the normal male and the male-to-hermaphrodite sex reversal flowers. Our results suggested the male-to-hermaphrodite sex reversal was likely caused by silencing the gynoecium suppression function on the sex determination pathway through epigenetic modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3aenvironmental factors 3aepigenetics 3afemales 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3ahermaphroditism 3ahistones 3amale flowers 3amales 3amethylation 3amicroRNA 3apapayas 3aphenotype 3apistil 3aplant hormones 3asex determination 3asex reversal 3asignal transduction 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics1 aLiao, Zhenyang1 aZhang, Lingmao1 aYu, Qingyi0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2016 Oct., v. 12, no. 5 p.94-94dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949857x1614-29427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-016-1055-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01301naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245014400151300001800295520025800313592002800571650002300599650002300622650002300645650001500668650001700683650001100700650001400711700001900725700002000744773012900764856007300893852000900966655001200975IND60658170020221119135809.0190816e20071129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065817002DNAL7 a10.1039/b713151h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Xiao10aBicyclic guanidine-catalyzed enantioselective phospha-Michael reaction: synthesis of chiral β-aminophosphine oxides and β-aminophosphines  ap. 5058-5060.  aChiral bicyclic guanidine has been found to catalyze the phospha-Michael reactions of diaryl phosphine oxide to nitroalkenes with high enantioselectivities, offering a direct methodology to prepare chiral β-aminophosphine oxides and β-aminophosphines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3aenantioselectivity 3aguanidines 3anitroalkenes 3aoxides 3aphosphine1 aJiang, Zhiyong1 aTan, Choon-Hong0 tChemical communications.g2007 Nov. 29, , no. 47 p.5058-5060dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b713151h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245010800166300001600274520134700290592002801637650002101665650002501686650002101711650001401732650001301746650001401759650001701773650002101790650001601811650001701827650002001844650001001864650001101874650001801885650002601903650002101929653001401950653002501964653001401989653003602003653003102039653001602070700002402086700001802110700002402128700002502152700002102177700002102198700002802219700002102247773011902268856007902387852000902466655001202475IND60560818020221120211700.0170325e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056081802DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2016.20572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozwadowska, Beata10aInduction of Apoptosis in Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts Infected with Borrelia burgdorferi Sensu Lato  ap. 237-242.  aThe spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. can enter into different eukaryotic cells. Intracellular localization of bacteria may cause many changes in different cell pathways like apoptosis-mediated caspase cascade. The present studies focused on gene expression associated with caspase cascade after normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) infection with Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, and B. burgdorferi s.s. The use of oligonucleotide microarray technique enabled an expression level comparison of genes associated with caspase cascade in NHDF infected with spirochetes. The increased expression of genes associated with caspase cascade was observed in case of CASP5, CASP2, CARD10, CASP10, MALT1, and NLRP1. The decreased expression was observed in case of CASP4, CASP6, and CASP1. The mRNA expression for CASP3 was inhibited in cells infected with three genospecies of Borrelia. However, the intensity of fluorescence was not statistically significant. In addition, cell cultures were fixed and procedure of caspase-3 detection and the TUNEL assay were performed. The in situ caspase-3 detection procedure confirmed the results obtained from microarray analyses. Only several fluorescent signals were observed. Many apoptotic cells were detected in NHDF-infected cultures with all spirochete genospecies found using the TUNEL reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia afzelii 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aBorrelia garinii 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3acaspase-3 3acell culture 3aeukaryotic cells 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amicroarray technology 3aoligonucleotides 0aapoptosis 0aBorrelia spirochetes 0acaspase-3 0anormal human dermal fibroblasts 0aoligonucleotide microarray 0aTUNEL assay1 aAlbertyńska, Marta1 aOkła, Hubert1 aJasik, Krzysztof P.1 aSwinarew, Andrzej S.1 aMazurek, Urszula1 aDudek, Sławomir1 aUrbańska-Jasik, Danuta1 aPoprawa, Izabela0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 17, no. 4 p.237-242dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-77597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fvbz.2016.20573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015200164300001600316500002000332520103900352592002801391596001701419596004001436596004001476650002101516650002701537650002901564650002301593650001701616650001301633650001601646650001001662650002201672650001101694650001401705700002201719700002501741700002201766700006701788773015001855856007402005852000902079655001202088IND60679434020221121015025.0191228e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067943402DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.143022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerdi, María Clara10aSynergistic antimicrobial effect of lactocin AL705 and nisin combined with organic acid salts against Listeria innocua 7 in broth and a hard cheese  ap. 267-275.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effectiveness of antimicrobial mixtures against Listeria innocua 7, used as a L. monocytogenes surrogate, was investigated in broth and a food system. Synergistic effects were found for nisin (Nis), potassium sorbate (PS), calcium propionate (CP) and sodium lactate (SL), Nis + PS being the most effective binary mixture that exhibited listericidal activity in broth. To assess the effect of adding lactocin AL705 (AL705) to Nis + organic acid salt combinations, tridimensional isobolograms were generated. Sub‐MIC combinations of the antimicrobials exerted bactericidal activity against L. innocua 7 after AL705 addition to the binary mixtures. However, when applied on Sardo cheese contaminated with L. innocua 7 (initial inoculum 4.45 ± 0.06 CFU g⁻¹), only Nis + PS + AL705 produced count reductions respect to the control, reaching 3.04 ± 0.35 CFU g⁻¹ counts after 15 days at 15 °C. Ternary combinations containing AL705 showed potential to reduce antimicrobial usages for L. innocua 7 inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data  a710/14cINTI  aPICT‐2014‐0585cMINCyT–ANPCyT  aPICT‐2016‐0407cMINCyT–ANPCyT 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantibacterial properties 3acalcium propionate 3ahard cheeses 3ainoculum 3alactic acid 3anisin 3apotassium sorbate 3asodium 3asynergism1 aMelian, Constanza1 aCastellano, Patricia1 aVignolo, Graciela1 aBlanco Massani, Mariana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5053-63780 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2020 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.267-275dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.143023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010700164300001800271500001900289520168600308592002801994650001402022650002202036650001602058650001202074650002202086650000902108650001502117650001302132700001602145700001402161700001502175700001702190700001802207700005702225700001502282773013502297856008002432852000902512655001202521IND60727372520221121205812.0210211e20210202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072737252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c112582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mingguang10aGuanidinium Chloride Passivated Perovskites for Efficient Solar Cells: The Role of Passivating Solvent  ap. 2866-2874.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPassivating treatment using organic molecules has become one of the most efficient means to reduce electronic defects and enhance perovskite crystallinity for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the solvents essentially needed to dissolve the passivating molecules are rarely concerned during the construction of high-quality perovskite layers. Here, the role of the passivating solvents in the secondary growth process and defect passivation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI₃) perovskite films and their influence on the final device performance are systemically investigated. In the guanidinium chloride (GACl)-passivated MAPbI₃ films produced with different passivating solvents, we found that the passivating solvents with poor solubility toward MAPbI₃ crystals can hardly alter the film morphology and the passivation effect of GACl molecules only works on the upper surface of the photoactive layer. However, the isopropanol (IPA) capable of partially dissolving the preformed MAPbI₃ crystals contributes to the formation of excellent polycrystalline perovskite morphologies with remarkably enhanced grain size and reduced grain boundaries. Consequently, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.65% has been realized for the inverted PSCs fabricated under GACl/IPA passivating treatment conditions. These results indicate that the solvent used to dissolve passivators is of great importance in manipulating the MAPbI₃ films, providing crucial understanding on the rational selection of solvents to establish the most effective passivation solutions for improving the quality of perovskite films and enhancing the PSC efficiencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3acrystal structure 3aguanidinium 3aiodides 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alead 3asolubility 3asolvents1 aZhang, Ying1 aGao, Huan1 aPeng, Ying1 aTang, Senlin1 aYu, Longsheng1 aChen, Runfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0222-02961 aHuang, Wei0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 02, v. 125, no. 5 p.2866-2874dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c112583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003500134024003800169024001200207040001800219100002200237245007500259300001800334506017300352520154700525650002102072650002002093650001102113650001402124650001202138650002402150650001302174650003702187650003502224650001702259650001102276650000902287650001202296650001402308650001902322650002702341650002102368650001902389650002802408650002502436650002202461650002502483650001602508650002502524700002002549700002602569700002302595700001902618700002302637773011002660856011402770856008102884956010602965961000903071852000903080655001203089IND60560819220221214230900.0161220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056081922DNAL7 a10113/56081922hdl7 a3281332aris7 a10.1007/s12155-016-9768-52doi7 a10.1007/s12155-016-9768-52chorus8 ans11660  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Samuel H.10aQTL and Drought Effects on Leaf Physiology in Lowland Panicum virgatum  ap. 1241-1259.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSwitchgrass is a key component of plans to develop sustainable cellulosic ethanol production for bioenergy in the U.S. We sought quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leaf structure and function, and tested for genotype × environment interactions in response to drought using the Albany full-sib mapping population, an F1 derived from lowland tetraploid parents. We also tested for G×E using check clones drawn from the parent cultivars. We determined phenotypes for leaf structure and physiological performance under well watered conditions in two consecutive years, and applied drought to one of two replicates to test for GxE. Phenotypes for the two check clones varied with location in our plot and drought impacted their photosynthetic performance, but there was limited evidence of GxE except in quantum yield (QPSII). Phenotypes of Albany were also influenced by plant location within our plot, but after correcting for experimental design factors and spatial effects we detected QTL for leaf size, tissue density, and stomatal conductance (g(s)). In addition, a QTL for intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) that was expressed only under drought provided clear evidence of GxE. Loci influencing physiological traits had small additive effects, showed complex patterns of heritability, and did not co-localize with QTL for morphological traits. These insights into the genetic architecture of leaf structure and function set the stage for consideration of leaf phenotypes as a component of switchgrass improvement for bioenergy purposes. 3aPanicum virgatum 3aadditive effect 3aclones 3acultivars 3adrought 3aexperimental design 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3aheritability 3aleaves 3aloci 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aplant morphology 3aplant response 3aquantitative trait loci 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3astomatal conductance 3atetraploidy 3awater use efficiency1 aLowry, David B.1 aAspinwall, Michael J.1 aBonnette, Jason E.1 aFay, Philip A.1 aJuenger, Thomas E.0 tBioenergy research.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.1241-1259dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/56081923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-016-9768-53Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Bioenergy%20Research%202016.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011300172300001600285520134200301592002801643650001501671650002001686650000801706650001001714650001901724650001701743700001801760700002101778773009801799856008501897852000901982655001201991IND60132230920221118075150.0150505e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013223092DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2015.10401282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiroozy, Nariman10aBalanced inversion of simulated bistatic radar cross-section data for remote sensing of snow-covered sea ice  ap. 399-408.  aThe reconstruction of the dielectric profile of snow-covered sea ice from simulated bistatic radar cross-section data is investigated. To this end, a cost function representing the discrepancy between the true radar cross-section data and the calculated radar cross-section data due to a predicted dielectric profile is formed. This cost function is iteratively minimized using the differential evolution algorithm so as to reconstruct the unknown dielectric profile. Herein, four different formulations for this cost function are considered. These formulations are distinguished by their utilized weighting factors for each data point within the bistatic radar cross-section data set. Although these cost functions use the same simulated bistatic normalized radar cross-section data set, it will be shown that the reconstruction accuracy achievable from each of them will be different. Finally, an appropriate weighting scheme for bistatic data sets, which emphasizes the scattering data points collected at the vicinity of the specular angle, is presented. It will be shown that the use of this weighting scheme results in enhanced reconstruction accuracy as compared to the other formulations. It is speculated that the proposed weighting scheme balances the individual data points more properly, thus, resulting in enhanced accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aice 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data1 aMojabi, Puyan1 aBarber, David G.0 tRemote sensing letters.g2015 May 4, v. 6, no. 5 p.399-408dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2015.10401283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01240naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245014300152300001800295520021900313592002800532650002600560650002300586650001000609700001100619700001800630700001400648700002800662700002700690773012800717856007200845852000900917655001200926IND60658170220221119135810.0190816e20071205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065817022DNAL7 a10.1039/b713156a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Ji10aChlorodifluoromethyl phenyl sulfone: a novel non-ozone-depleting substance-based difluorocarbene reagent for O- and N-difluoromethylations  ap. 5149-5151.  aChlorodifluoromethyl phenyl sulfone, a previously unknown compound that can be readily prepared from non-ODS-based precursors, was found to act as a robust difluorocarbene reagent for O- and N-difluoromethylations.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3achemical reactions 3aozone1 aLi, Ya1 aZhang, Laijun1 aHu, Jinbo1 aMeuzelaar, Gerrit Joost1 aFedersel, Hans-Jurgen,0 tChemical communications.g2007 Dec. 5, , no. 48 p.5149-5151dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b713156a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245007800181300001600259520127300275592002801548650002401576650002101600650001201621650003201633650001201665650003301677650003301710650002101743650001401764650001601778650002801794650001101822650003701833650003101870650002401901650002401925700002001949700002401969700002401993700002002017700001702037700002102054700001902075773011002094856004802204852000902252655001202261IND4484452120221118072820.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448445212DNAL7 a215475732pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-011-0648-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaby, Mya J.10aThermal dependence of locomotor performance in two cool-temperate lizards  ap. 869-875.  aTemperate-zone ectotherms experience varying or very low ambient temperatures and may have difficulty in attaining preferred body temperatures. Thus, adaptations to reduce the thermal dependence of physiological processes may be present. We measured the optimal temperature range for sprint speed and compared it with the selected body temperatures (T sel) of two sympatric, cool-temperate lizards: the diurnal skink Oligosoma maccanni and the primarily nocturnal gecko Woodworthia (previously Hoplodactylus) “Otago/Southland”. We also investigated whether time-of-day influenced sprint speed. Contrary to results for other reptiles, we found that time-of-day did not influence speed in either species. For each species, the optimal temperature range for sprinting and T sel overlapped, supporting the ‘thermal coadaptation’ hypothesis. However, the optimal range of temperatures for speed is not always attainable during activity by either species, which have limited opportunities to attain T sel in the field. The thermal sensitivity of sprint speed in these two species does not appear to have evolved to fully match their current thermal environment. More data on cold-adapted species are needed to fully understand physiological adaptation in ectotherms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3alizards 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperaturexphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aCold Temperature 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironment, Controlled 2aFemale 2aLizardsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMotor Activityxphysiology 2aRunningxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity1 aBesson, Anne A.1 aBezzina, Chalene N.1 aCaldwell, Amanda J.1 aCosgrove, Sarai1 aCree, Alison1 aHaresnape, Steff1 aHare, Kelly M.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2011 Sept., v. 197, no. 9 p.869-875dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-011-0648-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014500167300001200312520173700324592002802061650001602089650002402105650001002129650001402139650001102153650001402164650001202178650001302190650001002203650001002213650002202223700001702245700001902262700002002281700001602301700001902317773011402336856008102450852000902531655001202540IND60550627120221119055811.0170717e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055062712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-016-2256-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Lai-Sheng10aASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE15 gene, a member of AS2/LOB family, shows a dual abaxializing or adaxializing function in Arabidopsis lateral organs  ap. 240.  aIn determining leaf adaxial fates, Arabidopsis ASYMMERTIC LEAVES1 (AS1) and AS2/LBD6 are essential. The Arabidopsis ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE15/LBD17 gene, one member of the LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY DOMAIN gene family, is expressed at the base of juvenile lateral roots, as well as in boundaries between meristems and organ primordial. For better comprehending the function of ASL15/LBD17 in the Arabidopsis development, its antisense-expression construct was constructed, and some 35S:ASL15/LBD17 transgenic plants that were antisense overexpression mutants were attained. The transgenic plants can specify either abaxial or adaxial cell fate in differently shaped rosette leaves. In detail, slightly and extremely narrow rosette leaves (class I) displayed abaxial cell traits, compared with those of Col-0. Inflorescence stems of these transgenic plants also showed abaxial organ identity. Both radial needle-like and filamentous symmetric rosette leaves (class II) presented adaxial cell fate, in contrast to those of wild type (Col-0). However, in the background of AS2 mutation, antisense 35S:ASL15 only presented abaxial organ identity, implying that the influences of antisense 35:ASL15 require a functional AS2 gene. In addition, antisense 35S:ASL15 was defective in proximodistal patterning. In addition, antisense 35S:ASL15 lead to the enhancement of the transcript levels of the KNOX genes, i.e., KNAT2, KNAT6, and STM, but not of the related KNAT1 gene. Taken together, our findings show that ASL15/LBD17 has a dual abaxializing or adaxializing function, and is also related to distal and proximal patterning in the lateral organs of Arabidopsis. Therefore, ASL15/LBD17 has multiple functions in the Arabidopsis development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ajuveniles 3aleaves 3ameristems 3amutants 3amutation 3aroots 3astems 3atransgenic plants1 aWang, Zhi-Bo1 aCao, Xiao-Ying1 aZhang, Hua-Juan1 aWang, Yi-Bo1 aJiang, Ji-Hong0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2016 Oct., v. 38, no. 10 p.240-240dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-016-2256-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01398naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245006900160300001600229520030500245592002800550650001500578650001900593650002000612650001500632650001400647650002300661650001700684650002100701650001300722650001400735650002200749700002100771700002600792773012500818856007200943852000901015655001201024IND60658170320221119135836.0190816e20080103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065817032DNAL7 a10.1039/b713161e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFöttinger, Karin14aThe mechanism of carbonate formation on Pd–Al₂O₃ catalysts  ap. 320-322.  aVibrational spectroscopic investigations of the adsorption of isotopically labelled and unlabelled CO and CO₂ reveal that carbonate formation on Pd–alumina catalysts occurs via an “oxygen down” reaction of CO with hydroxyl groups on the support, whereas CO dissociation on Pd can be excluded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3adissociation 3aisotope labeling 3amoieties 3apalladium 3aspectral analysis1 aSchlögl, Robert1 aRupprechter, Günther0 tChemical communications.g2008 Jan. 3, , no. 3 p.320-322dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b713161e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245020100169300001600370520188800386592002802274650002002302650002302322650002302345650002202368650001502390650002002405650001102425650001402436650003302450650002002483700002502503700002402528700002202552773009702574856004802671852000902719655001202728IND50071956220221117105154.0140117e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007195622DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-013-9643-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnteshari, Maryam10aOptimization of Headspace Single-Drop Microextraction Coupled with Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry for Determining Volatile Oxidation Compounds in Mayonnaise by Response Surface Methodology  ap. 438-448.  aIn this assay, headspace single-drop microextraction (HS-SDME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as a simple, low-cost and rapid method has been developed and validated for determining volatile oxidation compounds including hexanal and heptanal in mayonnaise. The main microextraction variables affecting the HS-SDME procedure such as extraction temperature and time, stirring rate, and amount of NaCl were optimized by response surface methodology employing a central composite design. Obtained results demonstrated that higher yield of extracted analytes could be achieved under the following optimal conditions: extraction temperature of 45 °C, extraction time of 16 min, stirring rate at 700 rpm, and addition of 2 g NaCl. The optimized HS-SDME/GC-MS method was validated for oxidized mayonnaise samples (50 °C/48 h) by calculating analytical parameters (linearity, precision, accuracy, and sensitivity). Good linearity (R 2> 0.99) was observed by plotting calibration curves of extracted hexanal and heptanal over the concentration range of 0.025-10 μg g-1, and the repeatability of the method, expressed as relative standard deviation, were found to be 4.04 % for hexanal and 3.68 % for heptanal (n = 7). After the microextraction process of spiked mayonnaise sample, high levels of relative recovery were obtained for hexanal (107.33 %) and heptanal (91.43 %). The detection limits were 0.008 ng g-1 and 0.021 ng g-1 for hexanal and heptanal, respectively, while quantification limits of hexanal and heptanal were calculated to be 0.027 ng g-1 and 0.071 ng g-1, respectively. The possibility of the HS-SDME followed GC-MS to determine and quantify volatile oxidation compounds such as hexanal and heptanal was confirmed by analyzing commercial fresh mayonnaise stored at 4 and 25 °C during 3 months. ©Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3amass spectrometry 3amayonnaise 3amicroextraction 3amixing 3aoxidation 3aresponse surface methodology 3asodium chloride1 aMohammadi, Abdorreza1 aNayebzadeh, Kooshan1 aAzadniya, Ebrahim0 tFood analytical methods.g2014 Feb., v. 7, no. 2 p.438-448dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-013-9643-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245012100201300001600322500002000338520127000358592002801628596004801656596003801704596003001742596003201772650002301804650001601827650003001843650001101873650002201884650000901906650001401915650000901929651002101938700006001959700003702019700006702056700002002123700006102143700005902204773014302263856007502406852000902481655001202490IND60788392620221122132322.0220813e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078839262DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.105742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRechisky, Erin L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2811-839910aExposure Time of Wild, Juvenile Sockeye Salmon to Open‐Net‐Pen Atlantic Salmon Farms in British Columbia, Canada  ap. 650-660.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role that open‐net‐pen farms for Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar play in the global decline of stocks of wild salmonids (Salmo spp. and Oncorhynchus spp.) is contentious; Canada’s west coast is no exception. We identified the proportion of acoustic‐tagged juvenile Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka migrating through the main migration routes of the Discovery Islands region of British Columbia and measured both residence time in a major waterway hosting several Atlantic Salmon farms and exposure times to individual farms. One‐third of tagged fish migrated through this channel, with median residence times of 32.6 h in 2017 and 46.0 h in 2018. The median time near individual farms was 4.4 min in 2017 when farms were fallow and 10.9 min in 2018 when farms were stocked. The increase in 2018 was probably not caused by farm activity because the proportion of total time spent in the channel was the same across years. Sockeye Salmon used all major migration pathways, but the lack of farms and rapid migration speeds in the westernmost passage offers the lowest potential exposure to fish farms. These are the first individual‐level data available to inform assessments of the transmission risk of infectious agents from farms to wild salmonids.  aPublisher supplied data  cBritish Columbia Salmon Farmers Association  cAquaculture Association of Canada  cPacific Salmon Foundation  cFisheries and Oceans Canada 3aOncorhynchus nerka 3aSalmo salar 3aadministrative management 3acoasts 3aexposure duration 3afish 3ajuveniles 3arisk 3aBritish Columbia1 aPorter, Aswea D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1258-82651 aJohnston, Stephenq(Stephen D.),1 aStevenson, Christine F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8838-98951 aHinch, Scott G.1 aHunt, Brian P.

The largest vertebrates, defined as megafauna, are especially vulnerable. We analyzed how human activities are impacting the conservation status of megafauna within six classes: mammals, ray‐finned fish, cartilaginous fish, amphibians, birds, and reptiles. We identified a total of 362 extant megafauna species. We found that 70% of megafauna species with sufficient information are decreasing and 59% are threatened with extinction. Surprisingly, direct harvesting of megafauna for human consumption of meat or body parts is the largest individual threat to each of the classes examined, and a threat for 98% (159/162) of threatened species with threat data available. Therefore, minimizing the direct killing of the world's largest vertebrates is a priority conservation strategy that might save many of these iconic species and the functions and services they provide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChondrichthyes 3aamphibians 3aanthropogenic activities 3abirds 3aconservation status 3aextinction 3afauna 3afish 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3aharvesting 3ahumans 3ameat 3areptiles 3arisk 3athreatened species 3azoogeography1 aWolf, Christopher1 aNewsome, Thomas M.1 aBetts, Matthew G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7100-25511 aCeballos, Gerardo1 aCourchamp, Franck1 aHayward, Matt W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5574-16531 aVan Valkenburgh, Blaire1 aWallach, Arian D.1 aWorm, Boris0 tConservation letters.g2019 May, v. 12, no. 3 p.e12627-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.126273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113024002700159040001800186100001700204245014900221300001800370506007600388520170800464592002802172506003702200650001502237650002202252650001102274650001302285650001502298650001102313650001202324650001802336650002002354650001002374650001502384651001002399651001202409700002602421700001602447700002602463700001902489700003302508700002702541773009702568856007302665852000902738655001202747IND60080685120221207073731.0140802e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008068512DNAL7 a248634592pmid7 aPMC4225523 [Available on 02/01/15]2pmcid7 a10.1111/mec.128072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosse, Mirte10aUntangling the hybrid nature of modern pig genomes: a mosaic derived from biogeographically distinct and highly divergent Sus scrofa populations  ap. 4089-4102.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe merging of populations after an extended period of isolation and divergence is a common phenomenon, in natural settings as well as due to human interference. Individuals with such hybrid origins contain genomes that essentially form a mosaic of different histories and demographies. Pigs are an excellent model species to study hybridization because European and Asian wild boars diverged ~1.2 Mya, and pigs were domesticated independently in Europe and Asia. During the Industrial Revolution in England, pigs were imported from China to improve the local pigs. This study utilizes the latest genomics tools to identify the origin of haplotypes in European domesticated pigs that are descendant from Asian and European populations. Our results reveal fine‐scale haplotype structure representing different ancient demographic events, as well as a mosaic composition of those distinct histories due to recently introgressed haplotypes in the pig genome. As a consequence, nucleotide diversity in the genome of European domesticated pigs is higher when at least one haplotype of Asian origin is present, and haplotype length correlates negatively with recombination frequency and nucleotide diversity. Another consequence is that the inference of past effective population size is influenced by the background of the haplotypes in an individual, but we demonstrate that by careful sorting based on the origin of haplotypes, both distinct demographic histories can be reconstructed. Future detailed mapping of the genomic distribution of variation will enable a targeted approach to increase genetic diversity of captive and wild populations, thus facilitating conservation efforts in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSus scrofa 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3apopulation size 3aswine 3awild boars 3aChina 3aEngland1 aMegens, Hendrik‐Jan1 aMadsen, Ole1 aFrantz, Laurent A.

Films were sealed with an impulse heat sealer at a dwell time of 1 s and temperature of 110 ± 10 °C. Thermal properties of the films (determined using a differential scanning calorimeter) showed that onset temperatures (Tₒ) of sorbitol-plasticized films were significantly lower than those of glycerol-plasticized films. All films were heat sealable, but sorbitol-plasticized films exhibited better heat sealability than did the glycerol type. The highest seal strength was obtained with a 3:1 combination of sorbitol/glycerol.

In deeper water bodies, Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu are often caught from depths greater than 6 m and held in a boat’s live well until they are weighed in. Smallmouth Bass that are caught from such depths typically display symptoms of barotrauma, where the swim bladder becomes overinflated and the fish cannot maintain proper orientation. We examined the effects of three common practices that are used by tournament anglers who hold fish that exhibit symptoms of barotrauma: no treatment, weighted fin clips (rubber‐coated weighted alligator clips), and fizzing (venting the swim bladder with a hypodermic needle). After receiving a treatment, the Smallmouth Bass were held in experimental live wells for a period of 3 h and their condition was monitored using reflex action mortality predictors. Condition declined for the Smallmouth Bass that received no treatment, whereas both fin clips and fizzing demonstrated improved fish condition. Fizzing was also found to be a more rapid and effective treatment than fin clips. As the weight and capture depth of fish in the control group increased, there was a significant decrease in final condition, as indicated by reflex impairment. For tournaments that hold fish in live wells prior to release, these results demonstrate that interventions shortly after capture can effectively reduce reflex impairment in Smallmouth Bass that experience barotrauma and that fizzing is more effective than fin clips.  aPublisher supplied data  cGreenberg Family Fund for the Conservation of Freshwater Fisheries at Queen’s University 3aMicropterus dolomieu 3aadministrative management 3aalligators 3abass 3aboats 3amortality 3aswim bladder 3aNorth America1 aRow, Alexander J.1 aTufts, Bruce L.0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2021 June, v. 41, no. 3 p.834-843dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19701x0275-59477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.105903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006900171300001400240520114700254592002801401650001401429650002001443650001401463650002101477650001901498650001601517650004001533650002401573650001801597650001301615650000901628650001401637650001701651653001901668653001801687653002801705653001201733653001701745700001901762700001901781700002701800700002701827700002001854700002301874700002201897700002401919700002601943710011201969773010902081856008202190852000902272655001202281IND60544087920221121144429.0190415e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054408792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2013.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScicchitano, Pietro10aNutraceuticals and dyslipidaemia: Beyond the common therapeutics  ap. 11-32.  aDyslipidaemia accelerates the atherosclerotic process and its morbid consequences; statins represent the evidence-based treatment of choice for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and decreasing cardiovascular events. Unfortunately, statins are frequently not available for several reasons, including intolerance, side effects or, simply, patient preference. Nutraceuticals and functional food ingredients that are beneficial to vascular health may represent useful compounds that are able to reduce the overall cardiovascular risk induced by dyslipidaemia by acting parallel to statins or as adjuvants in case of failure or in situations where statins cannot be used. The mechanisms underlying such actions are not fully understood but may be related to reducing 7α-hydroxylase, increasing faecal excretion of cholesterol, decreasing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase mRNA levels or reducing the secretion of very low-density lipoprotein. This contribution provides an overview of the mechanism of action of nutraceuticals and functional food ingredients on lipids and their role in the management of lipid disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aadverse effects 3aexcretion 3afunctional foods 3ahyperlipidemia 3aingredients 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3arisk 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 0aNutraceuticals 0aDyslipidaemia 0aCardiovascular diseases 0aStatins 0aDrug therapy1 aCameli, Matteo1 aMaiello, Maria1 aModesti, Pietro Amedeo1 aMuiesan, Maria Lorenza1 aNovo, Salvatore1 aPalmiero, Pasquale1 aSaba, Pier Sergio1 aPedrinelli, Roberto1 aCiccone, Marco Matteo2 a“Gruppo di Studio Ipertensione, Prevenzione e Riabilitazione”, Società Italiana di Cardiologiaeauthor0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Jan., v. 6 p.11-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2013.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245008400166300001400250500002000264520111600284592002801400596004901428650002601477650002501503650001501528650002301543650001301566650001401579650001401593650001101607650002301618700006201641700002101703700002801724700001701752700006601769773014801835856007401983852000902057655001202066IND60679434620221120202509.0191228e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067943462DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.142202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTepsongkroh, Benjarat10aConsumer perception of extruded snacks containing brown rice and dried mushroom  ap. 46-54.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEffects of mushroom type, seasoning and health benefit information (HBI) on consumers’ saltiness expectation, sensory liking, elicited emotions and purchase intent (PI) of extruded snacks were investigated. Five snacks were evaluated: straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea) extrudates without (SME) or with seasoning (SMES), phoenix mushroom (Pleurotus pulmonarius) extrudates without (PME) or with seasoning (PMES), and the control without mushroom and seasoning. Hedonic scores and positive emotions were generally higher for seasoned mushroom‐containing snacks (SMES and PMES) with 65% and 75.83% of consumers reporting willingness to purchase, respectively, after receiving HBI. Bored, interested and satisfied were identified as significant emotional predictors for PI odds. Flavour, saltiness, overall liking, bored, good and interested were critical attributes, differentiating snacks. This study demonstrated that sensory liking and PI of extruded brown rice‐based snacks containing mushroom could be improved through savoury seasoning addition, which also allowed saltiness expectations to be met.  aPublisher supplied data  aPHD58I0001cthe Thailand Research Fund (TRF) 3aPleurotus pulmonarius 3aVolvariella volvacea 3abrown rice 3aconsumer attitudes 3aemotions 3amushrooms 3asaltiness 3asnacks 3awillingness to pay1 aJangchud, Kamolwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7747-76731 aJangchud, Anuvat1 aChonpracha, Pitchayapat1 aArdoin, Ryan1 aPrinyawiwatkul, Witoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5270-89570 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2020 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.46-54dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.142203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01179naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245008100160300001800241520019800259592002800457650001400485650002300499650002100522650001600543650001300559650001600572650001200588700002400600700001800624773012900642856007300771852000900844655001200853IND60658170920221119135842.0190816e20071121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065817092DNAL7 a10.1039/b713273e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrogan, Andrew P.10aNornicotine-organocatalyzed aqueous reduction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes  ap. 4952-4954.  aNornicotine, a native component of tobacco and minor nicotine metabolite, was found to catalyze the chemoselective reduction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes under homogeneous aqueous conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3achemical reactions 3achemoselectivity 3ametabolites 3anicotine 3anornicotine 3atobacco1 aDickerson, Tobin J.1 aJanda, Kim D.0 tChemical communications.g2007 Nov. 21, , no. 46 p.4952-4954dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b713273e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015000159300001600309500002000325520102000345592002801365650002701393650002501420650002901445650001901474650002201493650000901515650001801524650002101542650002001563650002001583650003301603650002401636650001201660700002001672700002001692700005901712773015001771856007401921852000901995655001202004IND60679434820221120202359.0191228e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067943482DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.143052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, Hyuk‐Je10aApplication of Cudrania tricuspidata leaf extract as a washing agent to inactivate Listeria monocytogenes on fresh‐cut romaine lettuce and kale  ap. 276-282.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study aimed to examine the antimicrobial activity of silkworm thorn (Cudrania tricuspidata) leaf extract (CTLE) and its application as a washing agent for fresh‐cut romaine lettuce and kale. The antimicrobial activities of CTLE at various concentrations against Listeria monocytogenes were determined using disc diffusion and viable cell count assays, and CTLE exhibited strong inactivation of L. monocytogenes. In particular, after the treatment with 0.4% CTLE, the protein content of L. monocytogenes cells was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased from 507.21 to 254.58 μg mL⁻¹, and damaged cells were observed by scanning electron microscopy. CTLE washing resulted in approximately 2‐log reduction of microbial growth, similar to that of 0.01% NaOCl. In addition, CTLE washing did not affect the quality of romaine lettuce and kale. Therefore, these results suggest that CTLE is applicable as a new washing agent for inactivating L. monocytogenes on fresh‐cut romaine lettuce and kale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aMaclura tricuspidata 3aantimicrobial properties 3acell viability 3afresh-cut produce 3akale 3aleaf extracts 3amicrobial growth 3aprotein content 3aromaine lettuce 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hypochlorite 3awashing1 aKang, Ji‐Hoon1 aLee, Chae‐Hun1 aSong, Kyung Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7744-22240 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2020 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.276-282dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.143053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245022500212300002000437520237600457592002802833650001102861650001402872650002502886650001102911650000902922700001702931773012202948856008803070852000903158655001203167IND60756861420221122040447.0211118e20211104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075686142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c031322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7823-634510aStress-Dependent Unstable Dynamic Propagation of Three-Dimensional Multiple Hydraulic Fractures with Improved Fracturing Sequences in Heterogeneous Reservoirs: Numerical Cases Study via Poroelastic Effective Medium Model  ap. 18543-18562.  aMultistage hydrofracturing of horizontal wells is one of the key technologies for deep tight oil and gas resource exploitation. The stable and parallel propagation of multiple fractures formed by multistage perforation cluster fracturing is conducive to the formation of a developed fracture network. However, in the actual process of rock fracturing in deep tight reservoirs, owing to the influence of many factors, such as fracturing sequence, perforation cluster space, reservoir heterogeneity, and stress shadow effect, the three-dimensional (3D) fracture network that propagates unsteadily of multiple fractures is often formed. This has become an important problem limiting artificial transformation and in optimizing fracture networks. In view of the above difficulties, a 3D finite element–discrete element model considering fluid–solid coupling and fracturing fluid leak-off effect is proposed to simulate hydrofracturing, and an effective medium model to describe heterogeneous reservoir rock mass is established. Several typical fracturing sequences (sequential, alternate, simultaneous, and two improved alternate scenarios), perforation cluster spaces (100, 75, 50, and 25 m), and heterogeneous reservoir conditions were analyzed. The spatial unstable propagation, stress field interference, and evolution behavior of the pressure fracture network were simulated, and the quantitative results of the dynamic propagation shape, fracture propagation area, and spatial volume of the pressure fracture network were obtained. The numerical results show that when the perforation cluster space decreases, the stress shadow effect between hydraulic fractures intensifies, and the 3D fracture exhibits unstable propagation and spatial deflection. Compared with sequential and simultaneous fracturing, all types of improved alternate fracturing can effectively reduce the stress interference between fractures, fracture deflection, and form the developed fracture network area. Compared with the homogeneous reservoir model, the heterogeneity of the reservoir rock mass becomes an important factor that limits the propagation of the fracture network. These results can provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms of stress-dependent unstable dynamic propagation of 3D multiple hydraulic fractures of improved fracturing sequences in heterogeneous reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aevolution 3ahydraulic fracturing 3amodels 3aoils1 aLiu, Xuguang0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Nov. 04, v. 35, no. 22 p.18543-18562dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c031323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01337naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245010800200300002000308520016900328592002800497650002300525650002300548650001900571650001400590650001800604650001300622700002500635700002100660700002100681700001700702700002000719700001700739773013600756856007400892852000900966655001200975IND60639702820221119181714.0190502e20171123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063970282DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc08185e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPramanikEqually contributing to this work., Sumit Kumar10aImaging cellular trafficking processes in real time using lysosome targeted up-conversion nanoparticles  ap. 12672-12675.  aβ-NaYF₄:Yb,Gd up-conversion nanoparticles, UCNPs, surface functionalized with suitable targetting peptides function as nontoxic lysosome-specific imaging probes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3ananoparticles 3apeptides1 aSreedharan, Sreejesh1 aSingh, Harwinder1 aGreen, Nicola H.1 aSmythe, Carl1 aThomas, Jim.

The paper wasp Polistes chinensis antennalis is native to East Asia, was introduced to New Zealand in 1979 and has expanded its distribution there. This provides an excellent opportunity to examine the impacts of an initial bottleneck and subsequent expansion on genetic structure. We analysed and compared the genetic population structures of the native (Japan and South Korea) and invasive New Zealand populations. Although 94% of individuals had shared haplotypes detected across both populations, the remaining 6% had private haplotypes identified in only one of the three countries. The genetic variation at microsatellite loci was lower in New Zealand than in native countries, and the genetic structure in New Zealand was clearly distinct from that in its native range. Higher frequencies of diploid‐male‐ and triploid‐female‐producing colonies were detected in New Zealand than in the native countries, showing the reduction in genetic variation via a genetic bottleneck. At least two independent introductions were suggested, and the putative source regions for New Zealand were assigned as Kanto (central island) and Kyushu (south island) in Japan. Serial founder events following the initial introduction were also indicated. The estimated dispersal distance between mother and daughter in New Zealand was twice that in Japan. Thus, the introduction history of P. chinensis antennalis in New Zealand is probably the result of at least two independent introductions, passing through a bottleneck during introduction, followed by population expansion from the point of introduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolistes chinensis 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aislands 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aJapan 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth Korea1 aKudô, Kazuyuki1 aIshiguro, Norio0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 23, no. 16 p.4018-4034dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.128523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012400156300001600280500002000296520096000316592002801276596005401304596008001358596007101438596005901509650001501568650001201583650001801595650001901613650002401632650002101656650001301677650005801690650001401748650001401762650001001776700003101786700001701817700005301834700001401887773015001901856007402051852000902125655001202134IND60679435020221120223518.0191228e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067943502DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.142712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiping10aBitter‐tasting hydrophobic peptides prepared from soy sauce using aqueous ethanol solutions influence taste sensation  ap. 146-156.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, bitter‐tasting hydrophobic peptides were prepared and purified from soy sauce using aqueous ethanol solutions and ion exchange resin, and analysed using RP‐HPLC and UPLC‐Q‐TOF‐MS/MS.

This fraction contained sixteen small peptides (molecular weight < 1000 Da; rich in hydrophobic amino acids with Lys‐Pro (KP), Glu‐Phe (EF), Glu‐Val (EV), Asp‐Leu (DL), Leu‐Trp (LW) and Asp‐Pro (DP)) capable of enhancing significantly (P < 0.05) umaminess and/or imparting kokumi effect in taste reconstitution experiments. Thus, the bitter peptides affected bitterness as well as other taste sensations like umaminess, kokuminess and saltiness. This was the first study to report the impacts of the bitter‐tasting hydrophobic peptides on soy sauce and solutions of salt, monosodium l‐glutamate.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0400803cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2017A010105002cScience and Technology Research Funds of Guangdong Province  a2017ZD093cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a31201416cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abitterness 3aethanol 3aglutamic acid 3ahydrophobicity 3aion exchange resins 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asaltiness 3asoy sauce 3ataste1 aSun‐Waterhouse, Dongxiao1 aChen, Jiahui1 aCui, Chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9452-02201 aWang, Wei0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2020 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.146-156dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.142713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245013500198300001800333520168100351592002802032650002302060650001602083650002702099650002302126650001602149650002202165650002502187650001802212650000702230650002002237650001302257650002302270650001502293653003102308653001802339653002502357653003102382700001302413700001502426700002602441700005602467773015502523856007902678852000902757655001202766IND60705456720221120081842.0200913e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070545672DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2020-184572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8267-924510aElectrostatic complexation of β-lactoglobulin aggregates with κ-carrageenan and the resulting emulsifying and foaming properties  ap. 8709-8720.  aThe electrostatic complexation of protein and polysaccharide and the functional properties of the complexes are significantly affected by the structure of protein aggregates and are important in the development of new food ingredients. In this work, natural globular β-lactoglobulin (NGBLG), β-lactoglobulin nanoparticles (BLGNP), and β-lactoglobulin fibrils (BLGF) were prepared and complexed with κ-carrageenan (κ-car). Phase diagrams of the NGBLG–, BLGNP–, and BLGF–κ-car systems were established and divided into 4 regions: mixed soluble polymers (I), intramolecular soluble complex (II), intermolecular soluble complex (III), and intermolecular insoluble complex (IV). Aggregation shifted the boundaries of regions III and IV of BLGF– or BLGNP–κ-car to lower pH and higher protein aggregates/κ-car weight ratio (r), especially for BLGF–κ-car. The emulsifying and foaming properties of the 3 mixed systems were investigated in regions I and II. Complexes in region II had significantly better emulsifying properties than the corresponding mixtures in region I and the pure protein aggregates. Interestingly, phase separation resulted in different effects on the foaming properties of the 3 BLG–κ-car complexes, in which BLGF–κ-car complexation in region II decreased the foaming properties in region I but the complexation of NGBLG–κ-car and BLGNP–κ-car in region II increased the foaming properties. The BLGF–κ-car complex in regions I and II provided the best emulsifying and foaming properties. Interfacial data both on oil–water and air–water interfaces overall explained the emulsifying and foaming properties of the complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3afoaming properties 3aingredients 3akappa carrageenan 3aliquid-air interface 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphysical phases 3apolymers 3aprotein aggregates 3aseparation 0aelectrostatic complexation 0aphase diagram 0ainterfacial property 0aβ-lactoglobulin aggregate1 aHu, Jing1 aZhang, Hui1 aNishinari, Katsuyoshi1 aFang, Yapeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3411-76480 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Oct., v. 103, no. 10 p.8709-8720dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-184573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009200154300002000246520108900266592002801355650002101383650001501404650001501419650001701434650001901451650001301470650001301483650001301496650001701509650001701526700001701543700001501560700001901575773014501594856007401739852000901813655001201822IND60641836020221117231434.0190506e20160913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064183602DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta04939g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jun10aNitrogen-rich microporous carbons for highly selective separation of light hydrocarbons  ap. 13957-13966.  aA controllable and facile one-pot method for synthesizing N-doped activated carbons (NACs) with a considerable amount of N by using a nitrogen-rich polymer precursor as both the nitrogen source and self-template is reported. The obtained NACs are promising solid adsorbents for light hydrocarbon separations with tunable microstructures. Particularly, NACs with a narrow pore size distribution (ca. 2.6–3.8 nm), high specific surface area (ca. 1628.9–2146.1 m² g⁻¹), and high heteroatom content (ca. 3.6 wt%) exhibited excellent hydrocarbon uptake capacities (ca. C2 7.59 mmol g⁻¹ and C3 11.77 mmol g⁻¹). Remarkably, NACs also showed unprecedented C3/C2/C1 separation selectivity (ca. C2/C1 65.7 and C3/C1 501.9) at 298 K and 1.0 bar, which is one of the highest so far reported for benchmark adsorbents, according to the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). Combined with its simple preparation, high adsorption capacity, and excellent light hydrocarbon selectivity, the sample NAC 700 is a potent and promising solid-state adsorbent for light hydrocarbon separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3ahydrocarbons 3amicrostructure 3anitrogen 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asurface area1 aKrishna, R.,1 aYang, Ting1 aDeng, Shuguang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Sept. 13, v. 4, no. 36 p.13957-13966dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta04939g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012500170300001800295520064400313592002800957650001400985650001700999650002401016650001201040700001701052700001701069700002301086700002201109700002001131700001701151700001701168773009601185856008101281852000901362655001201371IND60724916720221119063613.0210124e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072491672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRandell, Edward W.10aStrategy for 90% autoverification of clinical chemistry and immunoassay test results using six sigma process improvement  ap. 1740-1749.  aSix Sigma involves a structured process improvement strategy that places processes on a pathway to continued improvement.

Up regulation of IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-12 at different time points post immunization (dpi) revealed activation of macrophages in both chicken lines. Stronger immune response was induced in the cecal tonsils of the susceptible line at 5 dpi. The highest transcriptional activities were observed in the spleen tissues of the resistant line at 3 dpi. No increase in the population of CD3+ T cells was observed in duodenum of vaccinated birds at 5 dpi indicating the lack of involvement of adaptive immune system in the transcriptional profiling of the tested genes. There was, however, an increase in the number of macrophages in the duodenum of vaccinated birds. The CVI988/Rispens antigen was detected in the duodenum and cecal tonsils of the susceptible line but not the resistant line at 5 dpi. This study sheds light on the role of macrophages in vaccine-mediated protection against MD and possible development of new recombinant vaccines with enhanced innate immune system activation properties.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMarek disease 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3aantigen detection 3aantigens 3acecum 3acell lines 3achickens 3adisease resistance 3aduodenum 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophages 3arecombinant vaccines 3aspleen 3atonsils 3atranscription (genetics)1 aWang, Dang1 aSun, Shuhong0 tJournal of veterinary science.g2018, v. 19, no. 3 p.375-383wJournal:2132x1229-845X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67431933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2018.19.3.3753Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/jvs-19-375.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Vaccine-induced%20MQ%20activation.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245016700166500001400333520093900347592002801286650001801314650001601332650002501348650002901373650001401402650001901416650001501435650001401450650001301464653003601477653001401513653001401527700001701541700002001558700001801578700001601596700001801612773010001630856008701730852000901817655001201826IND60704575120221120223956.0201024e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070457512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1276392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lin10aDual effects of ascorbic acid on the stability of EGCG by the oxidation product dehydroascorbic acid promoting the oxidation and inhibiting the hydrolysis pathway  aNAL-light  aA series of incubation systems of pure (−)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) at 80 °C were performed to investigated the effect and mechanism of AA on the stability of EGCG. Results shows the dual function of AA, protect action at low concentration and promoting degradation at high concentration, and the critical concentration is about 10 mmol/L. The protective properties of AA due to the reversible reaction from AA to DHAA inhibiting oxidation pathway of EGCG to EGCG quinone or other activated intermediates, and both AA and DHAA can inhibit the hydrolysis of EGCG. The properties of promoting degradation is mainly due to the fact that DHAA, the oxidation product of AA, can react with EGCG to generate some ascorbyl adducts of EGCG. This result is helpful to control the stability of catechins and further clarify the complex interaction on healthy between EGCG and AA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3adegradation 3adehydroascorbic acid 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3aflavanols 3afood chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3aoxidation 3aquinones 0aEpigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 0aStability 0aMechanism1 aWang, Weiwei1 aZhang, Jianyong1 aCui, Hongchun1 aNi, Dejiang1 aJiang, Heyuan0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 337 p.127639-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1276393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013000163300001600293500001500309520166300324592002801987650001302015650001602028650001302044650001402057650001402071650001402085650002302099650002502122650001502147650001002162650001702172650002602189650001202215650002102227653001802248653003302266653001502299653002502314653003102339653002002370700002002390773013302410856007802543852000902621655001202630IND60515876720221118184817.0160321e20140210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587672DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-03882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlecht, R.M.10aBranch aggregation and crown allometry condition the precision of randomized branch sampling estimators of conifer crown mass  ap. 499-508.  a2019-12-06  aCharacterizations of conifer crown biomass are important for assessing forest fuel loadings, bioenergy supplies, carbon stocks, and growth and yield. There is considerable variation in conifer crown mass, but to guide sampling programs, there is little quantitative information available concerning its structure or extent. This research examines several randomized branch sampling (RBS) strategies adapted for excurrent crown forms, as well as the impact of allometric relationships on their precision. The RBS strategies differ in terms of how primary branches (those attached directly to the bole) are aggregated into selection nodes and are evaluated using destructively sampled Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) trees. Strong linear relationships between branch mass and basal area improve the precision of RBS relative to simple random sampling. Yet because the sample trees exhibited area-increasing branching patterns, the RBS strategies could not achieve the same precision as two-pass probability proportional-to-size methods. For the same reason, aggregation of branches improved the precision of RBS. For practical reasons, we recommend aggregating branches by 1 m intervals along the stem. This strategy brought the relative standard errors for crown mass below 20% with sample sizes of four to eight branches, with smaller sample sizes yielding this result for more slender trees. We also report results on the variability of branch area and mass, as well as results that recommend against the practice of allocating equal numbers of sample branches to crown strata of equal length.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconifers 3aprobability 3abranches 3aallometry 3abranching 3abioenergy 3aLarix occidentalis 3afuels (fire ecology) 3atree trunk 3atrees 3acarbon sinks 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3abiomass 3astand basal area 0acrown biomass 0aunequal probability sampling 0abasal area 0aexcurrent crown form 0arandomized branch sampling 0acrown allometry1 aAffleck, D.L.R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2014 Feb. 10, v. 44, no. 5 p.499-508dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-03883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007300171520147000244592002801714650002401742650001101766650002901777650001501806650003201821650001301853650001501866650001201881650002301893650000701916650001101923650001601934651001301950653002201963653002801985653002102013653002102034653000702055653000802062653000702070653000802077653000702085653000802092653000702100653000902107700002002116700002002136700002102156773011802177856008602295852000902381655001202390IND60760264220221117225337.0220124e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076026422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1143092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardilhó, Sara10aMarine macroalgae waste: A potential feedstock for biogas production  aIn the present study, marine macroalgae waste, mainly composed by Saccorhiza polyschides, was collected from a beach in northern Portugal and evaluated as feedstock for anaerobic digestion. Batch experiments (500 mL flasks, 300 mL working volume) were conducted at the following conditions: mesophilic temperature (37 °C); 80 rpm stirring speed; 150 mL inoculum (anaerobically digested sludge) and variable total solids content (0.9, 1.7, 2.5 and 3.5% TS). Methane concentration and volume of biogas obtained were monitored during up to 57 days by optical sensors and milligascounters, respectively. The results show that an increase in total solids content up to 2.5% TS led to the highest biogas volume and methane concentration. The maximum biogas yield was 227 ± 4 mL/g VS (2.5% TS, 53 operation days), with the maximum methane content in the biogas being 64.5 ± 0.6% (51 operation days). A maximum methane yield of 146 ± 2 mL/g VS was consequently estimated. At the end of the process (57 days), an average of 43% COD reduction and 46% VS reduction were observed. These results correspond to about 27% of the theoretical maximum methane production. Using 3.5% TS the inhibition of the process was observed, by the decrease in pH, most likely due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. The results indicate that marine macroalgae waste may be a good candidate as substrate for anaerobic digestion processes, most probably by co-digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3aenvironmental management 3afeedstocks 3agas production (biological) 3ainoculum 3amacroalgae 3amethane 3amethane production 3apH 3asludge 3atemperature 3aPortugal 0aBiogas production 0aMarine macroalgae waste 0aBiomass recovery 0aRenewable energy 0aAD 0aC/N 0aMM 0aMMW 0aTS 0aVFA 0aVS 0aWWTP1 aBoaventura, Rui1 aAlmeida, Manuel1 aDias, Joana Maia0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 304 p.114309-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1143093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245013200152300002000284520173200304592002802036650001202064650002402076650002202100650001902122650001602141700001902157773014202176856007402318852000902392655001202401IND60643136920221121034233.0190509e20190507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064313692DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta01647c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qi10aStructure and property tunability in monolayer halide lead-free double hybrid perovskites: effects of Rashba and biaxial strain  ap. 11487-11496.  aOrganic–inorganic hybrid double perovskites (OIHDPs) are playing increasingly important roles in the development of stable and lead-free perovskite materials. However, most of them are indirect-band semiconductors with large band gaps which severely limit their development for practical applications. Here we theoretically investigate the intrinsic structures/properties and biaxial strain-induced changes for the monolayer lead-free OIHDP, MA₄[AgBi]Br₈ (MA = CH₃NH₃⁺), and propose to use strain to tune its electronic structures and so optimize its properties. Our results reveal that pristine MA₄[AgBi]Br₈ has an indirect band gap originated in the inequality of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects on its valence and conduction band extrema and on two directions around the high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone as well, and that the strain tunes the band gap and the Rashba effect, and as a result it mediates the band structure. The band gap of MA₄[AgBi]Br₈ varies linearly with the strain ratio and a ≥2% stretching can turn it into a complete direct-band semiconductor. MA₄[AgBi]Br₈ shows different properties under various strain conditions. Compression strengthens the giant SOC-related characteristics including the SOC-induced indirect band gap and Rashba band-splitting, while moderate stretching not only lessens the band gap but also can enhance the carrier mobility and exciton separation. These results indicate that MA₄[AgBi]Br₈ has the potential to be a stable and non-toxic multifunctional perovskite material. This work also provides some full-scale insights into the Rashba effect on band structures and the correlation between structures/properties and the strain ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahalides 3ainterface phenomena 3aquantum mechanics 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells1 aLiang, WanZhen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 May 7, v. 7, no. 18 p.11487-11496dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta01647c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003600134024002200170024001900192040001800211100002600229245011100255300001200366506007600378506017300454520127700627506003701904650002101941650002201962650001501984650001301999650001202012650002302024650003102047650001802078700002202096700001802118700002102136773008402157856011402241856008202355956014002437961000902577852000902586655001202595IND60674319520221214231754.0180717s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067431952DNAL7 a10113/67431952hdl7 a3476282aris7 a10.1038/s41598-018-27998-72doi7 aPMC60184202pmcid7 a299419242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikulu-Lord, Maggy T.10aFirst report on the application of near-infrared spectroscopy to predict the age of Aedes albopictus Skuse  ap. 1-7.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aTo date there is no single technique described for predicting the age of Aedes albopictus commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito. In this study we report the potential of a near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique for characterizing the age of female laboratory reared Ae. albopictus. Using leave one out cross validation, laboratory reared mosquitoes at 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 16, 20 and 25 days post emergence preserved in RNAlater for up to a month were assessed. Mosquitoes (N=322) were differentiated into two age classes (<7 or ≥ 7 days old) with a predictive accuracy of 93%., into 3 age classes (>7, 7-13 and >13 days old) with a predictive accuracy of 76% accuracy and on a continuous age scale to within ±3 days of the actual average age. Similarly, models developed predicted mosquitoes (N=146) excluded from the model with 94% and 71% predictive accuracy to the two and the three age groups, respectively. We show for the first time that NIRS could be applied to predict the age of female Ae. Albopictus reared in the laboratory. Rapid characterisation of the survival of Ae. albopictus is crucial in determining its invasion capability in various regions of the world with downstream effects of designing appropriate interventions targeting their survival.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes albopictus 3aage determination 3aanimal age 3aeclosion 3afemales 3alaboratory rearing 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3asurvival rate1 aDevine, Gregor J.1 aHugo, Leon E.1 aDowell, Floyd E.0 tScientific reports.g2018, v. 8, no. 9590 p.1-7wJournal:26716x2045-23227nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67431953Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27998-73Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2018%20%20SciRpts%20%208%20%209590%20%20Sikulu-Lord%20et%20al.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009700169300001600266520101700282592002801299650002401327650002501351650002101376650002601397650004101423650001101464650001801475650001901493650001801512650002301530650001701553653002301570653002101593653002101614653001801635653002201653700001301675700002201688700001401710773012801724856008101852852000901933655001201942IND60540047020221119183912.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054004702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2014.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBermejo-Prada, A.10aEffect of hyperbaric storage at room temperature on the volatile profile of strawberry juice  ap. 906-914.  aThe effect of hyperbaric storage at room temperature on the volatile profile of raw strawberry juice was evaluated. To do so, volatile profiles of strawberry juices maintained at 20 °C and different pressure levels (0.1, 50, and 200 MPa) for 15 days were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy and compared with those of control samples at day 0. Data corresponding to juices stored under traditional refrigeration (0.1 MPa/5 °C) for the same period are also presented for comparison. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were applied to discriminate the samples according to the storage conditions. The results clearly showed that samples stored under pressure were more similar to the control juices at day 0 than samples stored under refrigeration at atmospheric pressure. Moreover, hyperbaric storage, unlike traditional refrigeration, was efficient in avoiding changes in all the key aroma compounds detected in the strawberry juice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3acluster analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ajuices 3aleast squares 3aodor compounds 3arefrigeration 3astorage conditions 3astrawberries 0aHyperbaric storage 0aStrawberry juice 0aVolatile profile 0aHigh pressure 0aFood preservation1 aVega, E.1 aPérez-Mateos, M.1 aOtero, L.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 June, v. 62, no. 1 p.906-914dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2014.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245009600159300002000255520146500275592002801740650002601768650001301794650001901807650002301826650000901849650001801858650002901876650001501905650001801920650002101938650004301959651001002002653002602012653001802038653002202056653001402078700001502092700001502107773015702122856007902279852000902358655001202367IND60615939320221118084430.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061593932DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-146092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakada, S.10aEstimation of circulating bovine leukemia virus levels using conventional blood cell counts  ap. 11229-11236.  aBovine leukemia virus (BLV) is widely prevalent in Japanese dairy farms. To control BLV infections in Japan, segregating or managing cows according to their proviral load (PVL) is a rational strategy. This study was conducted to establish a quantitative procedure for estimating blood PVL per microliter using a statistical model to offer a cost-effective alternative to the conventional quantitative real-time PCR method. In total, 250 Holstein cows infected with BLV were identified from 10 commercial dairy farms. Information on age was collected and blood samples were tested for white blood cell and lymphocyte counts and PVL using PCR. Generalized linear models with quasi-Poisson errors were used to estimate PVL by selecting age, logarithm of lymphocyte count, and their interaction term as explanatory variables. To evaluate the model, blood samples of 92 BLV-infected Holstein cows from 2 other commercial dairy farms were tested, and measured PVL values were compared with estimated PVL values by the model. The logPVL per microliter was modeled by positive associations with log lymphocyte count and age and a negative association with the interaction term. In the evaluation, measured PVL values had a strong correlation with estimated PVL values (Spearman's ρ = 0.87). In conclusion, our model provides a cost-effective and more rapid alternative to the conventional method to facilitate test and segregation or management of BLV-suspected cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine leukemia virus 3aHolstein 3ablood sampling 3acost effectiveness 3acows 3adairy farming 3aenzootic bovine leukosis 3aleukocytes 3alinear models 3alymphocyte count 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aJapan 0abovine leukemia virus 0aproviral load 0astatistical model 0adairy cow1 aKohara, J.1 aMakita, K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Dec., v. 101, no. 12 p.11229-11236dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-146093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008700165300001400252520068400266592002800950650001500978650003200993650004401025650002001069650002201089650001801111653002401129653002701153653002801180700001901208700001401227773013801241856008501379852000901464655001201473IND60527868320221121191013.0190415e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052786832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2016.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Li Hua10aAnticomplement cycloartane triterpene glycosides from Beesia calthaefolia (Maxim.)  ap. 47-51.  aInvestigation of the n-BuOH extract of the whole plant of Beesia calthaefolia led to the isolation of three new cycloartane triterpenoids (1–3) and two known compounds (4, 5).

All of the isolates were investigated for their inhibitory effects on the classical pathway of the complement system. Among them, compound 3 showed stronger inhibitory activity (IC50 148.0μM) than the positive control (rosmarinic acid, IC50 181.8μM), while other compounds (1, 2, 4 and 5) showed moderate activity. The chemical compound studied in this article was rosmarinic acid (PubChem CID: 5281792).  aPublisher supplied data 3aglycosides 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arosmarinic acid 3aspectral analysis 3atriterpenoids 0aBeesia calthaefolia 0aCycloartane triterpene 0aAnticomplement activity1 aZhao, Jin Yuan1 aLiu, Ping0 tPhytochemistry letters.g2016 June, v. 16 p.47-51dElsevier LtdaPhytochemical Society of EuropewJournal:J000000131x1874-39007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2016.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245005500167300001600222500001500238520146600253592002801719650002301747650001901770650001801789650001401807650001401821650001101835650002301846650001501869650001001884650001101894650001701905650001701922650001501939650002001954650002401974650002101998650001202019651003102031653002902062653001802091653002502109653001002134653001502144700001902159700002002178700002102198700003202219700001902251700001902270700002102289700001902310700002402329773011802353856007802471961001202549852000902561655001202570IND60515877020221118185516.0160321e20140124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587702DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-04462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamuelson, Lisa J.10aEcosystem carbon stocks in Pinus palustris forests  ap. 476-486.  a2019-12-06  aLongleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) restoration in the southeastern United States offers opportunities for carbon (C) sequestration. Ecosystem C stocks are not well understood in longleaf pine forests, which are typically of low density and maintained by prescribed fire. The objectives of this research were to develop allometric equations for above- and below-ground biomass and quantify ecosystem C stocks in five longleaf pine forests ranging in age from 5 to 87 years and in basal area from 0.4 to 22.6 m²·ha⁻¹. Live aboveground C (woody plant + ground cover) and live root C (longleaf pine below stump + plot level coarse roots + plot level fine roots) ranged from 1.4 and 2.9 Mg C·ha⁻¹, respectively, in the 5-year-old stand to 78.4 and 19.2 Mg C·ha⁻¹, respectively, in the 87-year-old stand. Total ecosystem C (live plant + dead organic matter + mineral soil) values were 71.6, 110.1, 124.6, 141.4, and 185.4 Mg C·ha⁻¹ in the 5-, 12-, 21-, 64-, and 87-year-old stands, respectively, and dominated by tree C and soil C. In the 5-year-old stand, ground cover C and residual taproot C were significant C stocks. This unique, in-depth assessment of above- and below-ground C across a series of longleaf pine stands will improve estimates of C in longleaf pine ecosystems and contribute to development of general biomass models that account for variation in climate, site, and management history in an important but understudied ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprescribed burning 3aorganic matter 3amineral soils 3aallometry 3aequations 3amodels 3aconiferous forests 3afine roots 3atrees 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3awoody plants 3aecosystems 3aPinus palustris 3abelowground biomass 3astand basal area 3aclimate 3aSoutheastern United States 0aground-penetrating radar 0alongleaf pine 0acarbon sequestration 0aroots 0abasal area1 aStokes, Tom A.1 aButnor, John R.1 aJohnsen, Kurt H.1 aGonzalez-Benecke, Carlos A.1 aAnderson, Pete1 aJackson, Jason1 aFerrari, Lorenzo1 aMartin, Tim A.1 aCropper, Wendell P.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2014 Jan. 24, v. 44, no. 5 p.476-486dNRC Research Pressx1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-04463Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245009100199300001800290500002000308520161700328592002801945650001601973650001301989650001302002650001102015650002202026650001102048650000902059650001802068650001302086650001502099650001702114650000902131650001102140650001402151650001402165650001502179650001802194650001302212650000902225700006502234700006002299700006002359700006702419700006202486773012202548856007302670852000902743655001202752IND60701650720221120190216.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070165072DNAL7 a10.1111/are.146602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGouva, Evangelia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0108-021X10aComparative study of the effects of heavy metals on embryonic development of zebrafish  ap. 3255-3267.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to investigate the effects of heavy metals, such as copper, zinc, iron, cobalt, chromium, aluminium, manganese and molybdenum, on zebrafish egg hatching rate and the subsequent survival rate of the larvae. Each metal was used in the various concentrations of0.05 mg/L, 50 mg/L and 500 mg/L to detect the threshold limit of tolerance. The study's results showed significant differences in the hatching and survival rate of larvae between the control group and most of the experimental groups when adding heavy metals in various concentrations. The highest concentration (500 mg/L) of the induced heavy metals tested in this study resulted in total egg or larval mortality within 96 hr and significantly lower egg or larval life expectancy. Among the tested metals, zinc and molybdenum had the most significant impact on hatching time, in contrast to iron that did not differentiate the results from the control group. Copper, cobalt, chromium, aluminium and manganese did affect zebrafish eggs depending on their exposure concentrations, which differentiated the results from the control group. Also, the study's findings demonstrate a significant dependence of the hatched egg heart rate on the metal concentration, and in particular, higher concentrations of metals correspond to higher heart rate. Zinc, Molybdenum and copper was proved to be the most toxic heavy metals causing increased hazard rate to mortality up to 96 hr and shorter life expectancy. Finally, skeletal deformities that occasionally observed did not significantly affect the total life expectancy of the hatched eggs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aaluminum 3achromium 3acobalt 3acomparative study 3acopper 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3ahatching 3aheart rate 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alarvae 3alongevity 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3asurvival rate 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aNathanailides, Cosmas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9215-41271 aSkoufos, Ioannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4459-55581 aPaschos, Ioannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5813-64271 aAthanassopoulou, Fotini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7489-64901 aPappas, Ioannis S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6214-48840 tAquaculture research.g2020 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.3255-3267dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.146603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011100167500001400278520107000292592002801362650002301390650001101413650001001424650001101434650001101445650001901456650002701475650001201502650001701514650000901531650001401540650001901554650001001573650001601583650001801599653002501617653004101642653003201683653003101715653002201746700001701768700005501785773010001840856008701940852000902027655001202036IND60704575320221121004957.0201024e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070457532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1276412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParr, Hebe10aModelling flavour formation in roasted malt substrates under controlled conditions of time and temperature  aNAL-light  aDrum roasted products are used to impart colour, flavour and mouthfeel to beers. Here we designed a laboratory-scale roaster (100 g batch size) capable of precise time-temperature control and investigated the impacts of time, temperature and roasting substrate (barley, pale malt or germinated green malt) on formation of 20 key odour active aroma volatiles. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of flavour volatile data across 37 laboratory roasted and 6 commercial roasted products generated a product flavour space depicting the relationship between roasting conditions and concentrations of these 20 compounds. Response surface models were produced for aroma compound concentrations across the design space of roasting times and temperatures for each substrate. These clearly illustrate the impacts of substrate moisture content and prior history (e.g. whether germinated or germinated and kilned) on flavour formation. In low moisture substrates a steep increase in associated heterocyclic aroma compound production was noted at process temperatures >180 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abarley 3acolor 3adesign 3aflavor 3afood chemistry 3aheterocyclic compounds 3ahistory 3alaboratories 3amalt 3amouthfeel 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3atemperature 3awater content 0aRoasted malt flavour 0aGas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aModelling flavour formation 0aThermal flavour generation 0aMaillard reaction1 aBolat, Irina1 aCook, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4967-32870 tFood chemistry.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 337 p.127641-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1276413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013400169300001800303500001900321520139900340592002801739650004401767650001701811650001001828650001301838650000701851650001501858650001801873650001901891700002301910700002501933700002401958700002301982700006302005773012102068856008202189852000902271655001202280IND60708401320221122043519.0200825e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070840132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-020-03929-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadhav, Rajiv A.10aDevelopment and Validation of Rapid Stability-Indicating RP-HPLC Method for Assay and Related Substances of Solifenacin Succinate  ap. 1107-1119.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA simple, inexpensive, rapid and novel stability-indicating reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method employing Zorbax-CN column has been developed and validated for the determination of both, assay and related substances of Solifenacin Succinate (SOL) drug substance and in its drug product. Forced degradation study of SOL was performed at acid, base, oxidative, photolytic and thermal stress conditions. Significant degradation was observed only in acidic and basic conditions. Four process and degradation impurities and have been identified by LC–MS and characterized by ¹H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. The baseline separation of the impurities was achieved by gradient elution using phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) and a mixture of solvents (acetonitrile, methanol, and water), as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min⁻¹. All impurities were quantified using a photodiode array detector (PDA) at 220 nm. The developed RP-HPLC method was validated in agreement with ICH requirements. The forced degradation studies proved the stability-indicating power of the method and hence, the validated method is useful for the intended use in routine analysis of SOL as bulk drug and in respective dosage forms. The salient feature of the presented method could be applied for assay and related substances determination of SOL in pharmaceutical laboratories and industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetonitrile 3adrugs 3amethanol 3apH 3aphosphates 3asuccinic acid 3athermal stress1 aSanil, Yogeesha M.1 aShankarwar, Sunil G.1 aShankarwar, Anil G.1 aPawar, Rajendra P.1 aBembalkar, Saroj R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8249-62460 tChromatographia.g2020 Sept., v. 83, no. 9 p.1107-1119dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-020-03929-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245010400216500001900320520145000339592002801789650002101817650002901838650002301867650003101890650002301921650002101944650000701965650002101972650001101993653001202004653001802016653001802034653001202052653001002064653001802074700002802092700006502120700002502185773010602210856008602316852000902402655001202411IND60697073020221118052547.0200601e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069707302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1106052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojciechowski, Kamil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7693-946910aAntimicrobial films of poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) and its copolymers doped with TiO2 and CaCO3  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolymeric coatings with positive surface charge offer potential antimicrobial activity, which they owe to a simple electrostatic attraction with negatively charged bacterial walls and membranes. We describe synthesis and characterization of poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) and its copolymers with methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate, as potential binders for antimicrobial solvent-cast paints. TiO₂ and CaCO₃ mineral particles were employed as model pigments/fillers, as they are used in most real-life paint formulations. Electrokinetic (ζ) potential and antimicrobial activity of thin films made of the (co)polymers in the absence and presence of TiO₂ and CaCO₃ nanopowders were assessed using streaming current measurements and microbial growth inhibition tests, respectively. Independently of the structure of the monomers used for the synthesis, the films showed positive ζ-potential values (up to +95 mV) in the pH range 3.5-8.0. The presence of mineral particles at 50% dry weight of the films did not affect significantly the ζ(pH) curves. The films made of the mixed dispersions remained positively charged and inhibited growth of both Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacteria, as well as yeast (C. albicans). The mixed polymeric-mineral films described in this study seem to be promising potential candidates for designing antimicrobial coatings aimed to prevent spreading of bacterial infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantimicrobial properties 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agrowth retardation 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3atitanium dioxide 3ayeasts 0aPolymer 0aGram-positive 0aGram-negative 0aTitania 0aPaint 0aAntibacterial1 aGutarowicz, Małgorzata1 aMierzejewska, Jolanta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9298-87941 aParzuchowski, Paweł0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 185 p.110605-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1106053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001600284520125300300592002801553650002701581650001001608650001301618650001101631650001601642650001301658650001801671650000901689650002001698650001001718650001301728650001201741650001501753650002001768653001901788653001501807653001601822653002401838653002301862700001501885700001501900700001601915700001601931773012801947856008102075852000902156655001202165IND60540047220221119183937.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054004722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2014.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArancibia, C.10aColour, rheology, flavour release and sensory perception of dairy desserts. Influence of thickener and fat content  ap. 408-416.  aThis study aims to obtain information about how thickener type and concentration, and fat content influence colour, rheology, in-vivo aroma release and sensory characteristics of lemon-flavoured dairy desserts. Eight formulations were prepared varying in thickener type and concentration: carboxymethyl cellulose (1.1% and 1.3%) and modified starch (3.5% and 4.0%) and milk type (whole or skimmed). The amounts of the other ingredients were fixed. Regarding effects on colour and rheology, statistically significant interactions were detected between fat content, and thickener type and concentration. Colour was mainly affected by fat content; flow behaviour by thickener type, and viscoelasticity by thickener concentration. Thickener type and concentration and fat content significantly affected in-vivo aroma release. The delivery to the nasal cavity of the most lipophilic compound (linalool) mainly depended on fat content while thickener type and concentration mainly affected the release of the least lipophilic compound (cis-3-hexen-1-ol). Differences perceived in colour, texture and flavour attributes were also affected by variations in ingredients differently and most of them could be related with those observed in instrumental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acolor 3adesserts 3aflavor 3aingredients 3alinalool 3alipid content 3amilk 3amodified starch 3aodors 3arheology 3atexture 3athickeners 3aviscoelasticity 0aDairy desserts 0aThickeners 0aFat content 0aPhysical properties 0aSensory attributes1 aCastro, C.1 aJublot, L.1 aCostell, E.1 aBayarri, S.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 June, v. 62, no. 1 p.408-416dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2014.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245018900205300001400394520165900408592002802067650002002095650001202115650001402127650002202141650002302163650001202186650002102198650001702219650001602236650001702252650001002269650001102279650001402290650000902304650001402313651001202327651001102339653001902350653002002369653000802389653002902397653002102426653001802447653002402465700001802489700001602507700002302523700001902546773009902565856008502664852000902749655001202758IND60611880820221117215602.0190411e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061188082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dendro.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarman, Rob1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3560-126610aDendrochronological assessment of British veteran sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) trees: Successful cross-matching, and cross-dating with British and French oak (Quercus) chronologies  ap. 10-21.  aAcross Britain and continental Europe there are many ancient Castanea sativa trees of great significance for natural and cultural heritage, yet scant assessment has been made of them for dendrochronological information. This paper describes the dendrochronological analysis of 28 Castanea sativa trees (veteran historic trees, forest trees and coppice stems) sampled from 15 sites in southern Britain: 56 growth-ring sequences were collected for analysis, by boring living trees and by cutting transverse sections from dead fallen trees and previously cut stumps. Twenty-three single-tree sequences from 14 sites were cross-matched (t ≥3.5) and then cross-dated with 17 oak Quercus reference chronologies from England and northern France: a Castanea sativa master chronology spanning AD 1660–2014 has been created. The results demonstrate the viability of dendrochronological analysis of Castanea sativa wood; and confirm that Castanea sativa can be cross-dated with oak Quercus reference chronologies, inter-regionally and inter-nationally. The findings provide the potential means for dating Castanea sativa timbers sampled from palaeoenvironmental and historical contexts. The extraction of sawn sections from long-dead (up to 60 years in this study) trees and stumps is proven to be a reliable method for dating veteran trees in cultural landscapes and ancient woodlands; and for revealing the growth history of historic/iconic trees. The germination dates calculated for the Castanea sativa trees in this study span the period AD 1640–1943. The inaccuracy of estimating veteran Castanea sativa tree ages from girth measurements is highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea sativa 3aQuercus 3acoppicing 3acultural heritage 3acultural landscape 3acutting 3adendrochronology 3aforest trees 3agermination 3apaleoecology 3astems 3astumps 3aviability 3awood 3awoodlands 3aEngland 3aFrance 0aSweet chestnut 0aCastanea sativa 0aOak 0aQuercus robur/Q. petraea 0aDendrochronology 0aVeteran trees 0aCultural landscapes1 aMoir, Andy K.1 aWebb, Julia1 aChambers, Frank M.1 aRussell, Karen0 tDendrochronologia.g2018 Oct., v. 51 p.10-21dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl71157x1125-78657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245005700165300001400222520048100236592002800717650002200745650002700767650002900794650002900823650001500852650003700867650001500904650004400919650001000963650002200973653002400995653001401019653001401033653002901047700001801076700001401094700001201108700001801120700001701138700001601155700002001171773013801191856008501329852000901414655001201423IND60527868720221121191052.0190415e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052786872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2016.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yue10aNew norlignans and flavonoids of Dysosma versipellis  ap. 75-81.  aTwo new norlignans, dysosmanorlignans A and B (1–2); six new flavonoids, dysosmaflavones A–F (3–8); and 30 known compounds (9–38) were isolated from the roots of Dysosma versipellis.

A number of reasons such as few clinical signs complicate the diagnosis of this infection in Camelidae. Despite the ubiquitous use of serological tests for the first screening of brucellosis in camel, this approach showed several restrictions because of the intracellular properties of this organism as well as decline antibody titers in chronic stage. This study aimed at identifying the presence of Brucella spp. in blood and lymph node samples collected from slaughtered male camels of Sistan-Baluchistan province by serology, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. For this purpose, 2854 blood camel samples were sampled and analyzed for Brucella detection by serological screening tests. The molecular detection of IS711 gene and Bruce-ladder assay as well as culture were performed using the lymph nodes of all seropositive camel (n = 10) and 30 seronegative samples. Results showed that 0.35% (10/2854), 0.24% (7/2854) and 0.21% (6/2854) of blood samples were positive by RBPT, SAT and 2ME, respectively. However, 0% (0/10) and 70% (7/10) of lymph node samples collected from seropositive camels were positive for Brucella infection by culture and PCR, respectively. Furthermore, 6.6% (2/30) of seronegative lymph node specimens showed the presences of Brucella by PCR and culture assay. The results of the present study indicated the low seroprevalence of Brucella infection in male camels of the Sistan-Baluchistan province and highlighted the complementary role of PCR techniques for a better screening of Brucella infection among seronegative camels. Moreover, the potential shedding of Brucella within undiagnosed camel milk and secretions is a serious problem which may result in further spread and maintenance of Brucella infection among both human and livestock. Thus, for brucellosis detection and control, our results suggested that a first PCR screening supported by a bacteriological isolation on positive samples should be performed along with the serological test in endemic countries to identify the source and prevent the uncontrolled spread of the disease among camels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis 3aCamelidae 3aanimal health 3aantibodies 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3abrucellosis 3acamel milk 3acamels 3adisease transmission 3agenes 3ahealth status 3ahumans 3aimmunologic techniques 3alymph nodes 3amales 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asecretion 3aserology 3aseroprevalence 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3azoonoses 3aIran 0aSeroprevalence 0acamel 0aBrucella melitensis 0aPCR 0abrucellosis control1 aAlamian, Saeed0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2020 Dec., v. 185 p.105194-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.1051943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245009100213300001200304500001900316520170700335592002802042650001302070650001202083650001202095650001302107650001902120650001602139650001602155650002502171651002102196651001002217700001802227700001802245700002002263773015202283856008302435852000902518655001202527IND60708401620221122043420.0210325e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070840162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08554-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomshoo, Shakil Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0070-556410aSatellite-observed glacier recession in the Kashmir Himalaya, India, from 1980 to 2018  ap. 597.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study, first of its kind in the Kashmir Valley, uses a time series of satellite data (1980–2018) to determine the glacier health, which is critical for sustaining the perenniality of the rivers originating from the area. The role of topography, morphology and climate on the observed glacier recession was investigated. In total, 147 glaciers were mapped from 1980 image; ~ 72% of the glaciers have area ≤ 3 km² and a majority of them (123) are having size < 1 km². The glaciers have reduced from 101.73 ± 16.79 km² in 1980 to 72.41 ± 4.7 km² in 2018 showing a recession of 29.32 ± 12.09 km² during the period (28.82%). The observed glacier loss is higher (0.77 ± 0.31 km² a⁻¹) compared with the other Himalayan regions. The results indicated that there is strong influence of altitude, aspect, slope and climate on glacier recession. The glaciers with area ≤ 1 km² have receded significantly more (41.20 ± 6.20%) than the larger glaciers > 3 km² in area (15.97 ± 5.13%). The glaciers situated between 4200 and 4400 m altitudes have receded more (~ 55 ± 5.01%) than those situated at altitudes > 4800 m (~ 19 ± 6.9%). Furthermore, the glaciers with steep slope (> 25) have witnessed lower recession (0.25 ± 0.15 km² a⁻¹) compared to the glaciers with gentle slope (0.51 ± 0.22 km² a⁻¹). The south-facing glaciers showed higher recession (~ 38%) compared with the north-facing glaciers (~ 27%). The findings suggest that the increase in temperature and decline in winter solid precipitation have resulted in the glacier recession with the consequent depletion of the streamflows, which, if continued in the future, would adversely affect the economy in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3adecline 3aglaciers 3aremote sensing 3astream flow 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aFayaz, Midhat1 aMeraj, Gowhar1 aBahuguna, I.

This study addressed effects of intercropping loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) for wood and bioenergy production on soil C storage in coastal North Carolina, USA. Spaces between rows of bedded pine were intercropped with switchgrass or contained native vegetative regrowth after site preparation. Two years after switchgrass establishment, soils were collected from beds and interbeds of each treatment, and C concentration and δC were measured in bulk soils and aggregate fractions. Soil C concentration, soil C density (Mg ha), and aggregate-associated C were lower in pine beds adjacent to switchgrass compared with pines adjacent to native regrowth. In the greater than 2,000-μm aggregate size class, 11% of C was derived from new pine inputs in beds of the pine-switchgrass treatment compared to the pine-native treatment. These results indicate that increased belowground C flow in pine beds adjacent to switchgrass may be driving breakdown soil C. In the pine-switchgrass intercropping treatment, a greater percentage of aggregates (by weight and C content) was found in the 2,000- to 250-μm size class of both beds and interbeds, suggesting that this aggregate size class is sensitive to management. This study provides a baseline analysis of C storage under different management scenarios in pine forests and for investigating long-term (10+ years) impacts. Although presence of switchgrass reduced soil C over the short term, bioenergy intercropping may still be pragmatic from an economical and land-use diversification view point.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aPinus taeda 3abioenergy 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aconiferous forests 3aintercropping 3aland use 3aregrowth 3asite preparation 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3awood 3aNorth Carolina1 aLeggett, Zakiya H.1 aSucre, Eric B.1 aFox, Thomas R.1 aStrahm, Brian D.0 tSoil science.g2017 July, v. 182, no. 7 p.233-240dWolters Kluwer HealthwJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.00000000000002153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245007100172520128900243592002801532650002201560650002001582650000901602650001101611650001501622650001101637650001901648651001201667653001801679653002501697653001201722653002901734653001201763653000901775700002401784700001601808700002101824773011501845856008801960852000902048655001202057IND60716076620221118165355.0220103e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071607662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.1051952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouslama, Zied10aSpatio-temporal evolution of canine rabies in Tunisia, 2011–2016  aTunisia is an endemic country for dog mediated rabies. An increase in canine rabies cases during the last decade has been suspected. Since no studies have been conducted on rabies spatial distribution, the present work was focused on spatiotemporal evolution of rabies in Tunisia during the 2011–2016 period with a special focus on the reservoir species. Data collected concerned suspected dogs that originate from the whole country. Surveillance indicators such as positive fractions and number of suspected dogs received at the laboratory have been calculated. Spatiotemporal hotspots were then mapped, spatial and spatio-temporal analysis were carried out using discrete Poisson spatial model and space-time permutation models available in SaTScan9 software. The study revealed that an actual increase in canine rabies incidence occurred in Tunisia since 2012. Spatial and spatio-temporal analysis identified clusters centered in the North and in the Center East of the country. Spatio-temporal clusters were non overlapping, indicating that this spatial distribution is not fixed through time. A large heterogeneity in surveillance indicators such as number of suspected dogs was associated to the distance to the laboratory or to insufficient coordination between governorates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adogs 3amodels 3amonitoring 3arabies 3aspace and time 3aTunisia 0aCanine rabies 0aSpatial epidemiology 0aTunisia 0aSpatio-temporal analysis 0aSaTScan 0aDogs1 aBelkhiria, Jaber A.1 aTurki, Imed1 aKharmachi, Habib0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2020 Dec., v. 185 p.105195-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.1051953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010100166500001900267520182300286592002802109650002502137650001502162650001602177650002002193650001702213650002102230650001102251650001502262650001202277653003502289653001602324653002902340700001402369700001802383700001702401700002102418700001902439700001902458700001802477700001802495700005702513773010602570856008602676852000902762655001202771IND60697073320221118052657.0200601e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069707332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1106182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Wei10aYttrium vanadates based ratiometric fluorescence probe for alkaline phosphatase activity sensing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an important biomarker for diagnosis, and the abnormal level of serum ALP is closely related to a variety of diseases. In present work, a ratiometric fluorescence probe based on hybrid nanoparticles CDs@YVO₄: Dy³⁺ nanoparticle is introduced for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity determination. The CDs@YVO₄: Dy³⁺ probe is constructed by the carbon dots (CDs) and YVO₄: Dy³⁺ through a simple mixing method, in which the blue emission of CDs at 405 nm acts as the calibrated signal, the green emission of YVO₄: Dy³⁺ at 574 nm decreased with the increasing targets ALP, and used as the output signal. In addition, the Cu²⁺ and pyrophosphate (PPi) were also employed in this strategy to utilize the excellent fluorescnece quenching efficiency of Cu²⁺ to the Dy³⁺ ions emission of CDs@YVO₄: Dy³⁺, as well as the strong affinity of PPi for Cu²⁺. In the presence of analyts ALP, ALP catalyzes the hydrolysis of PPi, causing the release of Cu²⁺, resulting in the Dy³⁺ ions emission quenched, while the CDs emission at 405 nm retained unchanged, based on this, we designed the off-on-off ratiometric fluorescence platform for ALP sensing. The experiment result shows that the ratio of F₅₇₄/F₄₀₅ is linear to the concentration of ALP in arange of 0.05∼3000 U/L with a detection limit of 0.04 U/L, which is comparable or better than those reported fluorescence probe, especially the calibrated signal introduction of CDs can eliminate the background interference, improve the accuracy of proposed probe greatly. Furthermore, the discrimination of ALP enzyme inhibitor with the IC₅₀ of 26 μM, and ALP concentration in real human serum sample has also demonstrated the applicability of CDs@YVO₄: Dy³⁺ fluorescence sensor well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ayttrium 0aRatiometric fluorescence probe 0aCarbon dots 0aLanthanide orthovanadate1 aLiu, Fang1 aYan, Gen-Ping1 aShi, Wei-Guo1 aPeng, Kang-liang1 aYang, Xue-qing1 aLi, Xiao Jing,1 aYu, Hou-chuan1 aShi, Zhi-ying1 aZeng, Hui-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7945-69880 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 185 p.110618-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.1106183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04509naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245014500168300002000313520250600333592002802839650001902867650002602886650001702912650001802929650000902947650001402956650001502970650002602985650002103011650002003032650001903052650001103071650001603082650003203098650001703130650001903147650001303166650001703179650002203196650001503218650001903233650001103252650001703263650001403280650001403294650001403308650001703322650001103339650001303350653001103363653001303374653002103387653001503408700002003423700001903443700001903462700002003481700002303501700002103524700002103545773015703566856007903723852000903802655001203811IND60615939720221118083743.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061593972DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-148602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerakhshani, Hooman10aInvited review: Microbiota of the bovine udder: Contributing factors and potential implications for udder health and mastitis susceptibility  ap. 10605-10625.  aVarious body sites of vertebrates provide stable and nutrient-rich ecosystems for a diverse range of commensal, opportunistic, and pathogenic microorganisms to thrive. The collective genomes of these microbial symbionts (the microbiome) provide host animals with several advantages, including metabolism of indigestible carbohydrates, biosynthesis of vitamins, and modulation of innate and adaptive immune systems. In the context of the bovine udder, however, the relationship between cow and microbes has been traditionally viewed strictly from the perspective of host-pathogen interactions, with intramammary infections by mastitis pathogens triggering inflammatory responses (i.e., mastitis) that are often detrimental to mammary tissues and cow physiology. This traditional view has been challenged by recent metagenomic studies indicating that mammary secretions of clinically healthy quarters can harbor genomic markers of diverse bacterial groups, the vast majority of which have not been associated with mastitis. These observations have given rise to the concept of “commensal mammary microbiota,” the ecological properties of which can have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of mastitis and offer opportunities for development of novel prophylactic or therapeutic products (or both) as alternatives to antimicrobials. Studies conducted to date have suggested that an optimum diversity of mammary microbiota is associated with immune homeostasis, whereas the microbiota of mastitic quarters, or those with a history of mastitis, are considerably less diverse. Whether disruption of the diversity of udder microbiota (dysbiosis) has a role in determining mastitis susceptibility remains unknown. Moreover, little is known about contributions of various biotic and abiotic factors in shaping overall diversity of udder microbiota. This review summarizes current understanding of the microbiota within various niches of the udder and highlights the need to view the microbiota of the teat apex, teat canal, and mammary secretions as interconnected niches of a highly dynamic microbial ecosystem. In addition, host-associated factors, including physiological and anatomical parameters, as well as genetic traits that may affect the udder microbiota are briefly discussed. Finally, current understanding of the effect of antimicrobials on the composition of intramammary microbiota is discussed, highlighting the resilience of udder microbiota to exogenous perturbants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal tissues 3aanti-infective agents 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrates 3acows 3adysbiosis 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aepithelial cells 3agenetic markers 3agenetic traits 3agenome 3ahomeostasis 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ainflammation 3amammary glands 3amastitis 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial ecology 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3aniches 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3asecretion 3asymbionts 3atherapeutics 3audders 3avitamins 0abovine 0amastitis 0audder microbiota 0ateat canal1 aFehr, Kelsey B.1 aSepehri, Shadi1 aFrancoz, David1 aDe Buck, Jeroen1 aBarkema, Herman W.1 aPlaizier, Jan C.1 aKhafipour, Ehsan0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Dec., v. 101, no. 12 p.10605-10625dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-148603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245011900168300001600287520119300303592002801496650002401524650001101548650001601559650001701575650001501592650001401607650001101621650001301632650001501645650002201660650002201682650001201704650003301716650002101749651001501770653002401785653001501809653002801824653003301852653002401885653002101909700002401930773011801954856007802072852000902150655001202159IND60515877520221118185508.0160321e20140224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587752DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-03312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecknell, Justin M.10aStand age and soils as drivers of plant functional traits and aboveground biomass in secondary tropical dry forest  ap. 604-613.  aThe distribution of tropical forest biomass across the landscape is poorly understood, particularly in increasingly common secondary tropical forests. We studied the landscape-scale distribution of edaphic properties, plant community characteristics, and aboveground biomass (AGB) in secondary tropical dry forests in northwest Costa Rica. We used structural equation modeling to examine conceptual models of relationships among these factors, with data from 84 0.1 ha plots. Stand age and soils explained 33%–60% of the variation in community-weighted mean values of foliar traits including specific leaf area, foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, and δ¹³C. Aboveground biomass ranged from 1.7 to 409 Mg·ha⁻¹ among plots between 5 and >100 years old. Stand age alone explained 46% of the variation in AGB among plots, while a model including age, soil pH, traits, and forest type explained 58%. Stand age was the most important variable explaining the distribution of AGB and community characteristics in secondary forests. We speculate that plot size, landscape heterogeneity, disturbance history, and stand dynamics contribute to the unexplained variation in AGB across the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3adry forests 3aforest types 3alandscapes 3aleaf area 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3asecondary forests 3asoil pH 3astructural equation modeling 3atropical forests 3aCosta Rica 0aaboveground biomass 0asuccession 0aplant functional traits 0astructural equation modeling 0atropical dry forest 0asecondary forest1 aPowers, Jennifer S.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2014 Feb. 24, v. 44, no. 6 p.604-613dNRC Research Pressx1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-03313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245010900196300001800305500001100323520133500334592002801669596005701697596008601754650002501840650001801865650002201883650001101905650001001916650002901926650002901955650002201984650001502006650001302021650001302034700002602047700006302073700006402136773011802200856007502318852000902393655001202402IND60789280720221116160507.0220819e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078928072DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.160452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Mengqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6246-338310aDeveloping the right tools for the job: Lin28 regulation of early life T‐cell development and function  ap. 4416-4429.  aREVIEW  aT cells comprise a functionally heterogeneous cell population that has important roles in the immune system. While T cells are broadly considered to be a component of the antigen‐specific adaptive immune response, certain T‐cell subsets display innate‐like effector characteristics whereas others perform immunosuppressive functions. These functionally diverse T‐cell populations preferentially arise at different stages of ontogeny and are tailored to the immunological priorities of the organism over time. Many differences in early life versus adult T‐cell phenotypes can be attributed to the cell‐intrinsic properties of the distinct progenitors that seed the thymus throughout development. It is becoming clear that Lin28, an evolutionarily conserved, heterochronic RNA‐binding protein that is differentially expressed among early life and adult hematopoietic progenitor cells, plays a substantial role in influencing early T‐cell development and function. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which Lin28 shapes the T‐cell landscape to protect the developing fetus and newborn. Manipulation of the Lin28 gene regulatory network is being considered as one means of improving hematopoietic stem cell transplant outcomes; as such, understanding the impact of Lin28 on T‐cell function is of clinical relevance.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJT‐168862cCanadian Institutes of Health Research  aRGPIN‐2019‐05053cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3aadults 3afetus 3agene regulatory networks 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3aimmunosuppression 3alandscapes 3aneonates 3aontogeny1 aMallet Gauthier, Ève1 aFournier, Marilaine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5418-69501 aMelichar, Heather J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0951-334X0 tFEBS journal.g2022 Aug., v. 289, no. 15 p.4416-4429dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.160453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012100206300001800327500001400345520105000359592002801409650001301437650001201450650002001462650001201482650001601494650001101510650001001521650001901531650002201550650001101572650001401583650003301597650001601630650001301646700005601659773014501715856008201860852000901942655001201951IND60708401820221122043413.0200825e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070840182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-019-00475-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Veysel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5147-504710aImpact of knowledge, concern and awareness about global warming and global climatic change on environmental behavior  ap. 6245-6260.  aNAL-light  aGlobal warming refers to the increase in average temperatures as a result of natural phenomena and the greenhouse effect caused by gases released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities, while global climatic change refers to the climatic change that results from global warming.

The purpose of the study investigated the level of knowledge, concern and awareness about global warming and global climatic change (GWCC) effect on environmental behavior. For this purpose, a “structural equation modeling (SEM)” is proposed for the intercorrelations between the four latent variables.

Samples originated from 193 dairy and beef farms in 29 provinces distributed throughout Spain, and were tested for the occurrence of three target enteric pathogens by reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR): bovine rotavirus A (RVA), Cryptosporidium parvum and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing analysis were used to determine the G (VP7 gene) and P (VP4 gene) genotypes of 26 specimens positive for RVA. A total of 188 specimens (79.3 %) were positive for at least one of the three target enteric pathogens, and 101 samples (42.6 %) harbored mixed infections. The individual prevalence was 57.8 %, 50.6 % and 23.6 % for C. parvum, RVA and BCoV, respectively. Molecular analysis of selected RVA strains revealed the presence of the G6, G10, G3, P[5] and P[11] genotypes, with the combinations G6P[5] and G6P[11] being the most prevalent. Alignments of nucleotide sequences of the VP7 and VP4 markers showed a high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with up to 294 SNPs found in 869bp of sequence at the G6 genotype (0.338 SNPs/nt), which reveals the extensive genetic diversity of RVA strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene of the G6 strains revealed four distinct lineages, with most strains clustering in the G6-IV lineage. The discrepancies between the RVA genotypes circulating in the sampled cattle farms and the genotypes contained in commercial vaccines currently available in Spain are discussed. We believe that this is the first study on the molecular characterization of rotavirus infecting cattle in Spain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aRotavirus A 3aanimal viruses 3acalves 3adiarrhea 3aenteropathogens 3afarms 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3alivestock and meat industry 3amixed infection 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription (genetics) 3avaccines 3aSpain 0aSpecies A rotavirus 0aCryptosporidium parvum 0aCoronavirus 0aCattle 0aOccurrence 0aGenetic diversity 0aSpain1 aMonteagudo, Luis V.1 aArnal, José L.1 aBaselga, Cristina1 aQuílez, Joaquín0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2020 Dec., v. 185 p.105196-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.1051963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017700164300001600341520136200357592002801719650001701747650002201764650001201786650000901798650001901807650001301826650001101839650001401850650001201864650001101876650001701887650001101904650001601915650001801931653002701949653002301976653001701999653001702016653001402033700002002047700002602067700002502093773012802118856008102246852000902327655001202336IND60540047520221119183734.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054004752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2014.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirth, Mario10aInfluence of HTST extrusion cooking process parameters on the stability of anthocyanins, procyanidins and hydroxycinnamic acids as the main bioactive chokeberry polyphenols  ap. 511-516.  aChokeberry polyphenols could be used to design functional snacks and breakfast cereals. High-temperature, short-time extrusion processing is a unique technique to design such cereal based products. However, the intense amount of thermomechanical energy, which is necessary to generate crispy structures, can lead to losses of those bioactives. In order to gather information about the retention of chokeberry polyphenols in extrusion processing, the influence of process parameters, e.g. screw speed (300 and 500 1/min), barrel temperature (100 and 140 °C) and water content (15 and 22 g/100 g, wet basis), on changes of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated using a model based on maize starch.At the range investigated, changing screw speed, water content, and barrel temperature had no significant (P < 0.05) influence on the retention of procyanidins and hydroxycinnamic acids. Higher screw speed increased the specific mechanical energy, the melt temperature and resulted in the loss of anthocyanins. The retention decreased linearly with the melt temperature. A higher retention was analysed by increased water content. The highest retention (about 60%) of cyanidin glycosides in this study was achieved at the highest water content (22 g/100 g, wb), irrespective of the barrel temperature and the screw speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3abreakfast cereals 3acooking 3acorn 3acoumaric acids 3acyanidin 3aenergy 3aextrusion 3amelting 3amodels 3aprocyanidins 3asnacks 3atemperature 3awater content 0aHTST extrusion cooking 0aAronia melanocarpa 0aAnthocyanins 0aProcyanidins 0aStability1 aPreiß, Rebecca1 aMayer-Miebach, Esther1 aSchuchmann, Heike P.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 June, v. 62, no. 1 p.511-516dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2014.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003300134024002200167024001900189040001800208100002500226245013900251506007600390506017300466520116200639596004501801506003701846650002201883650002201905650001301927650002601940650002401966650002301990650002302013650002402036650001002060650002002070650001702090650002602107650002602133650002202159650001202181650002202193650002002215650002002235650001702255700002202272773007302294856011402367856007902481956012702560961000902687852000902696655001202705IND60674320220221214230219.0180717e20180619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067432022DNAL7 a10113/67432022hdl7 a3548122aris7 a10.3390/children50600812doi7 aPMC60254262pmcid7 a299218112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallender, Chishinga10aFamily TXT: Feasibility and Acceptability of a mHealth Obesity Prevention Program for Parents of Pre-Adolescent African American Girls  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aObesity prevalence is greater in African American girls than their non-Hispanic white peers. Obesity prevention programs are needed to help parents create an obesity-preventive home environment. This paper reports the feasibility and acceptability of a mHealth child obesity prevention program consisting of self-determination theory-grounded text messages promoting a healthy home food and activity environment to parents of 8–10-year-old African American girls. A one-group design with baseline and immediate post-intervention assessments was utilized. Mothers (n=19) received 36 text messages over 12 weeks. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed through staff logs and post-intervention surveys and an interview. Feasibility and acceptability criteria were met. Mothers reported positive reactions to the intervention; they liked the program, used the information, and all but one gave it an A or B grade. The majority made changes and shared the text messages with others. This research provides evidence that a theoretically grounded mHealth child obesity prevention intervention is feasible and acceptable to parents of African American girls.  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acommunication (human) 3aconsumer acceptance 3adisease prevalence 3adisease prevention 3afeasibility studies 3agirls 3ahealth programs 3ahealthy diet 3ahealthy eating habits 3ahome food preparation 3amobile telephones 3amothers 3aphysical activity 3aself-perception 3asocial networks 3atelemedicine1 aThompson, Deborah0 tChildren.g2018 June 19, v. 5, no. 6wJournal:27223x2227-90677nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67432023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/children50600813Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Callender%20et%20al_Children%202018_Family%20TXT.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009600156300002000252520108400272592002801356650001801384650001601402650001901418650001101437650002201448650003101470650001001501650002901511650001301540650001101553650002101564650001001585650002001595700001701615700002301632700001801655700001901673700001301692700001701705700001501722700001701737700001701754773014401771856007401915852000901989655001201998IND60641837120221119074141.0190506e20160823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064183712DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta05001h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Weiwei10aHigh performance bio-based elastomers: energy efficient and sustainable materials for tires  ap. 13058-13062.  aGlobally, we are faced with a massive growth in the number of urban vehicles. This growth comes at the cost of enormous fuel consumption, CO₂ emissions and air pollution, commonly seen as a haze. With a strategy to fabricate low roll-resistance green tire elastomers from large-scale, bio-based chemicals, specifically itaconic acid, mono-alcohols and conjugated dienes, each of these problems can be reduced. By combining a molecular structural design with non-petroleum based silica and an in situ process to tune the viscoelastic properties of the elastomer composites, we have successfully manufactured silica/poly(di-n-butyl itaconate-co-butadiene) nanocomposite-based green tires that have very low roll-resistance, excellent wet skid resistance and good wear resistance, promote fuel efficiency and reduce our dependence on petrochemical resources. The results shown here open an important avenue for the synthetic rubber and automobile industry to ameliorate a major problem facing many cities worldwide, and also provide an effective route for resource sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aautomobiles 3acarbon dioxide 3acities 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3asilica 3asynthetic rubber 3atires 3aviscoelasticity1 aZhou, Xinxin1 aRussell, Thomas P.1 aHua, Kuo-chih1 aYang, Xiaoping1 aQiao, He1 aWang, Wencai1 aLi, Fanzhu1 aWang, Runguo1 aZhang, Liqun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Aug. 23, v. 4, no. 34 p.13058-13062dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta05001h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012800161300001600289520166000305592002801965650001501993650001702008650001102025650001102036650001502047650001202062650001902074650001102093650001902104650000902123650001002132650001202142650001502154650002502169650001402194650001002208650000902218650001002227650001502237650000902252651002102261653000902282653001502291653000902306653001502315653001202330653001702342653002902359700002302388700002102411700001902432700002502451773011702476856007802593852000902671655001202680IND60515877720221118185724.0160321e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587772DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-03802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGyug, Les W.10aDietary dependence of Williamson’s Sapsucker nestlings on ants associated with dead and decaying wood in British Columbia  ap. 628-637.  aWilliamson’s Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus thyroideus (Cassin, 1852)) breeds primarily in managed forests in Canada. Its status as endangered will require reliable information to develop habitat management guidelines. Adults provision nestlings with ants gleaned from tree trunks, so we estimated the preferred nestling diet by comparing nestling fecal sac composition with the ant fauna collected in tree trunk traps. For ants, we determined nest densities and substrates by counts along transects within sapsucker nest areas. Ants made up 98% of >10 000 arthropods identified in Williamson’s Sapsucker fecal sacs. Of 11 ant taxa available, Williamson’s Sapsucker consumed six, of which two large-bodied ant taxa, carpenter ants of Camponotus subgenus Camponotus and ants of the Formica rufa species group, were preferred. Together these two taxa averaged 80% of the nestling diet by biomass and formed >48% of the nestling diet at every nest examined (n = 89). Preference varied regionally: west of the Okanagan Valley, only the two large-bodied ant taxa already mentioned were preferred, in the Okanagan–Boundary and East Kootenay regions, smaller bodied ants of the genus Lasius were also preferred, although these comprised ≤5% of the nestling diet by biomass. Camponotus (Camponotus) spp. nests were 3.3 times more common in wood than soil, and the F.rufa species group were entirely dependent on dead or decaying wood for nest substrate. Given the dependence of Williamson’s Sapsucker on these ants, retention and recruitment of dead and decaying wood should be considered a management priority for Williamson’s Sapsucker breeding habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamponotus 3aFormica rufa 3aLasius 3aadults 3aarthropods 3abiomass 3abreeding sites 3abreeds 3acarpenter ants 3adiet 3afauna 3aforests 3aguidelines 3ahabitat conservation 3anestlings 3anests 3asoil 3atraps 3atree trunk 3awood 3aBritish Columbia 0aants 0aCamponotus 0adiet 0aFormicidae 0aFormica 0amyrmecophagy 0aWilliamson’s Sapsucker1 aHiggins, Robert J.1 aTodd, Melissa A.1 aMeggs, Jeff M.1 aLindgren, B.

Although protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is required for T‐cell development and function, the role of PPP2CB, which is the catalytic subunit β isoform of PP2A, remains unknown. In the present study, using a T cell‐specific knockout mouse of PPP2CB (PPP2CBᶠˡ/ᶠˡ Lck‐Cre⁺), we demonstrated that PPP2CB was dispensable for T‐cell development in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs. Furthermore, PPP2CB deletion did not affect T‐cell receptor (TCR)‐induced T‐cell activation or cytokine‐induced T‐cell responses; however, it specifically enhanced phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin‐induced T‐cell activation with increased cellular proliferation, elevated CD69 and CD25 expression, and enhanced cytokine production (inteferon‐γ, interleukin‐2 and tumor necrosis factor). Mechanistic analyses suggested that the PPP2CB deletion enhanced activation of the phosphoinositide 3‐kinase/Akt signaling pathway and Ca²⁺ flux following stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin. Moreover, the specific PI3K inhibitor rescued the augmented cell activation in PPP2CB‐deficient T cells. Using mass spectrometry‐based phospho‐peptide analysis, we identified potential substrates of PPP2CB during PMA plus ionomycin‐induced T‐cell activation. Collectively, our study provides evidence of the specific role of PPP2CB in controlling PMA plus ionomycin‐induced T‐cell activation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFA0103400cthe Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China  a81222005cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a81770108cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aSKLP‐K201802cthe National Center for Protein Sciences, China  aSKLP‐O201804cthe National Center for Protein Sciences, China 3aT-lymphocytes 3aacetates 3acalcium 3acell proliferation 3ahomeostasis 3ainterleukin-2 3aknockout mutants 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphopeptides 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aprotein subunits 3atumor necrosis factors1 aLi, Xin1 aGao, Huiying1 aZhao, Ke1 aLiu, Xian1 aLiu, Jinfang1 aWang, Qi1 aZhu, Yaxin1 aChen, Hui1 aXiang, Shensi1 aZhan, Yiqun1 aYin, Ronghua1 aYu, Miao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2963-82541 aNing, Hongmei1 aYang, Xiaoming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3629-09461 aLi, Changyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9959-16610 tFEBS journal.g2022 Aug., v. 289, no. 15 p.4518-4535dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.163703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245010300166300001600269520176500285592002802050650001702078650002402095650001402119650001902133650002002152650001202172650001402184650001202198650001802210650001102228650001502239653001802254653002202272653003502294653000902329653001902338653002502357653001302382653001702395700002302412700001702435773011702452856007802569852000902647655001202656IND60515877820221120224348.0160321e20140303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051587782DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2013-03852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade-Miguel, Sergio10aDeveloping generalized, calibratable, mixed-effects meta-models for large-scale biomass prediction  ap. 648-656.  aLarge-scale prediction of forest biomass is of interest for forest science, ecology, and issues related to climate change. Previous research has attempted to provide allometric models suitable for large-scale biomass prediction using different methods. We present a new approach for meta-analysis of existing biomass equations using mixed-effects modelling on simulated data. The resulting generalized meta-models can be calibrated for local conditions. This meta-analytical approach allows for directly benefiting from previous research to minimize data collection and properly take into account the unknown differences between different locations within large areas. The approach is demonstrated by developing pan-Mediterranean mixed-effects meta-models for Pinus brutia Ten. The fixed part of the meta-models enables sound aboveground biomass predictions throughout practically the full native range of the species. Significant improvement in the predictive performance can be further gained by using small local datasets for model calibration. The calibration procedure for location-specific biomass prediction is based on best linear unbiased predictor of random effects. The predictive performance of the meta-models under different sampling strategies is validated in an independent dataset. The results show that mixed-effects meta-models may enable accurate and robust large-scale biomass predictions. Calibration for specific locations based on minimal data collection effort performs better than fitting location-specific equations based on much larger samples. The advantages of mixed-effects meta-models are of interest not only for further biomass-related research and applications, but also for other modelling disciplines within forest science.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus brutia 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aecology 3aequations 3aforests 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aprediction 0ameta-analysis 0amodel calibration 0abest linear unbiased predictor 0aBLUP 0arandom effects 0aallometric equations 0asampling 0aPinus brutia1 aMehtätalo, Lauri,1 aDurkaya, Ali0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2014 Mar. 3, v. 44, no. 6 p.648-656dNRC Research Pressx1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2013-03853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245012300187300001600310500001500326520105400341592002801395650000901423650001501432650002901447650001601476650001301492650001801505650001201523650002001535650001601555650001001571650001101581650001401592650001201606650009701618650007601715650007601791650008801867650001101955650002601966653001901992653001502011653002402026653001002050653001002060653001902070653001202089700001602101700002602117773011902143856008502262852000902347655001202356IND50071217220221119072900.0190403e20131129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007121722DNAL7 a238906722pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Guanggang10aEquine herpesviruses type 1 (EHV-1) and 4 (EHV-4)—Masters of co-evolution and a constant threat to equids and beyond  ap. 123-134.  a2019-12-06  aThe equine herpesviruses type 1 (EHV-1) and 4 (EHV-4) are ubiquitous pathogens that affect horse populations on all continents. Despite widespread vaccination, EHV-1 and EHV-4 infections remain a permanent risk. While the two viruses share a high degree of genetic and antigenic similarity, they differ significantly in host range and pathogenicity. Compared to EHV-4, which mainly infects horses and causes respiratory disease, EHV-1 has a broader host range and can result in respiratory disease, abortions, neonatal death, and equine herpesvirusmyeloencephalopathy (EHM). Recent studies have elucidated a number of mechanisms that may, at least partly, explain the differential pathogenic potential of the two viruses. While both EHV-1 and EHV-4 can escape host immune responses and establish latent infection, there are differences with respect to virus entry and their ability to interfere with the innate immune response. Understanding the virus’ repertoire of immunomodulatory mechanisms may lead the way to develop more efficient vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3ahost range 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3acoevolution 3avaccines 3apathogenicity 3aviruses 3aimmune response 3avaccination 3adeath 3ahorses 3apathogens 2aAnimals 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsximmunologyxpathologyxprevention & controlxveterinaryxvirology. 2aHerpesvirus 1, Equidxclassificationxgeneticsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aHerpesvirus 4, Equidxclassificationxgeneticsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aHorse Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxpathologyxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aHorses 2aVirus Internalization 0aImmune evasion 0aHost range 0aEquid herpesvirus 1 0aEHV-1 0aEHV-4 0aEntry Receptor 0aVaccine1 aAzab, Walid1 aOsterrieder, Nikolaus0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 Nov. 29, v. 167, no. 1-2 p.123-134dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003200139245011600171300001800287500002000305520160900325592002801934596005501962596005402017650002602071650002602097650002702123650001302150650002302163650002602186650001802212650001702230650001702247650001602264650001802280650001102298650001102309650001502320650001502335650001302350650003102363650001202394650001402406650001602420700003102436700002802467700003302495700003302528700001702561700002602578700007702604773012202681856007302803852000902876655001202885IND60701651420221120153945.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070165142DNAL7 a10.1111/are.146682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFimbres‐Acedo, Yenitze E.10aOreochromis niloticus aquaculture with biofloc technology, photoautotrophic conditions and Chlorella microalgae  ap. 3323-3346.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this manuscript (Part I), the zootechnical performance of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) culture during the nursery and grow‐out phases using biofloc technology (BFT) with three photoautotrophic pathway treatments (Chlorella spp., M; Chlorella sorokiniana 2,805, CS; and Chlorella sorokiniana 2,714, CV) was evaluated using high protein feed (40.6%) at a C:N ratio of 7.69:1. Two additional treatments were included as controls: a chemoautotrophic (Q) treatment with a C:N ratio of 7.69:1 and a heterotrophic (H) treatment with a C:N ratio of 13:1. Differences in growth and weight gain were observed among the photoautotrophic treatments and Q and H treatments (p < .05). An increase in nitrates in all photoautotrophic treatments suggests that a chemoautotrophic pathway naturally occurred. For O. niloticus carcasses, the protein (>50.9%) and crude lipid (>23.1%) levels were not significantly different among treatments (p > .05). For the Q treatment, the highest crude protein (42.6%) and crude lipid (1.1%) levels in biofloc were observed during the nursery phase (p < .05). Correlation analyses between the amino acid composition in O. niloticus and that of the feed highlighted deficiencies with regard to methionine, lysine and threonine content despite the high r² value obtained (.9078). In addition, deficiencies in arginine, lysine and taurine were observed in the biofloc (r² = .7265). In Part II, the physicochemical characterization of nutrient residuals and O. niloticus BFT aquaculture integration with hydroponic horticulture in non‐recirculated systems is described.  aPublisher supplied data  aJPMJSA1405cJapan International Cooperation Agency  a278223cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3aChlorella sorokiniana 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aamino acid composition 3aarginine 3abiofloc technology 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acrude protein 3afish culture 3ahorticulture 3ahydroponics 3alipid content 3alipids 3alysine 3amethionine 3amicroalgae 3anitrates 3aphysicochemical properties 3ataurine 3athreonine 3aweight gain1 aMagallón‐Servín, Paola1 aGarza‐Torres, Rodolfo1 aEmerenciano, Maurício G.

Emulsions with LCT showed higher droplet size than MCT as a consequence of its higher viscosity. All emulsions exhibited shear thinning behavior, but the viscosity was influenced by their interface composition. An occurrence of the destabilization mechanism by creaming was observed in turbidimetric measurements, but no visual phase separation could be observed, indicating a good kinetic stability after a 7-day storage. The initial interfacial tension of the water-LCT or water-MCT oil was about 25 mN/m, but the WPI addition (1% w/w) reduced the initial interfacial tension to approximately 20 mN/m. The increase of T80 concentration led to a decrease of the interfacial tension, reaching a value around 10 mN/m in systems with pure T80. The curves of interfacial tension of systems with LCT or MCT showed differences in the decay rate of tension over time. These differences were attributed to characteristics of the oil phase (hydrophobicity, unsaturation degree, presence of impurities) and the different proportions of each emulsifier within the mixture of emulsifiers. Finally, a higher viscoelastic interface was observed in LCT emulsions, which were mainly stabilized by WPI molecules. Such molecules presented a higher resistance to the displacement due to the competitive adsorption phenomenon, since the LCT is a more hydrophobic oil. On the other hand, the interface with MCT and a higher T80 concentration was less viscoelastic due to an easier displacement of WPI from the interface and the replacement by T80. The results indicate that T80 can be used in combination with WPI to produce emulsions with good stability and lower concentration of synthetic compounds. Lastly, the interfacial layer composition is not only dependent on the WPI-T80 ratio in the bulk phase, but also on the oily phase features. These results provide a potential strategy for designing emulsified foods based on the choice of ingredients and knowledge of the interaction between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acolloids 3acreaming 3adroplet size 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3afoods 3ahydrophobicity 3aingredients 3along chain triacylglycerols 3amedium chain triacylglycerols 3aoil-water interface 3apolysorbates 3arheology 3aseparation 3asunflower oil 3asurface tension 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 3awhey protein 0aEmulsion stability 0aTween 80 0aWPI 0aProtein-surfactant mixture 0aMixture of emulsifiers 0aMedium chain triacylglycerol 0aSunflower oil 0aInterface properties1 aCosta, Ana Letícia Rodrigues1 aCunha, Rosiane Lopes0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 164 p.272-280dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011000167520136500277592002801642653002701670653001901697653003101716653001701747653002501764700001701789700001901806700001601825700001901841700001801860700002001878700001701898700002301915700002701938773011101965856008502076852000902161655001202170IND60684675020221119032420.0200330e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068467502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1179822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanling10aPorous organic polymer embedded thin-film nanocomposite membranes for enhanced nanofiltration performance  aPorous organic polymers have been considered promising for the design of high performing membranes, mainly because of their superior surface area, intrinsic mesoporous structure and good polymer affinity. In this study, hierarchical o-hydroxyazo porous organic polymers (o-POPs) and piperazine (PIP) monomers were incorporated into the casting solution, followed by phase inversion to prepare PIP-containing polymeric substrates. The o-POPs modified thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes were fabricated by interfacial polymerization (IP) with trimesoyl chloride (TMC). The incorporated o-POPs could locally enrich PIP in substrates and impede its diffusion towards the organic interface during IP reaction through hydrogen bonding and physical obstruction, leading to the formation of a crumpled membrane surface. The enhancement of surface roughness and hydrophilicity endowed the TFN membranes with a signally elevated water permeance while maintaining a comparable solute rejection. The optimal TFN membrane with the o-POP content of 0.3 wt% displayed a remarkable water permeance of 29.6 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹, a high Na₂SO₄ rejection of 94.9%, and an efficient removal of reactive dyes (e.g., reactive black 5 and reactive orange 16, >98.2%), which makes o-POP functionalized TFN membranes competitive for NF applications in water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPorous organic polymer 0aNanofiltration 0aInterfacial polymerization 0aTFN membrane 0aPiperazine diffusion1 aZhu, Junyong1 aZheng, Junfeng1 aGao, Xiaoqi1 aTian, Miaomiao1 aWang, Xiaomao1 aXie, Yuefeng F.1 aZhang, Yatao1 aVolodin, Alexander1 aBruggen, Bart van der,0 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 May 01, v. 602 p.117982-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1179823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012200177300001300299520181700312592002802129650001602157650001402173650000902187650001202196650001502208650001102223650001302234650002202247650001702269650002202286650001402308650001102322650000902333650000902342650001702351650002202368650001202390650001402402651001102416700003202427700002402459700004902483700003502532700003002567773008302597856008402680852000902764655001202773IND60111896820221118050649.0141110e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011189682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Fernanda de,14aThe mosaic of habitats in the high-altitude Brazilian rupestrian fields is a hotspot for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  ap. 9-19.  aThe high diversity in rupestrian field vegetation has been attributed to the mosaic of environments formed by several soil classes, rugged relief and microclimatic variation. Although advances in the knowledge of some biological areas in rupestrian fields have been made, little is known about the relevance of soil microorganisms and their relationships with the vegetation. Symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is one of the most studied interactions between microorganisms and plants, because they are ubiquitous and contribute to the sustainability of ecosystems. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and diversity of AMF species and to evaluate their relationship with soil physicochemical attributes and plant diversity in different habitats of the rupestrian fields from the Cadeia do Espinhaço, Serra do Cipó, Brazil. These rupestrian fields were delimited into five distinct habitats: rock outcrop, quartz gravel fields, sandy bogs, peat bogs and the Cerrado. Forty-nine AMF species were identified as belonging to nine families and twelve genera. Among them, Acaulospora colossica and Pacispora dominikii were found for the first time in Brazil. The results of this study suggest that the diversity of AMF is related to the heterogeneity of habitats and that the soil texture (coarse sand, gravel and silt) is better related to the structure of these fungi communities than to the soil chemical attributes. Plant species richness was related to AMF richness only in the quartz gravel field, rocky outcrop, and sandy bog habitats. Considering these habitats constitute one of the most menaced ecosystems on the planet, our survey provides information to improve knowledge about rupestrian field biodiversity, thus supporting policy actions for its conservation and preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcaulospora 3aPacispora 3abogs 3acerrado 3aecosystems 3agravel 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3amicroclimate 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apeatlands 3aquartz 3asand 3asilt 3asoil texture 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3asymbiosis 3aBrazil1 ade Souza, Francisco Adriano1 aCarrenho, Rosilaine1 aMoreira, F.

More and more people are shopping on-line, which increases the efficiency of consumption, expands choice and information – while also intensifying exposure to consumerism and materialistic messages. This article explores the relationship between sustainable consumption and wellbeing and the role of on-line shopping in moderating the relationship, analysing survey data from a representative sample of the Norwegian population in 2017. Wellbeing is addressed in its hedonic (happiness), cognitive (satisfaction) and eudaimonic dimensions (subjective vitality). Sustainable consumption practices are investigated through a variable that captures the extent to which respondents choose sustainable alternatives as regards travel, household energy use and food. Results based on regression analysis of cross-sectional data indicate that sustainable consumption is positively associated with happiness and life satisfaction in Norway, but that the relationship weakens when psychological and lifestyle factors are taken into account. Subjective vitality maintains its strong association with sustainable consumption. Two alternative explanations are proposed: that those who feel energetic engage more in sustainable practices; and that the effort and socialization inherent in sharing, reusing and reducing promote the conditions for increased psychological health and vitality. The study also shows that internet shopping does not weaken the strength of the relationship, and might even increase life satisfaction by lowering the costs of engaging in sustainable consumption practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acognition 3aconsumer behavior 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afood consumption 3alifestyle 3apeople 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3atravel 3aNorway 0aSustainable consumption 0aWellbeing 0aHappiness 0aOn-line shopping0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 229 p.1112-1124dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007900169300002000248520122900268592002801497650000801525650001801533650001601551650001401567650001901581650002001600650002001620650001701640650001401657650002601671650001701697650002201714650001601736650001601752650003101768700001801799700001701817700002001834773014901854856008102003852000902084655001202093IND60441803920221120051925.0151106e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044180392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4762-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSofuoglu, Sait C.10aIndoor air quality in a restaurant kitchen using margarine for deep-frying  ap. 15703-15711.  aIndoor air quality has a great impact on human health. Cooking, in particular frying, is one of the most important sources of indoor air pollution. Indoor air CO, CO₂, particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations, including aldehydes, were measured in the kitchen of a small establishment where a special deep-frying margarine was used. The objective was to assess occupational exposure concentrations for cooks of such restaurants. While individual VOC and PM₂.₅ concentrations were measured before, during, and after frying events using active sampling, TVOC, PM₁₀, CO, CO₂, temperature, and relative humidity were continuously monitored through the whole period. VOC and aldehyde concentrations did not increase to considerable levels with deep-frying compared to the background and public indoor environment levels, whereas PM₁₀ increased significantly (1.85 to 6.6 folds). The average PM₂.₅ concentration of the whole period ranged between 76 and 249 μg/m³. Hence, considerable PM exposures could occur during deep-frying with the special margarine, which might be sufficiently high to cause health effects on cooks considering their chronic occupational exposures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aaldehydes 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3adeep fat frying 3ahuman health 3amargarine 3aoccupational exposure 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3arestaurants 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds1 aToprak, Melis1 aInal, Fikret1 aCimrin, Arif H.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Oct., v. 22, no. 20 p.15703-15711dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4762-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006700152245006300219300001400282520115900296592002801455650001801483650002201501650002301523650001201546650001001558650001301568650001801581650001401599650001001613650001301623650001401636650001001650650002201660650001201682650003001694650001801724650001501742650001501757650001601772650001201788650001801800650001101818650001101829653001601840653002001856653001801876653002001894653001701914653001101931700002301942773010901965856008702074852000902161655001202170IND60539842220221118060707.0190318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053984222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtálora-Luna, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5313-218410aAmines from vertebrates guide triatomine bugs to resources  ap. 52-60.  aMost triatomine bugs (Heteroptera: Reduviidae) are nest-living insects that require vertebrate blood or invertebrate haemolymph to complete their life cycle. Vertebrates accumulate excretory products in or near their nesting sites and we hypothesize that triatomines use emanations from such host wastes when searching for resources. Here we recount how triatomine bugs increase upwind locomotion on a servosphere in response to volatile amine constituents of vertebrate excretions. Fresh chicken faeces is strongly attractive to Rhodnius prolixus nymphs. Ammonia induces attraction and an increase in both speed and total path length by R. prolixus on the servosphere. Whereas ethylamine and dimethylamine attract R. prolixus, Triatoma infestans and Panstrongylus geniculatus, other amine constituents of vertebrate excretions such as isobutylamine and hexylamine induce R. prolixus nymphs to walk faster and for a longer period. These amines are derived from generally occurring metabolites of vertebrates and from gut flora metabolism. We conclude that amines and other products associated with nesting hosts serve as signals for foraging triatomines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanstrongylus 3aRhodnius prolixus 3aTriatoma infestans 3aammonia 3ablood 3achickens 3adimethylamine 3aexcretion 3afeces 3aforaging 3ahemolymph 3ahosts 3ainsect physiology 3ainsects 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ainvertebrates 3alocomotion 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anymphs 3awastes 0aTriatominae 0aTriatomine bugs 0aInsect vector 0aSensory ecology 0aHost finding 0aAmines1 aGuerin, Patrick M.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2014 Dec., v. 71 p.52-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015100170300001800321520178200339592002802121650001102149650002202160650002202182650004402204650001902248650002102267650001402288650001402302650001902316650002302335650003802358650001302396650004402409650001302453650002102466650002402487653002202511653001802533653001402551653001902565700001702584700002202601773011002623856008602733852000902819655001202828IND60529446720221121113108.0210708e20161020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052944672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.06.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Nemr, Ahmed10aTesting zinc chloride as a new catalyst for direct synthesis of cellulose di- and tri-acetate in a solvent free system under microwave irradiation  ap. 1058-1067.  aThis research demonstrates the effect of ZnCl₂ as a catalyst on the esterification of commercial cotton cellulose using acetic anhydride in order to obtain di- and tri-cellulose acetates under microwave irradiation. It was discovered that microwave irradiation significantly increased the yield and reduced the reaction time. It was found that the maximum yield for cellulose triacetates was 95.83% under the reaction conditions that were as follows: 3min reaction time, 200mg of ZnCl₂ catalyst and 20ml of Ac₂O for 5g cellulose. However, the cellulose acetate obtained in this manner had the highest DS (2.87). The cellulose di-acetate was produced with the maximum yield of 89.97% and with the highest DS (2.69) using 25ml Ac₂O, 200mg of ZnCl₂ for 5g cellulose and in 3min reaction time. The effect of some factors such as the amount of used catalyst, the quantity of acetic acid anhydride and the reaction time of the esterification process have been investigated. The production of di- and tri-cellulose acetate and the degree of substitution were confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The thermal stability was investigated using thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular weight and the degree of polymerization were obtained using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of di- and tri-cellulose acetate without degradation during the reaction; these results were found to be in contrast to some recent studies. The present study reveals that ZnCl₂ is a new catalyst; it is effective as well as inexpensive and is a low toxicity catalyst for usage in cellulose esterification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3athermal stability 3acellulose acetate 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3aacetic anhydride 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3aesterification 3agel chromatography 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3asolvents 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3atoxicity 3amolecular weight 3amicrowave radiation 0aCellulose acetate 0aZinc chloride 0aMicrowave 0aEsterification1 aRagab, Safaa1 aEl Sikaily, Amany0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Oct. 20, v. 151 p.1058-1067dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.06.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04064naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245013700214520242400351592002802775650002802803650002602831650001402857650001302871650001702884650000902901650001002910650001302920650001502933650001502948650000902963650002402972650000902996650002303005650001403028650001403042650001203056650001703068651001003085653001203095653002403107653002903131653002803160653002003188653001103208653001303219700002203232700001803254700001903272700002303291773008803314856008703402852000903489655001203498IND60793240820221122154219.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079324082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2022.1026392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Jay Prakash1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0238-763810aPrevalence, molecular characterization, and antimicrobial resistance profile of Clostridium perfringens from India: A scoping review  aClostridium perfringens is one of the most important foodborne pathogens that causes histotoxic diseases and intestinal infections in both humans and animals. The present scoping review has been designed to analyze the literature published during 2000–2021 from India on the prevalence, molecular characterization, and antimicrobial resistance profile of C. perfringens isolates recovered from humans, animals, animal-based foods, and associated environmental samples. The peer-reviewed articles retrieved from four electronic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science) were assessed using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A total of 32 studies from India were selected on the basis of their relevance and inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of C. perfringens among domestic animals having history of clinical symptoms and among healthy animals was found to be 65.8% (508/772) and 42.8% (493/1152), respectively. The pathogen was also detected in clinically affected wild animals (75%), healthy wild animals (35.4%), and captive birds (24.5%). The detection of C. perfringens among poultry having necrotic enteritis and among healthy birds was found to be 66.8% (321/480) and 25.6% (80/312), respectively. The detection of pathogen among animal-based foods (i.e., meat, milk, and fish and their products) and environmental samples depicted a prevalence of 20.8% (325/1562) and 30.2% (23/76), respectively. However, the prevalence of C. perfringens among humans having history of diarrhea and among healthy humans was found to be 25% (70/280) and 23.2% (36/155), respectively. The genotyping of C. perfringens isolates revealed that toxin type A was found to be the most prevalent genotype. Along with the alpha toxin gene (cpa), beta (cpb), epsilon (etx), iota (itx), enterotoxin (cpe), beta-2 toxin (cpb2), and NetB (netB) toxins were also detected in different combinations. Antimicrobial resistance profile of C. perfringens isolates recovered from different sources demonstrated that the highest resistance was detected against sulphonamides (76.8%) and tetracycline (41.3%) by phenotypic and genotypic detection methods, respectively. Comprehensive scientific studies covering different geographical areas at the human-animal-environment interface are crucial to generalize the real magnitude of C. perfringens-associated problem in India and for establishing a reliable database.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aantibiotic resistance 3adatabases 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxins 3afish 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aintestines 3ameat 3amicrobial detection 3amilk 3anecrotic enteritis 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3apoultry 3atetracycline 3aIndia 0aAnimals 0aAnimals-based foods 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aClostridium perfringens 0aGastroenteritis 0aHumans 0aWildlife1 aKaur, Simranpreet1 aDhaka, Pankaj1 aVijay, Deepthi1 aBedi, Jasbir Singh0 tAnaerobe.g2022 Oct., v. 77 p.102639-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2022.1026393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245015300167300001600320520208100336592002802417650000802445650002202453650002102475650001502496650001602511650001302527650002002540650001302560650001702573650001302590650001302603650001702616650002802633650001002661650001902671650001802690650002502708650001302733650001502746650001502761650001902776650001302795650001602808653001502824653002502839653002202864653001802886653001802904700001802922700001902940700005902959773010603018856008703124852000903211655001203220IND60626007520221120205740.0190213e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062600752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Jia-Yu10aPhotodegradable coumarin-derived amphiphilic dendrons for DNA binding: Self-assembly and phototriggered disassembly in water and air-water interface  ap. 428-435.  aIn this article, we demonstrate the self-assembly and photoresponive behavior of a novel coumarin-based amphiphilic dendron in both aqueous solution and air-water interface. The dendritic structure, namely C-IG1, was composed of a lipophilic cholesterol and hydrophilic poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendron, and the amphiphilic counterpart is interconnected by a photolabile coumarin carbonate ester, enabling the photoinduced degradation of the amphiphiles in protic solvents via SN1-like mechanism. A Nile red solubilization fluorescence assay suggests a low critical aggregation concentration for the micelle formation of C-IG1 in aqueous solutions (3.9 × 10−5 M); the Langmuir analysis further indicates that C-IG1 possesses significant compressibility in air-water interface, eventually forming homogeneous monolayers with a final molecular area (A0) of 36 Å2. Notably, the micelles and Langmuir monolayer are quite stable until photo-triggered dissociation based on the photocleavage of C-IG1 amphiphile activated by 365-nm incident light. Moreover, the transition in interfacial morphology of the Langmuir monolayer during the assembly and photodegradation processes also can be visually analyzed by incorporating Nile red probes with in situ monitoring through fluorescence microscopy. The thin film deposited on a glass substrate by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique also shows a photoresponsive behavior based on the change in the contact angles of a water droplet on the surface upon light stimulation. The binding affinity of C-IG1 and cyclic DNA determined by the fluorescence quenching analysis of the coumarin reporter suggests a ground-state macromolecular complexation process occurring through polyvalent interactions between the pseudodendrimers and biomacromolecules. The ethidium bromide displacement assay further indicates thus dendriplex formation at low nitrogen-to-phosphorous value (N/P < 1) and confirms that the decomplexation accompanied by DNA release can be achieved through an active phototriggered route under spatiotemporal control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaqueous solutions 3abinding capacity 3acarbonates 3acholesterol 3acolloids 3acompressibility 3acoumarin 3adissociation 3adroplets 3aethidium 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3alipophilicity 3aliquid-air interface 3amicelles 3amonitoring 3aphotolysis 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3asurfactants 0aDendrimers 0aAmphiphilic dendrons 0aLangmuir analysis 0aPhotocleavage 0aGene delivery1 aShih, Yu-Chan1 aWang, Bing-Yen1 aChu, Chih-Chien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6712-00640 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 175 p.428-435dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009800165300001600263520098900279592002801268650002201296650001501318650001301333650002701346650002601373650001001399650002001409650001501429650001201444650002101456650003101477650001701508650001901525650001601544650001701560653001501577653002601592653002301618653002501641653001501666653003301681653001501714700001601729700001501745700001601760700002401776773010601800856008601906852000901992655001202001IND60630786520221123010418.0190213e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063078652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoig, F.10aHyaluronan based materials with catanionic sugar-derived surfactants as drug delivery systems  ap. 218-223.  aIn the present work novel drug delivery systems consisting in highly porous Hyaluronan foams for the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ketoprofen, have been obtained. A sugar-derived surfactant associated with ketoprofen was prepared and incorporated into the porous hyaluronan materials. The association between a lactose derived surfactant, Lhyd12, and ketoprofen was obtained by acid-base reaction and its physicochemical properties were studied. Tensiometric and dynamic light scattering (DLS) determinations showed the formation of catanionic surfactant aggregates, Lhyd12/ketoprofen, in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the catanionic surfactants allowed greater solubilisation of ketoprofen. Hyaluronan porous materials were developed using butanediol diglycidyl ether as crosslinking agent. The profile release of Lhyd12/ketoprofen from hyaluronan based materials shows differences as a function of the aggregation state of catanionic surfactant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abutanediol 3acolloids 3across-linking reagents 3adrug delivery systems 3afoams 3ahyaluronic acid 3aketoprofen 3alactose 3alight scattering 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporous media 3asolubilization 3asurfactants 3atensiometers 0aHyaluronan 0aCatanionic surfactant 0aControlled release 0aCrosslinked hydrogel 0aSolid foam 0aHighly concentrated emulsion 0aKetoprofen1 aBlanzat, M.1 aSolans, C.1 aEsquena, J.1 aGarcía-Celma, M.J.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 164 p.218-223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010300169300002000272520163200292592002801924650001001952650001601962650002401978650001502002650002202017650002502039650001702064650001702081650001902098650002002117650002102137650001502158650001602173650000902189650001902198700001602217700001602233700001802249700001402267700001802281700001602299700001902315700001602334773014902350856008102499852000902580655001202589IND60441804220221120051933.0151106e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044180422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4710-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lianshuang10aEndosulfan activates the extrinsic coagulation pathway by inducing endothelial cell injury in rats  ap. 15722-15730.  aEndosulfan, a persistent organic pollutant, is widely used in agriculture as a pesticide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the blood toxicity of different doses of endosulfan in Wistar rats. The experimental sample was composed of four groups, a control group that did not receive endosulfan and three endosulfan-exposed groups that respectively received 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (doses below LD₅₀), of endosulfan for 21 days. The results showed that endosulfan significantly decreased the prothrombin time (PT) and upregulated the activated coagulation factors VIIa, Xa, and XIIIa; thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT); and P-selectin. Plasma levels of tissue factor (TF) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were increased in the endosulfan groups. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and the level of activated coagulation factor IXa showed no obvious changes. Immunohistochemical results showed increased expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β in the groups exposed to endosulfan. The pathology and electron microscopy results showed impaired vascular tissue accompanied by the exfoliation of endothelial cells and mitochondrial damage in the endosulfan-exposed groups. In summary, our results suggest that endosulfan damages endothelial cells via oxidative stress and the inflammatory response, leading to the release of TF and vWF into the blood. The TF and vWF in the blood may activate extrinsic coagulation factors and platelets, thus triggering the extrinsic coagulation pathway. There were no obvious effects on the intrinsic coagulation pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acoagulation 3aelectron microscopy 3aendosulfan 3aendothelial cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainterleukins 3alethal dose 50 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3apollutants 3aprothrombin 3arats 3athromboplastin1 aWei, Jialiu1 aGuo, Fangzi1 aDuan, Junchao1 aLi, Yanbo1 aShi, Zhixiong1 aYang, Yumei1 aZhou, Xianqing1 aSun, Zhiwei0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Oct., v. 22, no. 20 p.15722-15730dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4710-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245011500168506002800283520141200311592002801723506003701751650000801788650001401796650001501810650001101825650002001836650002201856650001401878650002701892650001401919650001301933650000901946651001401955653001801969653001901987653002102006653002602027700002102053700002602074700001202100773009102112856008002203852000902283655001202292IND60764619620221215143841.0211122e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076461962DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2106082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusandarini, Ratna10aMicrosatellite polymorphism for molecular characterization of pomelo (Citrus maxima) accessions from Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aSusandarini R, Subandiyah S, Daryono BS, Rugayah. 2020. Microsatellite polymorphism for molecular characterization of pomelo (Citrus maxima) accessions from Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 2390-2395. Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr. (pomelo) as a minor fruit crop deserve attention on its phenotypic and genotypic variability to avoid the risk of extinction. Previous study showed that pomelo from Indonesia has high morphological variability, and thus it is interesting to explore its genotypic variability using molecular markers. Microsatellite is a molecular marker widely used in Citrus taxonomy studies. This study aimed at revealing microsatellite polymorphism and its potential application in cultivar characterization of C .maxima. Eighty accessions of C. maxima consisting of registered cultivars and landraces from Indonesia were used in this study. Analysis of microsatellite sequences from genomic DNA amplified using DY296883 primer showed that C. maxima microsatellite has high polymorphism in the form of repeat length variation of (GA)n, ranging from (GA)7 to (GA)19. This study proved the existence of high genotypic variability in C. maxima, and confirmed the role of microsatellite as a useful molecular marker for uncovering variability at intraspecific level. Observation of the microsatellite polymorphisms indicated that variability of (GA)n can be used to distinguish some pomelo cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3acultivars 3aextinction 3afruits 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3alandraces 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotype 3apummelos 3arisk 3aIndonesia 0acitrus maxima 0amicrosatellite 0acharacterization 0agenotypic variability1 aSubandiyah, Siti1 aDaryono, Budi Setiadi1 aRugayah0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 May, v. 21, no. 6dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2106083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100001900193245006700212506007600279506003100355520164400386592002802030596008302058506003702141650003002178650002902208650001502237650001202252650001302264650002002277653002902297653001602326653001502342653001202357653001902369653001902388700001702407773011802424856008602542852000902628655001202637IND60727112220221207123428.0210423e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072711222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119952chorus7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Ritwick10aHybrid governance and performances of environmental accounting  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aMultiple centers of authority in hybrid forms create conditions of radical openness where questions of value and fitness are in flux. Environmental accounting is suggested as a condition for steadying hybrid forms and opening up possibilities for institutional innovations. This paper advances a critical social science analysis of environmental accounting to help specify how, when, and in what ways strengthening accounting capacity advances hybrid governance. Social studies of accounting argue that accounting systems are contingent on institutions: rules and social conventions, not only data or science. Our practice-centered analysis of two cases of building environmental accounting tools to advance high profile institutional innovations in US agri-environmental governance finds that the systems of rules that structure and legitimize accounting protocols are not pre-given. The same radical openness that presents opportunities for hybridity also reinforces uncertainties in building accounting standards. We identify two major frictions: a) Conventions for determining technical consensus and b) Rules for determining levels of transaction costs. We conclude by identifying a need to think about hybrid forms critically. Although hybrid forms are an expression of creativity and collaboration, they are also performances of a certain contemporary political covenant that delegitimizes state-centered governance. The challenge ahead is to understand when and where hybrid arrangements add to socio-ecological regulation and where they undermine the possibility of more functional approaches through a performance of seriousness.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagri-environmental policy 3aenvironmental management 3agovernance 3ahybrids 3apolitics 3asocial sciences 0aEnvironmental governance 0aAgriculture 0aAccounting 0aMetrics 0aClimate change 0aAccountability1 aWolf, Steven0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 284 p.111995-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010800168300001600276520131400292592002801606650001701634650001801651650001301669650001301682650001001695650001501705650001401720650001901734650001201753650001201765650001301777650001301790650001801803650001201821650003801833650001701871653001201888653001201900653001501912653001801927700001601945700001601961700001401977700001601991700005502007773010602062856008702168852000902255655001202264IND60626007720221120205626.0190213e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062600772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenfeng10aSynthesis and fabrication of a keratin-conjugated insulin hydrogel for the enhancement of wound healing  ap. 436-444.  aAccelerating and regulating collagen formation during wound healing repair is key issues for skin regeneration. Insulin can promote the healing of damaged skin by stimulating cellular migration and angiogenesis. Here, human hair keratin-conjugated insulin was synthesized to enhance full-thickness skin regeneration based on the excellent wound healing and hemostatic effects of keratin and the collagen deposition regulation ability of insulin. The insulin-conjugated keratin (Ins-K) was synthesized through the EDC/NHS reaction, which can supply a sustained release of insulin. The Ins-K hydrogel displayed similar water absorption, porosity and rheology properties to those of the keratin hydrogel. However, the Ins-K hydrogel shows a stronger hemostatic ability than the keratin hydrogel group, with a stronger wound healing effect found for the Ins-K hydrogel in the early regeneration stage (first 2 weeks) than for the keratin hydrogel treatment, resulting in smoother skin tissues at an excision section realized by regulating transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and hydroxyproline (HYP) expression. The results demonstrate that keratin promotes hemostasis and wound healing after insulin conjugation, which highlights the potential of keratin-based materials in tissue regeneration applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3acell movement 3acollagen 3acolloids 3ahairs 3ahemostasis 3ahydrogels 3ahydroxyproline 3ainsulin 3akeratin 3aporosity 3arheology 3atissue repair 3atissues 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3awater uptake 0aKeratin 0aInsulin 0aHemostasis 0aWound healing1 aGao, Feiyan1 aKan, Jinlan1 aDeng, Jia1 aWang, Bochu1 aHao, Shilei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1205-31020 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 175 p.436-444dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011800176300001400294520206500308592002802373650002402401650001602425650001202441650003402453650001202487650001502499650001802514650001402532650002202546650001802568650002202586650001502608650001302623650002002636650002402656650002402680653001702704653002302721653001202744653002002756653002502776700002002801773010902821856008702930852000903017655001203026IND60539842520221118060724.0190318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053984252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamashiro, Hirotake10aSignaling pathway underlying the octopaminergic modulation of myogenic contraction in the cricket lateral oviduct  ap. 30-36.  aOctopamine (OA), a biogenic monoamine, is a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in invertebrates. Here, we report the effect of OA on the spontaneous rhythmic contractions (SRCs) of the lateral oviduct of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus and the possible signaling pathway involved. Application of OA increased both the frequency and amplitude of SRCs in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of OA was inhibited by subsequent application of the OA receptor antagonist epinastine, indicating that the action of OA is mediated by OA receptor. To investigate the predominant signaling pathway underlying the action of OA, we first examined a possible involvement of the cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Application of the membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP had little effect on SRCs and the effect of OA was not influenced by subsequent application of the PKA inhibitor H89, indicating that the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway is not the predominant pathway in the action of OA. Next, we examined a possible involvement of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the action of OA. The effect of OA on SRCs was inhibited by subsequent application of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, indicating that the PLC pathway is involved in the action of OA. The OA-induced increase in the frequency of SRCs was inhibited by pretreatment of the cell with the ryanodine receptor antagonist tetracaine but was not significantly affected by the IP3 receptor antagonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). On the other hand, the OA-induced increase in the amplitude of SRCs was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with 2-APB but was not significantly affected by tetracaine. Taken together, these results suggest that the OA-induced excitatory effect on SRCs is mediated by the PLC signaling pathway: Ca2+ release from IP3 receptors may contribute to the modulation of the amplitude of SRCs, whereas Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptors may contribute to the modulation of the frequency of SRCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGryllus bimaculatus 3aantagonists 3aborates 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acalcium 3acyclic AMP 3adose response 3ainositols 3ainsect physiology 3ainvertebrates 3aneurotransmitters 3aoctopamine 3aoviducts 3aphospholipase C 3aryanodine receptors 3asignal transduction 0aIP3 receptor 0aRyanodine receptor 0aCricket 0aLateral oviduct 0aMyogenic contraction1 aYoshino, Masami0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2014 Dec., v. 71 p.30-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014400167520134900311592002801660653002201688653002601710653001001736653001901746700001701765700001901782700001501801700001801816700001901834773011101853856008501964852000902049655001202058IND60684675520221119032028.0200330e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068467552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1179682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinlan10aPebax-based mixed matrix membranes containing hollow polypyrrole nanospheres with mesoporous shells for enhanced gas permeation performance  aMixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great advantages in overcoming the Robeson trade-off effect, and various fillers have been utilized to improve the gas permeation and separation performance. In this study, hollow polypyrrole (PPy) nanospheres with mesoporous shells were synthesized by chemical polymerization using hard template method. The hollow PPy nanospheres with mesoporous shells were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer Emmett Teller and small-angle X-ray scattering. We introduced hollow PPy nanospheres into poly(ether-block-amide) (Pebax1657) as fillers to prepare MMMs for CO₂ separation. The effects of the hollow PPy nanospheres on the physical properties and the gas permeation and separation performance were studied. The results showed that the addition of hollow PPy nanospheres contributed to the improvement of the gas permeability. At 1 wt% loading of hollow PPy nanospheres, the MMMs exhibited a highest CO₂ permeability of 274 Barrer, which was more than double compared with that of the pure Pebax membrane, accompanied by the slightly increased CO₂/N₂ selectivity of 40.1 and the slightly increased CO₂/CH₄ selectivity of 12.8.

Reconstituted skim milk (12% RSM) or whey protein concentrate (4% WPC), with and without Flavourzyme® (0.14% w/w), were fermented with 4 different L. helveticus strains at 37 °C for 0, 4, 8, and 12 h.

RSM supported higher growth and produced higher proteolysis and ACE‐I compared to WPC without enzyme supplementation. The strains L. helveticus 881315 and 881188 were able to increase ACE‐I to >80% after 8 h of fermentation when combined with Flavourzyme® in RSM compared to the same strains without enzyme supplementation. Supplementation of media by Flavourzyme® was beneficial in increasing ACE‐I peptides in both media. The best media to release more ACE‐I peptides was RSM with enzyme supplementation.

Crosslinked chitosan, in beads form, was grafted with methacrylamide (MAm) using ammonium persulfate (APS) as free radical initiator. Evidence of grafting was determined by comparing FTIR, TGA, SEM and ¹³C NMR analyses of chitosan and graft copolymer. The optimal conditions for grafting reaction were as follow: crosslinked chitosan beads (1g), MAm (17.62×10⁻¹M), APS (2.63×10⁻¹M), reaction time (3h) and temperature (60°C). The modified chitosan bead was then used in laboratory batch experiments to evaluate the removal of Pb(II) ion from water samples. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were also applied to describe the equilibrium isotherms.

To investigate the potential pollution status of dumped BFS, 14 samples with total Hg contents ranging from 3.91 to 20.8 mg kg⁻¹ from five different locations in Europe were sequentially extracted. Extracts used included demineralized water (fraction 1, F1), 0.1 mol L⁻¹ CH₃COOH + 0.01 mol L⁻¹ HCl (F2), 1 mol L⁻¹ KOH (F3), 7.9 mol L⁻¹ HNO₃ (F4), and aqua regia (F5). The total recovery ranged from 72.3 to 114 %, indicating that the procedure was reliable when adapted to this industrial waste. Mercury mainly resided in the fraction of “elemental” Hg (48.5–98.8 %) rather being present as slightly soluble Hg species associated with sludge particles. Minor amounts were found as mercuric sulfide (F5; 0.725–37.3 %) and Hg in crystalline metal ores and silicates (F6; 2.21–15.1 %). The ecotoxically relevant fractions (F1 and F2) were not of significance (F1, <limit of quality; F2, 0.509–9.61 %, n = 5). Thus, BFS dumped for many years has a rather low environmental risk potential regarding Hg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aextracts 3ahydrochloric acid 3aindustrial wastes 3airon 3amercury 3anitric acid 3apollution 3apotassium hydroxide 3arisk 3asilicates 3asludge 3aEurope1 aAndrée, Corlin-Anna1 aMansfeldt, Tim0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Oct., v. 22, no. 20 p.15755-15762dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4781-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009800166300001600264520136200280592002801642650002201670650002301692650001101715650002001726650001301746650001601759650001701775653003001792653001901822653002001841653001701861653001901878653003101897700001901928700001801947700001601965773009701981856008502078852000902163655001202172IND60643060120221122043138.0190822e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064306012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.04.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, J.10aVariable speed operation of centrifugal pumps running as turbines. Experimental investigation  ap. 437-450.  aPumps running as turbines are pointed out as a cost-effective solution for energy recovery in pressurised water supply systems. However, these hydraulic machines feature low efficiency under variable discharge operation due to the lack of an inlet flow control component. Variable speed operation is an approach for controlling the discharge at the pump as turbine inlet aiming at increasing the operational efficiency. This research work presents the experimental investigation for measuring the variable speed characteristic curves of pumps running as turbines, focusing on the turbine and on the extended operation modes. Three single-stage end-suction closed-impeller centrifugal pumps with different unit specific speed values are tested. Turbine mode test results show that the discharge-specific energy operating range is broadened with increasing efficiency if the machines are operated with variable speed. Extended operation results show that these hydraulic machines do not feature the instability region near the runaway conditions, the so-called the “s-curve”. Outcomes of this experimental investigation provide the required insights for establishing the design technical specifications of micro hydropower plants with variable speed pumps running as turbines, aiming at maximizing the energy recovered in pressurised water supply systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrifugal pumps 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aturbines 3awater power 3awater supply 0aPumps running as turbines 0aVariable speed 0aEnergy recovery 0aTurbine mode 0aFour quadrants 0aExperimental investigation1 aFerreira, J.P.1 aCovas, D.I.C.1 aAvellan, F.0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Nov., v. 142 p.437-450dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.04.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011200170300001600282520126100298592002801559650002601587650002901613650001301642650002101655650002801676650001601704650001801720650001301738650001301751650002601764650003001790650001901820650000901839653002701848653002101875653002901896653002101925700001601946700001801962700001701980700001601997700001402013700001602027700001602043700001602059700001902075700005202094700005802146773010602204856008702310852000902397655001202406IND60626007920221120205628.0190213e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062600792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Tiantian14aThe antibacterial effect of potassium-sodium niobate ceramics based on controlling piezoelectric properties  ap. 463-468.  aThe implant infection is one of the most serious postsurgical complications of medical device implantation. Therefore, the development of biocompatible materials with improved antibacterial properties is of great importance. It might be a new insight to apply the intrinsic electrical properties of biomaterials to solve this problem. Here, potassium-sodium niobate piezoceramics (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, KNN) with different piezoelectric constants were prepared, and the microstructures and piezoelectric properties of these piezoceramics were evaluated. Moreover, the antibacterial effect and biocompatibility of these piezoceramics were assayed. Results showed that these piezoceramics were able to decrease the colonies of bacteria staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), favor the rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) proliferation and promote the cell adhesion and spreading. The above effects were found closely related to the surface positive charges of the piezoceramics, and the sample bearing the most positive charges on its surface (sample 80KNN) had the best performance in both antibacterial effect and biocompatibility. Based on our work, it is feasible to develop biocompatible antibacterial materials by controlling piezoelectric properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abone marrow 3acell adhesion 3aceramics 3acolloids 3aelectrical properties 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amicrostructure 3arats 0aAntibacterial property 0aBiocompatibility 0aPotassium-sodium niobate 0aPositive charges1 aChen, Junqi1 aWang, Zhengao1 aZhai, Jinxia1 aLi, Yangfan1 aXing, Jun1 aHu, Shiqian1 aTan, Guoxin1 aQi, Suijian1 aChang, Yunbing1 aYu, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2253-73731 aNing, Chengyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7304-50130 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 175 p.463-468dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245007800175500001900253520089300272592002801165650001901193650001901212650001501231650001801246650002201264653001501286653001801301653001301319653001201332700001501344700002001359700002101379773011101400856008701511852000901598655001201607IND60719406220221119202651.0210114e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071940622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2020.1104202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaille, Matthew J.10aCritical examination of particle swelling during wetting of ground coffee  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSwelling of roast and ground coffee particles during immersion in water was studied using laser diffraction and digital microscopy. In particular, swelling was investigated on a time scale typical of common brew methods (0.5–5 min). Time-dependent swelling behavior during brewing would change the packed coffee bed parameters and thus the dynamics of coffee extraction.The impact of roast level, decaffeination, water temperature, and water chemistry were examined. When accounting for the time dependency of particle entrainment into the recirculating water loop, laser diffraction did not detect statistically significant increase in particle size during wetting. In situ digital microscopy also observed no increase in particle diameter during wetting. These results suggest that individual coffee particles do not swell significantly during the time scale of typical brew methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecaffeination 3ahydrochemistry 3amicroscopy 3aparticle size 3awater temperature 0aExtraction 0aGround coffee 0aSwelling 0aWetting1 aSala, Kyle1 aScott, David M.1 aZukswert, Hannah0 tJournal of food engineering.g2021 Apr., v. 295 p.110420-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2020.1104203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013500166506002800301520176400329592002802093506003702121650001202158650002602170650001602196650001302212650000902225650001102234650001302245650002102258651001402279653002502293653001702318653004202335653002102377700002302398700002302421700002002444700002602464773009302490856008002583852000902663655001202672IND60764619920221207060155.0211122e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076461992DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2111462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARUAPEY, AJANG 10aSwampy rice lines for iron toxicity tolerance and yield components performance under inland swamp at Sorong, West Papua, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aMaruapey A, Wicaksana N, Karuniawan A, Utami DW, Windarsih G. 2020. Swampy rice lines performance for iron toxicity tolerance and yield components under inland swamp at Sorong, West Papua, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 5394-5402. The extensification of sub-optimal lowland farming strategy is expected to support the increase of rice production. Based on the efforts, the development of tolerant rice varieties to Fe-toxicity to be used in the swampy land area is one of the approaches for increasing rice production. Currently, promising rice lines that are tolerant to Fe-toxicity has been developed using molecular breeding approach for inland swampy area. The objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of 15 promising rice lines that have various genetic backgrounds in inland swamp in Sorong, West Papua. The field experiment was conducted during the second rice planting season (August 2018 to February 2019) to evaluate the performance of the promising rice lines to the morpho-agronomic performance under the lowland swamp conditions. The trial was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) consisting of 4 m x 5 m square plots, with 25 cm x 25 cm planting distance and 3 replications. The results revealed that most of the lines had good performances on the Fe-toxicity tolerance, based on bronzing, root length, and biomass characters. The G1 line had the best performance on yield component characters, especially the panicle length. This line also had the highest grain yield (6.15 ton.ha-1) followed by the next promising line of G7 (5.92 ton.ha-1). The genetic performance of these lines showed that they contained IRT (Iron Regulation Transporter) alleles that contributed to partitioning the Fe tolerance mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3apanicles 3arice 3aswamps 3atoxicity 3ayield components 3aIndonesia 0afe-toxicity tolerant 0ainland swamp 0apromising lines of molecular breeding 0ayield characters1 aWICAKSANA, NOLADI 1 aKARUNIAWAN, AGUNG 1 aWINDARSIH, GUT 1 aUtami, Dwinita  Wikan0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Oct., v. 21, no. 11dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2111463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245019400206520192300400592002802323650002302351650001902374650002302393650002902416650003002445650001302475650002102488650001102509650002302520650001102543650001502554651001802569651001702587653002102604653002902625653003202654653002902686653001902715653001502734700002302749700002002772700001802792700001502810700005702825773011802882856008603000852000903086655001203095IND60727112520221120054829.0210423e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072711252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7739-610910aCapturing response differences of species distribution to climate and human pressures by incorporating local adaptation: Implications for the conservation of a critically endangered species  aConsidering local adaptation has been increasingly involved in forecasting species distributions under climate change and the management of species conservation. Herein, we take the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) that has both a low dispersal ability and distinct population divergence in different regions as an example. Basin-scale models that represent different populations in the Huanghe River Basin (HRB), the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), and the Pearl River Basin (PRB) were established using ensemble species distribution models. The species ranges under the future human population density (HPD) and climate change were predicted, and the range loss was evaluated for local basins in 2050 and 2070. Our results showed that the predominant factors affecting species distributions differed among basins, and the responses of the species occurrence to HPD and climate factors were distinctly different from northern to southern basins. Future HPD changes would be the most influential factor that engenders negative impacts on the species distribution in all three basins, especially in the HRB. Climate change will likely be less prominent in decreasing the species range, excluding in the YRB and PRB under the highest-emissions scenario in 2050. Overall, the high-emissions scenario would more significantly aggravate the negative impacts produced by HPD change in both 2050 and 2070, with maximum losses of species ranges in the HRB, YRB, and PRB of 83.4%, 60.0%, and 53.5%, respectively, under the scenarios of the combined impacts of HPD and climate changes. We proposed adapted conservation policies to effectively protect the habitat of this critically endangered animal in different basins based on the outcomes. Our research addresses the importance of incorporating local adaptation into species distribution modeling to inform conservation and management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrias davidianus 3aclimate change 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental management 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3apopulation density 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aYangtze River 3aYellow River 0aLocal adaptation 0aChinese giant salamander 0aSpecies distribution models 0aHuman population density 0aClimate change 0aRange loss1 aGrenouillet, Gaël1 aDong, Xianghong1 aZheng, Yichen1 aLek, Sovan1 aChang, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1053-25400 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 284 p.111998-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245019500183300001600378520128900394592002801683650004401711650002201755650003501777650001201812650002101824650002001845650002201865650001401887650001401901650003301915650001301948650002701961650001301988650002502001653004702026653003102073653003402104653001802138700002602156700003102182700003202213700002702245773015102272856008502423852000902508655001202517IND60600881720221121130520.0180704e20180503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060088172DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2018.14789702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFirouzabadi, Zahra Dehghani10aMagnetic dispersive solid phase extraction using modified magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes combined with electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry for the determination of selenium  ap. 555-569.  aA novel magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction method using magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified with 5-mercapto-3-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thione potassium salt (bismuthiol II) (MMWCNTs@Bis) as the sorbent was developed for the separation and preconcentration of inorganic selenium (IV) prior to its determination by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The prepared MMWCNTs@Bis sorbent was characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer and X-ray diffraction. Total selenium was determined after reduction of Se(VI) to Se(IV) by addition of hydrochloric acid and heating the mixture in a boiling water bath. Se(VI) concentration was determined from the difference between the amounts of total selenium and Se(IV). Under the optimised experimental conditions, an enhancement factor of 196 and a detection limit (based on 3Sb/m) of 0.003 µg L⁻¹ was obtained for aqueous samples. The relative standard deviation at 0.1 µg L⁻¹ concentration level of Se(IV) (n = 6) was found to be 5.2 and 7.7% for intra- and inter-day analysis, respectively. The method was successfully applied to the determination of inorganic selenium species in water and total selenium in food samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aboiling 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3ahydrochloric acid 3amagnetism 3apotassium 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aselenium 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3astatistical analysis 0aMagnetic dispersive solid phase extraction 0ainorganic selenium species 0amulti-walled carbon nanotubes 0abismuthiol II1 aDadfarnia, Shayessteh1 aHaji Shabani, Ali Mohammad1 aEhrampoush, Mohammad Hassan1 aTafti, Elaheh Nourbala0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2018 May 3, v. 98, no. 6 p.555-569dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12218x1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2018.14789703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009000163300001600253520095100269592002801220650002601248650001801274650001101292650001301303650001701316650001801333650001501351650001301366650001501379650002201394650001601416650001101432650001401443650001501457650002501472653001601497653002701513653002201540653002401562653003001586700001801616700001601634700005901650773011301709856008601822852000901908655001201917IND60745131220221120202346.0221004e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074513122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2021.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jin10aHaloarchaea, excellent candidates for removing pollutants from hypersaline wastewater  ap. 226-239.  aHypersaline wastewater is difficult to treat due to the inhibition of salt stress on microbes’ viability and metabolic capabilities. Haloarchaea, native microorganisms that thrive in hypersaline habitats, overcome this key obstacle naturally. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the metabolic versatility of Haloarchaea in hypersaline wastewater treatment, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and heavy metal metabolism. It also analyzes factors affecting pollutant removal and addresses metabolic mechanisms. Additionally, haloarchaea microbial characteristics and strategies to cope with salt stress are highlighted. Finally, the biotechnological potential of biomolecules produced from haloarchaea is investigated. To get better insight into the potential of haloarchaea, a deeper investigation of basic metabolism and more in-depth studies of their genomics and applications in actual wastewater are also necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3agenomics 3aheavy metals 3ahypersalinity 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollution control 3asalt stress 3asulfur 3aviability 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aHaloarchaea 0ahypersaline wastewater 0apollutant removal 0ametabolic mechanism 0amicrobial characteristics1 aGao, Yuanyuan1 aDong, Huiyu1 aSheng, Guo-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4579-16540 tTrends in biotechnology.g2022 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.226-239dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl35011x0167-77997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2021.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014300168300001600311520151100327592002801838650001401866650001401880650001101894650001701905650003401922650001201956650002001968650001301988650002102001650001602022650001902038650002302057650002102080650001602101650000902117773011902126856008202245852000902327655001202336IND60619005420221122132705.0181030e196804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061900542DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517568038004102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Bernard10aThermoanalytical Studies on the Durable-Press Curing of CellulosebPart II: The Effect of Nitrate Salts on the Thermal1 Behavior of Cotton  ap. 395-400.  aIn the course of a series of thermoanalytical investigations on durable-press curing processes for cotton, attention has been focused on the acid salt catalysts. Studies on the sequence and nature of the chemical events occurring during heating through the tem perature range of a typical durable-press cure have been carried out by using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Different methods of combining cotton and salt were compared. In one sequence, cotton was soaked with aqueous salt solutions; in another, the two solids were separated from each' other by a porous barrier. In a few instances, an aminoplast cross-linking resin was included in the reaction system. Among the detectable processes, when nitrate salts were used, was a strongly exo thermic reaction accompanied by a rapid weight loss, not characteristic of any one of the substances in the mixtures. This decomposition could be modulated with respect to temperature, rate, and extent, depending on the concentration, environment, and geo metric arrangement of the system. In an attempt to explain these effects additional studies on zinc nitrate were carried out showing that its thermal behavior was not what might be implied from values stated in the cited literature. On the basis of the accumu lated data, it is suggested that the exothermic decomposition is the consequence of the oxidative attack of NO₂ on cellulose, the former being produced by the thermal breakdown of the nitrate salt.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3acotton 3acrosslinking 3adifferential thermal analysis 3afabrics 3aheat production 3anitrates 3anitrogen dioxide 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3aweight loss 3azinc0 tTextile research journal.g1968 Apr., v. 38, no. 4 p.395-400dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517568038004103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011100170300001500281520091800296592002801214650001401242650002801256650001101284650001801295650002001313650001001333653002101343653001801364653004801382653003701430700002501467700002401492773012401516856008501640852000901725655001201734IND60481391820221119015152.0160204e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048139182DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2015.10858712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeri, Mojtaba10aElementary discharge coefficient of a triangular–rectangular sharp-crested side weir in subcritical flow  ap. 95-102.  aSide weirs or lateral weirs are widely employed to divert flows from rivers, channels, sewers and reservoirs or to divide flows between components of water treatment systems. The side weir is a fixed structure installed at one side of a channel for water level control in water treatment plants and irrigation and drainage systems. Hydraulic characteristics of a compound sharp-crested triangular–rectangular side weir under subcritical flow were studied in this paper. The concept of the elementary discharge coefficient that is related to the head to weir height ratio was used to determine the flow through the side weir. The advantage of this method is to calculate the channel water surface profile along the weir. Generalized equations for an elementary discharge coefficient for compound triangular–rectangular side weirs were proposed.

Selective inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 by dietary constituents, notably the class of flavonoids, is a widely accepted paradigm that supports the concept of dietary chemoprevention. In parallel, recent studies have documented the ability of CYP1 enzymes to selectively metabolize dietary flavonoids to conversion products that inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In the present study we have examined the inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1-catalyzed EROD activity by 14 different flavonoids containing methoxy- and hydroxyl-group substitutions as well as the metabolism of the monomethoxylated CYP1-flavonoid inhibitor acacetin and the poly-methoxylated flavone eupatorin-5-methyl ether by recombinant CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. The most potent inhibitors of CYP1-EROD activity were the methoxylated flavones acacetin, diosmetin, eupatorin and the di-hydroxylated flavone chrysin, indicating that the 4′-OCH₃ group at the B ring and the 5,7-dihydroxy motif at the A ring play a prominent role in EROD inhibition. Potent inhibition of CYP1B1 EROD activity was also obtained for the poly-hydroxylated flavonols quercetin and myricetin. HPLC metabolism of acacetin by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 revealed the formation of the structurally similar flavone apigenin by demethylation at the 4′-position of the B ring, whereas the flavone eupatorin-5-methyl ether was metabolized to an as yet unidentified metabolite assigned E₅M1. Eupatorin-5-methyl ether demonstrated a submicromolar IC₅₀ in the CYP1-expressing cancer cell line MDA-MB 468, while it was considerably inactive in the normal cell line MCF-10A. Homology modeling in conjunction with molecular docking calculations were employed in an effort to rationalize the activity of these flavonoids based on their CYP1-binding mode. Taken together the data suggest that dietary flavonoids exhibit three distinct modes of action with regard to cancer prevention, based on their hydroxyl and methoxy decoration: (1) inhibitors of CYP1 enzymatic activity, (2) CYP1 substrates and (3) substrates and inhibitors of CYP1 enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapigenin 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3achemistry 3achemoprevention 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amyricetin 3aquercetin 2aAryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Line 2aComputer Simulation 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1B1 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlavonesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aPapakyriakou, Athanasios1 aVourloumis, Dionisios1 aSpandidos, Demetrios A.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2011 May 1, v. 19, no. 9 p.2842-2849dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.03.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245013200126300001600258520222900274592002802503650003402531650001802565650001002583650001702593650001402610650001402624650001202638650001102650650001302661650001702674650002002691650001602711650001502727650001202742650001702754651001002771700001102781700001702792700001402809773015002823852000902973655001202982IND60706416520221119114815.0200807e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070641652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThapa, U.10aStudy the Efficacy of Brassinolide and Triacontanol on Green and Seed Yield of Spinach –Beet (Beta vulgaris Var. bengalensis)  ap. 870-875.  aThe present communication deals with the effect of growth regulators like Triacontanol and Brassinolide Research was conducted during the seasons of October 2009 to May 2010 to Study the efficacy of Brassinolide and Triacontanol ongreen and seed yield of Spinach– beet (Beta vulgaris var. bengalensis) at Horticultural Research Station, Mondouri, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur, Nadia, West Bengal. India. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of Brassinolide and Triacontanol to find out suitable concentration of these growth regulators on green yield, seed yield and quality aspects of spinach-beet. The experiment comprised of four different concentrations of each Brassinolide and Triacontanol along with water spray and no spray treatment applied in two varieties (viz., All Green and Punjab Selection) in three replication. It was recorded from this experiment that both Triacontonal and Brassinolide significantly influence on the growth and yield related attributes. For most of the yield related characters (like plant height, number of leaves per plant, fresh and dry weight, green yield, etc) were found effective with proportionately increased in the concentration of these chemicals from 0.5–1.5ppm with Triacontanol and 0.05– 0.2ppm with Brassinolide. Both these growth regulators though have promotive effect in flowering characters like basal girth of flower stalk, flower stalk length but they might have no effect on duration for flowering and seed maturity. Results showed that 1000 seed weight and seed yield were highest at Triacontanol @concentration of 0.5 ppm and Brassinolide @ of 0.05 ppm with All Green variety. Biochemical analysis revealed that carotene content, nitrogen percentage, protein content and ascorbic acid content were highly influenced by the application of Triacontanol and Brassinolide. It was observed that the lower concentration of Triacontanol and Brassinolide were found tobe more effective for carotene and ascorbic acid content The maximum Ascorbic acid content of (80.650mg/100g) was observed with 0.05ppm concentration of Brassinolide, Variety Punjab selection was found superior in relation to ascorbic acid and carotene content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3aascorbic acid 3abeets 3abrassinolide 3acarotenes 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aplant height 3aprotein content 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3aspinach 3atriacontanol 3aIndia1 aDe, N.1 aPrasad, P.H.1 aRai, A.K.0 tTrends in Biosciences.g2014 May, v. 7, no. 10 p.870-875dSociety for Advancement of Science and Rural DevelopmentwJournal:2106x0976-24857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245009100181520232100272592002802593650001402621650002402635650002502659650000902684650001002693650001802703650001602721650001402737650002002751650001302771650001802784651002002802651001902822653002002841653001202861653002202873653001402895700002302909700001702932700002202949700002502971773009902996856009003095852000903185655001203194IND60662993520221122025657.0201104e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066299352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7344862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderzwalmen, Myriam10aEffect of a water conditioner on ornamental fish behaviour during commercial transport  aMillions of ornamental fishes undergo transport every year during which they experience high levels of stress and prolonged recovery. Studies aiming to refine welfare during transport have generally focused on maintaining water quality to minimise stress, with far less consideration of whether the addition of water conditioners containing herbal extracts to transport water could provide additional stress reduction beyond that obtained by maintaining good water quality. No study has previously tested this on a commercial scale. The aim of this study was to test the effect of Stress Coat®, a commercially-available water conditioner which contains Aloe vera, on fish health and behaviour during commercial transport. First, we tested the effect of the water conditioner on the behaviour of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) post-transport in a simulated transport in the laboratory (bags with Stress Coat®n = 6, control bags: n = 6). In a second experiment, we added water conditioner to the shipment water of variatus platy (Xiphophorus variatus) for regional transport from a UK wholesaler to UK retail stores (< 8 h transport time) (bags with Stress Coat®n = 11, control bags: n = 11). Finally, the water conditioner was added to the shipment water of variatus platy for international transport from a farm in South-East Asia to a UK wholesaler (> 30 h transport) (bags with Stress Coat®n = 16, control bags: n = 16) followed by a second transport by road to local retailers (< 9 h) with no addition of Stress Coat®. Behaviour was monitored following the simulated transport. Water quality, behaviour, mortality and visible injuries of fish post-transport were monitored following both the regional and international transports. The effects of the water conditioner were variable between studies, but overall it reduced levels of erratic swimming and reduced biting behaviours following the simulated and international transport. The water conditioner did not significantly affect water quality, mortality or visible injuries post-transport and mortality was low throughout. Overall, adding Stress Coat® to the transport water of ornamental fishes appears to improve behavioural indicators of welfare, in particular reducing the occurrence of erratic swimming and biting behaviours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aXiphophorus variatus 3abags 3afarms 3afish behavior 3afish health 3amortality 3aornamental fish 3aswimming 3awater quality 3aSouth East Asia 3aUnited Kingdom 0aOrnamental fish 0aWelfare 0aWater conditioner 0aTransport1 aEdmonds, Elizabeth1 aCarey, Peter1 aSnellgrove, Donna1 aSloman, Katherine A.0 tAquaculture.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 514 p.734486-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7344863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010800153300001600261520134200277592002801619650002701647650002701674650002701701650001701728650001701745650000901762650001301771650001301784650000701797650001801804650001101822700001601833700001701849700001601866700001701882773012201899856007502021852000902096655001202105IND60534867020221122155834.0160803e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053486702DNAL7 a10.1021/es404090h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujii, M.10aEffect of Natural Organic Matter on Iron Uptake by the Freshwater Cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa  ap. 365-374.  aThe mode of Fe uptake by the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa cultured in Fraquil* (pH 8) containing Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) was examined using short-term radiolabeled ⁵⁵Fe uptake assays and a kinetic model that describes extracellular Fe transformations. Both Fe(II) and Fe(III) uptake rates decreased substantially with increasing SRFA concentration as the availability of unchelated Fe decreased due to complexation by SRFA. Fe uptake rates under illuminated conditions were comparable to or slightly higher than those observed in the dark at the same Fe:SRFA concentration ratio, in contrast to results for systems containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid where Fe uptake rates were much greater under illumination than in the dark. The limited effect of light principally resulted from the relatively high rates of thermal dissociation and dark reduction of Fe(III) bound to SRFA and complexation of photogenerated Fe(II) by SRFA. Our findings imply that Fe uptake by M. aeruginosa at a fixed total Fe concentration of 200 nM is close to saturation when fulvic acid is present at concentrations near those typically found in natural waters (< ∼5 mg·L–¹), with cellular growth likely to be limited by Fe availability only when natural organic matter is present at very high concentrations (>25 mg·L–¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacterium (genus) 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3adissociation 3afulvic acids 3airon 3akinetics 3alighting 3apH 3aradiolabeling 3arivers1 aDang, T.

Despite this, the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 functioning cannot entirely be predicted, and it is not fully understood which factors contribute to this variability. Recent studies indicate that heterochromatin can negatively affect Cas9 binding and functioning. Investigating chromatin factors indicates that DNA cytosine-5 methylation does not directly block Cas9 binding. Nucleosomes, however, can completely block Cas9 access to DNA in cell-free assays and present a substantial hurdle in vivo. In addition to being associated with an open chromatin state, active transcription can directly stimulate DNA cleavage by influencing Cas9 release rates in a strand-specific manner. With these insights and a better understanding of genome-wide chromatin and transcription states, CRISPR/Cas9 effectiveness and reliability can be improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3acell free system 3agene editing 3aheterochromatin 3amethylation 3anucleosomes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aRots, Marianne G0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 55 p.68-73dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2018.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245009400207300001600301520132600317592002801643650002201671650001101693650001401704650002301718650003001741650001501771650001701786650001201803653002101815653001201836653002901848653002601877653003401903700001701937700002001954700002001974700001401994700007102008700001402079700001802093700001302111700001402124700001402138700001702152700005302169773008802222856008502310852000902395655001202404IND60740379720221123042524.0220103e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074037972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Huijuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3927-272X10aDouble boosting single atom Fe–N4 sites for high efficiency O2 and CO2 electroreduction  ap. 109-116.  aMetal-N₄ single-atom catalysts have emerged as the frontier of catalysis. However, the low metal loading and abundance of single atoms embedded in carbon skeleton hinder their practical application. Herein, we report an effective “trapping and exposing” strategy for constructing single-atom Fe–N₄ catalysts with high density of single-atom active sites. The strategy involves the strong binding of metal ions to sucrose (trapping) to prevent the migration and agglomeration of Fe³⁺, followed by the introduction of a mesoporous structure using an SBA-15 template to achieve sufficient exposure of the Fe–N₄ sites (exposing). The as-prepared catalyst comprises Fe–N₄ moieties (10.8 wt%) with a hierarchical structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the chelating reaction between sucrose and Fe³⁺ ions has a low free energy, resulting in the formation of highly dispersed Fe–N₄ single atoms. The single-atom catalyst displays a high peak power density of 0.784 W cm⁻² in a H₂–O₂ proton exchange membrane fuel cell and achieves an impressive CO current density of 109 A g⁻¹ at negligible overpotentials in a flow cell. This work provides an efficient strategy for designing high-performance single-atom catalysts for practical electrocatalysis applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3afuel cells 3aporous media 3asucrose 0aElectrocatalysts 0aFe–N4 0aHigh active site density 0aO2 reduction reaction 0aElectrochemical CO2 reduction1 aWang, Xingpu1 aWang, Shengbao,1 aZhang, Pengyang1 aXiao, Chi1 aMaleki Kheimeh Sari, Hirbod1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3927-272X1 aLiu, Jihu1 aJia, Jingchun1 aCao, Bin1 aQin, Jian1 aXiao, Wei1 aZhou, Zhiyou1 aLi, Xifei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4828-41830 tCarbon.g2021 Sept., v. 182 p.109-116dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245015900208520105800367592002801425650000801453650002501461650001701486650001001503650001001513650001301523650001101536650002101547650002501568650000901593650001401602650002301616650002201639650000901661650002501670650002101695650001701716650000901733653001301742653001101755653001901766653001301785653001701798653001401815700002101829700002301850773011201873856008201985852000902067655001202076IND60671779220221120061049.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067177922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2019.1035952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajewski, Michał1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6304-067314aThe antioxidant status, lipid profile, and modulation of vascular function by fish oil supplementation in nano-copper and copper carbonate fed Wistar rats  aCardiovascular alterations can be improved by the long-term use of fish oil (FO), as well as an adequate supply of copper (Cu). Recently, copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), as an alternative to ionic forms (CuCO₃) were found to decrease the level of protein/DNA oxidation.Male Wistar rats were supplemented for 8 weeks with FO (7 g/kg) together with 40 nm sized CuNPs and CuCO₃ (6.5 mg Cu/kg).FO with CuNPs modified the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and decreased Cu concentration in the blood. Meanwhile noradrenaline-induced contraction of an isolated aorta was not altered, but acetylcholine-induced vasodilation was reduced.FO with CuCO₃ increased the antioxidant capacity of blood, and Zn concentration, however decreased the level of triglycerides. Noradrenaline-induced contraction was improved with no change in acetylcholine-induced response.Since the modifications induced by the FO-supplemented diet corresponded with different Cu formulations, the interaction between FO and CuNPs may follow the replacement of CuCO₃ with CuNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaorta 3ablood 3acatalase 3acopper 3acopper carbonate 3acopper nanoparticles 3adiet 3afish oils 3alaboratory animals 3alipid composition 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 3avasodilation 3azinc 0aCatalase 0aCopper 0aCyclooxygenase 0aFish oil 0aNitric oxide 0aPinacidil1 aOgnik, Katarzyna1 aJuśkiewicz, Jerzy0 tJournal of functional foods.g2020 Jan., v. 64 p.103595-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2019.1035953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009600170520095900266592002801225650002401253650001101277650001501288650001501303650002301318650000701341650001801348650001301366650001601379653001501395653002301410700002101433700001601454700001401470700001501484700002001499700002101519700001601540700001801556700001801574700001401592773010601606856008701712852000901799655001201808IND60748312220221119204504.0220110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074831222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1258262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Xiaodong10aAnaerobic digestion of corn straw pretreated by ultrasonic combined with aerobic hydrolysis  aCorn straw (CS) was pretreated by ultrasonic combined aerobic with biogas slurry as medium for anaerobic digestion (AD), that strengthened the degradation efficiency CS, varied in the composition of digestion slurry, thereby the methane production was increased.

However, the preparation of a uniquely structured graphene film with high-quality often requires a complex multi-step technique. Herein, we propose a facile and efficient one-step laser irradiation process for the synthesis of multifunctional laser-induced graphene electrodes consisting of L-shaped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets with vertical alignment (VrGO). Notably, the instantaneous high thermal energy of the laser irradiation can heal the defects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, thus, enhancing the electrical conductivity and crystallinity while inducing the vertical alignment. Additionally, the vertical alignment of high-quality GO nanosheets leads to more isotropic thermal transport, thus, enhancing the out-of-plane thermal conductivity to 6.202 W m⁻¹K⁻¹. GO nanosheets also exhibited superior performances as supercapacitor electrodes, demonstrating an outstanding areal capacitance of 36.8 mF cm⁻² at 1.2 mA cm⁻², and excellent stability up to 10,000 cycles of charging/discharging. This simple laser technique opens up new possibilities for engineering the structural and physical properties of graphene for applications in various fields that require functional thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acrystal structure 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3aisotropy 3ananosheets 3athermal conductivity 3athermal energy 0aGraphene 0aGraphene oxide 0aVertical alignment 0aEnergy storage 0aLaser irradiation1 aJi, Seulgi1 aYoon, Yeoheung1 aKim, Seong Ku1 aSong, Wooseok1 aMyung, Sung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2030-23911 aLim, Jongsun1 aJung, Ha-Kyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8939-18231 aLee, Sun Sook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3518-59521 aAn, Ki-Seok0 tCarbon.g2021 Sept., v. 182 p.691-699dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.05.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03745naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245021500167520159200382592002801974650003402002650002402036650002502060650002502085650001502110650001502125650001602140650002802156650001502184650001202199650002402211650001902235650002002254650002102274650001002295650002202305650001702327650001102344650001302355650002102368650001702389650004402406653002302450653002002473653001702493653001402510653000802524653000802532653000902540653001802549653000802567653000802575653000802583653000802591653000802599653000702607653000802614653000802622653001202630700001502642700001802657700001502675700001702690700001202707700001702719700001702736700001602753773011102769856008602880852000902966655001202975IND60768951420221123014855.0220314e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076895142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2022.1231852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Taiping10aHigh throughput metabolomics explores the mechanism of Jigucao capsules in treating Yanghuang syndrome rats using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight coupled with mass spectrometry  aTo explore the potential mechanism of the Chinese patent medicine Jigucao capsule in treating the serum metabolic profile of rats with Yanghuang syndrome, zingiber officinale Rosc. and ethanol simulates the syndrome background of traditional Chinese medicine and uses α-naphthyl isothiocyanate to induce liver damage in rats to prepare a Yanghuang syndrome model. The histopathological observation and the determination of biochemical indexes evaluate the therapeutic effect of the Jigucao capsule, and the metabolomic method analyzes the mechanism of the Jigucao capsule against Yanghuang syndrome. Jigucao capsule reduces the number of inflammatory cells, inhibits the proliferation of bile duct epithelial cells and hepatocyte necrosis. Compared with Yanghuang syndrome rats, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bile acid were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Furthermore, Jigucao capsule significantly reversed the abnormal levels of glucose 1-phosphate, phenylalanyl-cysteine, taurodeoxycholic acid, lysoPC (22:6 (4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, 19Z), lysoPC (15:0), lysoPC (P-18:0), 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatrieic acid and regulated part of the lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism, Jigucao capsule has a therapeutic effect on Yanghuang syndrome rats.

In the present study, a stepwise approach using hydrothermal and deep eutectic solvents (DES) pretreatment was developed to preferentially dissociate hemicelluloses and further remove lignin from poplar, while retaining a cellulose-rich substrate that can be easily digested via enzymatic saccharification to obtain glucose. Results showed that the hydrothermal filtrate is mainly composed of xylooligosaccharide (XOS), monosaccharides, byproducts, and xylan-type hemicelluloses, which have homogenous structures and uniform molecular weights distribution as well as excellent antioxidant activity. Subsequent DES pretreatment further removed the lignin barriers, leading to a remarkable increase in the saccharification efficiency from 15.72% to 96.33% under optimum conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis. In short, the integrated pretreatment is effective for dissociating and chemical conversion of poplar wood, which was reasonable to promote the frontier of highly available biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3aantioxidant activity 3abiorefining 3acellulose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afiltrates 3afractionation 3aglucose 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3asaccharification 3asolvents 3awood 0aHydrothermal pretreatment 0aDES pretreatment 0aHemicelluloses 0aEnzymatic saccharification 0aPoplar wood1 aXu, Ling-Hua1 aZhang, Chen1 aGuo, Kai-Ning1 aYuan, Tong-Qi1 aWen, Jia-Long0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Dec., v. 341 p.125828-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1258283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009900159300001600258520168000274592002801954650001301982650001301995650002802008650002702036650002802063650002402091650002402115650001202139650002302151650001002174650001502184650001402199650001102213650001402224650003002238650001202268651001102280700001702291700001802308700002202326700002202348700001602370700002102386773012202407856007502529852000902604655001202613IND60534867420221122180231.0160803e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053486742DNAL7 a10.1021/es404220z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharisiadis, P.10aHousehold Cleaning Activities as Noningestion Exposure Determinants of Urinary Trihalomethanes  ap. 770-780.  aPrevious epidemiological studies linking drinking water total trihalomethanes (THM) with pregnancy disorders or bladder cancer have not accounted for specific household cleaning activities that could enhance THM exposures. We examined the relation between household cleaning activities (washing dishes/clothes, mopping, toilet cleaning, and washing windows/surfaces) and urinary THM concentrations accounting for water sources, uses, and demographics. A cross-sectional study (n = 326) was conducted during the summer in Nicosia, Cyprus, linking household addresses to the geocoded public water pipe network, individual household tap water, and urinary THM measurements. Household tap water THM concentrations ranged between 3–129 μg L–¹, while the median (Q1, Q3) creatinine-adjusted urinary THM concentration in females (669 ng g–¹ (353, 1377)) was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that in males (399 ng g–¹, (256, 681)). Exposure assessment, based on THM exposure equivalency units, showed that hand dishwashing, mopping, and toilet cleaning significantly (p < 0.001) increased urinary THM levels. The effect of dishwashing by females ≥36 y of age remained significant, even after adjusting for potential confounders. No significant (p > 0.05) association was observed between ingestion-based THM exposure equivalency units and urinary THM. Noningestion routes of THM exposures during performance of routine household cleaning activities were shown for the first time to exert a major influence on urinary THM levels. It is warranted that future pregnancy–birth cohorts include monitoring of noningestion household THM exposures in their study design.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3aclothing 3across-sectional studies 3ademographic statistics 3aepidemiological studies 3aexperimental design 3aexposure assessment 3afemales 3ahousehold cleaning 3amales 3amonitoring 3apregnancy 3asummer 3atap water 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 3awashing 3aCyprus1 aAndra, S.

Various organic loading rates were applied to the system by modifying the water content in the FW feed and solid retention time (SRT). The excessive organic loading due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from the feed with 80% water content during the short SRT (15 and 20 d) caused system failure. In contrast, more intermediate materials, such as VFAs, was easily converted into methane at higher water contents. In addition, the biogas production rate of dry AD was effectively predicted based on SRT, soluble chemical oxygen demand, total VFA, total ammonia, and free ammonia using a recurrent neural network—the so-called “black-box” model. This implies the feasibility of applying this data-based black-box model for controlling and optimizing complex biological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digestion 3achemical oxygen demand 3afood waste 3agas production (biological) 3amethane 3amodels 3aprediction 3awater content 0aBlack-box model 0aDry anaerobic digestion 0aLSTM 0aRecurrent neural network1 aSeo, Jangwon1 aKim, Kyungil1 aJi Lim, Seung1 aChung, Jaeshik0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Dec., v. 341 p.125829-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1258293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245010900199300001100308520182900319592002802148650001002176650002502186650002502211650002602236650002502262650001002287650001602297650001102313650001102324650000902335650002502344650001602369651001202385700001702397700001702414773012702431856008202558852000902640655001202649IND60611325120221117165618.0181011e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061132512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-018-0592-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeto, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2825-952X10aInteractions between environmental factors and vertical extension of helophyte zones in lakes in Finland  ap. 41.  aSheltered shores in boreal lakes are typically dominated by emergent helophytes in which the perennating organ lies in soil below the water level, but the aerial shoots protrude above the water. Changes in natural water-level regimes due to hydropower development may significantly affect the longitudinal extent of the helophyte zone. We explored the vertical distribution of helophyte zones under water-level regulation to develop tools for estimating hydropower impacts. We recorded the vertical extension of the three most common helophyte species (Carex L. spp., Equisetum fluviatile L., and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.) along 238 macrophyte transects in four regulated lakes and one nonregulated lake in Finland. We used random forest (RF) models to quantify the degree to which water-level fluctuation and site-specific environmental variables uniquely explained the variation in helophyte zonation. The vertical extension of Carex spp. was most strongly associated with the water-level fluctuation of the open-water period (OWP), followed by Phragmites and Equisetum. Overall, the RF models explained 4–41% of the variation observed in the helophyte zones. The models indicated that OWP fluctuation, slope, openness, and cover of other macrophyte groups were key factors explaining the extent of the helophyte zones. OWP fluctuation was the most important variable for zonation of Carex spp. and the upper limit of Phragmites. Slope was the most significant variable for the lower limit of Equisetum and Phragmites. Our study demonstrates the importance of taking into account natural habitat-level variability to increase confidence in quantifying the environmental impacts of hydropower production. This approach could be used in future impact assessments of new water-level regulation practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex 3aEquisetum fluviatile 3aPhragmites australis 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3amodels 3ashoots 3asoil 3aspatial distribution 3awater power 3aFinland1 aAroviita, J.1 aHellsten, S.0 tAquatic sciences.g2018 Oct., v. 80, no. 4 p.41-41dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000051x1015-16217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-018-0592-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012600161300001600287520154900303592002801852650003701880650002901917650001301946650001501959650001101974650001701985650001902002650001102021650001802032650002802050650001502078650002002093650003302113650002202146650003402168700002502202700001702227700001402244700002702258700003102285773012202316856007502438852000902513655001202522IND60534867520221122215051.0160803e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053486752DNAL7 a10.1021/es404232s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Sasson, Moshe10aSurface Functionalization of Thin-Film Composite Membranes with Copper Nanoparticles for Antimicrobial Surface Properties  ap. 384-393.  aBiofouling is a major operational challenge in reverse osmosis (RO) desalination, motivating a search for improved biofouling control strategies. Copper, long known for its antibacterial activity and relatively low cost, is an attractive potential biocidal agent. In this paper, we present a method for loading copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) on the surface of a thin-film composite (TFC) polyamide RO membrane. Cu-NPs were synthesized using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a capping agent, resulting in particles with an average radius of 34 nm and a copper content between 39 and 49 wt.%. The positive charge of the Cu-NPs imparted by the PEI allowed a simple electrostatic functionalization of the negatively charged RO membrane. We confirmed functionalization and irreversible binding of the Cu-NPs to the membrane surface with SEM and XPS after exposing the membrane to bath sonication. We also demonstrated that Cu-NP functionalization can be repeated after the Cu-NPs dissolve from the membrane surface. The Cu-NP functionalization had minimal impact on the intrinsic membrane transport parameters. Surface hydrophilicity and surface roughness were also maintained, and the membrane surface charge became positive after functionalization. The functionalized membrane exhibited significant antibacterial activity, leading to an 80–95% reduction in the number of attached live bacteria for three different model bacterial strains. Challenges associated with this functionalization method and its implementation in RO desalination are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiofouling 3acopper 3adesalination 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aphysiological transport 3apolyamides 3areverse osmosis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface roughness 3athin film composite membranes1 aZodrow, Katherine

An imbalance in the gut microbiota and metabolites can disrupt the function of the intestinal barrier, cause changes in the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and promote the immune inflammatory response, thereby aggravating the fluctuation of blood glucose level and promoting the occurrence and development of the chronic complications of DM. Manipulating the GM and metabolites is a promising therapeutic intervention and is being studied extensively. Shenqi compound (SQC) is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation, which has been widely used to improve T2DM. Studies have demonstrated that SQC can reduce glycemic variability, alleviate the inflammatory response, etc. However, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, in this experiment, We administered SQC to Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and evaluated its effect on blood glucose homeostasis and the intestinal mucosal barrier. We identified the profiles of the GM and metabolites with the aid of 16S rDNA gene sequencing and non-target metabolomics analysis. It showed that SQC intervention could reduce glycemic variability, regulate serum levels of glucagon and insulin, and improve injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier of GK rats. In the gut, the ratio of bacteria of the phyla Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes could be improved after SQC intervention. SQC also regulated the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae, Butyricimonas, Bacteroides, Blautia, Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Rothia. We found out that expression of 40 metabolites was significantly improved after SQC intervention. Further analyses of metabolic pathways indicated that the therapeutic effect of SQC might be related predominantly to its ability to improve gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, citrate cycle, and butanoate metabolism. These results suggest that SQC may exert a beneficial role in T2DM by modulating the GM and metabolites in different pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aLactobacillus 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aRoseburia 3aamino acid metabolism 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abutyrates 3achromatography 3agenes 3aglucagon 3agluconeogenesis 3aglycolysis 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apermeability 3atherapeutics 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aShenqi compound 0aGlycemic variability 0aIntestinal mucosal barrier 0aGut microbiota 0aMetabolites 0aGC 0aGK 0aGM 0aGV 0aHPLC 0aINS 0aLAGE 0aLPS 0aMBG 0aSCFAs 0aSDBG 0aSQC 0aTCM 0aT2DM 0aUPLC-QTOF/MS 0aVIP 0aZO-11 aWang, Heting1 aXie, Chunguang1 aHu, Zhipeng1 aZhang, Yuan1 aPeng, Sihan1 aHe, Yuchi1 aKang, Jian1 aGao, Hong1 aYuan, Haipo1 aLiu, Ya1 aFan, Gang0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 1194 p.123189-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2022.1231893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245014600186300001400332520171600346592002802062650001102090650002902101650001902130650001302149650001102162650002902173650001502202650004402217650003702261650005002298650004302348650004402391650003102435650001302466650002402479650002402503650001502527650004602542650004302588650004402631700002002675773010002695856008702795852000902882655001202891IND4466964120221118060007.0141112e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446696412DNAL7 a226345532pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.04.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Si-Hyun10aReductive dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons as non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL): Preliminary investigation on effects of cement doses  ap. 82-87.  aThe reactivities of various types of iron mixtures to degrade chlorinated hydrocarbons (PCE, TCE and 1,1,1-TCA) in the form of non-aqueous phase liquids were investigated. The iron mixtures included a mixture of Fe(II) and Portland cement (Fe(II)-C), a mixture of Fe(II), Fe(III) and Ca(OH)₂ (Fe(II/III)-L), and a mixture of Fe(II), Fe(III), Ca(OH)₂, and Portland cement (Fe(II/III)-C). When the same amount of Fe(II) was used, Fe(II)-C was more reactive with chlorinated ethylenes (i.e. PCE and TCE) than Fe(II/III)-L. The reductive pathway for high concentrations of total PCE (i.e. above solubility) with Fe(II)-C was determined to be a combination of two-electron transfer, β-elimination and hydrogenolysis. Increasing the cement dose from 5% to 10% in Fe(II)-C did not affect PCE dechlorination rates, but it did favor the β-elimination pathway. In addition, when Fe(II/III)-C with 5%C was used, PCE dechlorination was similar to that by Fe(II)-C, but this mixture did not effectively degrade TCE. A modified second-order kinetic model was developed and shown to appropriately describe degradation of TCE at high concentrations. Fe(II/III)-L effectively degraded high concentrations of 1,1,1-TCA at rates that were similar to those obtained with Fe(II)-C using 10% C. Moreover, both increasing cement doses and the presence of Fe(III) increased dechlorination rates of 1,1,1-TCA, which was mainly through the hydrogenolysis pathway. The reactivity of Fe(II/III)-L was strongly dependent on the target compound (i.e. less reactivity with TCE, more with 1,1,1-TCA). Therefore, Fe(II/III)-L could be a potential mixture for degrading 1,1,1-TCA, but it should be modified to degrade TCE more effectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3adechlorination 3aethylene 3amodels 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3asolubility 2aCalcium Hydroxidexanalysisxchemistry. 2aConstruction Materialsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aFerric Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFerrous Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aModels, Theoretical 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSolubility 2aTetrachloroethylenexanalysisxchemistry. 2aTrichloroethanesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aTrichloroethylenexanalysisxchemistry.1 aBatchelor, Bill0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 July 15, v. 430 p.82-87dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.04.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008800156300001500244500002000259520147900279592002801758650002601786650001801812650001601830650001701846650000901863650001701872650001901889650001301908650002601921650001201947700006001959700001802019700002102037700002102058700002702079700002002106700001702126700002902143700001902172773014802191856007302339852000902412655001202421IND60681325920221120104721.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068132592DNAL7 a10.1111/vec.129102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogers, Erin10aPrevalence and impact of cholecystitis on outcome in dogs with gallbladder mucocele  ap. 97-101.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Gallbladder mucocele is a potentially life‐threatening extrahepatic biliary disease in dogs. The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of cholecystitis in dogs with gross and histopathologically confirmed gallbladder mucocele and to investigate if there is an association between cholecystitis, including its subtypes (eg, acute, acute on chronic, with necrosis, chronic), and survival. Our secondary objective was to evaluate if there is an association between cholecystitis and intraoperative bacteriological culture positivity. KEY FINDINGS: Two hundred nineteen dogs with gallbladder mucocele were included in this multi‐institutional retrospective study, of which 63 (28.8%) dogs had histopathological evidence of cholecystitis. The most common forms of cholecystitis were acute on chronic (n = 22/63, 34.9%) and with necrosis (n = 20, 31.7%). Thirty‐one (14.1%) dogs had growth of at least 1 bacterial isolate; however, 88.7% had antimicrobials administered within the 48 hours before surgery or intraoperatively. There was not an association between cholecystitis or its subtypes and survival. Furthermore, there was not an association between cholecystitis and intraoperative bacteriological culture positivity. A total of 38 (17.4%) dogs either died or were euthanized during hospitalization. SIGNIFICANCE: Cholecystitis is a common comorbidity in dogs with gallbladder mucocele but was not associated with decreased survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective agents 3acholecystitis 3acomorbidity 3adog diseases 3adogs 3agall bladder 3ahistopathology 3anecrosis 3aretrospective studies 3asurgery1 aJaffey, Jared A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0270-47281 aGraham, Amber1 aHostnik, Eric T.1 aJacobs, Casandra1 aFox‐Alvarez, William1 aVan Eerde, Eric1 aArango, John1 aWilliams, Fred, IIIcIII1 aDeClue, Amy E.0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2020 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.97-101dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl69848x1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vec.129103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010500170300001600275520113400291592002801425650000801453650000901461650001201470650001701482650001901499650001301518650002101531650001901552700001801571700002401589773011801613856008201731852000901813655001201822IND60619006620221122132653.0181030e196805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061900662DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517568038005032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiles, Charles H.10aAnomalous Lightfastness in Disperse-Dyed Systems and its Significance in Studies of Fading Mechanism  ap. 467-474.  aA few dyes and fluorescent brightening agents of disperse type, in hydrophobic substrates, show anomalous fading characteristics, i.e., reduced lightfastness with in creased dye concentration, a reversal of the normal trend. Measurements, by the density gradient method, of the change of apparent specific gravity of dyed film material with change in dye concentration reveal a marked difference between the nature of this change as between anomalous and normal dyes. The effect is, therefore, due to physical changes in the substrate, probably in its porosity, produced in the dyeing process. The facts are consistent with the hypothesis that the anomalous dyes at moderate concentrations do not penetrate as deeply into the substrate structure as normal dyes do. They may tend to block the entrance to internal pores whereby the apparent specific gravity is reduced and, by remaining outside these pores, they are more readily accessible to air and moisture. The wider implication of the results is that changes in lightfastness, even as much as five-fold, can be produced solely by physical changes in the substrate structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adyes 3afabrics 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3aporosity 3aspecific gravity 3atextile fibers1 aYabe, Akihiko1 aShah, Champaklal D.0 tTextile research journal.g1968 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.467-474dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517568038005033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03836naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015200167506011700319506007600436520164400512592002802156506003702184650002802221650001502249650002202264650001602286650002802302650003202330650001402362650001602376650000902392650001502401650002002416650002602436650002302462650001302485650002002498650003002518650001502548650001202563650003802575650001202613650001602625653002902641653001502670653004102685653002602726653002002752700002002772700001602792700001302808700001702821700002002838700002002858700001502878700001602893700001902909700001302928700001602941773010002957856008403057852000903141655001203150IND60755161520221207104719.0220726e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075516152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1009242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ling-Ling10aGrowth performance, intestinal microbiota and immune response of grass carp fed isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets containing faba bean extracts  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFunctionally active components of faba bean (Vicia faba, FB) are known to improve the muscle texture and growth performance of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), but this has not yet been proven by feeding trials using isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets. Here, we formulated isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets containing four types of FB extracts and examined their effects on the weight gain, textural quality, intestinal microbiota, metabolic enzymes and immune response of grass carp by a 100-day feeding trial. An isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diet with no FB extracts (control) and whole FB were also used. Compared to the control, the FB water extract diet increased weight gain, muscle hardness and chewiness, intestinal microbiota diversity, the activity of metabolic enzymes including lipase (LP), glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-P), acetyl-CoA and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (P < 0.05). The FB alcohol extract diet also increased weight gain, intestinal microbiota diversity, but the total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) contents were also increased (P < 0.05). The FB protein extract and FB residues diets had negative and no effects on weight gain, respectively, and caused intestinal microbiota disorder. FB water and alcohol extracts enhanced intestinal amino acids metabolism, whereas FB water extract and residues enhanced intestinal carbohydrate metabolism. These results further extend previous findings that FB water and alcohol extracts contain most functionally active components of FB, opening up the possibility that these extracts can be used as functional feed additives for freshwater fish.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aVicia faba 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aaquaculture 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3achewiness 3acholesterol 3adiet 3afaba beans 3afreshwater fish 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3agrowth performance 3ahardness 3aimmune response 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amuscles 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3atexture 3aweight gain 0aCtenopharyngodon idellus 0aVicia faba 0aIsonitrogenous and isoenergetic diet 0aIntestinal microbiota 0aImmune response1 aZhang, Jun-Ming1 aKaneko, Gen1 aXie, Jun1 aSun, Jin-Hui1 aWang, Guang-Jun1 aTian, Jing-Jing1 aZhang, Kai1 aLi, Zhi-Fei1 aGong, Wang-Bao1 aXia, Yun1 aYu, Er-Meng0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 Feb., v. 22 p.100924-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1009243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04121naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100003600158245006600194300001400260520194000274592002802214650002802242650003202270650002102302650002502323650003202348650002502380650002302405650001402428650000902442650002202451650001502473650001202488650000902500650001802509650002702527650002002554650001602574650002502590650001002615650003102625650003902656650001302695650001602708650001402724650003302738650001302771650003902784650001902823650002802842650001802870650001602888650001202904650001202916653001302928653001502941653000802956700002302964700002502987700002303012700002403035700001903059700002003078700002003098700002003118700002403138773009903162856009303261852000903354655001203363IND60662994220221122183443.0191025e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066299422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMogielnicka-Brzozowska, Marzena10aProteome of cat semen obtained after urethral catheterization  ap. 68-81.  aThe binding of seminal plasma (SP) proteins by spermatozoa plays an important role in the regulation of sperm epididymal maturation, motility gaining in female reproductive tracts and sperm-egg interaction. The aim of the study was to analyze the SP and sperm extracts proteome of cat (Felis catus) semen. The seminal plasma and spermatozoa were obtained by urethra catheterization from 10 male cats. Proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer and separated by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gels were analyzed using MultiAnalyst software. The proteins were subsequently analyzed using NanoUPLC-Q-TOF/MS. UniProt database-supported identification resulted in 106 proteins identified in the cat SP and 98 proteins in the extracts of spermatozoa. Based on a gene ontology analysis, dominant molecular functions of feline SP proteins were binding, catalytic, and antioxidant activity (56%, 33%, and 11% of cases, respectively). The molecular functions of sperm extracts proteins were mainly involved in catalytic activity (41%) and binding (23%). The proteins present in both, the SP and spermatozoa's extracts, were: serum albumin (ALB), semenogelin 2 (SEMG 2), clusterin (CLU), lactoferrin (LTF), prostatic acid phosphatase (ACPP), prolactin inducible protein (PIP), negative elongation factor E (NELF-E) and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase (ENPP3). Protein-protein interactions analysis showed significant connection for 12 proteins in the cat semen. The seminal plasma proteins which, with high probability score, participate in important metabolic pathways are: glutathione peroxidases (GPx5 and 6), prostatic acid phosphatase (ACPP), β-hexosaminidase (HEXB), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and serpin family F member 1 (SERPINF1). For sperm protein extracts it were: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHB), succinate-CoA-ligase (SUCLA2), malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5F1A) and tubulin beta (TUBB).  aPublisher supplied data 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aacid phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3abiochemical pathways 3acatalytic activity 3acatheters 3acats 3acomputer software 3aepididymis 3afemales 3agels 3agene ontology 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aimmunoglobulins 3alactoferrin 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amales 3apeptide elongation factors 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymers 3aprobability 3aprolactin 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteome 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3aseminal plasma 3aseminal plasma proteins 3aserum albumin 3aspermatozoa 3atubulin 3aurethra 0aProteins 0aProteomics 0aCat1 aProchowska, Sylwia1 aNiżański, Wojciech1 aBromke, Mariusz A.1 aWiśniewski, Jerzy,1 aOlejnik, Beata1 aKuzborska, Anna1 aFraser, Leyland1 aMłynarz, Piotr1 aKordan, Władysław0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 141 p.68-81dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04731naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010000166300001800266500002000284520179200304592002802096596007402124596004702198596004702245596004702292596004702339596005902386596005302445650001102498650001202509650001502521650002102536650001302557650003102570650001502601650001702616650001402633650002402647650001002671700005902681700006302740700006802803700006002871700006302931700006002994700006103054700006303115700006503178700006503243700006403308700006303372700006003435700002003495700005903515700002103574700006103595700006103656700005803717700006003775773012103835856008003956852000904036655001204045IND60779618420221121043635.0220613e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077961842DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.138782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGill, Allison L.10aNitrogen increases early‐stage and slows late‐stage decomposition across diverse grasslands  ap. 1376-1389.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo evaluate how increased anthropogenic nutrient inputs alter carbon cycling in grasslands, we conducted a litter decomposition study across 20 temperate grasslands on three continents within the Nutrient Network, a globally distributed nutrient enrichment experiment We determined the effects of addition of experimental nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium plus micronutrient (Kμ) on decomposition of a common tree leaf litter in a long‐term study (maximum of 7 years; exact deployment period varied across sites). The use of higher order decomposition models allowed us to distinguish between the effects of nutrients on early‐ versus late‐stage decomposition. Across continents, the addition of N (but not other nutrients) accelerated early‐stage decomposition and slowed late‐stage decomposition, increasing the slowly decomposing fraction by 28% and the overall litter mean residence time by 58%. Synthesis. Using a novel, long‐term cross‐site experiment, we found widespread evidence that N enhances the early stages of above‐ground plant litter decomposition across diverse and widespread temperate grassland sites but slows late‐stage decomposition. These findings were corroborated by fitting the data to multiple decomposition models and have implications for N effects on soil organic matter formation. For example, following N enrichment, increased microbial processing of litter substrates early in decomposition could promote the production and transfer of low molecular weight compounds to soils and potentially enhance the stabilization of mineral‐associated organic matter. By contrast, by slowing late‐stage decomposition, N enrichment could promote particulate organic matter (POM) accumulation. Such hypotheses deserve further testing.  aPublisher supplied data  aDG‐0001‐13cInstitute on the Environment, University of Minnesota  aDEB‐0620652cNational Science Foundation  aDEB‐1042132cNational Science Foundation  aDEB‐1234162cNational Science Foundation  aDEB‐1556529cNational Science Foundation  cUniversity of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences  cUniversity of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute 3acarbon 3aecology 3agrasslands 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3aparticulate organic matter 3aphosphorus 3aplant litter 3apotassium 3asoil organic matter 3atrees1 aAdler, Peter B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4216-40091 aBorer, Elizabeth T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2259-58531 aBuyarski, Christopher R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7080-89781 aCleland, Elsa E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3920-00291 aD'Antonio, Carla M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0395-96501 aDavies, Kendi F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7716-33591 aGruner, Daniel S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3153-42971 aHarpole, W.

Myogenic and adipogenic cells come from a similar pool of progenitor cells. We hypothesized that adipogenic differentiation was primed in high marbling cattle. To test, two groups of cattle with high and low marbling levels were selected from a uniform group of cattle with the same genetic background and management. By RNA-sequencing, differentially expressed genes were identified. Myogenic genes (eg. MyoG) were up-regulated in the low marbling group, while apolipoprotein E genes (eg. APOE) were down-regulated. Meanwhile, the expression of fibrogenic genes was mixed, with collagen isoforms, COL11A2 and COL22A1 more highly expressed in the high marbling group, and COL14A1, COL16A1, COL1A1 and COL1A2 more lowly expressed. In summary, our data show that adipogenesis was elevated in high marbling cattle accompanied by weakened myogenesis, pointing to the developmental origins of differences in beef marbling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3aapolipoprotein E 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3acollagen 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic background 3aintramuscular fat 3alongissimus muscle 3amarbling 3amuscle development 3asequence analysis 3astem cells 0aFibrogenesis 0aMyogenesis 0aRNA-Sequencing1 aLi, Yuqiu,1 aDu, Min1 aCao, Binghai0 tLivestock science.g2019 Nov., v. 229 p.188-193dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2019.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245011400179300001300293520132800306592002801634650002201662650002001684650001301704650002001717650001101737650001201748650001001760650001301770650003301783650001301816650001001829651001201839653002101851653001601872653001401888653002001902653001301922653001701935700001901952700001801971700002001989700002102009773009402030856008502124852000902209655001202218IND60481392620221119014920.0160204e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048139262DNAL7 a10.1080/21658005.2015.11261562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBensouilah, Taqiyeddine10aVariation in nest placement by the European Greenfinch Chloris chloris in relation to the age of orange trees  ap. 9-14.  aSeveral studies have been performed to investigate the impact of tree characteristics on nest placement in canopy by nesting passerines. Although the breeding ecology of the European Greenfinch Chloris chloris was studied previously, the knowledge of its nest placement and nesting behavior is still scarce. This study aimed to examine the impact of the age of orange orchards Citrus sinensis on nest location within trees. During two consecutive breeding seasons (2013–2014), nest placement was studied in two different age categories of orange orchards in Guelma region, Northeast Algeria. The principal component analysis was performed to demonstrate the variability of nest placement with the age of orange plantation. Results indicated that nest placement in orange orchards is highly variable. The comparison of the two orchards with different age and structural characteristics revealed that nest placement in trees differed in all measured parameters. The Greenfinch nests are placed gradually higher and further from the main trunk as trees grow older. Although the relative vertical position of the nest rises with the age of trees, its relative horizontal position in the canopy does not change. These results demonstrate plasticity of this finch species in nest placement in orange plantations of this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarduelis chloris 3aCitrus sinensis 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3acanopy 3anesting 3anests 3aorchards 3aprincipal component analysis 3atree age 3atrees 3aAlgeria 0aBreeding ecology 0anest height 0apasserine 0aorange orchards 0afarmland 0aNorth Africa1 aBrahmia, Hafid1 aZeraoula, Ali1 aBouslama, Zihad1 aHouhamdi, Moussa0 tZoology and ecology.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 26, no. 1 p.9-14dTaylor & Francisx2165-80137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21658005.2015.11261563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013200170520257000302592002802872650002302900650001002923650001502933650001002948650001402958650001402972650001302986650001002999650002103009650001403030650002103044650001903065650001803084653002303102653002103125653002003146653002303166653001803189653001903207700002003226700002003246773010203266856008503368852000903453655001203462IND60768951920221123015013.0220614e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076895192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.1016082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerot, Jonathan10aEnhanced understanding of physicochemical constraints on Corbicula japonica habitat in Lake Shinji assisted by machine learning  aThe catch of Corbicula japonica is one of the top three in Japan's inland water fisheries. Most of the Japanese fishing stock of this bivalve comes from Lake Shinji. Since the 1980's the catch of this species declined drastically with strong inter-annual variation. New recruitment and poor growth of the clams were thought to be the main reasons for this decline. This bivalve has a poor transportation ability after the settlement. Therefore, it is also important to know their suitable habit that is affected by multi interacting parameters of water qualities and sediments. In order to get a better understanding of their habitat, we used machine learning models to test abiotic limiting factors. The database that we used in our study included 337 sampling stations with 7 physicochemical variables and the Corbicula japonica counting which was divided into two size categories: small (shell length < 4 mm) and large (shell length ≥ 4 mm). Due to their low self-transportation ability, their survival is primarily influenced by the site environment, such as water quality and sediment conditions. To extract physicochemical thresholds that directly impact these clam populations, we applied a coupled methodology based on a random forest model and partial dependence plots. We highlighted that the use of three different populations groups for each size category, allowed us to significantly increase the accuracy of our model to predict groups. Moreover, our results show that the three most influential predictors were, in order of importance, the water depth, ignition loss of the bottom sediments and silt clay (diameter ≤ 0.063 mm) content of the bottom sediments; with, respectively, the following physicochemical limitations for the preferable habitat: 4 m, 10% and 45%. These limitations are based on the thresholds that we extracted from the coupling between a Random Forest model and the partial dependence plots. Our findings emphasize that this coupled methodology has the advantage of being able to manage the zero values of population and give graphical interpretation of the limiting environmental factors. Consequently, the results that we presented here clearly demonstrate a further step towards comprehension of the inter-annual variations in the fishery resources of Corbicula japonica after accounting for the impact of new recruitment. In addition, this kind of numerical tool could help the local government to manage the clam's population by restoring and conserving the water quality and sediment conditions of the lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorbicula japonica 3aJapan 3aalgorithms 3aclams 3adatabases 3afisheries 3ahabitats 3alakes 3alocal government 3asediments 3asilty clay soils 3atransportation 3awater quality 0aCommercial fishing 0aMachine learning 0aBivalve habitat 0aCorbicula japonica 0aRandom forest 0aBrackish water1 aYajima, Hiroshi1 aNakamura, Mikio0 tEcological informatics.g2022 July, v. 69 p.101608-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.1016083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008800178520137200266592002801638650001501666650001101681650001401692650001201706650001301718650001501731650003501746650001301781650001901794650002201813651001101835653002401846653001401870653001901884653001901903700002801922700003701950773011701987856008202104852000902186655001202195IND60768952020221123014832.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076895202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2022.1261522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Escarlett de Arruda10aLandscape Transformations and loss of Atlantic Forests: challenges for conservation  aRegions of intense fragmentation and landscape transformation can indicate patterns of conversion of forest areas in space and time, challenging the resilience of ecosystems and driving the degradation of natural resources. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of use, loss, and gain of Atlantic forests in the southern region of Bahia State in the last thirty-four years (1985–2019) based on pre and post-implementation of forest production policies. The area has ecological, historical, and cultural importance, and is the most conserved portion of the Atlantic Forest in northeastern Brazil. From the remote sensing products of the MapBiomas Project and spatial analyses of land use and forests, we evaluated a conflicted region that has 751 km of coastline and seventy municipalities. Our results indicate a degraded landscape, with 59% of the territory occupied by anthropogenic activities and intense fragmentation. The planting of eucalyptus forests and pasture stood out as landscape modifiers. The results show a loss of 328,595 ha of Atlantic Forest in the period under study, with a large part of this area being replaced by planted forests of Eucalyptus sp derivated the policies economics of the sector. It is urgent to consider the recovery of the Atlantic domain, prioritizing the capacity of ecosystems, especially in the Decade of Restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3acoasts 3aeconomics 3aforests 3aland use 3alandscapes 3anatural resources conservation 3apastures 3aspace and time 3atimber production 3aBrazil 0aLand and forest use 0aMapBiomas 0aRemote sensing 0aSouthern Bahia1 aNuvoloni, Felipe Micali1 aLopes, Elfany Reis do Nascimento0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2022 Apr., v. 66 p.126152-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2022.1261523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245014100180300001800321520051400339592002800853650001500881650001700896650002500913650001400938650002200952650001700974650001200991650002301003650001601026650001701042650004001059650003101099650001201130650007001142650003701212650005701249650006201306650006101368650002401429650000901453650002201462650002601484700001301510700001501523700001801538700001601556700001501572700001801587700001701605773010901622856008101731990002301812852000901835655001201844IND60090628920221119151851.0141102e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009062892DNAL7 a215150602pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.03.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wei10aSynthesis and biological evaluation of new flavonoid fatty acid esters with anti-adipogenic and enhancing glucose consumption activities  ap. 3192-3203.  aOleoyl Formononetin (OF) has good weight loss activity and hypolipidemic activity, could improve insulin sensitivity and suppress adipogenesis.

Our pervious study documented an interesting phenomenon, i.e. GABA accumulation was involved in abamectin resistance in the carmine spider mite, Tetranychus cinnabarinus. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon remains to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the interaction between abamectin and GABAR. Firstly, an artificial increase of GABA content was conducted in T. cinnabarinus and toxicity assays showed that GABA accumulation could indeed increase the tolerance of T. cinnabarinus to abamectin in vivo. Subsequently a GABAR of T. cinnabarinus, RDL2, was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and its sensitiveness to abamectin was detected. The results revealed that RDL2 showed significant responses to a series of GABA concentrations and GABA inhibited the effect of abamectin in vitro, providing direct evidence of the abamectin resistance mediated by GABA content. Our data confirmed that GABAR is the action target of abamectin and the GABA accumulation is one of the mechanisms of abamectin resistance in spider mites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetranychus cinnabarinus 3aXenopus 3aabamectin 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agamma-aminobutyric acid receptors 3ainsecticides 3aoocytes 3atoxicity 0aγ-aminobutyric acid receptor 0aMites 0aAction mode 0aResistance1 aHu, Yuan1 aHu, Jia1 aQi, Cuicui1 aZhang, Mengyu1 aXu, Qiang1 aHe, Lin0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2020 Mar., v. 164 p.191-195dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007400168300001600242520147100258592002801729650002101757650002101778650001501799650001001814650002501824650001201849650002201861650001701883650001501900650004301915650005201958650001702010650001302027650001602040650001902056650002402075650001702099650001302116650002202129650004002151653001202191653002302203653004002226653001202266700001402278700001802292700001902310700001902329700001502348700002002363700001302383700001702396773015602413856008602569852000902655655001202664IND60630207120221120111708.0190416e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063020712DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(18)61957-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQIU, You-wen10aGsMAPK4, a positive regulator of soybean tolerance to salinity stress  ap. 372-380.  aSalt stress is one of the major factors affecting plant growth and yield in soybean under saline soil condition. Despite many studies on salinity tolerance of soybean during the past few decades, the detailed signaling pathways and the signaling molecules for salinity tolerance regulation have not been clarified. In this study, a proteomic technology based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to identify proteins responsible for salinity tolerance in soybean plant. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB) were used to verify the results of 2-DE/MS. Based on the results of 2-DE and MS, we selected glucosyltransferase (GsGT4), 4-coumarate, coenzyme A ligase (Gs4CL1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (GsMAPK4), dehydration responsive element binding protein (GsDREB1), and soybean cold-regulated gene (GsSRC1) in the salinity tolerant soybean variety, and GsMAPK4 for subsequent research. We transformed soybean plants with mitogen-activated-protein kinase 4 (GsMAPK4) and screened the resulting transgenics soybean plants using PCR and WB, which confirmed the expression of GsMAPK4 in transgenic soybean. GsMAPK4-overexpressed transgenic plants showed significantly increased tolerance to salt stress, suggesting that GsMAPK4 played a pivotal role in salinity tolerance. Our research will provide new insights for better understanding the salinity tolerance regulation at molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abinding proteins 3acoenzyme A 3agenes 3aglucosyltransferases 3aligases 3amass spectrometry 3aplant growth 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asignal transduction 3asoil quality 3asoybeans 3atransgenic plants 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0asoybean 0asalinity tolerance 0atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0aGsMAPK41 aFENG, Zhe1 aFU, Ming-ming1 aYUAN, Xiao-han1 aLUO, Chao-chao1 aYU, Yan-bo1 aFENG, Yan-zhong1 aWei, Qi,1 aLi, Fenglan,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2019 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.372-380dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

It is common practice to prefer the screening method with the smallest root mean square error (RMSE), least-significant difference (LSD), or coefficient of variation (CV). However, valid comparison based on the RMSE or LSD requires both methods to have the same scale while the CV is only applicable if the scales are proportional to each other. Most plant disease-screening methods developed for the same disease have different scales and, generally, it is not clear that the scales are proportional. The sensitivity ratio is a statistic specifically developed for comparing different measuring methods and is not based on any particular assumption about how the scales are related. We use the sensitivity ratio to compare two white mold [Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) deBary] resistance screening methods on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and two methods of evaluating pathogen isolate aggressiveness on dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Our results suggest that the sensitivity ratio should be used when comparing plant disease-screening methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3agermplasm screening 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resources 3adata analysis 3aaccuracy1 aEskridge, Kent M.1 aSteadman, James R.1 aMadisa, Gabotepele0 tCrop science.g2009 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.153-160dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2008.03.0167sc3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02818naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010600162300001600268520163300284592002801917650004401945650001501989650001302004650001302017650002002030650001902050650001302069650002102082650000902103650001602112650001102128650002202139650001802161650001102179700002402190773012202214856007502336852000902411655001202420IND60534867920221122180239.0160803e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053486792DNAL7 a10.1021/es404321s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTofan-Lazar, Julia10aSurface Water Enhances the Uptake and Photoreactivity of Gaseous Catechol on Solid Iron(III) Chloride  ap. 394-402.  aUptake and photoreactivity of catechol–Fe complexes are investigated at the gas/solid interface under humid and dry conditions, along with the nature of the hydrogen-bonding network of adsorbed water. Catechol was chosen as a simple model for organics in aerosols. Iron chloride was used to distinguish ionic mobility from binding to coordinated iron(III) in hematite. Studies were conducted using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy as a function of irradiation time. Results show that adsorbed water at 30% relative humidity (RH), not light, increases the concentration of adsorbed catechol by a factor of 3 over 60 min relative to dry conditions. Also, our data show that, at 30% RH and under light and dark conditions, growth factors describing the concentration of adsorbed catechol are very similar suggesting that light does not significantly enhance the uptake of catechol vapor on FeCl₃. Surface water also enhances the initial photodecay kinetics of catechol–Fe complexes at 30% RH by a factor of 10 relative to control experiments (RH < 1%, or no FeCl₃ under humid conditions). Absorptions assigned to carbonyl groups were not observed with irradiation time, which was explained by the dominance of FeCl²⁺ species relative to FeOH²⁺ in the highly acidic “quasi-liquid” phase at 30% RH.

The traces under fingernails represent valuable forensic evidence because DNA profiling can indicate from whom the trace originated and proteomic methods can be used to determine the type of fluid in the trace, thus providing evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the crime. Here, we present an initial study of an analytical strategy that involves two complementary techniques, direct PCR DNA profiling and direct mass spectrometry-based protein biomarker detection, for the comprehensive examination of traces of biological fluids gathered from underneath fingernails. With regard to protein biomarker detection, direct MALDI-ToF MS/MS is very sensitive, allowing results to be obtained from biological material present on only a few fibres plucked from a microswab used to collect the traces. Human cornulin, a protein biomarker for vaginal fluid, could be detected up to 5 h after it had been deposited under fingernails whereas haemoglobin, a biomarker for blood, is somewhat more persistent under fingernails and could be detected up to 18 h post-deposition. Bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry techniques were used to provide a high level of confidence in assigning the identity of protein biomarkers. nLC-ESI-qToF MS/MS offered higher levels of confidence and the ability to detect traces that had been present under fingernails for longer periods of time, but this performance came with the cost of longer analysis time and a more laborious sampling approach.

The BF₄– anion inside the central cavity serves as a template, causing the outer two pockets to show a tremendous affinity for allosteric binding of two small chloride anions. Here we show that derivatization of the ligand backbone with a bulky aryl substituent allows us to control the dimerization and hence the guest-binding ability of the cage by the choice of the templating anion. Steric constraints imposed by L² prevent the large BF₄– anion from serving as a template for the formation of interpenetrated double cages. Instead, a single isomer of the monomeric cage [Pd₂L²₄] is formed. Addition of the small anionic template Cl– permits dimerization, yielding the interpenetrated double cage [Cl@Pd₄L²₈], whose enlarged outer pockets show a preference for the binding of large anions such as ReO₄–.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3achlorides 3aderivatization 3adimerization 3aisomers 3aligands1 aMichel, Reent1 aStalke, Dietmar1 aPawliczek, Martin1 aFrauendorf, Holm1 aClever, Guido H.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 June 12, v. 135, no. 23 p.8476-8479dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja403184a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245019200192300001600384520095800400592002801358650002101386650001301407650001901420650003901439650001801478650001701496650001201513650001301525650003101538650005801569650003301627650002001660650002401680650003401704650002401738650003801762650002601800650003501826700001801861700002001879700003101899700001701930773009601947856004802043852000902091655001202100IND4479194320221119084246.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447919432DNAL7 a219839712pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-011-0765-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchenkmayerová, Andrea10aViability of free and encapsulated Escherichia coli overexpressing cyclopentanone monooxygenase monitored during model Baeyer–Villiger biooxidation by confocal laser scanning microscopy  ap. 309-314.  aBaeyer–Villiger biooxidation of 4-methylcyclohexanone–5-methyloxepane-2-one catalysed by recombinant Escherichia coli overexpressing cyclopentanone monooxygenase encapsulated in polyelectrolyte complex capsules was used to investigate effect of substrate conversion on the viability of cells.

Viability of encapsulated cells decreased with increasing substrate concentration from 99 ± 1 to 83 ± 4%, while substrate conversions from decreased 100 to 6 ± 1%. Storage stabilization of encapsulated cells was observed by increased substrate conversion form 68 ± 2 to 96 ± 3%.

Based on previous studies on tangible service quality, a total of 29 tangible service attributes were identified. Through the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), five underlying dimensions of tangible service attributes were first delineated: presentation value, table aesthetics, sensory perceptions, hygiene purity, and vehicle convenience. The results of multiple regression analyses indicate that statistically significant causal relationship between tangible service factors and the diners’ satisfaction exist within the upscale dining segment.

It has been found that these charac teristics change with the age of the animal, their magnitudes mostly increasing. Partic ularly interesting are the changes in birefringence, which increases from 0.0090 at lamb's birth to 0.0128 after 365 days, and changes in the degree of crystallinity which vary within the range of 26-32%, depending on the fiber growth.

Two different experiments employing randomized post-test only with control group designs were executed. In Study 1, consumers’ motivations were moderately primed; the results supported regulatory focus theory in that a promotion prime led to an increase in food portion size behavior, and a prevention prime caused a decrease in food portion size behavior. In Study 2, consumers’ motivations were primed more subtly. When primed subtly or implicitly, regulatory focus theory was supported only for promotion-oriented consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3aconsumers (people) 3afocus groups 3afood advertising 3amotivation 3aportion size 0aFood portion size 0amotivational priming 0aobesity 0aregulatory focus theory1 aChakrabarty, Subhra1 aKinard, Brian R.0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2016 Jan. 1, v. 19, no. 1 p.39-55dRoutledgex1537-80397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2016.11292173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01779naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245009200180520080600272592002801078650001101106650001101117650000801128650001601136650001301152650000901165653001201174653002301186653001101209653001101220653002101231773009401252856008601346852000901432655001201441IND60755162320221119171326.0211106e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075516232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e082412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez-Martinez, Moises10aHarbor and coastal structures: A review of mechanical fatigue under random wave loading  aHarbor and coastal structures are essential in maritime connections. Additionally, some offshore structures near the coast are important for supplying energy as a material or transforming the natural resources into energy, as in wind turbines. One of the main issues that needs to be overcome in terms of these structures is mechanical fatigue due to the loads of the structure by its function and waves, wind, the current seawater level, and ice. Structural design has to meet high target loads to ensure that structures can endure extreme marine conditions under the assumption of the probability of loads and based on marine conditions, can mask damage where component immersions are not available for inspection. In this work, the wave loads and fatigue damage under random processes are reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aenergy 3aice 3aprobability 3aseawater 3awind 0aCoastal 0aMechanical fatigue 0aDamage 0aHarbor 0aRandom processes0 tHeliyon.g2021 Oct., v. 7, no. 10 p.e08241-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e082413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170300001400308520067900322592002801001650001601029650001801045650001801063650002201081650002101103653003301124653003401157653002201191653002601213700002201239700002201261700002601283700002701309773013801336856008501474852000901559655001201568IND60671780620221120205225.0200210e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067178062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2019.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaka, Masahiko10aPaecilodepsipeptide D, a cyclohexadepsipeptide from cultures of the whitefly pathogenic fungus Conoideocrella luteorostrata BCC 76664  ap. 65-67.  aPaecilodepsipeptide D (1), a new cyclohexadepsipeptide was isolated together with known paecilodepsipeptides A–C (2–4) from the whitefly pathogenic fungus Conoideocrella luteorostrata BCC 76664.

The accurate estimation of its tree aboveground biomass (AGB) is of significant value to evaluate urban ecological functions and estimate urban forest carbon storage. It has a high accuracy to estimate the forest AGB with field measured canopy structure parameters, but unsuitable for large-scale operations. Limited by low spatial resolution or spectral saturation, the estimated forest AGBs based on various satellite remotely sensed data have relatively low accuracies. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing provides a promising way to accurately estimate the tree AGB of fragmented urban forest. In this study, taking an artificial urban forest in Ma'anxi Wetland Park in Chongqing City, China as an example, we used UAVs equipped with a digital camera and a LiDAR to acquire two point cloud data. One was produced from overlapping images using Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, and the other was resolved from laser scanned raw data. The dual point clouds were combined to extract individual tree height (H) and canopy radius (Rc), which were then input to the newly established allometric equation with tree H and Rc as predictor variables to obtain the AGBs of all dawn redwood trees in study area. In accuracy assessment, the coefficient of determination (R²) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of extracted H were 0.9341 and 0.59 m; the R² and RMSE of extracted Rc were 0.9006 and 0.28 m; the R² and RMSE of estimated AGB were 0.9452 and 17.59 kg. These results proved the feasibility and effectiveness of applying dual-source UAV point cloud data and the new allometric equation on H and Rc to accurate AGB estimation of urban forest trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetasequoia glyptostroboides 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3acameras 3acanopy 3acarbon sequestration 3adata collection 3aequations 3alidar 3aphotogrammetry 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atree height 3aurban forestry 3aurban forests 3awetlands 3aChina 0aAGB 0aAllometric equation 0aCanopy radius 0aPoint cloud 0aTree height 0aUrban forest1 aChen, Decao1 aWu, Wenjian1 aLiao, Xiaohan0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2022 Mar., v. 69 p.127521-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.1275213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245012000204300001800324506007600342520103600418592002801454506003701482650001901519650002101538650001601559650001601575650002001591650001501611650001101626650001101637650001401648650001301662650001101675700002101686700001801707700002101725773013201746856007501878852000901953655001201962IND60538863820221207142222.0160815e20130612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053886382DNAL7 a10.1021/ja403255s2doi7 aPMC37531002pmcid7 a237186272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilcock, Brandon
C.10aC2′-OH of Amphotericin B Plays an Important Role in Binding the Primary Sterol of Human Cells but Not Yeast Cells  ap. 8488-8491.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmphotericin B (AmB) is a clinically vital antimycotic but is limited by its severe toxicity. Binding ergosterol, independent of channel formation, is the primary mechanism by which AmB kills yeast, and binding cholesterol may primarily account for toxicity to human cells. The leading structural model predicts that the C2′ hydroxyl group on the mycosamine appendage is critical for binding both sterols. To test this, the C2′-OH was synthetically deleted, and the sterol binding capacity of the resulting derivative, C2′deOAmB, was directly characterized via isothermal titration calorimetry. Surprisingly, C2′deOAmB binds ergosterol and, within the limits of detection of this experiment, does not bind cholesterol. Moreover, C2′deOAmB is nearly equipotent to AmB against yeast but, within the limits of detection of our assays, is nontoxic to human cells in vitro. Thus, the leading structural model for AmB/sterol binding interactions is incorrect, and C2′deOAmB is an exceptionally promising new antifungal agent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamphotericin B 3abinding capacity 3acalorimetry 3acholesterol 3adetection limit 3aergosterol 3ahumans 3amodels 3atitration 3atoxicity 3ayeasts1 aEndo, Matthew M.1 aUno, Brice E.1 aBurke, Martin D.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 June 12, v. 135, no. 23 p.8488-8491dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja403255s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245006700155300001600222520160400238592002801842650003401870650001901904650002801923650001601951650000901967650001301976650001401989650001102003650000702014650002102021650001202042700001802054773012202072856007502194852000902269655001202278IND60534868220221118162333.0160803e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053486822DNAL7 a10.1021/es40433532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Yuqiang10aNano-FeS Inhibits UO2 Reoxidation under Varied Oxic Conditions  ap. 632-640.  aBioreductive in situ treatment of U-contaminated groundwater can convert soluble U(VI) species to immobile reduced U(IV) solid phases such as UO₂(s) to contain U movement. Once active bioremediation is halted, UO₂ may be subsequently reoxidized if oxidants such as oxygen enter the reducing zone. However, iron sulfide minerals that form during bioreduction may serve as electron sources or oxygen scavengers and inhibit UO₂ reoxidation upon oxygen intrusion. In this study, flow-through reactor experiments examined the abiotic kinetics of UO₂ oxidative dissolution in the presence of oxygen and nanoparticulate FeS as a function of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and FeS content. The UO₂ dissolution rates in the presence of FeS were over 1 order of magnitude lower than those in the absence of FeS under otherwise comparable oxic conditions. FeS effectively scavenged DO and preferentially reacted with oxygen, contributing to a largely unreacted UO₂ solid phase during an “inhibition period” as determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The removal of DO by FeS was significant but incomplete during the inhibition period, resulting in surface-oxidation-limited dissolution and greater UO₂ dissolution rate with increasing influent DO concentration and decreasing FeS content. Although the rate was independent of solution pH in the range of 6.1–8.1, the length of the inhibition period was shortened by substantial FeS dissolution at slightly acidic pH. The reducing capacity of FeS was greatest at basic pH where surface-mediated FeS oxidation dominated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3abioremediation 3afree radical scavengers 3agroundwater 3airon 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3asulfide minerals 3auranium1 aHayes, Kim F.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Jan. 07, v. 48, no. 1 p.632-640dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes40433533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245014700201300001800348520152700366592002801893650002101921650002201942650002001964650003801984650002302022650002102045650002602066650001802092650002102110650004402131650001502175650001902190650001802209650001602227650002102243650001902264650003202283700001302315700001702328700001602345700001202361700001602373773017102389856008002560852000902640655001202649IND60600879220221116160840.0180704e20170412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060087922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b005162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8918-528010aSynthesis and Properties of Biobased Multiblock Polyesters Containing Poly(2,5-furandimethylene succinate) and Poly(butylene succinate) Blocks  ap. 3937-3946.  aNovel biobased multiblock polyesters poly(2,5-furandimethylene succinate)-b-poly(butylene succinate) (PFS-PBS) containing PFS and PBS blocks were synthesized in a full composition range via chain-extension reaction of dihydroxyl terminated poly(2,5-furandimethylene succinate) (HO-PFS-OH) and poly(butylene succinate) (HO-PBS-OH) prepolymers. High molecular weight polyesters were obtained, and the stability of double bonds in 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan was guaranteed via this preparation procedure. The obtained copolyesters were characterized with ¹H NMR, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, polarized optical microscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and the mechanical properties were also investigated. No transesterfication reaction happened during chain-extension reaction, and the expected multiblock chemical structure was obtained. The PBS block is crystallizable, while the PFS block is nearly amorphous. Crystallization temperature and degree of crystallinity gradually decreased with increasing PFS fraction, but the melting temperature of crystalline samples showed no sharp reduction (109.4–105.2 °C). The crystallization rate also decreased with incorporation of PFS during isothermal crystallization, but the crystallization mechanism remained unchanged at any composition. Finally, the PFS-PBS copolyesters exhibit widely tunable mechanical properties, ranging from semicrystalline thermoplastics to amorphous soft elastomer-like polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agel chromatography 3alight microscopy 3amechanical properties 3amelting point 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyesters 3aprocess design 3asuccinic acid 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3athermoplastics 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aLi, Ting1 aXie, Zhining1 aHan, Jiarui1 aXu, Jun1 aGuo, Baohua0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Apr. 12, v. 56, no. 14 p.3937-3946dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b005163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245016300165300001600328520235200344592002802696650001702724650001102741650002002752650001702772650001502789650001102804650001602815650001002831650001602841650001902857650001702876651001402893700002202907700001602929700002302945700002202968773011902990856007903109852000903188655001203197IND60478550720221120082750.0160111e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047855072DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.125492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaryl, Fiona M.10aFunctional responses of insectivorous bats to increasing housing density support ‘land‐sparing’ rather than ‘land‐sharing’ urban growth strategies  ap. 191-201.  aDebates about ‘land‐sparing’ and ‘land‐sharing’ strategies for conserving biodiversity in cities provide an overly simplistic characterization of alternate planning options. Increased urbanization manifests in a number of ways and sophisticated analyses of how species respond to urban environments are required before generalizations about the relative merits of either planning strategy should be made. We investigated how insectivorous bats respond to housing density (a measure of urbanization intensity) and a range of habitat variables by modelling the occupancy and activity of 12 species in Melbourne, Australia. In addition to species‐level analyses, species were grouped into guilds (‘matrix’, ‘patch’ or ‘edge’ species) depending on their ecomorphology and level of patch‐dependency. Housing density (dwellings per hectare: dph) was the dominant explanatory variable of occupancy and activity of most species studied. Site occupancy probabilities of patch and edge species were reduced by half at housing densities of just 1·1–4·5 dph depending on species, while their activity was halved at housing densities of 2·6–10·3 dph. The activity of two matrix species also declined, but at higher housing densities (reducing by half at 4·5–7·9 dph). Patch and edge species responded nonlinearly to tree cover at low housing densities, with peaks in occupancy and activity at 20–60%. This response broke down at medium housing densities, however, as most species were no longer present. Synthesis and applications. Occupancy probability and activity of almost all bat species studied were substantially reduced even at very low housing densities. Increasing tree cover had no positive effect on the occupancy and activity of patch and edge species once medium housing densities were reached. In order for land‐sharing strategies to provide good habitat for patch and edge bat species housing densities would need to be so low as to be impractical in most urban planning contexts. By contrast, land‐sparing with forested habitat remaining in 20% or more of the landscape could provide positive conservation outcomes for the species modelled here. We discuss the relevance of our findings in planning for conservation of bats and their habitats in other recently established and expanding cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acities 3aforest habitats 3ainsectivores 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprobability 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aAustralia1 aLumsden, Linda F.1 aRee, Rodney1 aWintle, Brendan A.1 aMinderman, Jeroen0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2016 Feb., v. 53, no. 1 p.191-201dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.125493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245014000179300002000319520186800339592002802207650001902235650001702254650001802271650002102289650002202310650001202332650002602344650001902370650001102389650001902400650001702419650001102436650002502447650004402472650001302516650001802529650002102547650002402568650001402592650001502606650000902621650001402630650001402644650003702658650001102695650001802706650001202724651001102736651001302747700004102760700002702801700002902828700002102857773014902878856008103027852000903108655001203117IND60441801120221120193037.0151106e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044180112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4458-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcosta-González, Alejandro14aThe effect of oil spills on the bacterial diversity and catabolic function in coastal sediments: a case study on the Prestige oil spill  ap. 15200-15214.  aThe accident of the Prestige oil tanker in 2002 contaminated approximately 900 km of the coastline along the northern Spanish shore, as well as parts of Portugal and France coast, with a mixture of heavy crude oil consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, asphaltenes and resins. The capacity of the autochthonous bacterial communities to respond to the oil spill was assessed indirectly by determining the hydrocarbon profiles of weathered oil samples collected along the shore, as well as through isotope ratios of seawater-dissolved CO₂, and directly by analyses of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints and 16S rRNA gene libraries. Overall, the results evidenced biodegradation of crude oil components mediated by natural bacterial communities, with a bias towards lighter and less substituted compounds. The changes observed in the Proteobacteria, the most abundant phylum in marine sediments, were related to the metabolic profiles of the sediment. The presence of crude oil in the supratidal and intertidal zones increased the abundance of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, dominated by the groups Sphingomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Chromatiales, whilst Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria were more relevant in subtidal zones. The phylum Actinobacteria, and particularly the genus Rhodococcus, was a key player in the microbial response to the spill, especially in the degradation of the alkane fraction. The addition of inorganic fertilizers enhanced total biodegradation rates, suggesting that, in these environments, nutrients were insufficient to support significant growth after the huge increase in carbon sources, as evidenced in other spills. The presence of bacterial communities able to respond to a massive oil input in this area was consistent with the important history of pollution of the region by crude oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aChromatiales 3aRNA libraries 3aRhodobacteraceae 3aSphingomonadaceae 3aalkanes 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3acoasts 3adelta-Proteobacteria 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aisotopes 3alittoral zone 3amarine sediments 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrients 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aresins 3aribosomal RNA 3atankers 3aFrance 3aPortugal1 aMartirani-von Abercron, Sophie-Marie1 aRosselló-Móra, Ramon1 aWittich, Regina-Michaela1 aMarques, Silvia,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Oct., v. 22, no. 20 p.15200-15214dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4458-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245013200173300001600305520149700321592002801818650002101846650001201867650002401879650001601903650001901919650001401938650001801952650001301970700002201983773008002005856008302085852000902168655001202177IND60111894720221118050806.0150812e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011189472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2011.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeenstra, Esther M.10aAttentional bias in restrictive eating disorders. Stronger attentional avoidance of high-fat food compared to healthy controls?  ap. 133-140.  aA striking feature of the restricting subtype of anorexia nervosa (AN) is that these patients are extremely successful in restricting their food intake. Possibly, they are highly efficient in avoiding attentional engagement of food cues, thereby preventing more elaborate processing of food cues and thus subsequent craving. This study examined whether patients diagnosed with restrictive eating disorders (‘restricting AN-like patients’; N=88) indeed show stronger attentional avoidance of visual food stimuli than healthy controls (N=76). Attentional engagement and disengagement were assessed by means of a pictorial exogenous cueing task, and (food and neutral) pictures were presented for 300, 500, or 1000ms. In the 500ms condition, both restricting AN-like patients and healthy controls demonstrated attentional avoidance of high-fat food as indexed by a negative cue-validity effect and impaired attentional engagement with high-fat food, whereas no evidence was found for facilitated disengagement from high-fat food. Within the group of restricting AN-like patients, patients with relatively severe eating pathology showed relatively strong attentional engagement with low-fat food. There was no evidence for attentional bias in the 300 and 1000ms condition. The pattern of findings indicate that attentional avoidance of high-fat food is a common phenomenon that may become counterproductive in restricting AN-like patients, as it could facilitate their restricted food intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia nervosa 3acraving 3adietary restriction 3afood intake 3ahigh fat foods 3aingestion 3alow fat foods 3apatients1 ade Jong, Peter J.0 tAppetite.g2012 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.133-140dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2011.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245017500209500001400384520175500398592002802153650003002181650002602211650001402237650001102251650001902262650002502281650001902306650002202325650002902347650002202376650001702398650002902415650001602444650000902460650001502469650001102484650001702495650001002512650002202522653001802544653001002562653001902572653002302591653002302614700002002637700002102657700006002678773011602738856008702854852000902941655001202950IND60719403520221119202809.0210114e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071940352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1136682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhiat, Ikhlas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4421-941310aCO2 utilisation in agricultural greenhouses: A novel ‘plant to plant’ approach driven by bioenergy with carbon capture systems within the energy, water and food Nexus  aNAL-light  aSecuring the growing populations' demand for food energy and water whilst adapting to climate change is extremely challenging. In this regard, bioenergy coupled with carbon capture and storage or utilisation (BECCS/U) is an attractive solution for meeting both the population demand, and offsetting CO₂ emissions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of BECCS/U pathways utilising CO₂ for agricultural enrichment in enhancing food systems and reducing GHG emissions within the energy, water and food nexus concept. The study bridges negative emissions with CO₂ fertilisation within an integrated system. It consists of a source of CO₂ represented by a biomass-based integrated gasification combined cycle with carbon capture, a CO₂ network for a sustainable CO₂ supply, and a CO₂ sink characterised by agricultural greenhouses. A techno-economic and environmental analysis of each of these subsystems is conducted, feeding to an overall performance analysis of the integrated BECCS/U pathway. Results reveal synergetic opportunities between the energy, water and food subsectors, whereby CO₂ is captured from an energy sub-system and is efficiently utilised to enhance food sub-systems by improving productivity and reducing crop water requirements. Thus, the proposed integrated BECCS/U system is able to improve food availability by enhancing the food system, increasing the yield by 13.8%, whilst reducing crop water requirements by 28%. System outputs resulted in a levelised cost of 0.35 $/kg of agricultural produce when the system is scaled-up, and an abatement of the related environmental burdens throughout the supply chain by achieving negative CO₂ emissions of 24.6 kg/m².year of cultivated land.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aagricultural products 3abioenergy 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aenergy conversion 3aenvironmental assessment 3afood availability 3agasification 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouses 3aland 3apopulation 3asupply 3asupply chain 3awater 3awater requirement 0aFood security 0aBECCS 0aCO2 enrichment 0aNegative emissions 0aCO2 fertilisation1 aMahmood, Farhat1 aGovindan, Rajesh1 aAl-Ansari, Tareq1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2932-82400 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 228 p.113668-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1136683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007600166520138100242592002801623650000801651650001201659650002201671650001901693650001101712650001701723650001201740650001601752653002001768653003101788653003301819700001601852700001901868700001701887773009001904856008501994852000902079655001202088IND60684672920221119032107.0200330e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068467292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1171852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZare, Saeid10aOn the low-temperature plasma discharge in methane/air diffusion flames  aInterest in methane has grown recently because of its encouraging characteristics. However, methane comes with serious concerns regarding stability and flammability limitations. Some methods have been proposed to improve the ignition characteristics of methane in diffusion flame burners such as electrical fields, dielectric barrier discharge, and low-temperature plasma. In this study, an innovative single-element coaxial shear injector coupled with a high-voltage nanosecond pulse generator has been used to study the effects of low-temperature plasma (LTP) discharge on methane/air inverse diffusion flame at different plasma and flow conditions. The stability analysis focuses on the detachment conditions of the flame and how RNP discharge can delay this phenomenon, explaining the presence of an optimal operating point with the least applied energy. Comparing the lean blow-off limits for the cases with and without plasma discharge, it is shown that low-temperature plasma discharge enhances the flammability of the diffusion flame. The effect of LTP discharge on laminar flames is also discussed using chemiluminescence photography. It shows that the shape of the diffusion flame becomes more similar to premixed flame with more air entrainment and stability. Resultantly, it is shown that RNP discharge can improve the flame stability and ignition characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aburners 3achemiluminescence 3aelectric field 3aenergy 3aflammability 3amethane 3aphotography 0aDiffusion flame 0aPlasma-assisted combustion 0aRepetitive nanosecond plasma1 aLo, Hao Wei1 aRoy, Shrabanti1 aAskari, Omid0 tEnergy.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 197 p.117185-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1171853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001600281520100800297592002801305650003201333650001501365650003301380650001401413650001601427650001401443650001801457700001401475700001801489700002101507700002401528700002301552700001501575700005701590773012601647856008101773852000901854655001201863IND60596680020221118031300.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059668002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-018-1400-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, PaulEunil10aRevision of the taxonomic status of the genus Gloeoporus (Polyporales, Basidiomycota) reveals two new species  ap. 855-863.  aGloeoporus Mont. is characterized by an easily separated gelatinous hymenophore and a continuous hymenium over the pore mouth. Recent molecular taxonomic and phylogenetic research showed that morphological grouping of Gloeoporus is polyphyletic. The lack of comprehensive phylogenetic studies of Gloeoporus exacerbates confusion in determining the taxonomic position of the genus. To delimit the genus Gloeoporus, we performed multi-locus phylogenetic analysis using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU), and the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that current delimitation of Gloeoporus is not monophyletic. Gloeoporus s.s. includes mostly clamped species lacking cystidia. Some species of Gloeoporus featuring simple septa and cystidia are proposed to be renamed to Meruliopsis.

It nevertheless has its critics, consisting of people denying climate change or minimizing the responsibility of human beings in the process. This skepticism partly derives from the complexity of the topic, encouraging people to rely on cognitive shortcuts to grasp the phenomenon. We question the role of analytic cognitive style, general and climate change-related knowledge, overconfidence, and political partisanship (plus additional expected confounding variables) in this process through a package of three studies (total N = 1031). In a first study, we showed that an intuitive mindset predicted greater skepticism relative to an analytical mindset while controlling for cognitive ability and the degree to which individuals value science, suggesting that reasoning cognitive style and trust are key parameters of climate change skepticism. A second study highlighted that climate science knowledge stands as strong and independent predictors of skepticism relative to analytic cognitive style. A final study revealed that analytic cognitive style and climate change knowledge generated less influence on climate change skepticism among conservatives than among liberals and moderates, suggesting that reliance on deliberative thinking and knowledgeability on climate science are not sufficient to mitigate climate change skepticism among conservatives. We discuss the critical interplay between cognitive processes and political partisanship in this ongoing debate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acognition 3ahumans 3aliteracy 3apeople 3apolitics 3atotal nitrogen 0aClimate change skepticism 0aAnalytic cognitive style 0aIllusion of knowledge 0aBelief in science 0aNumeracy 0aScience literacy 0aPolitical orientation1 aDjeriouat, Hakim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7518-71460 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2021 Apr., v. 74 p.101561-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.1015613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014400171520088200315592002801197650002601225650001001251650001601261650000901277650002001286650002001306650001301326650001401339653000901353653002001362700002101382700002001403700002101423700002101444700006101465700002101526700005901547773012701606856008501733852000901818655001201827IND60745128520221118023151.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074512852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2021.1103012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyauchi, Sonoko10aIncreased T-cell responses that control bovine leukemia virus proviral load in beef cattle under dietary vitamin A restriction for marbling  aBovine leukemia virus (BLV) proviral load is controlled by T-cell responses, which require vitamin A (VA) derived from food. However, whether dietary VA restriction for marbling impairs the T-cell responses that control BLV proviral load in beef cattle is unknown. We assessed T-cell subsets, interferon (IFN)-γ gene expression, and BLV proviral load in naturally BLV-infected Japanese Black cattle that were fed a diet with decreased VA levels. We found that the percentage of CD4⁺ T cells increased over time during dietary VA restriction. In addition, BLV proviral load was negatively correlated with the percentage of CD4⁺ T cells and with the level of IFN-γ gene expression. These observations suggest that dietary VA restriction for marbling enhances T-cell responses that control BLV proviral load and thus does not promote leukemogenesis in fattening beef cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine leukemia virus 3aWagyu 3abeef cattle 3adiet 3agene expression 3aimmunopathology 3amarbling 3avitamin A 0aBeef 0aT-cell response1 aKatagiri, Yuzuru1 aOchiai, Chihiro1 aHirata, Toh-ichi1 aMatsuda, Keiichi1 aIchijo, Toshihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0812-11681 aHikono, Hirokazu1 aMurakami, Kenji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3813-818X0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2021 Sept., v. 239 p.110301-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2021.1103013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010400168300002000272520126300292592002801555650001201583650001201595650001601607650001701623650001101640650000901651650002201660650001201682650002101694650000901715650000901724650001301733651001101746651001101757651001601768651001801784773014901802856008101951852000902032655001202041IND60441801420221120192851.0151106e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044180142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4753-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJallad, Karim N.10aHeavy metal exposure from ingesting rice and its related potential hazardous health risks to humans  ap. 15449-15458.  aDifferent types of rice grains imported from 11 different countries and available on the Kuwaiti retail market were collected for heavy metal analysis.

Although the parasitoids have been released in several African countries, the extent of their dispersal and the resulting extent in benefits to fruit growers have not yet been elucidated. This paper proposes an innovative, multi-level CBC impact analysis that combines cellular automata (CA) and ecological niche models to estimate parasitoid dispersal ranges and the range of farmers who benefit from it. Firstly, we provided a generic, systematic methodological approach using CA rules incorporated into species distribution. Secondly, the model was used to estimate the dispersal range of the parasitoid, based on the life history and bioecology of the host insect (fruit fly) and the parasitoid. Finally, the parasitoid dispersal coverage was mapped across fruit crops attacked by the target fruit fly, and the number of households that benefited from the parasitoids release programme was extracted from the area of the dispersal. The data was projected across all countries where the parasitoid has been released and validated. In Kenya, the model showed that F. arisanus had covered a total area of 50.34 km² from the initial point of open field release; and at the continental scale, the model predicted that the parasitoid had covered a total area of 229.97 km². The model estimated that 351,855 and 3,731,330 households had directly benefited from the release of F. arisanus between 2013 and 2018 in Kenya and at the continental level, respectively. The study's outcome is appropriate for providing feedback information on the impact of CBC to government and development partners to assist in making informed decisions on technological interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aFopius arisanus 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aendoparasitoids 3afruit flies 3afruits 3ageographical distribution 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amodels 3aniches 3aKenya 0aSpatiotemporal 0aCellular automata 0aEcological niche model 0aParasitoid dispersal 0aBeneficiary households1 aTonnang, Henri E.Z.1 aAbdel-Rahman, Elfatih M.1 aKimathi, Emily1 aMutanga, Onisimo1 aOdindi, John1 aNiassy, Saliou1 aMohamed, Samira A.1 aEkesi, Sunday0 tBiological control.g2022 Nov., v. 175 p.105053-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2022.1050533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011800176300001600294520138400310592002801694650001701722650001701739650001801756650001101774650001401785650001301799650001901812650002201831650001001853650001101863650001601874650002101890650001201911650001701923650001801940653001701958653001801975653002401993653002002017653001402037653001902051700001902070700001802089773011102107856008702218852000902305655001202314IND60539840520221118060843.0190318e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053984052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnzmann, Brittany L14aThe cost of being queen: Investment across Pogonomyrmex harvester ant gynes that differ in degree of claustrality  ap. 134-142.  aThe role of the ant colony largely consists of non-reproductive tasks, such as foraging, tending brood, and defense. However, workers are vitally linked to reproduction through their provisioning of sexual offspring, which are produced annually to mate and initiate new colonies. Gynes (future queens) have size-associated variation in colony founding strategy (claustrality), with each strategy requiring different energetic investments from their natal colony. We compared the per capita production cost required for semi-claustral, facultative, and claustral gynes across four species of Pogonomyrmex harvester ants. We found that the claustral founding strategy is markedly expensive, costing approximately 70% more energy than that of the semi-claustral strategy. Relative to males, claustral gynes also had the largest differential investment and smallest size variation. We applied these investment costs to a model by Brown and Bonhoeffer (2003) that predicts founding strategy based on investment cost and foraging survivorship. The model predicts that non-claustral foundresses must survive the foraging period with a probability of 30–36% in order for a foraging strategy to be selectively favored. These results highlight the importance of incorporating resource investment at the colony level when investigating the evolution of colony founding strategies in ants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPogonomyrmex 3aant colonies 3abrood rearing 3aenergy 3aevolution 3aforaging 3aharvester ants 3ainsect physiology 3amales 3amodels 3aprobability 3aproduction costs 3aprogeny 3areproduction 3asurvival rate 0aPogonomyrmex 0aHarvester ant 0aParental investment 0aColony founding 0aClaustral 0aSemi-claustral1 aGibbs, Allen G1 aNonacs, Peter0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2014 Nov., v. 70 p.134-142dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015300171520100600324592002801330650004801358650001001406650001901416650002501435650002001460650003201480650002101512650004301533650001501576653001801591653002001609700002101629773012701650856008501777852000901862655001201871IND60745128720221118022941.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074512872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2021.1103042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshouri, Mojtaba10aPathology, immunohistochemistry and molecular study of cattle screened by comparative tuberculin test for diagnosis latent form of Johne’s disease  aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis causes Johne’s disease in cattle and other ruminants.

Some of these novel iptycene-containing polymers have already displayed unprecedented separation performance. This review summarizes the progression of the gas separation membranes, utilizing iptycene structures over the past five years by dividing the polymers into three categories: nonladder polymers, semiladder polymers, and ladder polymers. The focus lies on examining macromolecular design strategies of these novel polymers and consequential effects on chain packing, free volume architecture, and gas transport properties to provide useful guidance on the design of new membrane materials. Finally, we provide some perspectives and future research directions for designing and utilizing iptycene-containing polymers for gas separation membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrofiltration 3apolymers 3aprocess design 3aseparation1 aGuo, Ruilan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3373-25880 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Apr. 19, v. 56, no. 15 p.4220-4236dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b005403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010500159300001600264500002000280520163800300592002801938650002301966650001201989650001702001650001102018650001202029650001002041650001102051650001502062650002502077650001402102650002102116650002302137650001302160700001802173773013302191856007302324852000902397655001202406IND60587476020221117040020.0180102e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058747602DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.130282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGershman, S.

Cuticular chemical profiles frequently function as insect sexual signals; however, few studies have asked whether males alter these signals in response to their social environment. In Drosophila serrata, an Australian fly, there is sexual selection for a multivariate combination of male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). Here, we show that the ratio of females to males that an adult male experiences has a strong effect on his CHC expression, with female‐biased adult sex ratios eliciting greater expression of CHC profiles associated with higher male mating success. Classical models predict that male reproductive investment should be highest when there is a small but nonzero number of rivals, but we found that males expressed the most attractive combination of CHCs when there were no rivals. We found that male CHCs were highly sensitive to adult sex ratio, with males expressing higher values of CHC profiles associated with greater mating success as the ratio of females to males increased. Moreover, sex ratio has a stronger effect on male CHC expression than adult density. Finally, we explore whether sex ratio affects the variance among a group of males in their CHC expression, as might be expected if individuals respond differently to a given social environment, but find little effect. Our results reveal that subtle differences in social environment can induce plasticity in male chemical signal expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila serrata 3afemales 3ahydrocarbons 3aimagos 3ainsects 3amales 3amodels 3aplasticity 3areproductive success 3asex ratio 3asexual selection 3asocial environment 3avariance1 aRundle, H.

The focus of this work is on the dynamic operation of a system, which is investigated using representative profiles of wind electricity production. In addition, the effect and challenges of dynamic operation on the system and stack itself are studied. Detailed operation strategies are defined during the switching process from one operational mode to another and are implemented on the dynamic process model. Simulation results show that when the rSOC system is operated in solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) modes alternatively, energy balancing can be implemented on a continuous basis. In this process, the results show that the rSOC system operates in a safe operating range and does not deviate from the pre-defined limits. This is due to the accurate strategies developed for the switching process. It is also observed from the simulation results that the switching time is significantly influenced by the initial power of the first and the final power of the later operational mode. The proposed model of rSOC was validated using experimental data, and good agreement with experimental data was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acells 3adynamic models 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrolysis 3afuel cells 3awind 0arSOC system 0aReversible solid oxide cell 0aSOE 0aSOFC 0arSOC1 aKupecki, Jakub1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2736-30311 aNuman, Bart1 aHajimolana, Yashar S.1 aVenkataraman, Vikrant0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 228 p.113674-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1136743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009600168300001600264520156800280592002801848650001201876650001901888650001601907650002201923650001201945650001201957650001101969650002101980650001602001650002302017650001602040650002002056651001002076653002302086653002902109653002302138653001502161700001302176700001402189700001602203700001302219773011302232856008602345852000902431655001202440IND60643057520221120193358.0191231e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064305752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Xiawei10aInter-provincial electricity transmissions’ co-benefit of national water savings in China  ap. 350-357.  aInterprovincial electricity transmissions have been utilised in China to overcome the country's imbalanced social-economic development and resource endowments. A bottom-up technology-based model is adopted to estimate water uses in electricity-exporting provinces to produce the transmitted electricity as well as opportunistic water savings in the receiving provinces. The results highlight that, in 2014, on a national scale, electricity transmissions generated co-benefit of saving 20.1 billion m³ of water nationally due to the electric power sector's water productivity differences in the exporting and importing provinces. Taking regional water stresses into account, 10.98 billion m³ of national scarce water saving is realized through electricity transmissions. Moreover, electricity transmissions by China's proposed 12 future transmission lines are expected to use additional 3.22 billion m³ of water in the electricity-exporting provinces. As more water-intensive technologies, e.g. open-loop cooling, are more commonly utilised in the electricity-receiving provinces, a total amount of 16.97 billion m³ of water use will be avoided nationally. Water-use efficiency for power production should be improved in all regions. Transmitted power imports should still be encouraged in water-scarce regions to alleviate their water stresses while power exports should be shifted away from water-stressed regions to water-abundant ones. Energy transformation by utilising gas-fired capacity and hydropower in water-abundant Southern China could be advanced.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy conversion 3aexports 3aimports 3amodels 3apower generation 3apower lines 3awater conservation 3awater power 3awater resources 3aChina 0aWater conservation 0aElectricity transmission 0aWater-energy nexus 0aCo-benefit1 aChai, Li1 aJiang, Yu1 aJi, Junping1 aZhao, Xu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 229 p.350-357dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245010100174506010400275506007600379520156000455592002802015506003702043650001502080650001802095650001702113650000902130650001102139650002802150650002002178650002802198650001402226650001202240650001802252650001002270651001202280653001502292653002102307653001702328653002602345653002002371700001602391773010302407856008902510852000902599655001202608IND60793239020221207093657.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079323902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2022.1050562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorbély, Csaba10aProviding sugar sources for ants improves the biological control of Aphis spp. in apple orchards  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe green apple aphids Aphis pomi DeGeer and A. spiraecola Patch are serious pests of apple, especially in young orchards, where both species establish facultative mutualisms with ants. This study, conducted in Hungary in 2014 and 2015, manipulated the presence of the common black ant Lasius niger (L.) on colonies of Aphis spp. in apple tree canopies. To this end, two kinds of sugar dispensers (bottle dispensers and agar jelly cubes), each providing a sucrose solution with 300 g/1000 ml concentration, were deployed as alternative sugar sources for the ants, with plots lacking dispensers serving as controls. Both forms of sugar provisioning reduced the number of ants tending Aphis spp. colonies and reduced aphid populations compared to controls in both years. However, bottle dispensers demonstrated consistent efficacy in both years, whereas agar jelly cubes were less reliable in distracting the ants. Both treatments significantly increased the abundance of natural enemies at Aphis spp. colonies compared to controls. Our results indicate that the provisioning of ants with sugar in apple orchards can effectively disrupt ant-aphid mutualisms in the case of Aphis spp., by drawing ants away from aphid colonies and thus increasing natural enemy predation on aphid colonies. The use of sugar-feeding tactics to alter ant behaviour should permit reduced pesticide use in apple orchards, whether to control aphids or other pests that might serve as prey for ants, and is fundamentally compatible with biological pest control in apple orchards.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAphis pomi 3aFormica fusca 3aLasius niger 3aagar 3aapples 3abiological pest control 3anatural enemies 3apesticide use reduction 3apredation 3asucrose 3asugar feeding 3atrees 3aHungary 0aAphis pomi 0aAphis spiraecola 0aLasius niger 0aSupplementary feeding 0aNatural enemies1 aNagy, Csaba0 tBiological control.g2022 Nov., v. 175 p.105056-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2022.1050563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245016700211520205800378592002802436650002402464650002202488650001802510650000902528650001402537650001302551650002002564650001302584653001902597653002002616653001102636653003202647700002002679700002402699700002202723700002302745773010302768856008602871852000902957655001202966IND60745128920221118023129.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074512892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1060572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmo, Garrett M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9973-274310aValidity of daily and annual age estimation and back-calculation methods for early life stages of a subtropical-tropical species, the tarpon (Megalops atlanticus)  aMuch emphasis has been placed on challenges related to estimating ages of old fish, yet accurately estimating age for young individuals has proved equally challenging for some species. Indices of recruitment are often based on assigning ages to young fish to estimate the strength of a given year class. Similarly, growth is most commonly estimated using age-based methods and has been proposed as a metric for evaluating the quality of nursery habitats. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on the validity of age estimates for many fishes, and thus the accuracy of age-based metrics used to guide management of these species is unknown. To address such needs, we conducted a validation study of age and growth estimation methods for juvenile tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), using oxytetracycline to chemically mark otoliths and scales. Oxytetracycline marks were observed on all the otoliths of recaptured tarpon (n = 23), prior to a newly formed annulus, validating true age and that one annulus is deposited yearly. Marginal increment analysis indicated that annuli form in tarpon otoliths and scales during March–April. Annuli in scales were more easily identified by readers leading to more accurate and precise estimates of age from scales (100 % accuracy of age estimates for age-1 fish) compared to otoliths (88 % accuracy). Although annual age estimates were accurate, we observed substantial error and low accuracy for daily age estimates based on otoliths (10 % accuracy). Additionally, there was a poor relationship between otolith radius and tarpon length (R² = 0.46), which resulted in inaccurate estimates of back-calculated length-at-age and growth rates. Our results indicate that scales can be used to differentiate between age-0 and age-1 tarpon, which will aid in conservation efforts by allowing for more accurate evaluation of the age structure within nursery habitats and the quality of these habitats. Further research is needed to better understand factors influencing daily age and growth estimates from otoliths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegalops atlanticus 3aage determination 3aage structure 3afish 3ajuveniles 3aotoliths 3aoxytetracycline 3aresearch 0aAge-validation 0aDaily increment 0aTarpon 0aMarginal increment analysis1 aCrane, Derek P.1 aKimball, Matthew E.1 aWilliams, Kyle L.1 aStevens, Philip W.0 tFisheries research.g2021 Nov., v. 243 p.106057-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1060573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184242008700203245011300290300001600403506007600419520108600495592002801581506003701609650002701646650000901673650002901682650002301711650001201734650002501746650001801771650004101789650001501830650001901845650001101864650003701875650001901912650003301931650002101964650001301985700001901998700001902017700001302036700002102049700001902070700001302089700001402102700001802116700001702134700001802151700001502169700005702184773012802241856007702369852000902446655001202455IND60596680420221207125007.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059668042DNAL7 a10.1631/jzus.B17003562doi7 aPMC59625132pmcid7 a297327472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wen-dong10a桑螵蛸脂类提取物对铜绿假单胞菌的抗菌活性和 抗生物膜作用10aAntibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of the lipid extract from Mantidis ootheca on Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ap. 364-371.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study is to assess the antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties of the lipid extract from Mantidis ootheca against the gentamycin resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical composition of the lipid extract and its relative proportion were determined using the technique of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antibacterial susceptibility tests were performed using a disc diffusion assay and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) was determined by way of the agar dilution method. The anti-biofilm test was carried out with crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). There were 16 compounds detected, and the most abundant components were sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenes, and trace aromatic compounds. The MIC for P. aeruginosa was 4 mg/ml and the eradication effect on preformed biofilms was established and compared with a ciprofloxacin control. The results of our study indicated that a lipid extract from M. ootheca could be used as a topical and antibacterial agent with anti-biofilm activity in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aagar 3aantimicrobial properties 3aaromatic compounds 3abiofilm 3achemical composition 3aciprofloxacin 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agentamicin 3agentian violet 3alipids 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amonoterpenoids 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asesquiterpenoids 3astaining1 aZhang, Nan-nan1 aChanda, Warren1 aLiu, Min1 aDin, SyedRiaz ud1 aDiao, Yun-peng1 aLiu, Lei1 aCao, Jing1 aWang, Xiao-li1 aLi, Xing-yun1 aNing, An-hong1 aHuang, Min1 aZhong, Min-tao1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2190-11530 tJournal of Zhejiang University.g2018 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.364-371dZhejiang University PresswJournal:5353x1673-15817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B17003563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245015300173300001600326520140000342592002801742650002101770650004401791650002701835650001901862650002901881650002701910650001301937650001401950650002201964650001101986650001301997650001802010650002402028650001402052650001902066653002502085653002002110653002602130653003702156700001602193700001602209700001802225700001702243700002202260700001902282700001802301700001502319700002302334700001802357700001802375700002002393700002002413700001602433773010602449856008602555852000902641655001202650IND60630784520221119061358.0190213e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063078452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, L.M.F.C.10aNanobiostructure of fibrous-like alumina functionalized with an analog of the BP100 peptide: Synthesis, characterization and biological applications  ap. 275-283.  aThe functionalization of alumina nanoparticles of specific morphology with antimicrobial peptides (AMP) can be a promising strategy for modeling medical devices and packaging materials for cosmetics, medicines or food, since the contamination by pathogens could be reduced. In this paper, we show the synthesis of a fibrous-like alumina nanobiostructure, as well as its functionalization with the peptide EAAA-BP100, an analog of the antimicrobial peptide BP100. The antibacterial activity of the obtained material against some bacterial strains is also investigated. The covalent binding of the peptide to the nanoparticles was promoted by a reaction between the carboxyl group of the glutamate side chain (E1) of the peptide and the amino groups of the alumina nanoparticles, previously modified by reaction with 3-aminopropyltrietoxysilane (APTES). The functionalized nanoparticles were characterized by zeta potential measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and other physicochemical techniques. Although the obtained alumina nanobiostructure shows a relatively low degree of substitution with EAAA-BP100, antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium strains are appreciably higher than the activities of the free peptide. The obtained results can affect the design of new hybrid nanobiomaterials based on nanoparticles functionalized with AMP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aaluminum oxide 3aantibacterial properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acolloids 3acosmetics 3amedical equipment 3amodels 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3apackaging materials 3apathogens 3azeta potential 0aAlumina nanoparticle 0aNanobiomaterial 0aAntimicrobial peptide 0aPeptide-nanoparticle conjugation1 aBraga, N.A.1 aGomes, I.P.1 aAlmeida, M.T.1 aSantos, T.L.1 ade Mesquita, J.P.1 ada Silva, L.M.1 aMartins, H.R.1 aKato, K.C.1 ados Santos, W.T.P.1 aResende, J.M.1 aPereira, M.C.1 aBemquerer, M.P.1 aRodrigues, M.A.1 aVerly, R.M.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 163 p.275-283dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014400165300001400309520132000323592002801643650002501671650001201696650001401708650001601722650001201738650001401750650002201764650000901786650001901795650001501814650001301829650002101842650001701863650001401880650001301894653002501907653001201932653001201944653001401956653001401970700001801984700002102002700001702023700001802040773011102058856008202169852000902251655001202260IND60793239120221122100614.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079323912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2022.08.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shiping10aEffect of sub-lethal ammonia and nitrite stress on autophagy and apoptosis in hepatopancreas of Pacific whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeusvannamei  ap. 72-78.  aOxidative stress caused by ammonia and nitrite, affect the health and growth of aquaculture animals, results in oxidative damages. However, the toxic mechanism and pathogenesis of ammonia and nitrite to aquatic invertebrates are not completely clear. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of sub-lethal ammonia and nitrite on autophagy and apoptosis in hepatopancreas of Pacific whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Shrimps were exposed to sub-lethal ammonia (20 mg/L) and nitrite (20 mg/L) for 72 h, respectively. Hepatopancreas was collected for investigating the autophagy and apoptosis under stress conditions. The results showed that ammonia stress could induce up-regulated of autophagy (ATG3, ATG4, ATG10 and ATG12) and apoptosis (Caspase3 and P53) genes transcription. Nitrite stress could also induce up-regulated of autophagy (ATG3, ATG4, ATG5 and ATG10) and apoptosis (Caspase3) genes transcription. The expression of the autophagy related genes increased at first and then decreased with increasing exposure time. The atrophy, lysis, vacuolation of cell and other tissue damages in hepatopancreas were observed after 72h exposure to ammonia and nitrite. The results indicated that ammonia and nitrite stress could induce autophagy and apoptosis, and results in oxidative damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aammonia 3aapoptosis 3aaquaculture 3aatrophy 3aautophagy 3aexposure duration 3afish 3ahepatopancreas 3aimmunology 3anitrites 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3ashellfish 3atoxicity 0aLitopenaeus vannamei 0aAmmonia 0aNitrite 0aAutophagy 0aApoptosis1 aLuo, Junliang1 aHuang, Yongxiong1 aYuan, Yunhao1 aCai, Shuanghu0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 Nov., v. 130 p.72-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.08.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245016500214500001400379520222300393592002802616650001502644650003002659650001202689650001102701650001202712650002302724650002102747650002202768650001102790650000902801650002002810650001802830650001402848650002202862653003202884653002602916653003502942653003202977653003903009700006703048700006503115700006303180773011603243856008703359852000903446655001203455IND60719404220221119202553.0210114e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071940422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1136772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalilzadeh, Saman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5104-332110aInvestigating the effects of integrating an absorption heat transformer with a combined cooling, heating and power system: A thermodynamic and economic analysis  aNAL-light  aRegarding the significance of low-temperature heat sources in combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems, it is necessary to find practical and economical ways to maximize the efficient use of available energies. Integrating the auxiliary cycle with the main system and changing the configuration are among the useful solutions to achieve this purpose. In this work, a combination of both solutions is presented, accordingly, an absorption heat transformer cycle (AHT) is integrated with a conventional CCHP system, which is made of organic Rankine cycle, absorption refrigeration cycle, and a heat exchanger. Three conventional CCHP systems with sequential (Configuraion₁), parallel (Configuraion₂) and a combination of sequential and parallel (Configuraion₃) configurations are considered. It is shown that among the Configuraion₁, Configuraion₂, and Configuraion₃, Configuraion₁ has the highest energy efficiency; therefore, it is selected to be compared with the proposed integrated system with AHT. This integration affects the outputs production and also energy consumption; therefore, four different modes (standpoints) are taken into account to compare the production of power (mode A), cooling (Mode B), heating (mode C), and energy consumption (mode D) of these two systems. Also, from the exergy, environmental, and economic aspects, these two systems are compared. Regarding mode D, it is indicated that the energy and exergy efficiencies, energy consumption and carbon emission of the proposed system are improved 17.68%, 17.68%, 15.03%, and 15.02%, respectively. It is noted that for the heat source stream temperature range of 90 °C–120 °C, the proposed system has better performance than the Configuration₁. Despite the additional costs of integrating AHT with the CCHP system, the proposed system has 517018.1 US$/year cost saving (which is 32.65% of the investment cost of Configuration₁) if biomass is used as a heat source, which indicates its higher economic advantage than the Configuration₁. Also, comparing the proposed system with Configuration₁, the amount of power, cooling and heating productions are improved 27.98%, 102.15%, and 36.87%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadministrative management 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acooling 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic factors 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3arefrigeration 3asolutions 3awater temperature 0aAbsorption heat transformer 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aAbsorption refrigeration cycle 0aLow-temperature heat source 0aCombined cooling heating and power1 aHossein Nezhad, Alireza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2360-81931 aRomagnoli, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1271-54791 aAkhmetov, Bakytzhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3323-00590 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 228 p.113677-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1136773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006600146245013300212300001800345520189300363592002802256650001502284650001502299650001702314650001102331650001202342650001902354700002302373700002302396773017102419856008002590852000902670655001202679IND60600879920221120182239.0180704e20170419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060087992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b005532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTupsakhare, Swanand S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6508-780313aAn Application of the Results from the Large-Scale Thermal Stimulation Method of Methane Hydrate Dissociation to the Field Tests  ap. 4588-4599.  aMethane hydrate formation and the gas recovery from the hydrates using the thermal stimulation method was studied in a large-scale laboratory reactor. A large-scale laboratory reactor (59 L volume) was used in this study. The efficiencies of gas recovery and energy utilization were studied over two different values of initial hydrate saturation (30% and 50%) and three different values of heating rates (20, 50, and 100 W). Results obtained from the tests demonstrate that with the initial hydrate saturation (SH) remaining constant (50% SH); total recovery of methane increases from 40% to 52% to 73% with a heating rate increase from 20 W to 50 W to 100 W. The average thermal efficiency, however, decreases from 86% to 84% to 82% over the same heating rate range. Alternately at a constant heating rate (100 W), total recovery of methane increased from 67% to 74% when an initial hydrate saturation was increased from 30% to 50%. We show that maintaining a constant heating rate throughout the dissociation is not the most efficient procedure. Instead, starting with a low heating rate then increasing it when methane output starts to decrease will be more effective. This suggests that accurate knowledge of the saturation percentage of a chosen hydrate reservoir will enable efficient energy use when recovering methane. We also found that the free water generated during the dissociation and the free water present initially in the reservoir play a major role in carrying the heat front to distant locations in the reservoir hence increasing the gas recovery. We recommend that in the higher hydrate saturation reservoirs, which may lack the free water; the down-hole combustion method will benefit from an injection of hot water in the initial stages, supplying a small amount of heat for the dissociation but providing the free water for convection of heat to the outer regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aconvection 3adissociation 3aenergy 3amethane 3aprocess design1 aKattekola, Samhita1 aCastaldi, Marco J.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Apr. 19, v. 56, no. 15 p.4588-4599dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b005533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012800175520181600303592002802119650001302147650001302160650001202173650001602185650003502201650002802236650003602264650001102300650001002311650001202321650001502333650002402348650001202372650001202384653002702396653001102423653001502434653002102449700001602470700002202486700002202508700002502530773010602555856008602661852000902747655001202756IND60678230820221118063906.0200221e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067823082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.1127712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonanur, Vaibhav R.10aPhasic dopamine responses to a food-predictive cue are suppressed by the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist Exendin-4  aPhasic dopamine activity is evoked by reliable predictors of food reward and plays a role in cue-triggered, goal-directed behavior. While this important signal is modulated by physiological state (e.g. hunger, satiety), the mechanisms by which physiological state is integrated by dopamine neurons is only beginning to be elucidated. Activation of central receptors for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1R) via long-acting agonists (e.g., Exendin-4) suppresses food intake and food-directed motivated behavior, in part, through action in regions with dopamine cell bodies, terminals, and/or neural populations that directly target the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, the effects of GLP-1R activation on cue-evoked, phasic dopamine signaling remain unknown. Here, in vivo fiber photometry was used to capture real-time signaling dynamics selectively from dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area of male and female transgenic (tyrosine hydroxylase-Cre; TH:Cre+) rats trained to associate an audio cue with the brief availability of a sucrose solution. Cue presentation evoked a brief spike in dopamine activity. Administration of Exendin-4 (Ex4; 0, 0.05, 0.1 μg) to the lateral ventricle both dose-dependently suppressed sucrose-directed behaviors and the magnitude of cue-evoked dopamine activity. Moreover, the amplitude of cue evoked dopamine activity was significantly correlated with subsequent sucrose-directed behaviors. While female rats exhibited overall reduced dopamine responses to the sucrose-paired cue relative to males, there was no significant interaction with Ex4. Together, these findings support a role for central GLP-1Rs in modulating a form of dopamine signaling that influences approach behavior and provide a potential mechanism whereby GLP-1 suppresses food-directed behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3adopamine 3afemales 3afood intake 3agenetically modified organisms 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglucagon-like peptide receptors 3ahunger 3amales 3aneurons 3aphotometry 3aphysiological state 3asatiety 3asucrose 0aVentral tegmental area 0aReward 0aMotivation 0aFiber photometry1 aHsu, Ted M.1 aKanoski, Scott E.1 aHayes, Matthew R.1 aRoitman, Mitchell F.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 215 p.112771-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.1127713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245019100176300001600367520147900383592002801862650001501890650001401905650001401919650001101933650001901944650001901963650001701982650001101999650001602010650002202026650001402048650001102062650003002073650001502103650001302118650000902131650002602140650002002166650002102186650001702207650001002224650001802234651001802252653001402270653003102284653003502315653003502350653003002385653001502415700002102430773011302451856008602564852000902650655001202659IND60643057720221120225545.0191231e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064305772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagapurkar, Prashant10aTechno-economic optimization and social costs assessment of microgrid-conventional grid integration using genetic algorithm and Artificial Neural Networks: A case study for two US cities  ap. 552-569.  aThrough two case studies, a methodology is presented that assessed the techno-economic and environmental performance of microgrid-conventional grid integration scenarios for fifty homes located in US cities of Fargo and Phoenix. The microgrid was composed of seven components - solar photovoltaics, wind-turbines, lead acid batteries, biodiesel generators, fuel cells, electrolyzers and H2 tanks. Firstly, mathematical models that predicted the hourly power generation were developed for every microgrid component. Secondly, Artificial Neural Networks were utilized to predict hourly electricity demand and its results were validated with actual available data. Thirdly, through an electricity dispatch strategy and a Genetic Algorithm optimization technique, microgrid configurations were determined that had lowest levelized cost of energy, $/kWh. From peak power standpoint, four microgrid-conventional grid integration scenarios were examined, namely, microgrid possessing penetration level of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. Based on the environmental life cycle assessment of power generation, three carbon taxes were imposed -$12, $48, $72/tonne carbon dioxide emitted. Microgrid's electricity cost was found to be $0.43–0.86/kWh. Imposing carbon taxes barely showed any effect on microgrid's electricity cost nor its optimum configuration, but conventional grid's electricity cost was found to increase by 7–33% as its carbon emissions were five times as that of microgrid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acase studies 3acities 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental performance 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3alead 3alife cycle assessment 3aneural networks 3apower generation 3asolar energy 3atanks 3awind turbines 3aUnited States 0aMicrogrid 0aTechno-economic assessment 0aEnvironmental assessment (LCA) 0aGenetic algorithm optimization 0aArtificial neural network 0aCarbon tax1 aSmith, Joseph D.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 229 p.552-569dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01754naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245005600133300001200189300002000201500001500221520087400236650002101110650001301131650002601144650002601170653002201196653002901218653001601247653002301263773006901286852000901355939003301364945000801397946001101405655001201416991572934460742620221121182139.0801015e198003  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800027892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemm, John R.10aNutrient requirements and recommended daily intakes  ap. 2-5.  ap. 2-5. charts.  a2019-12-05  aRecommended dietary intakes have been produced by many groups, all of which stress that their recommendations are not exact requirements for individuals, but are based on the nutritional needs of the given population.

Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn and VM at 550 °C were determined. Some physico-chemical parameters were also quantified in water samples collected in the water column just above the sediments. Metal contamination factors (CF) indicated that sediments were not contaminated with Cu and Pb, slightly with Zn and moderately with Cr. For sediments with high metal pollution loadings, the original BCR (Community Bureau of Reference) metal speciation protocol was also applied. Speciation studies showed that chromium was mainly associated with the oxidisable plus residual fractions (>85%). These results suggest that changes in the physico-chemical properties of the river water (e.g. pH, Eh) should not be accompanied by a significative release of chromium from sediments. The relationships between chromium speciation fractions, physic-chemical parameters of the sediments and water samples were studied by Principal Component Analysis, and allowed to reduce the dimensionality of the data matrix from 14 to 3 significant components accounting for 89% of the variance.

The inactivation kinetics are determined in dependence of pressure, process time, temperature and absence or presence of co-solutes in the buffer system namely 4 M sodium chloride and 1.5 M sucrose. The kinetic analysis is carried out in a 0.1-L autoclave in order to minimise thermal and convective effects. Upon these data, a deterministic inactivation model is formulated with the logistic equation. Its independent variables represent the counts of viable cells (viable but injured) and of the stress-resistant cells (viable and not injured). This model is then coupled to a thermo-fluiddynamical simulation method, high-pressure computer fluid dynamics technique (HP-CFD), which yields spatiotemporal temperature and flow fields occurring during the HP application inside any considered autoclave. Besides the thermo-fluiddynamic quantities, the coupled model predicts also the spatiotemporal distribution of both viable (VC) and stress-resistant cell counts (SRC). In order to assess the process non-uniformity of the microbial inactivation in a 3.3-L autoclave experimentally, microbial samples are placed at two distinct locations and are exposed to various process conditions. It can be shown with both, experimental and theoretical models that thermal heterogeneities induce process non-uniformities of more than one decimal power in the counts of the viable cells at the end of the treatment. 3alactic acid bacteria 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aheat treatment 3ainactivation 3apredictive microbiology 0abacteria inactivation1 aKitsubun, P.1 aDelgado, A.1 aGanzle, M.G.1 aChapleau, N.1 aLe Bail, A.1 aHartmann, C.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g2006 July 5, v. 94, no. 4 p.655-666x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.208523electronic resource  a20060818b20060906c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/08/18  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02038naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072001700139072001700156100001700173245006200190300001600252500001500268520094200283650001901225650002001244650002001264650002801284650001001312653002001322653004001342700001601382700001601398700001501414773007001429852000901499856006301508930003301571945002501604946001101629655001201640IND4382878620221121182207.0060817e20060608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287862DNAL7 a10.1038/nature048112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Sleep could result from global changes in the brain during wakefulness or it could be regulated by specific loci that recruit the rest of the brain into the electrical and metabolic states characteristic of sleep. Here we address this issue by exploiting the genetic tractability of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibits the hallmarks of vertebrate sleep. We show that large changes in sleep are achieved by spatial and temporal enhancement of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity specifically in the adult mushroom bodies of Drosophila. Other manipulations of the mushroom bodies, such as electrical silencing, increasing excitation or ablation, also alter sleep. These results link sleep regulation to an anatomical locus known to be involved in learning and memory. 3ahistochemistry 3amushroom bodies 3aenzyme activity 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3asleep 0aneurophysiology 0acyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase1 aCrocker, A.1 aWhite, B.H.1 aSehgal, A.0 tNature.g2006 June 8, v. 441, no. 7094 p.757-760x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature048113electronic resource  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02833naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014500127300001600272520159100288650002201879650001101901650002101912650001701933650001801950650002201968650002001990650002202010650001502032650001902047650001702066650002502083650001802108650002602126650002002152653001602172700002002188700001402208700001702222773008202239852000902321930003302330945001302363946001102376655001202387IND2051203620221121180015.0960510e199509  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205120362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirasawa, T.10aStomatal responses to water deficits and abscisic acid in leaves of sunflower plants (Helianthus annuus L.) grown under different conditions  ap. 955-964.  aThe decrease in diffusive conductance of a leaf exposed to water stress or to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) was smaller in leaves of sunflower plants (Helianthus annuus L. cv. NK285) that had been grown in a phytotron in humid air than in leaves of sunflowers grown outdoors. Stomata of the phytotron-grown plants were slower to close after detachment of a leaf than those of the outdoor plants. When stomata closed rapidly, as they did in detached leaves and after treatment with ABA, the extent of closure was varied over the leaf's surface, in particular in the case of phytotron-grown plants, and the extent of the heterogeneity was greater in the phytotron-grown plants than in the outdoor plants. When stomata closed gradually, for example, under conditions of limited moisture in the soil, closure occurred uniformly over leaves of plants of both types. The smaller decrease in diffusive conductance of leaves from phytotron-grown plants after treatment with ABA resulted from the presence of patches on the surface in which stomata remained open. The smaller decrease of diffusive conductance in the phytotron-grown plants under conditions of limited moisture in the soil resulted from the uniformly lower responsiveness of stomata on a leaf to the decrease in water potential. When estimates are made of the intercellular concentration of CO2 (Ci) from gas-exchange measurements, heterogeneity in stomatal closure should be monitored when stomata close rapidly, in particular in plants grown in humid air, because heterogeneous stomatal closure can lead to overestimates of Ci. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aleaves 3aleaf conductance 3awater stress 3aabscisic acid 3arelative humidity 3agrowth chambers 3astomatal movement 3asoil water 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3aleaf water potential 3adose response 3aquantitative analysis 3astress response 0afield tests1 aWakabayashi, K.1 aTouya, S.1 aIshihara, K.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1995 Sept., v. 36, no. 6 p.955-964x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle04382naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191072001700208072001700225072001700242100001400259245007800273300001800351500001500369506007600384520157800460506003702038650001702075650001402092650002102106650001502127650002502142650002202167650001802189650002402207650002302231650002802254650002802282650001002310650001902320650002102339650002502360650003002385650001302415650002902428650004902457650007302506650004202579650001202621650001602633650002302649650002802672650001802700650001402718650001302732650002402745650002302769653001402792653001702806653002002823653003502843653004702878653002702925653004302952653002302995653003103018653003103049700001803080700001403098700001803112700002103130700001503151700001603166700001803182773009703200852000903297856009103306930003303397945002503430946001303455655001203468IND4364432720221207085703.0040915e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436443272DNAL7 a151285212pmid7 aPMC4044592pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.5.2702-2708.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We previously constructed and characterized an aroA mutant of Aeromonas hydrophila and studied the protection afforded by this mutant as a live vaccine in rainbow trout. In this work, we describe the survival of this strain in aquatic microcosms prepared from fish water tanks. The aroA mutant disappeared rapidly in nonfiltered, nonautoclaved fish tank water, declining below detection levels after 15 days, suggesting an inhibitory effect of the autochthonous microflora of the water. When the aroA strain was used to inoculate sterilized water, its culturability was lower than that of wild-type strain A. hydrophila AG2; after long periods of incubation, aroA cells were able to enter a viable but nonculturable state. Entry into this nonculturable state was accompanied by changes in the cell morphology from rods to spheres, but the cells appeared to remain potentially viable, as assessed by the preservation of cell membrane integrity. Supplementation of the culture medium with sodium pyruvate favored the culturability and resuscitation of the two A. hydrophila strains at low temperatures (6 and 16°C). These results contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of the aroA strain in natural environments and suggest that the inactivation of the aroA gene may be beneficial for the safety of this live vaccine for aquacultures.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afish culture 3aviability 3astructural genes 3aauxotrophs 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aaquaculture tanks 3alive vaccines 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aintroduced species 3amicrobial resuscitation 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3awater 3acell membranes 3amicrobial growth 3aenvironmental impact 3aalkyl (aryl) transferases 3abacteria 3aantibacterial properties 2a3-Phosphoshikimate 1-Carboxyvinyltransferase 2aAeromonas hydrophilaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aBacterial Vaccines 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCulture Media 2aEcosystem 2aMutation 2aOncorhynchus mykiss 2aWater Microbiology 0aaroA gene 0acell biology 0acell morphology 0aviable but nonculturable state 0a5-enopyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase 0aautochthonous bacteria 0afish-associated autochthonous bacteria 0amicrobial activity 0aactive nonculturable state 0afish tank water microcosms1 aCarracedo, B.1 aRiano, J.1 aRazquin, B.E.1 aLopez-Fierro, P.1 aAcosta, F.1 aNaharro, G.1 aVillena, A.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 May, v. 70, no. 5 p.2702-2708x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.5.2702-2708.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041028b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/28  aOther US 7aarticle03746naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191072001700208072001700225100002500242245007900267300001800346506007600364520181500440506003702255650001802292650001502310650003202325650000902357650001102366650001902377650001702396650002102413650002102434650002102455650001902476650001202495650006202507650001202569650002102581650001402602650005902616650003102675650002802706650002202734650003002756650001002786650001902796700002302815700001402838773009702852852000902949856009102958930003303049945002503082946001303107655001203120IND4364434520221207093620.0040915e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436443452DNAL7 a151285582pmid7 aPMC4044582pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.5.2966-2973.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The influence of heavy metal addition on total, bacterial, and fungal activities was therefore studied for up to 60 days in a laboratory experiment using forest soil contaminated with different concentrations of Zn or Cu. The effects of the metals differed between the different activity measurements. During the first week after metal addition, the total activity (respiration rate) decreased by 30% at the highest level of contamination and then remained stable during the 60 days of incubation. The bacterial activity (thymidine incorporation rate) decreased during the first days with the level of metal contamination, resulting in a 90% decrease at the highest level of contamination. Bacterial activity then slowly recovered to values similar to those of the control soil. The recovery was faster when soil pH, which had decreased due to metal addition, was restored to control values by liming. Fungal activity (acetate-in-ergosterol incorporation rate) initially increased with the level of metal contamination, being up to 3 and 7 times higher than that in the control samples during the first week at the highest levels of Zn and Cu addition, respectively. The positive effect of metal addition on fungal activity then decreased, but fungal activity was still higher in contaminated than in control soil after 35 days. This is the first direct evidence that fungal and bacterial activities in soil are differently affected by heavy metals. The different responses of bacteria and fungi to heavy metals were reflected in an increase in the relative fungal/bacterial ratio (estimated using phospholipid fatty acid analysis) with increased metal load.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asoil bacteria 3asoil fungi 3abiological activity in soil 3azinc 3acopper 3asoil pollution 3aforest soils 3asoil respiration 3aorganic horizons 3amicrobial growth 3apolluted soils 3asoil pH 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aEcosystem 2aFungixdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMetals, Heavyxtoxicity 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aTrees 2aZincxtoxicity1 aTobor-Kaplon, M.A.1 aBaath, E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 May, v. 70, no. 5 p.2966-2973x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.5.2966-2973.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041029b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/28  aOther US 7aarticle03885naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100003000181245007900211300001600290500002400306506007600330520181100406506003702217650002702254650001502281650001302296650002002309650001402329650001402343650001702357650002002374650000902394650001102403650001902414650001402433650001302447650001402460650001902474650001402493650001302507650001202520650003802532650003602570650003802606650002502644650002602669650000902695650002302704650004902727650003702776650003902813650005002852700002302902700001802925700001802943700002602961700002002987773011503007852000903122856008003131655001203211IND4431672820221207080629.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443167282DNAL7 a199958922pmid7 aPMC28122082pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00806-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampodónico, Victoria L.10aEvaluation of Flagella and Flagellin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as Vaccines  ap. 746-755.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPseudomonas aeruginosa is a serious pathogen in hospitalized, immunocompromised, and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa is motile via a single polar flagellum made of polymerized flagellin proteins differentiated into two major serotypes: a and b. Antibodies to flagella delay onset of infection in CF patients, but whether immunity to polymeric flagella and that to monomeric flagellin are comparable has not been addressed, nor has the question of whether such antibodies might negatively impact Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) activation, an important component of innate immunity to P. aeruginosa. We compared immunization with flagella and that with flagellin for in vitro effects on motility, opsonic killing, and protective efficacy using a mouse pneumonia model. Antibodies to flagella were superior to antibodies to flagellin at inhibiting motility, promoting opsonic killing, and mediating protection against P. aeruginosa pneumonia in mice. Protection against the flagellar type strains PAK and PA01 was maximal, but it was only marginal against motile clinical isolates from flagellum-immunized CF patients who nonetheless became colonized with P. aeruginosa. Purified flagellin was a more potent activator of TLR5 than were flagella and also elicited higher TLR5-neutralizing antibodies than did immunization with flagella. Antibody to type a but not type b flagella or flagellin inhibited TLR5 activation by whole bacterial cells. Overall, intact flagella appear to be superior for generating immunity to P. aeruginosa, and flagellin monomers might induce antibodies capable of neutralizing innate immunity due to TLR5 activation, but solid immunity to P. aeruginosa based on flagellar antigens may require additional components beyond type a and type b proteins from prototype strains.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3acystic fibrosis 3aflagellin 3aflagellum 3aimmunization 3ainnate immunity 3amice 3amodels 3aneutralization 3apathogens 3apatients 3apneumonia 3apolymerization 3aserotypes 3avaccines 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialximmunology 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFlagellaximmunology 2aFlagellinximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPseudomonas Infectionsxprevention & control 2aPseudomonas Vaccinesximmunology 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaximmunology 2aToll-Like Receptor 5ximmunologyxmetabolism.1 aLlosa, Nicolás J.1 aGrout, Martha1 aDöring, Gerd1 aMaira-Litrán, Tomás1 aPier, Gerald B.0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.746-755dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00806-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03802naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245019600202300001800398500002400416506007600440520214100516506003702657650002102694650002602715650001302741650001302754650000902767650001402776650001702790650001002807650002102817650000702838650001902845650001602864650001502880700002002895700001502915700001602930700002202946700002202968700001902990700002103009700002803030773013703058852000903195856008003204655001203284IND4460787420221207080610.0110805e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446078742DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.05321-112doi7 aPMC31652612pmcid7 a217429232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabel, Mirjam A.10aBiochemical Characterization and Relative Expression Levels of Multiple Carbohydrate Esterases of the Xylanolytic Rumen Bacterium Prevotella ruminicola 23 Grown on an Ester-Enriched Substrate  ap. 5671-5681.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe measured expression and used biochemical characterization of multiple carbohydrate esterases by the xylanolytic rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola 23 grown on an ester-enriched substrate to gain insight into the carbohydrate esterase activities of this hemicellulolytic rumen bacterium. The P. ruminicola 23 genome contains 16 genes predicted to encode carbohydrate esterase activity, and based on microarray data, four of these were upregulated >2-fold at the transcriptional level during growth on an ester-enriched oligosaccharide (XOSFA,Ac) from corn relative to a nonesterified fraction of corn oligosaccharides (AXOS). Four of the 16 esterases (Xyn10D-Fae1A, Axe1-6A, AxeA1, and Axe7A), including the two most highly induced esterases (Xyn10D-Fae1A and Axe1-6A), were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and biochemically characterized. All four enzymes showed the highest activity at physiologically relevant pH (6 to 7) and temperature (30 to 40°C) ranges. The P. ruminicola 23 Xyn10D-Fae1A (a carbohydrate esterase [CE] family 1 enzyme) released ferulic acid from methylferulate, wheat bran, corn fiber, and XOSFA,Ac, a corn fiber-derived substrate enriched in O-acetyl and ferulic acid esters, but exhibited negligible activity on sugar acetates. As expected, the P. ruminicola Axe1-6A enzyme, which was predicted to possess two distinct esterase family domains (CE1 and CE6), released ferulic acid from the same substrates as Xyn10D-Fae1 and was also able to cleave O-acetyl ester bonds from various acetylated oligosaccharides (AcXOS). The P. ruminicola 23 AxeA1, which is not assigned to a CE family, and Axe7A (CE7) were found to be acetyl esterases that had activity toward a broad range of mostly nonpolymeric acetylated substrates along with AcXOS. All enzymes were inhibited by the proximal location of other side groups like 4-O-methylglucuronic acid, ferulic acid, or acetyl groups. The unique diversity of carbohydrate esterases in P. ruminicola 23 likely gives it the ability to hydrolyze substituents on the xylan backbone and enhances its capacity to efficiently degrade hemicellulose.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aPrevotella ruminicola 3aacetates 3abacteria 3acorn 3aesterases 3aferulic acid 3agenes 3aoligosaccharides 3apH 3arumen bacteria 3atemperature 3awheat bran1 aYeoman, Carl J.1 aHan, Yejun1 aDodd, Dylan1 aAbbas, Charles A.1 ade Bont, Jan A.M.1 aMorrison, Mark1 aCann, Isaac K.O.1 aMackie, R.

We addressed this issue by examining the direct effects of a Gram-positive pathogen, Streptococcus equi, on bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs). Ultrastructural analysis revealed extensive formation of dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum in response to bacterial infection, indicating strong induction of protein synthesis. However, the BMMCs did not show signs of extensive degranulation, and this was supported by only slow release of histamine in response to infection. Coculture of live bacteria with BMMCs caused a profound secretion of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL7/MCP-3, CXCL2/MIP-2, CCL5/RANTES, interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, as shown by antibody-based cytokine/chemokine arrays and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In contrast, heat-inactivated bacteria caused only minimal cytokine/chemokine release. The cytokine/chemokine responses were substantially attenuated in Toll-like receptor 2-deficient BMMCs and were strongly dependent on cell-cell contacts between bacteria and BMMCs. Gene chip microarray analysis confirmed a massively upregulated expression of the genes coding for the secreted cytokines and chemokines and also identified a pronounced upregulation of numerous additional genes, including transcription factors, signaling molecules, and proteases. Together, the present study outlines MC-dependent molecular events associated with Gram-positive infection and thus provides an advancement in our understanding of how MCs may contribute to host defense toward bacterial insults.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptococcus equi 3abacteria 3achemokines 3acoculture 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistamine 3aimmunity 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3amast cells 3amicroarray technology 3apathogens 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteinases 3arough endoplasmic reticulum 3asecretion 3atranscription factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aBone Marrow Cellsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aCell Communicationximmunology 2aCells, Cultured 2aChemokinesxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aCoculture Techniques 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aMast Cellsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aStreptococcal Infectionsximmunology 2aStreptococcus equiximmunology 2aToll-Like Receptor 2ximmunologyxmetabolism.1 aGuss, Bengt1 aPejler, Gunnar0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.854-864dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01004-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02755naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001700161245014400178300001800322500002400340520119200364650001801556650001601574650002101590650003001611650002301641650002201664650002601686650001401712650001301726650001601739650002401755650004001779650005001819650001301869650002901882650003101911650001301942650002401955700001301979700001601992700001502008700001302023700001402036773010802050852000902158856008202167655001202249IND4408091920221121062152.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440809192DNAL7 a186158262pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2008000552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qinhua10aAnalysis of yohimbine alkaloid from Pausinystalia yohimbe by non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 2211-2218.  aIncludes references  aIn the present work, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of Pausinystalia yohimbe-type alkaloids in the barks of Rubiaceae species is presented using different analytical approaches. Extracts of P. yohimbe were first examined by GC-MS and the major alkaloids were identified. The quantitation of yohimbine was then accomplished by non-aqueous CE (NACE) with diode array detection. This approach was selected in order to use a running buffer fully compatible with samples in organic solvent. In particular, a mixture of methanol containing ammonium acetate (20 mM) and glacial acetic acid was used as a BGE. The same analytical sample was subjected to GC-MS and NACE analysis; the different selectivity displayed by these techniques allowed different separation profiles that can be useful in phytochemical characterization of the extracts. The linear calibration ranges were all 10-1000 μg/mL for yohimbine by GC-MS and NACE analysis. The recovery of yohimbine was 91.2-94.0% with RSD 1.4-4.3%. The LOD for yohimbine were 0.6 μg/mL by GC-MS and 1.0 μg/mL by NACE, respectively. The GC-MS and NACE methods were successfully validated and applied to the quantitation of yohimbine. 3aPausinystalia 3aacetic acid 3aammonium acetate 3acapillary electrophoresis 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aquantitative analysis 3ayohimbine 2aAcetates 2aAcetic Acid 2aAlkaloidsxanalysis 2aElectrophoresis, Capillaryxmethods 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMethanol 2aPausinystaliaxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSolvents 2aYohimbinexanalysis1 aLi, Peng1 aZhang, Zhuo1 aLi, Kaijun1 aLiu, Jia1 aLi, Qiang0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 July, v. 31, no. 12 p.2211-2218dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2008000553Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01775naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024002800115040001800143100002000161245005300181300001600234500001500250520031600265650001900581650001700600650003000617650001200647650002500659650002000684650001100704650003600715650001700751650002200768650000900790650002300799650002200822650000900844650002500853650002400878650003000902650004300932653001300975653003500988700001601023773007901039852000901118856007801127939003301205945000801238946001101246655001201257991572928730742620221121062044.0831011e198202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830090302DNAL7 a70806132pmid7 a10.1007/BF009253492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawkins, H.J.S.10aImmunisation of mice against Strongyloides ratti  ap. 327-333.  a2019-12-04  aStrongyloides ratti, mice, resistance to reinfection induced by infection with as few as 6 larvae, comparable resistance induced by injection of soluble somatic antigens from larvae, failure to induce immunity with larvae in peritoneal chambers, considerable cross-resistance after infection with S. stercoralis 3across reaction 3aimmunization 3aStrongyloides stercoralis 2aAnimals 2aAntigensximmunology 2aCross Reactions 2aFemale 2aFreund's Adjuvantxpharmacology 2aImmunization 2aLarvaximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPeritoneal Cavity 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStrongyloidesximmunology 2aStrongyloidiasisxprevention & control 0aimmunity 0aStrongyloides ratti (Nematoda)1 aGrove, D.I.0 tParasitology research.g1982 Feb., v. 66, no. 3 p.327-333x0044-32557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009253493Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19831011c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03634naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002200181245013500203300001600338500002400354506007600378520179200454506003702246650002602283650001802309650001502327650001402342650002102356650001002377650000902387650002802396650001302424650001702437650003902454650001102493650001002504650001202514650003802526650001102564650000902575650005302584650003802637650002702675650003002702650002502732650002502757650002502782700002302807700002202830773011502852852000902967856008002976655001203056IND4431672620221207094302.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443167262DNAL7 a199958972pmid7 aPMC28122112pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00840-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGowin, Chris L.10aMycoplasma genitalium Rapidly Disseminates to the Upper Reproductive Tracts and Knees of Female Mice following Vaginal Inoculation  ap. 726-736.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMycoplasma genitalium is an emerging sexually transmitted infection and in women is associated with notable reproductive tract syndromes such as cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. Investigations into the causal relationships of M. genitalium infections and clinical disease have been hindered largely by the lack of a well-established small-animal model of genital tract infection. To establish a murine model, female Swiss Webster mice were conditioned with either progesterone or estradiol and then inoculated intravaginally with M. genitalium type strain G37 or a contemporary Danish strain, M2300. Persistent lower tract infection was observed at up to 77 days postinoculation (d.p.i.). Upper reproductive tract colonization was observed as early as 3 d.p.i., with long-term infection observed in estradiol-treated (65%) and progesterone-treated (18%) animals. In the upper tract, more than 90% of M. genitalium PCR-positive samples were from the uterus and oviducts. Ultimately, gross hydrosalpinx was observed 21 days to 10 weeks p.i. in approximately 60% of infected animals, suggesting the presence of tubal occlusion. In addition, dissemination of M. genitalium to the knee tissues was observed as early as 7 d.p.i., with persistent infection detected at up to 28 d.p.i. Mice infected with M. genitalium also developed specific antibodies to the major antigenic outer membrane protein MgPa, elongation factor Tu, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α, and DnaK (Hsp70), indicating persistent infection despite robust humoral responses to infection. These findings provide strong experimental evidence that M. genitalium can establish long-term infection of reproductive tract and joint tissues, with preliminary evidence of pathological reproductive tract outcomes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycoplasma genitalium 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3aestradiol 3ahumoral immunity 3aknees 3amice 3aouter membrane proteins 3aoviducts 3aprogesterone 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3auterus 3awomen 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialximmunology 2aFemale 2aMice 2aMycoplasma Infectionsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMycoplasma genitaliumximmunology 2aOviductsxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aStiflexmicrobiology 2aUterusxmicrobiology 2aVaginaxmicrobiology1 aSpagnuolo, Rae Ann1 aPyles, Richard B.0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.726-736dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00840-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01302naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002800097040001800125100001700143245009900160300001400259520030800273650002700581650001300608650002300621653004300644653003400687653002300721653001600744773007700760852000900837856007800846939003300924945000800957946001100965655001200976991572927890742620221121040724.0831012e198208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830090682DNAL7 a10.1007/BF009266572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, G.G.10aTransmission of Nosema fumiferanae (Microsporida) to its host Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)  ap. 47-51.  aNosema fumiferanae, various modes of transmission to Choristoneura fumiferana demonstrated experimentally: perorally, transovarially, spore injection; infected female (but not male) budworms readily transmitted parasite to offspring, sublethal infection in adults reduced number of hatchable eggs by 19% 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aProtozoa 3abiological control 0aDisease transmission, Animal to animal 0aNosema fumiferanae (Protozoa) 0aReproduction, Host 0aSex of host0 tParasitology research.g1982 Aug., v. 68, no. 1 p.47-51x0044-32557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009266573Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19831012c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03173naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002500181245009600206300001600302500002400318506007600342520152800418506003701946650002001983650002702003650001302030650001102043650001602054650001202070650001602082650001402098650001702112650002802129650002302157650002102180650001102201650002902212650004302241650005202284650005802336700002302394700002202417700002402439773011502463852000902578856008002587655001202667IND4431673120221207093416.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443167312DNAL7 a199338312pmid7 aPMC28122032pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00718-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Loughlin, Jason L.10aYersinia pestis Two-Component Gene Regulatory Systems Promote Survival in Human Neutrophils  ap. 773-782.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs, or neutrophils) are the most abundant innate immune cell and kill most invading bacteria through combined activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial granule constituents. Pathogens such as Yersinia pestis resist destruction by the innate immune system and are able to survive in macrophages and neutrophils. The specific molecular mechanisms used by Y. pestis to survive following phagocytosis by human PMNs are incompletely defined. To gain insight into factors that govern Y. pestis intracellular survival in neutrophils, we inactivated 25 two-component gene regulatory systems (TCSs) with known or inferred function and assessed susceptibility of these mutant strains to human PMN granule extracts. Y. pestis strains deficient for PhoPQ, KdpED, CheY, CvgSY, and CpxRA TCSs were selected for further analysis, and all five strains were altered for survival following interaction with PMNs. Of these five strains, only Y. pestis ΔphoPQ demonstrated global sensitivity to a panel of seven individual neutrophil antimicrobial peptides and serine proteases. Notably, Y. pestis ΔphoPQ was deficient for intracellular survival in PMNs. Iterative analysis with Y. pestis strains lacking the PhoP-regulated genes ugd and pmrK indicated that the mechanism most likely responsible for increased resistance to killing is 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose modification of lipid A. Together, the data provide new information about Y. pestis evasion of the innate immune system.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aYersinia pestis 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3ahumans 3amacrophages 3amutants 3aneutrophils 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3areactive oxygen species 3aserine proteinases 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aImmune Evasionxgenetics 2aNeutrophilsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aYersinia pestisxgeneticsximmunologyxpathogenicity.1 aSpinner, Justin L.1 aMinnich, Scott A.1 aKobayashi, Scott D.0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.773-782dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00718-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03342naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002400144245010300168300001400271500002400285500001500309520153600324650001701860650001901877650001601896650003701912650001101949650002801960650002201988650001402010650002002024650001302044650001702057650002002074650001402094650002702108650002102135650001502156650001302171650002002184650002902204653002402233653002402257653002202281653002902303700002602332700002002358700002102378700002402399700001802423773010702441852000902548856006702557930003302624945002502657946001102682990002302693655001202716IND4426602220200928000000.0090928e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442660222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

It is used to make “merkén”, a condiment that is consumed locally and exported. This vegetable requires a nursery stage and can obtain nutritional benefits from symbiotic associations such as mycorrhizal fungi, achieving a better adaptation to transplanting. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are obligate biotrophes appearing in abundance in agroecosystems with conservation management. The aim of this study was to compare effectiveness of two AMF, a commercial mycorrhizal inoculant (IC, Glomus intraradices) and another native (IN, Glomus claroideum) with a control without inoculation (-I) on the production and quality of “Cacho de cabra”. At 45 days after sowing (DAS) transplanting was carried out and at 90 and 216 DAS fruit quality, fungal and edaphic parameters were evaluated. The harvest was at four stages. With IN inoculation plants and with greater foliar area were obtained. Also, precocity of fruit production was observed. The harvest started 49 days earlier and fresh weight was 177% higher than that of the control. Root colonization was low, showing significant differences between IN and IC, while a large number of spores was produced in the substrate. It was concluded that inoculation with native fungi decreased transplanting stress thus accelerating the maturation stage of plants and resulting in higher and better yield quality. 3aharvest date 3aagroecosystems 3ahot peppers 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aGlomus 3ainterspecific variation 3amycorrhizal fungi 3alandraces 3aCapsicum annuum 3aecotypes 3acrop quality 3avegetable crops 3aleaf area 3amicrobial colonization 3aplant adaptation 3acrop yield 3aplanting 3aplant nurseries 3aRhizophagus intraradices 0aspecies differences 0aGlomus intraradices 0aGlomus claroideum 0aplant cultural practices1 aSotomayor S, Leonardo1 aOrtiz O, César1 aLeonelli C, Gina1 aBorie B., Fernando.1 aRubio H, Rosa0 tChilean journal of agricultural research.g2009 , v. 69, no. 1 p.79-87wJournal:17877x0718-58397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.chileanjar.cl/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091117b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/22  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04025naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191072001700208100002000225245015300245300001800398500001500416506007600431520178700507506003702294650004402331650001102375650002702386650002102413650001202434650001202446650001402458650002302472650002102495650001202516650001802528650002102546650002402567650001802591650006602609650002402675650001702699650004202716650003302758650003002791650003602821650002602857650003602883650003002919650002302949653002202972653002302994700001703017700002003034700001703054773009703071852000903168856009103177930003303268945002503301946001303326655001203339IND4364418720221207094855.0040914e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436441872DNAL7 a151285262pmid7 aPMC4044032pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.5.2734-2740.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The results of nuclear magnetic resonance investigations of intracellular osmolytes under different growth conditions coupled with those of studies using genetically modified strains have confirmed and extended this hypothesis. During anaerobic growth in mineral salts medium containing 9% xylose (600 mM) and 1% corn steep liquor, proline was the only abundant osmolyte (71.9 nmol ml-1 optical density at 550 nm [OD550] unit-1), and growth was limited. Under aerobic conditions in the same medium, twice the cell mass was produced, and cells contained a mixture of osmolytes: glutamate (17.0 nmol ml-1 OD550 unit-1), trehalose (9.9 nmol ml-1 OD550 unit-1), and betaine (19.8 nmol ml-1 OD550 unit-1). Two independent genetic modifications of E. coli KO11 (functional expression of Bacillus subtilis citZ encoding NADH-insensitive citrate synthase; deletion of ackA encoding acetate kinase) and the addition of a metabolite, such as glutamate (11 mM) or acetate (24 mM), as a supplement each increased the intracellular glutamate pool during fermentation, doubled cell growth, and increased volumetric productivity. This apparent requirement for a larger glutamate pool for increased growth and volumetric productivity was completely eliminated by the addition of a protective osmolyte (2 mM betaine or 0.25 mM dimethylsulfoniopropionate), consistent with adaptation to osmotic stress rather than relief of a specific biosynthetic requirement.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3axylose 3aalcoholic fermentation 3afree amino acids 3aproline 3acytosol 3atrehalose 3aethanol production 3amicrobial growth 3abetaine 3aglutamic acid 3aEscherichia coli 2aBetainexmetabolism 2aCulture Media 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aGlutamic Acidxmetabolism 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aSulfonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aWater-Electrolyte Balance 2aXylosexmetabolism 0aorganic compounds 0acompatible solutes1 aBuszko, M.L.1 aShanmugam, K.T.1 aIngram, L.O.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 May, v. 70, no. 5 p.2734-2740x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.5.2734-2740.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041029b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle03678naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002300181245011000204300001600314500002400330506007600354520172500430506003702155650001402192650001502206650001902221650001602240650002002256650001902276650001002295650000902305650002602314650002102340650002002361650001402381650001502395650001702410650001202427650005402439650005602493650005102549650005502600650003802655650004002693650005602733650000902789700002002798700001802818700002202836700002602858773011502884852000902999856008003008655001203088IND4431672920221207094815.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443167292DNAL7 a199177182pmid7 aPMC28122142pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01084-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepúlveda, Jorge.10aEfficient Serum Clearance of Botulinum Neurotoxin Achieved Using a Pool of Small Antitoxin Binding Agents  ap. 756-763.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAntitoxins for botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) and other toxins are needed that can be produced economically with improved safety and shelf-life properties compared to conventional therapeutics with large-animal antisera. Here we show that protection from BoNT lethality and rapid BoNT clearance through the liver can be elicited in mice by administration of a pool of epitope-tagged small protein binding agents together with a single anti-tag monoclonal antibody (MAb). The protein binding agents used in this study were single-chain Fv domains (scFvs) with high affinity for BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A). The addition of increasing numbers of differently tagged scFvs synergistically increased the level of protection against BoNT/A. It was not necessary that any of the BoNT/A binding agents possess toxin-neutralizing activity. Mice were protected from a dose equivalent to 1,000 to 10,000 50% lethal doses (LD₅₀) of BoNT/A when given three or four different anti-BoNT scFvs, each fused to an E-tag peptide, and an anti-E-tag IgG1 MAb. Toxin protection was enhanced when an scFv contained two copies of the E tag. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that BoNT/A was rapidly cleared from the sera of mice given a pool of anti-BoNT/A scFvs and an anti-tag MAb but not from the sera of mice given scFvs alone or anti-tag MAb alone. The scFv pool and anti-tag MAb protected mice from lethality when administered up to 2 h following exposure of mice to a dose equivalent to 10 LD₅₀ of BoNT/A. These results suggest that it will be possible to rapidly and economically develop and produce therapeutic antitoxins consisting of pools of tagged binding agents that are administered with a single, stockpiled anti-tag MAb.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantiserum 3aantitoxins 3abinding agents 3ablood serum 3abotulinum toxin 3alethal dose 50 3aliver 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apharmacokinetics 3aprotein binding 3aserotypes 3ashelf life 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aAntibodies, Neutralizingximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aBotulinum Antitoxinximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aBotulinum Toxins, Type Axantagonists & inhibitors 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aEpitopesximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aImmunoglobulin Fragmentsximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aMice1 aMukherjee, Jean1 aTzipori, Saul1 aSimpson, Lance L.1 aShoemaker, Charles B.0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.756-763dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01084-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03322naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245009700177300001600274500002400290520160700314650002301921650002501944650001001969650001201979650002201991650002202013650003202035650001202067650002802079650001002107650001402117650001202131650001402143650001402157650002002171650001302191650001202204650003602216650003802252650003702290650002802327650002702355650001902382650003702401650004802438700001502486700001502501700002002516773013402536852000902670856007702679655001202756IND4408090620221121015925.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440809062DNAL7 a182474172pmid7 a10.1002/tox.203712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAker, Winfred G.10aComparing the relative toxicity of malathion and malaoxon in blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus  ap. 548-554.  aIncludes references  aMalathion inhibits the critical body enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This capability requires that malathion should first be converted to malaoxon to become an active anticholinesterase agent. Conversion can be caused by oxidation in mammals, insects, plants, and in sunlight. In this study, the effects of malathion and malaoxon on catfish Ictalurus furcatus were evaluated. After 96-h exposures, the LC₅₀ (concentration that causes 50% mortality) and IC₅₀ (concentration that causes 50% enzyme inhibition) for malaoxon were lower than corresponding values for malathion. The overall mean 96-h LC₅₀ is 17.0 ppm for malathion and 3.1 ppm for malaoxon. IC₅₀ values for malathion are 8.5 ppm for brain, 10.3 ppm for liver, and 16.6 ppm for muscle. Corresponding values for malaoxon are 2.3, 3.7, and 6.8 ppm, respectively. All the AChE activities in malathion- and malaoxon-exposed catfish brain showed significant inhibition. The oxidation product malaoxon demonstrated higher inhibition on AChE activity than did malathion. Moreover, malaoxon showed significant inhibition on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in the liver if the concentrations were increased to more than 1 ppm. Malathion showed no difference between treatment group and control group. Compared with malathion, malaoxon showed higher inhibition on monoamine activity than that of malathion. The results indicated that the oxidative product malaoxon is more toxic than the parent compound malathion. AChE, BChE, and monoamine activities are confirmed as bioindicators of malathion exposure in blue catfish, I. furcatus. 3aIctalurus furcatus 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abrain 3acatfish 3aenzyme inhibition 3aindicator species 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsects 3alethal concentration 50 3aliver 3amalathion 3amammals 3amortality 3aoxidation 3asolar radiation 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aBiogenic Monoaminesxmetabolism 2aButyrylcholinesterasexmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aIctaluridaexphysiology 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aLethal Dose 50 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMalathionxanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity.1 aHu, Xiaoke1 aWang, Peng1 aHwang, Huey-Min0 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2008 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.548-554dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx1520-40817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.203713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03532naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002800181245018800209300001600397500002400413506007600437520175200513506003702265650001502302650001502317650002902332650001402361650002102375650001502396650001002411650002402421650001002445650001302455650001302468650002902481650001202510650001102522650001302533650001802546650002002564650002102584650001102605650001302616650001102629700003102640700001902671700001802690700002002708700002202728773011502750852000902865856008002874655001202954IND4431673220221207094809.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443167322DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.00857-092doi7 aPMC28121942pmcid7 a199958942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatangkasombut, Oranart10aCytolethal Distending Toxin from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Induces DNA Damage, S/G₂ Cell Cycle Arrest, and Caspase- Independent Death in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Model  ap. 783-792.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a bacterial toxin that induces G₂/M cell cycle arrest, cell distension, and/or apoptosis in mammalian cells. It is produced by several Gram-negative species and may contribute to their pathogenicity. The catalytic subunit CdtB has homology with DNase I and may act as a genotoxin. However, the mechanism by which CdtB leads to cell death is not yet clearly understood. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to study the molecular pathways involved in the function of CdtB from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a cause of aggressive periodontitis. We show that A. actinomycetemcomitans CdtB (AaCdtB) expression induces S/G₂ arrest and death in a DNase-catalytic residue and nuclear localization-dependent manner in haploid yeasts. Yeast strains defective in homologous recombination (HR) repair, but not other DNA repair pathways, are hypersensitive to AaCdtB, suggesting that HR is required for survival upon CdtB expression. In addition, yeast does not harbor the substrate for the other activity proposed for CdtB function, which is phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate phosphatase. Thus, these results suggest that direct DNA-damaging activity alone is sufficient for CdtB toxicity. To investigate how CdtB induces cell death, we examined the effect of CdtB in yeast strains with mutations in apoptotic regulators. Our results suggest that yeast death occurs independently of the yeast metacaspase gene YCA1 and the apoptosis-inducing factor AIF1 but is partially dependent on histone H2B serine 10 phosphorylation. Therefore, we report here the evidence that AaCdtB causes DNA damage that leads to nonapoptotic death in yeast and the first mutation that confers resistance to CdtB.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aapoptosis 3abacterial toxins 3acell cycle 3adeath 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3agenes 3ahaploidy 3ahistones 3ahomologous recombination 3amammals 3amodels 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein subunits 3aserine 3atoxicity 3ayeasts1 aWattanawaraporn, Roongtiwa1 aTsuruda, Keiko1 aOhara, Masaru1 aSugai, Motoyuki1 aMongkolsuk, Skorn0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.783-792dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00857-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03895naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191072001700208072001700225100001600242245011400258300001800372500001500390506007600405520156000481506003702041650004002078650003302118650002002151650001502171650001502186650001802201650002502219650001102244650004202255650002002297650001202317650004502329650002202374650002102396650002402417650001802441650005602459650002402515650003802539650004802577650004102625650002802666650001302694650004802707653002202755653002502777700001502802700001502817700001902832700001902851700001702870700001802887773009702905852000903002856009103011930003303102945002503135946001303160655001203173IND4364414120221207094814.0040914e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436441412DNAL7 a151285122pmid7 aPMC4044302pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.5.2632-2638.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A glucoamylase (GAA) from the yeast Arxula adeninivorans was used as a reporter protein for the study of the secretion efficiencies of several wild-type and mutant strains of K. lactis. The expression of the reporter protein was placed under the control of the strong promoter of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among the laboratory strains tested, strain JA6 was the best producer of GAA. Since this strain is known to be highly sensitive to glucose repression and since this is an undesired trait for biomass-oriented applications, we examined heterologous protein production by using glucose repression-defective mutants isolated from this strain. One of them, a mutant carrying a dgr151-1 mutation, showed a significantly improved capability of producing heterologous proteins such as GAA, human serum albumin, and human interleukin-1beta compared to the parent strain. dgr151-1 is an allele of RAG5, the gene encoding the only hexokinase present in K. lactis (a homologue of S. cerevisiae HXK2). The mutation in this strain was mapped to nucleotide position +527, resulting in a change from glycine to aspartic acid within the highly conserved kinase domain. Cells carrying the dgr151-1 allele also showed a reduction in N- and O-glycosylation. Therefore, the dgr151 strain may be a promising host for the production of heterologous proteins, especially when the hyperglycosylation of recombinant proteins must be avoided.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3arecombinant DNA 3atransgenes 3ahexokinase 3aglycosylation 3arecombinant proteins 3ayeasts 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3agene expression 3amutants 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aprotein secretion 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGlucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHexokinasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKluyveromycesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aprotein synthesis 0aArxula adeninivorans1 aFarina, F.1 aNeglia, B.1 aCompagno, M.C.1 aUccelletti, D.1 aGoffrini, P.1 aPalleschi, C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 May, v. 70, no. 5 p.2632-2638x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.5.2632-2638.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041029b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle03324naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010200166300001600268500002400284520203000308650002302338650002402361650002402385650002102409650002002430650001102450650002002461650001502481650001302496650002102509650001902530650001802549650001802567650001002585650000902595650003102604700001902635700001902654700002302673700001902696773009402715852000902809856004802818655001202866IND4422503520221121004512.0090626e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442250352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-008-9529-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarney, Jacob N.10aBiogenic volatile organic compounds from an invasive species: impacts on plant-plant interactions  ap. 195-205.  aIncludes references  aInvasive plant species impact both ecosystems and economies worldwide, often by displacing native biota. Many plant species exude/emit compounds into the surrounding environment with minor consequences in their native habitat due to a long coevolutionary history. However, upon introduction to ecosystems naïve to these compounds, unpredictable interactions can manifest. The majority of the putative allelochemicals studied have been root exudates, despite the large number of plant species that emit volatile organic compounds. We quantified the concentrations and ecological consequences of volatile monoterpenes from the North American invasive perennial Artemisia vulgaris. Ambient monoterpene-mixing ratios inside an A. vulgaris canopy were 0.02-4.15 ppbv in May and 0.01-0.05 ppbv in August, but were negligible (below instrument detection limit of 0.01 ppbv) 10 m away. Foliar disturbance increased total monoterpene concentration to a maximum of 27 ppbv. However, this level remains 1,000-fold lower than that shown to be phytotoxic to sensitive species in laboratory assays. In contrast, soil monoterpene concentrations were >74-fold higher inside [<=35 ± 11 ng g⁻¹ (SDW)] and 19-fold higher at the edge [9 ± 3 ng g⁻¹ (SDW)], compared to outside the A. vulgaris stand [0.48 ± 0.05 ng g⁻¹ (SDW)]. A common native competitor species, Solidago canadensis, grown in pots and resident soil in situ yielded up to 50% less aboveground biomass inside as compared to outside the A. vulgaris stand. Activated carbon had no effect on greenhouse-grown S. canadensis performance when grown with A. vulgaris, suggesting root-derived exudates are not responsible for field observations. Results from this study suggest that A. vulgaris-derived monoterpenes have little direct activity in their volatile gaseous state, but are concentrated in the soil matrix within and bordering the A. vulgaris stand, thereby reducing interspecific performance and potentially fostering the subsequent local invasion of this species. 3aArtemisia vulgaris 3aSolidago canadensis 3aaboveground biomass 3aactivated carbon 3aallelochemicals 3acanopy 3adetection limit 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3amonoterpenoids 3aphytotoxicity 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3asoil 3avolatile organic compounds1 aSparks, Jed P.1 aGreenberg, Jim1 aWhitlow, Thomas H.1 aGuenther, Alex0 tPlant ecology.g2009 Aug., v. 203, no. 2 p.195-205dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-008-9529-4 7aarticle02457naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245009400158300001800252500002400270500001500294520133700309650001401646650001701660650001601677650001101693650001101704650002301715650001701738653001601755700002001771700002301791700002001814700001801834700002001852773010801872852000901980856008201989655001202071IND4408091120221121004622.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440809112DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2008000732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDugo, Paola10aAnalysis of native carotenoid composition in orange juice using C₃₀ columns in tandem  ap. 2151-2160.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the present contribution, a novel analytical approach based on using serial coupled conventional LC columns is proposed to the study of the native carotenoid composition of orange juice. The great difficulties that are found when analyzing complex carotenoid samples, due to the high natural variability of these compounds as well as to the presence of carotenoid esters are well documented. To overcome some of these limitations, we have developed a methodology including the study of both the saponified and the intact sample by means of two different LC-DAD/APCI-MS methods. The increase in the resolution and separation power obtained when using two serial coupled C₃₀ columns is demonstrated, and significant increases in peak capacity have been achieved. By using this new methodology, 44 different carotenoids have been tentatively identified. Among them, several violaxanthin diesters have been directly identified in orange juice for the first time. The main carotenoids in orange juice were violaxanthin, lutein, luteoxanthin, 9-cis-antheraxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin. Some of them were found in both their free and esterified forms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of serial couplings of C₃₀ columns for the identification of the native carotenoid composition of natural matrices. 3acouplings 3aorange juice 3amethodology 3alutein 3aesters 3abeta-cryptoxanthin 3aviolaxanthin 0anew methods1 aHerrero, Miguel1 aGiuffrida, Daniele1 aRagonese, Carla1 aDugo, Giacomo1 aMondello, Luigi0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 July, v. 31, no. 12 p.2151-2160dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2008000733Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02152naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002600142245007500168300001800243500002400261520119600285650001001481650004301491650001601534650001601550650001401566700002101580700002301601700001501624773010801639852000901747856008201756655001201838IND4408091320221121005347.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440809132DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2007005942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Sayah, Mohammad A.10aHigh throughput screening of active pharmaceutical ingredients by UPLC  ap. 2167-2172.  aIncludes references  aUltra performance LC (UPLC) was evaluated as an efficient screening approach to facilitate method development for drug candidates. Three stationary phases were screened: C-18, phenyl, and Shield RP 18 with column dimensions of 150 mmx2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, which should theoretically generate [tilde]35 000 plates or [tilde]175% of the typical column plate count of a conventional 250 mmx4.6 mm, 5 μm particle column. Thirteen different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were screened using this column set with a standardized mobile-phase gradient. The UPLC method selectivity results were compared to those obtained for these compounds via methods developed through laborious trial and error screening experiments using numerous conventional HPLC mobile and stationary phases. Peak capacity was compared for columns packed with 5 μm particles and columns packed with 1.7 μm particles. The impurities screened by UPLC were confirmed by LC/MS. The results demonstrate that simple, high efficiency UPLC gradients are a feasible and productive alternative to more conventional multiparametric chromatographic screening approaches for many compounds in the early stages of drug development. 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aingredients 3aplate count 3ascreening1 aRizos, Panagiota1 aAntonucci, Vincent1 aWu, Naijun0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 July, v. 31, no. 12 p.2167-2172dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007005943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04687naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191072001700208072001700225100001500242245013400257300001800391506007600409520193500485506003702420650001802457650001602475650001202491650001902503650001902522650001402541650002302555650001402578650002502592650003202617650002202649650004502671650001802716650001002734650002302744650002002767650002002787650001902807650002602826650002302852650004802875650005102923650006202974650002703036650003403063650002903097650001603126650001403142650003903156650002903195650003003224650004603254650005503300650003403355650002003389650002203409650001003431653005403441653001603495653001903511700001803530700001403548700001503562773009703577852000903674856009103683930003303774945002503807946001303832655001203845IND4364424620221207082129.0040914e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436442462DNAL7 a151285062pmid7 aPMC4044162pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.5.2577-2587.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPesaro, M.10aImpact of soil drying rewetting stress on microbial communities and activities and on degradation of two crop protection products  ap. 2577-2587.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrior to registration of crop protection products (CPPs) their persistence in soil has to be determined under defined conditions. For this purpose, soils are collected in the field and stored for up to 3 months prior to the tests. During storage, stresses like drying may induce changes in microbiological soil characteristics (MSCs) and thus may influence CPP degradation rates. We investigated the influence of soil storage-related stress on the resistance and resilience of different MSCs by assessing the impact of a single severe drying-rewetting cycle and by monitoring recovery from this event for 34 days. The degradation and mineralization of the fungicide metalaxyl-M and the insecticide lufenuron were delayed by factors of 1.5 to 5.4 in the dried and rewetted soil compared to the degradation and mineralization in an undisturbed reference. The microbial biomass, as estimated by direct cell counting and from the soil DNA content, decreased on average by 51 and 24%, respectively. The bulk microbial activities, as determined by measuring substrate-induced respiration and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, increased after rewetting and recovered completely within 6 days after reequilibration. The effects on Bacteria, Archaea, and Pseudomonas were investigated by performing PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes and reverse-transcribed 16S rRNA, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and terminal RFLP (T-RFLP) fingerprinting. Statistical analyses of RFLP and T-RFLP profiles indicated that specific groups in the microbial community were sensitive to the stress. In addition, evaluation of rRNA genes and rRNA as markers for monitoring the stress responses of microbial communities revealed overall similar sensitivities. We concluded that various structural and functional MSCs were not resistant to drying-rewetting stress and that resilience depended strongly on the parameter investigated.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asoil bacteria 3aPseudomonas 3aArchaea 3abiodegradation 3amineralization 3ametalaxyl 3afungicide residues 3alufenuron 3ainsecticide residues 3abiological activity in soil 3aspecies diversity 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3agenes 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agrassland soils 3asilt loam soils 3asoil pollution 3apesticide persistence 3asoil water content 2aAlaninexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aArchaeaxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBenzamidesxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysis 2aDesiccation 2aEcosystem 2aFungicides, Industrialxmetabolism 2aInsecticidesxmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPseudomonasxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aWater 0aterminal restriction fragment length polymorphism 0asoil drying 0asoil rewetting1 aNicollier, G.1 aZeyer, J.1 aWidmer, F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 May, v. 70, no. 5 p.2577-2587x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.5.2577-2587.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041029b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/28  aOther US 7aarticle02386naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017200126300001800298520130500316650002401621650002201645650001101667650001901678650001601697650001601713650001601729650001701745650002601762650002001788653002301808700001601831700001601847773008301863852000901946930003301955945001301988946001102001655001202012IND2051151920221120081112.0960507e199510  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205115192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, M.K.10aTemperature dependent alterations in the pattern of photochemical and non-photochemical quenching and associated changes in the photosystem II conditions of the leaves  ap. 1221-1227.  aThe alterations in the PSII activity of leaves, subsequent to a mild or severe heat stress were characterized by monitoring the Chl a fluorescence and thermoluminescence emission from intact leaves. The Chl a fluorescence measurements were carried out in leaves adapted to either 'state I' or 'state II' since under these two conditions the photosynthetic apparatus is known to have distinctly different structure-function relationships. The pattern of Chl a fluorescence induction in state II-adapted leaves was different from that of state I-adapted leaves due to the alterations in the extent of photochemical (qQ) and non-photochemical (qE) quenching during the time course of induction. The pattern of changes in qQ and qE values was also altered by heat treatment depending on the severity of heat stress; severe heat stress (47 degrees C) suppressing these parameters drastically. Mild heat treatment (42 degrees C) did not affect the ability of leaves to undergo state I to state II transition whereas the severe heat stress totally abolished such transition. The fluorescence and thermoluminescence characteristics of the leaves that have been exposed to the severe heat stress suggest that a large number of affected PSII units retain a functional water-oxidizing complex at the donor side. 3aEpipremnum pinnatum 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aleaves 3aphotosystem II 3aheat stress 3atemperature 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3aquantitative analysis 3astress response 0athermoluminescence1 aDesai, T.S.1 aMohanty, P.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1995 Oct., v. 36, no. 7 p.1221-1227x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03085naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245007200145300001800217520145600235650001701691650003701708650001101745650000801756650002501764650001701789650001901806650002501825650001801850650001001868650001001878650001101888650002801899650003601927650002401963650001801987650002302005650002402028650002302052650002302075650001502098650002802113650003102141650003402172650002202206653002802228653001602256653001902272700001302291700001402304700001602318773008302334852000902417930003302426945001302459946001102472655001202483IND2051152220221120081037.0960507e199510  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205115222DNAL7 a85642982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, S.10aCloning and sequencing of a cDNA for poplar endo-1,4-beta-glucanase  ap. 1229-1235.  aA cDNA for poplar endo-1,4-beta-glucanase was cloned by use of a synthetic oligonucleotide as probe. The probe was designed on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the beta-glucanase from suspension-cultured poplar cells (Populus alba L.), and by complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was determined. The 1,614 bp cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1,482 base pairs, encoding 494 amino acids. Removal of a putative signal sequence from the deduced amino acid sequence of the polypeptide yielded a mature protein of 467 amino acids. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the poplar endo-1,4-beta-glucanase was 80% and 70% identity to avocado fruit and bean abscission endo-1,4-beta-glucanases, respectively. Hydropathy plot analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence suggests that poplar endo-1,4-beta-glucanase belongs to family E in terms of the cellulase catalytic domain, and avocado fruit and abscission bean endo-1,4-beta-glucanases also belong to this family. 2,4-D markedly increased the level of the endo-1,4-beta-glucanase mRNA in cultured cells, while GA3, benzyladenine and abscisic acid each repressed transcription of this mRNA. The transcript was also detected in the roots and stems of intact plants, although the level of mRNA was much lower in intact tissues than in cultured cells. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that a small family of gene for endo-1,4-beta-glucanase exists in poplar. 3aPopulus alba 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aclones 3aDNA 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic code 3abeta-glucanase 3aamino acid sequences 3amessenger RNA 3aroots 3astems 3aleaves 3acell suspension culture 3achemical constituents of plants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCellulasexgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDNA, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTreesxenzymology 0amolecular sequence data 0agsdb/d32166 0agenbank/d321661 aMori, H.1 aSakai, F.1 aHayashi, T.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1995 Oct., v. 36, no. 7 p.1229-1235x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle04936naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191072001700208072001700225100001700242245013200259300001800391500001500409506007600424520214000500506003702640650004402677650002302721650003702744650001802781650002102799650002702820650002202847650002302869650001902892650001502911650001402926650001102940650001802951650003202969650003203001650002203033650002603055650001703081650001503098650001603113650002603129650005203155650001303207650001603220650007203236650002803308650002903336650001403365650002903379650001603408650006903424650002903493650003403522650003403556650005203590650002203642650001303664651001203677653002403689653002203713700001803735700001503753700001703768700001703785773009703802852000903899856009103908930003303999945002504032946001304057655001204070IND4364424820221207085707.0040914e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436442482DNAL7 a151285202pmid7 aPMC4043922pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.5.2692-2701.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGirvan, M.S.10aResponses of active bacterial and fungal communities in soils under winter wheat to different fertilizer and pesticide regimens  ap. 2692-2701.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe composition of the active microbial (bacterial and fungal) soil community in an arable wheat field subjected to different management practices was examined at five times during a 1-year period. Field sections were fertilized either at good agricultural practice (GAP) levels or at reduced levels (0.5x GAP) and were inoculated with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) at the same time. Field subsections were treated either with or without pesticides. Changes in the active microbial communities were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of reverse transcription-PCR-amplified 16S and 18S rRNA. Microbial community structure was primarily determined by season, and the seasonal trends were similar for the fungal and bacterial components. Between-sample microbial heterogeneity decreased under a mature crop in the summer but increased following harvesting and plowing. Although similar overall trends were seen for the two microbial components, sample variability was greater for the fungal community than for the bacterial community. The greatest management effects were due to GAP fertilization, which caused increases in the bacterial numbers in the total and culturable communities. Microbial biomass similarly increased. GAP fertilization also caused large shifts in both the active bacterial community structure and the active fungal community structure and additionally resulted in a decrease in the heterogeneity of the active bacterial community. Pesticide addition did not significantly affect bacterial numbers or heterogeneity, but it led to major shifts in the active soil bacterial community structure. PCR primers specific for Glomales 25S rRNA genes were used to monitor the VAM population following inoculation. Glomales were detected initially only in VAM-inoculated field sections but were subsequently detected in noninoculated field sections as the season progressed. After plowing, the level of Glomales was reduced in noninoculated field sections but remained high in VAM-inoculated field sections. Inoculation of VAM correlated with elevated soil phosphate and carbon levels.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aagricultural soils 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aribosomal RNA 3aapplication rate 3afertilizer application 3aTriticum aestivum 3apopulation density 3asoil fertility 3aphosphates 3aGigaspora 3aGlomus 3asoil bacteria 3agood agricultural practices 3abiological activity in soil 3aspecies diversity 3alow input agriculture 3awinter wheat 3asoil fungi 3agrain crops 3apesticide application 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3anitrates 2aAgriculture 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysis 2aEcosystem 2aElectrophoresisxmethods 2aFertilizers 2aFungixgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aPesticidesxpharmacology 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTriticum 3aEngland 0agel electrophoresis 0acommunity ecology1 aBullimore, J.1 aBall, A.S.1 aPretty, J.N.1 aOsborn, A.M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 May, v. 70, no. 5 p.2692-2701x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.5.2692-2701.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041029b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/27  aOther US 7aarticle04414naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191100001100208245013800219300001800357500001500375506007600390520162900466506003702095650001802132650001602150650002702166650001802193650002302211650003002234650002802264650002002292650001302312650001002325650002002335650001402355650002002369650002002389650001102409650002302420650003002443650002102473650004202494650001802536650001902554650002302573650003802596650003402634650003902668650002002707650003102727650004802758650002502806650002902831650002902860650003302889650003002922650003402952650003802986650002403024650002203048650001903070650006103089653003003150653001903180700001803199700001203217700001803229700001503247700001803262773009703280852000903377856009103386930003303477945002503510946001303535655001203548IND4364423920221207094218.0040914e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436442392DNAL7 a151285692pmid7 aPMC4043832pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.5.3073-3081.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We monitored in situ interactions between gfp-tagged biocontrol strains of T. atroviride and soilborne plant pathogens that were grown in cocultures and on cucumber seeds by confocal scanning laser microscopy and fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Spores of T. atroviride adhered to Pythium ultimum mycelia in coculture experiments. In mycoparasitic interactions of T. atroviride with P. ultimum or Rhizoctonia solani, the mycoparasitic hyphae grew alongside the pathogen mycelia, and this was followed by coiling and formation of specialized structures similar to hooks, appressoria, and papillae. The morphological changes observed depended on the pathogen tested. Branching of T. atroviride mycelium appeared to be an active response to the presence of the pathogenic host. Mycoparasitism of P. ultimum by T. atroviride occurred on cucumber seed surfaces while the seeds were germinating. The interaction of these fungi on the cucumber seeds was similar to the interaction observed in coculture experiments. Green fluorescent protein expression under the control of host-inducible promoters was also studied. The induction of specific Trichoderma genes was monitored visually in cocultures, on plant surfaces, and in soil in the presence of colloidal chitin or Rhizoctonia by confocal microscopy and fluorescence stereomicroscopy. These tools allowed initiation of the mycoparasitic gene expression cascade to be monitored in vivo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amycoparasites 3aTrichoderma 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3acell adhesion 3afungal antagonists 3afungal diseases of plants 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3agene expression 3amycelium 3aseeds 3aCucumis sativus 3acucumbers 3adisease control 3aPythium ultimum 3achitin 3abiological control 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aseed inoculation 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3afungal spores 3areporter genes 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aChitinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCucumis sativusxmicrobiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPythiumxgrowth & development 2aRhizoctoniaxgrowth & development 2aSeedsxmicrobiology 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSpores, Fungal 2aTrichodermaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0abiological control agents 0amycoparasitism1 aTombolini, R.1 aWoo, S.1 aZeilinger, S.1 aLorito, M.1 aJansson, J.K.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 May, v. 70, no. 5 p.3073-3081x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.5.3073-3081.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041029b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle02213naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012900143300001800272500001500290520035500305650001200660650001700672650000800689650002100697650002900718650001000747650002200757650002100779650001800800650004700818650001800865650001500883650003500898650003800933650001700971650003000988650002801018650003101046650002901077650003001106650003601136650002701172650002301199653002801222653001901250653002301269653001701292653002801309653002501337653001901362700001601381700001201397700001701409773008301426852000901509930003301518945001301551946001101564655001201575IND2051157420221120051031.0960507e199510  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205115742DNAL7 a85643062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikami, K.10aPotential transcription regulatory sequences in a promoter region of the wheat basic/leucine zipper protein HBP-1b(c38) gene  ap. 1375-1379.  a2019-12-05  aA gene encoding the wheat transcription factor HBP-1b(c38) and its promoter region have been structurally analyzed.

Isolates that had low levels of resistance (hereafter referred to as LR isolates) and high levels of resistance (hereafter referred to as HR isolates) were also cold and heat sensitive, respectively. Results from microsatellite DNA fingerprints showed that genetic identities among the populations of sensitive (S), LR, and HR isolates were very high (>0.96). Analysis of DNA sequences of the beta-tubulin gene showed that the LR isolates had a point mutation at codon 6, causing a replacement of the amino acid histidine by tyrosine. Codon 198, which encodes a glutamic acid in S and LR isolates, was converted to a codon for alanine in HR isolates. Based on these point mutations in the beta-tubulin gene, allele-specific PCR assays were developed for rapid detection of benzimidazole-resistant isolates of M. fructicola from stone fruit.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astone fruits 3aorchards 3amicrosatellite repeats 3atubulin 3astructural genes 3afungal diseases of plants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amutation 3aPrunus 3afruit diseases 3amutants 3abenomyl 3aMonilinia fructicola 3athiophanate-methyl 3afungicide residues 2aAscomycotaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBenomylxpharmacology 2aBenzimidazolesxpharmacology 2aDNA, Fungalxanalysis 2aDrug Resistance, Fungalxgenetics 2aFlowersxmicrobiology 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPrunusxmicrobiology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aThiophanatexpharmacology 2aTubulinxgenetics 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0abenzimidazole fungicides 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aYoshimura, M.A.1 aMichailides, T.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2003 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.7145-7152x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.12.7145-7152.20033Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdMWLe2004/12/23  aOther US 7aarticle01878naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008100127500018000208500001500388520086500403650002101268650001401289653003001303700001301333700001801346773015601364852000901520930003301529945001301562946001301575655001201588IND2056139920221123032307.0970325s1995    dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205613992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzardoki, F.10aDevelopment of assay for analysis of Hg2+ based on sulfur-containing ligands  aDeveloped from a symposium sponsored by the Division of Agrochemicals at the 207th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, March 13-17, 1994, San Diego, California.  a2019-12-06  aWe have developed a simple analytical method for the detection of mercuric ions at low ppb levels. We combined inexpensive ELISA methodology with the selective, high affinity recognition of Hg2+ ions by dithiocarbamate chelators. Thus, we employed sulfur-containing complexing agents instead of antibodies as analytical tools. One of our assay formats comprises a sandwich chelate formed by a chelator doped on the surface of the ELISA plate, the mercuric ion, and a chelator coupled to a reporter enzyme. Another format is based on the competition of the analyte ions with a mercury containing reagent (e.g., enzyme tracer) for the binding to a chelate linked reagent (e.g., immobilized chelator). Our preliminary results demonstrate that the high sensitivity and selectivity of our assay systems hold promise for the monitoring of mercury in the environment. 3awaste management 3apollution 0aenvironmental degradation1 aKido, H.1 aHammock, B.D.0 tImmunoanalysis of agrochemicals : emerging technologies.dWashington, D.C. : American Chemical Society, 1995.aAmerican Chemical Society.

Approximately 10% of the produced folate is released into the environment. Overexpression of folC in L. lactis led to an increase in the length of the polyglutamyl tail from the predominant 4, 5, and 6 glutamate residues in wild-type cells to a maximum of 12 glutamate residues in the folate synthetase overproducer and resulted in a complete retention of folate in the cells. Overexpression of folKE, encoding the bifunctional protein 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihy-dropteridine pyrophosphokinase and GTP-cyclohydrolase I, resulted in reduction of the average polyglutamyl tail length, leading to enhanced excretion of folate. By simultaneous overexpression of folKE and folC, encoding the enzyme folate synthetase or polyglutamyl folate synthetase, the average polyglutamyl tail length was increased, again resulting in normal wild-type distribution of folate. The production of bioavailable monoglutamyl folate and almost complete release of folate from the bacterium was achieved by expressing the gene for gamma-glutamyl hydrolase from human or rat origin. These engineering studies clearly establish the role of the polyglutamyl tail length in intracellular retention of the folate produced. Also, the potential application of engineered food microbes producing folates with different tail lengths is discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactococcus lactis 3acultured milk starters 3agenetic engineering 3agene overexpression 3astructural genes 3aenzymes 3afolic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aglutamic acid 3afermentation 2aAnimals 2aDiphosphotransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGTP Cyclohydrolasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aHumans 2aLactococcus lactisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMultienzyme Complexesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Synthasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPteroylpolyglutamic Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRats 2agamma-Glutamyl Hydrolasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0afolc gene 0afolke gene 0afolate synthetase 0apolyglutamyl folate synthetase1 aBorn, E. van den1 aStarrenburg, M.1 aMierau, I.1 aKleerebezem, M.1 aVos W.M. de1 aHugenholtz, J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2003 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.7101-7107x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.12.7101-7107.20033Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdMWLe2004/12/22  aOther US 7aarticle02869naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001200203245007400215300001400289500001500303520145500318650001501773650002301788650001201811650001301823650001801836650001701854650001701871650001501888650002101903650001701924650002101941650001401962653001901976653001101995653001702006700001602023700001602039700001402055773008702069852000902156856009202165930003302257945002502290946001302315990002302328655001202351IND4375182120221123031748.0051013s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437518212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4506.2005.00008.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLee, H.10aEffect of polyols versus sugar on the shelf life of vanilla ice cream  ap. 44-52.  a2019-12-06  aIce cream defects can be classified into many different categories such as defects in flavor, body and texture, color and shrinkage and melting quality characteristics. Quality degradation of packaged ice cream primarily involves body and texture, with the most common problem being the development of a coarse, icy texture. Accelerated shelf-life testing, which involves extremes of heat shock exposure under controlled conditions, is useful in evaluating shelf life; however, it will not provide information about the specific shelf life of the product, given the uncertain nature of the conditions to which it will be exposed. A 6-month study was conducted as a comparison of two vanilla ice cream samples, with the exception of the use of sugar as the control or maltitol as the experimental polyol variable to provide a profile of consumer or customer complaints received, combined with the evaluation of products purchased at or near the sell-by date. A random sample of 19 persons were used as taste panelists and were asked to rate the samples on the basis of sensory characteristics. The evaluation consisted of four distinctive categories such as taste, texture, appearance and overall sample. In this study, no significant differences for coarseness were found for each sample over the 6-month period. This shows that the no sugar-added ice cream retained the texture characteristics of regular ice cream during the 6-month testing period. 3ashelf life 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3amaltitol 3avanilla beans 3afood storage 3afood quality 3aflavorings 3aconsumer surveys 3astorage time 3aflavor compounds 3aice cream 0asugar alcohols 0asugars 0afrozen foods1 aStokols, J.1 aPalchak, T.1 aBordi, P.0 tFoodservice research international.g2005, v. 16, no. 1-2 p.44-52x1524-82757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4506.2005.00008.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20051019b20051102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/10/18  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02079naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245004500128500018000173520110800353650001501461650001801476700001801494700002101512700001401533700001801547773015601565852000901721930003301730945001301763946001301776655001201789IND2056138120221123031746.0970325s1995    dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205613812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodrow, M.H.10aStrategies for immunoassay hapten design  aDeveloped from a symposium sponsored by the Division of Agrochemicals at the 207th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, March 13-17, 1994, San Diego, California.  aImmunoassay performance is a function of the affinity and selectivity of the antibody. The immunizing hapten should represent a near perfect mimic of the target molecule in structure, electronic and hydrophobic properties. These haptens are tethered with an antigenically inert handle distal to the determinant group(s) and do not mask or alter any functional group. Optimal hapten design criteria are based on extending an existing carbon chain, or replacing a C-H moiety of the target molecule with a CH2 chain terminated by a functional group for conjugation to proteins. Careful selection of immunizing hapten can lead to the production of compound or class selective antibodies. A multiple hapten approach, based on handle location, length, and composition, results in assays with sub-ppb levels of detection and improved selectivity. Examination of cross-reactivity data of the haptens led to the identification of the best coating/enzyme-labeled haptens for improved heterologous assays. Examples from research with triazine, arylurea, and chloracetanilide pesticides illustrate these principles. 3apesticides 3aagrochemicals1 aSanborn, J.R.1 aStoutamire, D.W.1 aGee, S.J.1 aHammock, B.D.0 tImmunoanalysis of agrochemicals : emerging technologies.dWashington, D.C. : American Chemical Society, 1995.aAmerican Chemical Society.

Field experiments were conducted at two locations in 1991 and 1992 to determine the influence of selected densities and emergence times of redroot pigweed on corn growth and grain yield. Redroot pigweed densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 plants per m of row were established within 125 cm on either side of the corn row. In both years, redroot pigweed seeds were planted concurrently and with corn at the 3- to 5-leaf stage of corn growth. A density of 0.5 redroot pigweed per m of row from the first (earlier) emergence date of pigweed (in most cases, up to the 4-leaf stage of corn) or four redroot pigweed per m of row from the second (later) emergence date of pigweed (in most cases, between the 4- and 7-leaf stage of corn) reduced corn yield by 5%. Redroot pigweed emerging after the 7-leaf stage of corn growth did not reduce yield. Redroot pigweed seed production was dependent upon its density and time of emergence. The time of redroot pigweed emergence, relative to corn, may be more important than its density in assessing the need for postemergence control. 3aZea mays 3aeconomic threshold 3aleaf area index 3acrop yield 3apopulation density 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3acrop-weed competition 3aintegrated pest management 3agrains 3aintegrated weed management 3aOntario 0aweed control 0acrop growth stage 0atiming 0aemergence 0ayield losses 0acompetitive ability1 aWeise, S.F.1 aSwanton, C.J.0 tWeed science.g1994 , v. 42, no. 4 p.568-573x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02532naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009200125500018000217520149800397650001501895650001801910700001501928700001801943700001701961700001301978700001501991773015602006852000902162930003302171945001302204946001302217655001202230IND2056139520221123031901.0970325s1995    dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205613952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, R.B.10aImmunoaffinity chromatography applications in pesticide metabolism and residue analysis  aDeveloped from a symposium sponsored by the Division of Agrochemicals at the 207th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, March 13-17, 1994, San Diego, California.  aThe imidazolinone compounds are a new class of herbicides which are environmentally safe and effective at very low application rates. Because of the shared imidazolinone ring structure amongst several herbicides, generic antibodies were prepared which recognized all the compounds in this class. These antibodies are useful not only for developing immunoassays for the detection of low levels of residues in soil or in plant extracts, they are also useful for preparing antibody affinity columns used for sample clean-up in metabolism and residue studies. Imidazolinone-compound containing extracts from wheat plant, corn grain, corn fodder, goat urine, and goat kidney tissue were tested on the antibody columns. It was found that the analyses were bound to the antibody column after some simple sample preparation procedures. The bound analyses were easily eluted with a solution of 30% methanol in water. It was further demonstrated that metabolites of imidazolinone compounds which retain the imidazolinone ring structure can be purified through a simple antibody affinity chromatography procedure and be identified thereafter by mass spectrometry. A comparison of mono-and poly-clonal antibody columns indicates that the monoclonal antibody with its uniform affinity and more restricted binding epitope is better for antibody affinity chromatographies. A lower amount of matrix is bound to the monoclonal antibody column, thus producing a cleaner sample than a polyclonal antibody column. 3apesticides 3aagrochemicals1 aPont, J.L.1 aJohnson, D.H.1 aZulalian, J.1 aChin, T.1 aKaru, A.E.0 tImmunoanalysis of agrochemicals : emerging technologies.dWashington, D.C. : American Chemical Society, 1995.aAmerican Chemical Society.

The molecular mass of alpha-L-arabinopyranosidase was found to be 310 kDa by gel filtration, consisting of four identical subunits (77 kDa each, measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [SDS-PAGE]), and that of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase was found to be 60 kDa by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. alpha-L-Arabinopyranosidase and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase showed optimal activity at pH 5.5 to 6.0 and 40 degrees C and pH 4.5 and 45 degrees C, respectively. Both purified enzymes were potently inhibited by Cu(2+) and p-chlormercuryphenylsulfonic acid. alpha-L-Arabinopyranosidase acted to the greatest extent on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, followed by ginsenoside Rb2. alpha-L-Arabinofuranosidase acted to the greatest extent on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside, followed by ginsenoside Rc. Neither enzyme acted on p-nitrophenyl-beta-galactopyranoside or p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-fucopyranoside. These findings suggest that the biochemical properties and substrate specificities of these purified enzymes are different from those of previously purified alpha-L-arabinosidases.

Results indicated that while the traditional producers generally represented a homogenous group in terms of these criteria, there were some marked differences visa via the organic producers. 3aagriculture 3afood biotechnology 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3aorganic production 3afarmers 3afood industry 3afarmers' attitudes 3atransgenic plants 3aorganic certification 3aMidwestern United States1 aStover, Ronald1 aHirai, Satoko0 tFoodservice research international.g2006 June, v. 17, no. 3 p.152-158dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1524-82757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4506.2006.00034.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070821b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/21  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02174naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245010500168300001300273500001500286520088100301650002701182650001701209650002101226650002201247650001601269650002001285650002301305650001601328650002601344650002801370653001701398653001601415700001901431700001801450773008901468852000901557856009401566930003301660945001301693946001101706990002301717655001201740IND2333649220221122231811.0030717e200306  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233364922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4506.2003.tb00174.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, K.E.10aDevelopment of service quality measurement for foodservice in continuing care retirement communities  ap. 1-21.  a2019-12-06  aThe purposes of the study were to develop a service quality measurement applicable to foodservice of continuing care retirement communities and to examine the dimensionality of service quality. The instrument developed for this study encompassed both the process and outcome aspects of service quality and reflected older customers' specific needs and the unique dining environments of continuing care retirement communities. A pilot-test at a continuing care retirement community revealed that the instrument had high internal reliability. Residents in the independent-living units of five continuing care retirement communities were surveyed. The usable response rate was 48.8% (N = 405). One factor was identified from exploratory factor analysis. Possible explanations of the unidimensionality of service quality are discussed and suggestions for future research provided. 3aretirement communities 3afood quality 3aconsumer surveys 3aelderly nutrition 3areliability 3aquality of life 3aconsumer attitudes 3ameasurement 3aconsumer satisfaction 3afood service management 0afood service 0amethodology1 aShanklin, C.W.1 aJohnson, D.E.0 tFoodservice research international.g2003 June, v. 14, no. 1 p.1-21x1524-82757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4506.2003.tb00174.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02816naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072001700154072001700171072001700188100001600205245014600221300001600367500001500383520115800398650001701556650001901573650002401592650001701616650002401633650001501657650001301672650002301685650001601708650001401724650003401738650001901772650002201791650002101813650002101834650001801855650000901873650001801882650001101900650001701911653001701928700001601945773009201961852000902053856009402062930003302156945002502189946001302214990002302227655001202250IND4364090820221122221744.0040825e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436409082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4506.2004.tb00194.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSimpson, R.10aDesigning a modified atmosphere packaging system for foodservice portions on nonrespiring foods: optimal gas mixture and food/headspace ratio  ap. 257-272.  a2019-12-06  aThere are more than 850,000 retail foodservice establishments, restaurants, schools, offices, vending machines, hospitals, sports arenas, quick-service outlets, in the United States, serving more than $1 billion worth of food daily. For foodservice a modified atmosphere packaging system could be a good alternative packaging. Modified atmosphere packaging can provide a longer shelf-life for nonrespiring food. The aim of this research was to show the potential application of a mathematical model in designing an optimal food/package system for Pacific Hake. The mathematical model was used to determine the optimal gas mixture and the ratio food/headspace in foodservice portions. According to the simulation study, optimal conditions for Pacific Hake in foodservice portions were a 40/20/40 gas mixture (CO2/O2/and N2) and a headspace/food ratio of 2:1. Optimal conditions consider maximum shelf-life and an adequate film collapse criterion. In addition, economical aspects were qualitatively considered. The utilization of a mathematical model significantly minimized the cost and time to find the optimal packaging design for foodservice portions. 3aportion size 3acarbon dioxide 3amathematical models 3afood service 3apackaging materials 3ashelf life 3anitrogen 3aheadspace analysis 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3afood packaging 3aactivation energy 3aequipment design 3amodel validation 3amass transfer 3ahake 3aheat transfer 3aoxygen 3apermeability 0aoptimization1 aCarevic, E.0 tFoodservice research international.g2004 July, v. 14, no. 4 p.257-272x1524-82757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4506.2004.tb00194.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060817b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/09/01  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03095naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174072001700192100001700209245008100226300001800307506007600325520124400401506003701645650001801682650002001700650001801720650001001738650002501748650001701773650001801790650000901808650006201817650003101879650001801910650002901928650001601957650002801973650001402001650003402015650002702049650002202076653002802098653003702126700001902163700001602182700001802198700001802216773009902234852000902333856009202342930003302434945002502467946001302492655001202505IND4364481520221207092730.0040916e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436448152DNAL7 a146603682pmid7 aPMC3099962pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.69.12.7210-7215.20032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We cultured a collection of 350 isolates from soil by using simple solid media in petri dishes. These isolates were assigned to 60 family-level groupings in nine bacterial phyla on the basis of a comparative analysis of their 16S rRNA genes. Ninety-three (27%) of the isolates belonged to 20 as-yet-unnamed family-level groupings, many from poorly studied bacterial classes and phyla. They included members of subdivisions 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the phylum Acidobacteria, subdivision 3 of the phylum Verrucomicrobia, subdivision 1 of the phylum Gemmatimonadetes, and subclasses Acidimicrobidae and Rubrobacteridae of the phylum Actinobacteria. In addition, members of 10 new family-level groupings of subclass Actinobacteridae of the phylum Actinobacteria and classes Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria of the phylum Proteobacteria were obtained. The high degree of phylogenetic novelty and the number of isolates affiliated with so-called unculturable groups show that simple cultivation methods can still be developed further to obtain laboratory cultures of many phylogenetically novel soil bacteria.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asoil bacteria 3agrassland soils 3aribosomal RNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3acell culture 3aculture media 3aagar 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBacteriological Techniques 2aCulture Media 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysis 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil Microbiology 0amolecular sequence data 0apreviously unculturable bacteria1 aHugenholtz, P.1 aSangwan, P.1 aOsborne, C.A.1 aJanssen, P.H.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2003 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.7210-7215x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.12.7210-7215.20033Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdMWLe2004/12/23  aOther US 7aarticle02831naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174072001700192100001300209245016100222300001800383506007600401520103000477506003701507650003801544650002501582650001901607650002301626650001001649650001801659650002101677650001001698650001201708650002501720650004201745650002401787650004101811650001001852650002601862650002201888653001401910700001601924700001201940700001401952700001501966700001301981773009901994852000902093856009202102930003302194945002502227946001302252655001202265IND4364481820221207090644.0040916e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436448182DNAL7 a146603722pmid7 aPMC3098762pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.69.12.7242-7247.20032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Schmidt et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:3855-3861, 1999) and H-19B::Tn10d-bla (D. W. Acheson et al., Infect. Immun. 66:4496-4498, 1998) to lysogenize enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains in vivo. We were able to transduce the porcine EPEC strain 1390 (O45) with phi3538 (deltastx2::cat) in porcine ligated ileal loops but not the human EPEC prototype strain E2348/69 (O127). Neither strain 1390 nor strain E2348/69 was lysogenized under these in vivo conditions when E. coli K-12 containing H-19B::Tn10d-bla was used as the stxl phage donor. The repeated success in the in vivo transduction of an Stx2-encoding phage to a porcine EPEC strain in pig loops was in contrast to failures in the in vitro trials with these and other EPEC strains. These results indicate that in vivo conditions are more effective for transduction of Stx2-encoding phages than in vitro conditions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3agenetic transduction 3abacteriophages 3aShiga-like toxin 2 3aswine 3aorgan culture 3astructural genes 3aileum 2aAnimals 2aColiphagesxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxvirology. 2aIleumxmicrobiology 2aShiga Toxin 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSwine 2aTransduction, Genetic 2aVirus Integration 0astx2 gene1 aSchmidt, H.1 aDow, M.1 aMalik, A.1 aOswald, D.1 aNagy, B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2003 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.7242-7247x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.12.7242-7247.20033Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdMWLe2004/12/27  aOther US 7aarticle02405naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169100002300186245011800209300001300327500001500340520098700355650002101342650001801363650002601381650002101407650001601428650001201444650001601456650002301472653002601495653002501521653001801546653002401564653001401588700002101602773012901623852000901752856009201761930003301853945002501886946001301911990002301924655001201947IND4379675420221122160358.0060416e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437967542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4506.2006.00015.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Current legislation, through the Truth-in-Menu Law, protects consumers from misleading advertisements, but does not mandate that restaurant establishments provide nutritional information. This qualitative study aims to assess how much consumers really know about menu labeling legislation and what information they consider to be most important on restaurant menus. This study found that consumers feel consistency between item description and actual presentation, accuracy of claims, disclosure of ingredients, nutritional information, value and the availability of competent servers to explain any ambiguities were most important. The article concludes with recommendations on where legislation should go and what restaurants can do to provide menus that meet customer expectations. 3anutrient content 3amenu planning 3anutrition information 3arestaurant foods 3arestaurants 3aobesity 3aingredients 3anutrition labeling 0adiet-related diseases 0alaws and regulations 0amenu labeling 0afood content labels 0aconsumers1 aMills, Juline E.0 tFoodservice research international.g2006 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.6-22dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1524-82757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4506.2006.00015.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070821b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/08/21  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02678naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009400129300001600223500012200239500001500361520137500376650002601751650001501777650002201792650001501814650001801829650002101847650001201868650001401880650002201894650002001916650002101936650002301957653003101980653002302011653002202034653001902056653002302075773006602098852000902164930003302173945001302206946001302219655001202232IND2041969720221122070215.0940913e199404  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204196972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSterling, T.M.10aMechanisms of herbicide absorption across plant membranes and accumulation in plant cells  ap. 263-276.  aPaper presented at the "Symposium on Interactions of Herbicides with Membranes", February 10, 1993, Denver, Colorado.  a2019-12-05  aIn most cases, a herbicide must traverse the cell wall, the plasma membrane, and organellar membranes of a plant cell to reach its site of action where accumulation causes phytotoxicity. The physicochemical characteristics of the herbicide molecule including lipophilicity and acidity, the plant cell membranes, and the electrochemical potential in the plant cell control herbicide absorption and accumulation. Most herbicides move across plant membranes via nonfacilitated diffusion because the membrane's lipid bilayer is permeable to neutral, lipophilic xenobiotics. Passive absorption of lipophilic, ionic herbicides or weak acids can be mediated by an ion-trapping mechanism where the less lipophilic, anionic form accumulates in alkaline compartments of the plant cell. A model that includes the pH and electrical gradients across plant cell membranes better predicts accumulation concentrations in plant cells of weak acid herbicides compared to a model that uses pH only. Herbicides also may accumulate in plant cells by conversion to nonphytotoxic metabolites, binding to cellular constituents, or partitioning into lipids. Evidence exists for herbicide transport across cell membranes via carrier-mediated processes where herbicide accumulation is energy dependent; absorption is saturable and slowed by metabolic inhibitors and compounds of similar structure. 3amembrane permeability 3aabsorption 3aenergy metabolism 3aherbicides 3aion transport 3aactive transport 3asolutes 3adiffusion 3auptake mechanisms 3aplasma membrane 3aplant physiology 3amembrane potential 0acarrier-mediated transport 0aliterature reviews 0apassive diffusion 0acell membranes 0apassive absorption0 tWeed science.g1994 , v. 42, no. 2 p.263-276x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle03554naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001500193245008900208300001600297520157700313650002501890650001201915650002001927650005301947650001102000650003002011650005102041650005402092650000902146650002302155650002702178650004302205650002702248650001402275650004802289650004002337650002602377650005302403653002802456653002702484653001902511653002202530653001902552700001702571700001702588700002002605700001902625700002002644700001802664773012302682852000902805856009202814930003302906946001302939655001202952IND4426450620221122061744.0090925e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442645062DNAL7 a196822042pmid7 aPMC27734442pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06335.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Dehua10aDocosahexaenoic acid promotes hippocampal neuronal development and synaptic function  ap. 510-521.  aDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), the major polyunsaturated fatty acid accumulated in the brain during development, has been implicated in learning and memory, but underlying cellular mechanisms are not clearly understood. Here, we demonstrate that DHA significantly affects hippocampal neuronal development and synaptic function in developing hippocampi. In embryonic neuronal cultures, DHA supplementation uniquely promoted neurite growth, synapsin puncta formation and synaptic protein expression, particularly synapsins and glutamate receptors. In DHA-supplemented neurons, spontaneous synaptic activity was significantly increased, mostly because of enhanced glutamatergic synaptic activity. Conversely, hippocampal neurons from DHA-depleted fetuses showed inhibited neurite growth and synaptogenesis. Furthermore, n-3 fatty acid deprivation during development resulted in marked decreases of synapsins and glutamate receptor subunits in the hippocampi of 18-day-old pups with concomitant impairment of long-term potentiation, a cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory. While levels of synapsins and NMDA receptor subunit NR2A were decreased in most hippocampal regions, NR2A expression was particularly reduced in CA3, suggesting possible role of DHA in CA3-NMDA receptor-dependent learning and memory processes. The DHA-induced neurite growth, synaptogenesis, synapsin, and glutamate receptor expression, and glutamatergic synaptic function may represent important cellular aspects supporting the hippocampus-related cognitive function improved by DHA. 3adocosahexaenoic acid 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aGlutamic Acidxmetabolism 2aHippocampusxcytologyxembryologyxphysiology. 2aLong-Term Potentiationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNeuritesxdrug effects 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPregnancy 2aReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartatexmetabolism 2aSynapsesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSynapsinsxmetabolism 2aSynaptic Transmissionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0ahippocampal development 0along-term potentiation 0aneurite growth 0asynaptic function 0asynaptogenesis1 aKevala, Karl1 aKim, Jeffrey1 aMoon, Hyun-Seuk1 aJun, Sang Beom1 aLovinger, David1 aKim, Hee-Yong0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Oct., v. 111, no. 2 p.510-521dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06335.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01843naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008000130300001600210520093300226650001601159650002601175650002301201650001501224650001801239650001101257650002801268651001301296653001701309653001601326700001701342773006601359852000901425930003301434945001301467946001301480655001201493IND2047918420221122062504.0950925e199410  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204791842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlingaman, T.E.10aPalmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) interference in soybeans (Glycine max)  ap. 523-527.  aA 2-yr field study was conducted at Fayetteville, AR, to determine the effect of Palmer amaranth interference on soybean growth and yield.

An impermeant sulfhydryl binding agent was reported to block the diclofop acid-induced depolarization of the membrane potential (Em) in rigid ryegrass. A correlation between the antagonistic interaction with auxin herbicides both in the field and in the Em response, and the repolarization of Em in herbicide-resistant rigid ryegrass following removal of diclofop acid also provide support for this hypothesis. However, similar membrane responses in resistant grasses and broadleaf species suggest that the membrane response may not be important in the phytotoxic activity of the postemergence graminicides under field conditions. In addition, an antagonistic interaction was not observed in roots of susceptible grasses exposed to combinations of diclofop-methyl and 2,4-D. Furthermore, the repolarization of the Em in diclofop-resistant rigid ryegrass was correlated to differential acidification of the external solution and an increase in the protonated form of diclofop acid, rather than a site-specific interaction at the plasmalemma. Although the membrane response is probably not involved in herbicide phytotoxicity in agricultural systems, a higher extracellular pH in the resistant biotypes of rigid ryegrass may inhibit the movement of these weak-acid herbicides across the plasmalemma, and possibly contribute to increased herbicide tolerance. 3amechanism of action 3acyclohexene oxime herbicides 3amembrane permeability 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3ametabolic detoxification 3aenzyme inhibitors 3auptake mechanisms 3aherbicide resistance 3aplasma membrane 3aenzyme activity 3amembrane potential 0aantagonism 0aaryloxyphenoxypropionic herbicides 0aresistance mechanisms 0acell membranes 0apolarization0 tWeed science.g1994 , v. 42, no. 2 p.302-309x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02370naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008900125300001600214500012200230500001500352520118700367650001801554650001401572650002901586650001801615650001301633650002201646650002501668650002001693650002001713650001101733650001701744653002601761653001901787700002001806773006601826852000901892930003301901945001301934946001301947655001201960IND2041970020221122043158.0940913e199404  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204197002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, J.J.10aSequestration and oxygen radical detoxification as mechanisms of paraquat resistance  ap. 277-284.  aPaper presented at the "Symposium on Interactions of Herbicides with Membranes", February 10, 1993, Denver, Colorado.  a2019-12-05  aEvidence in the literature has generally supported either of two paraquat resistance mechanisms: an increase in activity of oxygen radical-scavenging enzymes in resistant plants which affords protection from active oxygen species formed by paraquat; and sequestration of paraquat away from its site of action in the chloroplast Evidence for the first model relies primarily on measurement of increased enzyme activity and cross-resistance to other oxygen radical-generating stresses in resistant plants. The sequestration model is supported by data showing decreased translocation of paraquat and absence of paraquat injury in plant systems that do not have increased levels of protective enzymes. An alteration in paraquat transport at one of several plant cell membranes could confer resistance by modifying movement of paraquat into the compartment bounded by that membrane. Properties of the plasmalemma, chloroplast envelope, and tonoplast that may be important to paraquat transport are discussed and data supporting or discounting specific membrane alterations in resistant plants are presented. Finally, the possibility that both mechanisms may work in concert is addressed. 3afree radicals 3atonoplast 3ametabolic detoxification 3aion transport 3aparaquat 3auptake mechanisms 3aherbicide resistance 3aplasma membrane 3aenzyme activity 3aoxygen 3achloroplasts 0aresistance mechanisms 0acell membranes1 aDi Tomaso, J.M.0 tWeed science.g1994 , v. 42, no. 2 p.277-284x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02390naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008800126300001600214500001500230520140700245650002101652650001601673650001801689650001301707650002701720650002401747650002201771650001001793650001901803650002301822653001801845653001901863773006601882852000901948930003301957945001301990946001302003655001202016IND2041967120221122001151.0940913e199404  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204196712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoley, M.E.10aTemperature and water status of seed affect afterripening in wild oat (Avena fatua)  ap. 200-201.  a2019-12-05  aDormant wild oat seed require afterripening under warm-dry conditions for conversion to a nondormant state capable of germination. Research was conducted to determine the relationship between temperature and seed moisture levels on afterripening of dormant wild oat line M73 seed, and to evaluate the status of water binding in the dormant seed. Conversion of dormant wild oat seed to a nondormant state at 20 to 40 C occurs primarily in the range of 5 to 20% seed moisture. There is an inverse relationship between temperature and seed moisture content for afterripening as measured by seed germination. As the afterripening temperature increases, the seed moisture content must decrease for maximum afterripening (germination) to occur. Moisture isotherms and derived enthalpy curves indicate three regions of water binding which reflect decreased binding of water to seed components as the moisture content in the dormant seed increases. Maximum afterripening, in the second region of water binding, corresponds to seed moisture contents of 7 to 22%. In this region water is weakly associated with macromolecular surfaces and begins to have solvent properties. Because afterripening occurs mainly in the second region of water binding it is likely that individual enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions, rather than metabolic processes, mediate the conversion of wild oat seed to the nondormant state. 3aseed germination 3aAvena fatua 3aseed dormancy 3aenthalpy 3awater binding capacity 3aambient temperature 3adormancy breaking 3aweeds 3aafter-ripening 3asorption isotherms 0aseed moisture 0athermodynamics0 tWeed science.g1994 , v. 42, no. 2 p.200-201x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle04486naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174072001700192072001700209100001600226245016700242300001800409500001500427506007600442520182300518506003702341650003002378650004002408650001802448650001702466650003202483650002002515650002102535650003002556650001602586650001402602650002302616650003302639650001402672650002002686650001702706650001102723650002302734650003402757650004002791650003202831650003502863650002902898650003902927650005502966650003303021650004603054650003003100650005503130650001903185650001303204650003803217653001103255653002603266653002203292653001803314700001603332700001403348700001703362700001703379700001303396773009903409852000903508856009203517930003303609945002503642946001303667655001203680IND4364483320221207085903.0040916e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436448332DNAL7 a146603842pmid7 aPMC3099982pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.69.12.7343-7353.20032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study presents conclusive evidence for the induction of a systemic response against angular leaf spot of cucumber (Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans) following application of T. asperellum to the root system. To ascertain that T. asperellum was the only microorganism present in the root milieu, plants were grown in an aseptic hydroponic growth system. Disease symptoms were reduced by as much as 80%, corresponding to a reduction of 2 orders of magnitude in bacterial cell densities in leaves of plants pretreated with T. asperellum. As revealed by electron microscopy, bacterial cell proliferation in these plants was halted. The protection afforded by the biocontrol agent was associated with the accumulation of mRNA of two defense genes: the phenylpropanoid pathway gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and the lipoxygenase pathway gene encoding hydroxyperoxide lyase (HPL). This was further supported by the accumulation of secondary metabolites of a phenolic nature that showed an increase of up to sixfold in inhibition capacity of bacterial growth in vitro. The bulk of the antimicrobial activity was found in the acid-hydrolyzed extract containing the phenolics in their aglycone form. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of phenolic compounds showed a marked change in their profile in the challenged, preelicited plants relative to that in challenged controls. The results suggest that similar to beneficial rhizobacteria, T. asperellum may activate separate metabolic pathways in cucumber that are involved in plant signaling and biosynthesis, eventually leading to the systemic accumulation of phytoalexins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans 3amessenger RNA 3abiosynthesis 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aCucumis sativus 3astructural genes 3abiological control agents 3aTrichoderma 3acucumbers 3aphenolic compounds 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aleaf spot 3agene expression 3aphytoalexins 3aleaves 3abiological control 2aCucumis sativusxmicrobiology 2aHydro-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPhenolsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPhenylalanine Ammonia-Lyasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Extractsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonas syringaexdrug effectsxpathogenicity. 2aSesquiterpenes 2aTerpenes 2aTrichodermaxgrowth & development 0alyases 0ahydroxyperoxide lyase 0aangular leaf spot 0aleaf spotting1 aShoresh, M.1 aKerem, Z.1 aBenhamou, N.1 aKapulnik, Y.1 aChet, I.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2003 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.7343-7353x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.12.7343-7353.20033Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdMWLe2004/12/27  aOther US 7aarticle01917naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245011400172300001600286500002400302520085800326650002101184650002301205650001101228650001501239650001101254650001401265650003101279650001001310650002301320650002901343773014101372852000901513856005701522655001201579IND4456061420221121214225.0110408e197006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445606142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1970.tb00094.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLANGLEY, P.A.10aPost-teneral development of thoracic flight musculature in the tsetse-flies glossina austen1 and g. morsitans  ap. 133-140.  aIncludes references  aMale Glossina austeni Newstead and Glossina morsitans Westwood were found to develop their flight musculature irregularly and incompletely during the first week of adult life under laboratory conditions. However, after 20 days, following the ingestion of their tenth blood meal, thoracic muscle development was found to compare favourably with that of non-teneral flies caught in the field. It is concluded that the rate rather than the extent of muscle development is affected by laboratory maintenance conditions. Thus the failure of 7 days-old laboratory held adult tsetse-flies to survive well after release into the field is considered to be due to a behavioural abnormality rather than a physiological deterioration. This is discussed in relation to the current interest in the sterile insect release method as a means of controlling tsetse-flies. 3aGlossina austeni 3aGlossina morsitans 3aadults 3ablood meal 3aflight 3aingestion 3alaboratory experimentation 3amales 3amuscle development 3asterile insect technique0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1970 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.133-140dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1970.tb00094.x 7aarticle02821naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014500185300001600330500002400346520107300370650002001443650002401463650001301487650001201500650001501512650000901527650001101536650001801547650002801565650001201593650001301605650001401618650001601632650001301648650001201661650002801673650002901701650003201730650005801762650002401820650003001844650002301874650006001897650002801957650002201985700001802007700002102025700001802046773009702064852000902161856008502170655001202255IND4407801720221121141707.0080712s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440780172DNAL7 a185287092pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-1032-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGovindarajan, M.10aStudies on effect of Acalypha indica L.

Herbicides were applied at rates corresponding to 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 times the typical use rate (x rate) of each herbicide. Simulated drift treatments were applied at potato emergence, tuber initiation, or tuber bulking. Foliar injury symptoms varied with herbicide, rate, and potato growth stage at the time of application, but were generally most severe with imazapyr and least severe with imazamethabenz. Yield losses also varied with herbicide, rate, and potato growth stage at the time of application, but generally were greater when drift occurred at tuber initiation or tuber bulking than at potato emergence. Losses in U.S. Number 1 (highest quality) yield were greater than losses in total yield, indicating that tuber quality was affected more by the herbicides than was tuber biomass accumulation. U.S. Number 1 yield was not reduced by simulated drift of imazamethabenz at 0.02x but was reduced 25% by the 0.1x rate applied at tuber bulking. At the 0.5x rate, U.S. Number 1 yield was reduced 36, 85, or 92 % when drift occurred at potato emergence, tuber initiation, or tuber bulking, respectively. For imazethapyr, U.S. Number 1 yield losses ranged from 0 to 68% for the 0.02x rate; 19 to 98% for the 0.1x rate; and 64 to 100% with the 0.5x rate, depending on potato growth stage at the time of application. Losses were least when drift occurred at potato emergence. Simulated drift of imazapyr at the 0.02x rate applied as potatoes were emerging reduced U.S. Number 1 yield 79%. All other imazapyr treatments caused greater than or equal to 99% loss in U.S. Number 1 yield. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aphytotoxicity 3aimazapyr 3aimazethapyr 3aimazamethabenz 3acrop damage 3aleaves 3acrop yield 3acrop quality 3aabnormal development 3atubers 3aapplication rate 3aIdaho 0asymptoms 0acrop growth stage 0asimulated spray drift1 aGuttieri, M.J.0 tWeed science.g1994 , v. 42, no. 1 p.70-75x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle04172naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009900184300001600283500002400299520188500323650002402208650002002232650001202252650001102264650001302275650001402288650001402302650001202316650001702328650001502345650001702360650001902377650001002396650000902406650001302415650002402428650001602452650001502468650000902483650001102492650001702503650002502520650003202545650001202577650003902589650002102628650002102649650002902670650001102699650003702710650003402747650001902781650003902800650002502839650000902864650001302873650001702886650005002903650007102953650004003024650003703064700001703101700002103118700001703139700002203156700002103178773009703199852000903296856008503305655001203390IND4407800120221121081439.0080712s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440780012DNAL7 a185120772pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-1011-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttallah, A.

To investigate this hypothesis, adverse effects resulting from treatment with Larvin were compared between S. mansoni-exposed and nonexposed outbred albino mice. The effects of concurrent treatment with Larvin on the progress and outcomes of S. mansoni infection were assessed via macroscopic and microscopic examination of liver and spleen, evaluation of several hematological, biochemical and hepatic enzymes parameters, and effect on worm burden. Oral administration of 1/5 and 1/10 LD₅₀ of Larvin to S. mansoni-exposed mice induced (1) hepatomegaly and splenomegaly; (2) prominent lymphocytic aggregation in liver replacing large areas of bridging necrosis; (3) increased serum level of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase-aspartate aminotransferase enzymes; (4) decreased serum level of albumin and total proteins; and (5) decreased RBC, hemoglobin content, leukocyte, and lymphocyte counts. No significant effect on worm burden or oviposition was noted as a result of Larvin treatment compared to controls. All doses used in mice either for infection with S. mansoni cercariae or treatment with Larvin resulted in dose dependent alterations in hepatic functions of the tested mice. These alterations were most profound in mice exposed to S. mansoni and receiving Larvin treatment. The present findings support our hypothesis and show that concurrent S. mansoni infection with exposure to Larvin adversely affect liver functions and seriously alter hematological, biochemical, and hepatic enzymes parameters in outbred albino mice. These findings warrant further investigation and reinforce the need to minimize exposure to insecticide in both natural field settings and the broader environment. 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aadverse effects 3aalanine 3aalbino 3aalbumins 3abilirubin 3acercariae 3aenzymes 3aerythrocytes 3ahemoglobin 3ainsecticides 3alethal dose 50 3aliver 3amice 3anecrosis 3aoral administration 3aoviposition 3apollutants 3arisk 3aspleen 3asplenomegaly 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aBilirubinxblood 2aBlood Cell Count 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHepatomegalyxchemically induced 2aInsecticidesxadverse effects 2aLethal Dose 50 2aLiverxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aLiver Function Tests 2aMice 2aNecrosis 2aPancytopenia 2aSchistosoma mansonixisolation & purification 2aSchistosomiasis mansonixparasitologyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aSpleenxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aSplenomegalyxchemically induced1 aWahba, M.

ANIMALS Twelve 2- to 14-day old healthy Arabian and Arabian-pony cross neonatal foals. PROCEDURES A 1.27-cm strip of cream containing 7.3 mg of diclofenac sodium (n = 6 foals) or an equivalent amount of placebo cream (6 foals) was applied topically to a 5-cm square of shaved skin over the anterolateral aspect of the left tarsometatarsal region every 12 hours for 7 days. Physical examination, CBC, serum biochemistry, urinalysis, gastric endoscopy, and ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys and right dorsal colon were performed before and after cream application. Venous blood samples were collected at predefined intervals following application of the diclofenac cream, and plasma diclofenac concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. RESULTS No foal developed any adverse effects attributed to diclofenac application, and no significant differences in values of evaluated variables were identified between treatment groups. Plasma diclofenac concentrations peaked rapidly following application of the diclofenac cream, reaching a maximum of < 1 ng/mL within 2 hours, and declined rapidly after application ceased. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Topical application of the 1% diclofenac sodium cream to foals as described appeared safe, and low plasma concentrations of diclofenac suggested minimal systemic absorption. Practitioners may consider use of this medication to treat focal areas of pain and inflammation in neonatal foals. 3aurinalysis 3aplacebos 3acream 3amass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3afoals 3ablood sampling 3adiclofenac 3agastroscopy 3aclinical examination 3aultrasonography 3acolon 3ablood serum 3akidneys 3aclinical trials 3apharmacokinetics 3aadverse effects 3atopical application 3apain 3aabsorption 3ainflammation 0adrug therapy1 aSellon, Debra C.1 aHines, Melissa T.1 aSeino, Kathy K.1 aKnych, Health K.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2017 Apr., v. 78, no. 4 p.405-411dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.78.4.405  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003200143245017700175300001600352520157400368650000901942650001701951650001301968700002301981700002302004700002502027773015202052856004402204852000902248655001202257IND60566172620221121061841.0170404e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056617262DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.78.4.4122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEcheverry-Bonilla, Diego F.10aAssessment of the potential efficacy of blind perineural injection techniques for blockade of the saphenous, obturator, and lateral cutaneous femoral nerves in dog cadavers  ap. 412-420.  aOBJECTIVE To evaluate the potential efficacy of blind perineural injection techniques to provide nerve blockade of the saphenous, obturator, and lateral cutaneous femoral nerves by assessing the distribution along those nerves of 3 volumes of an injected staining solution in dog cadavers.

Following perineural administration of 3 volumes (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mL/kg) of staining solution near the target nerves in 15 cadavers, the distribution of the staining solution along the nerves was evaluated. Staining that extended ≥ 2 cm along the target nerves was considered to be compatible with an effective clinical nerve block. RESULTS In all cadavers, nerves were appropriately stained by the blind techniques used here. The staining distribution along the nerves was considered to be optimal after perineural injection of 0.2 mL of staining solution/kg in the obturator and lateral cutaneous femoral nerves and 0.3 mL of staining solution/kg in the saphenous nerve. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that the evaluated blind perineural injection techniques may be an inexpensive, safe, and clinically effective method to block the saphenous, obturator, and lateral cutaneous femoral nerves in dogs. 3adogs 3anerve tissue 3astaining1 aPelaez, Jessica T.1 aBuritica, Edwin F.1 aLaredo, Francisco G.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2017 Apr., v. 78, no. 4 p.412-420dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.78.4.412  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245009100133300001600224520096200240650001501202650002101217650002201238650001701260650002301277650002401300650002101324650000901345650002101354650002501375650001901400651001001419653001601429700002301445773006601468852000901534930003301543945001301576946001301589655001201602IND2040061920221121061954.0940606e199310  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204006192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez-Granados, F.10aPopulation dynamics of crenate broomrape (Orobanche crenata) in faba bean (Vicia faba)  ap. 563-567.  aProgression of crenate broomrape population density (PD, number of emerged plants m-2) in faba bean was studied over 8 yr in Spain. Spatial dispersion and effect of climatic conditions on parasite population growth rate (PGR) also were studied. With repeated cropping of faba bean, infestations of crenate broomrape increased from an initial PD of 0.15 to an average of 26, with a maximum of about 40 to 45. The average population growth rate (PGR, ratio between the PD of any 2 consecutive years) was approximately 3. However, this figure varied widely among localities and years, from 0.8 to 7.7. A highly significant relationship (P = 0.01) was found between PGR and rainfall and soil temperatures during December to February, months of crop vegetative growth. Dispersion of crenate broomrape infestations mainly followed direction of crop rows, most likely due to the effect of tillage and harvesting operations, which were the same direction as sowing. 3aVicia faba 3aparasitic plants 3aOrobanche crenata 3aweed biology 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3aclimatic factors 3arain 3asoil temperature 3aspatial distribution 3aseed dispersal 3aSpain 0agrowth rate1 aGarcía-Torres, L.0 tWeed science.g1993 , v. 41, no. 4 p.563-567x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02855naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245019100126300001600317500001500333520161900348650001601967650002401983650001102007650002002018650001402038650002602052650003002078650002602108650001702134650001002151650002202161653002402183653001702207653001602224653002002240653001002260700001702270773006602287852000902353930003302362945001302395946001302408655001202421IND2040059320221121051604.0940606e199310  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204005932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, R.E.10aEffect of interspecific interference, light intensity, and soil moisture on soybean (Glycine max), common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium), and sicklepod (Cassia obtusifolia) water uptake  ap. 534-540.  a2019-12-05  aGreenhouse and growth chamber experiments with potted plants were conducted to determine the effects of interspecific root and canopy interference, light intensity, and soil moisture on water uptake and biomass of soybean, common cocklebur, and sicklepod. Canopy interference and canopy plus root interference of soybean with common cocklebur increased soybean water uptake per plant and per unit leaf area. Root interference with soybean decreased common cocklebur water uptake per plant. Canopy interference of soybean with sicklepod increased soybean water uptake per unit leaf area, while root interference decreased uptake per plant. Combined root and canopy interference with soybean decreased water uptake per plant for sicklepod. Soybean leaf area and shoot weight were reduced by root interference with both weeds. Common cocklebur and sicklepod leaf area and shoot weight were reduced by root and canopy interference with soybeans. Only common cocklebur root weight decreased when canopies interfered and roots did not. The relationship between light intensity and water uptake per unit leaf area was linear in both years with water uptake proportional to light intensity. In 1991 water uptake response to light was greater for common cocklebur than for sicklepod. The relationship between soil moisture level and water uptake was logarithmic. Common cocklebur water uptake was two times that of soybean or sicklepod at -2 kPa of pressure potential. In 1991 common cocklebur water uptake decreased at a greater rate than soybean or sicklepod in response to pressure potential changes from -2 to -100 kPa. 3aGlycine max 3aXanthium strumarium 3acanopy 3alight intensity 3aleaf area 3aplant-water relations 3ainterspecific competition 3acrop-weed competition 3awater uptake 3aroots 3aSenna obtusifolia 0acompetitive ability 0ainteractions 0agrowth rate 0alight relations 0alight1 aWalker, R.H.0 tWeed science.g1993 , v. 41, no. 4 p.534-540x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02933naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245023400124300001600358500001500374520155200389650002401941650001801965650002601983650001602009650001702025650001302042650001602055650001402071650002202085650001902107650001802126650001302144650001102157650001802168653002002186653001602206653001702222653001802239700001702257700001602274700001402290773008102304852000902385930003302394945001302427946001102440655001202451IND2051136520221121051417.0960506e199506  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205113652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatoh, K.10aMechanism of electron flow through the Q(B) site in photosystem II. 1.

Affinities of BQs for both the Q(B) and the PQ site and the maximum turnover rates at the two sites were estimated by computer simulation of the dependence on the concentration of the BQ of the rate of oxygen evolution. Affinities of BQs for the Q(B) sites determined by this method agreed well with those determined from competition between BQs and DCMU for the Q(B) site. All methyl-substituted BQs had low affinities for the Q(B) site, and tetramethyl-p-benzoquinone had almost no affinity. An increase in the number of chlorine atoms in the quinone ring increased the affinity, and the position of such substitutions had a great effect on the affinity when two positions on the ring were occupied by two chlorine atoms or methyl groups. The affinities of BQs for the PQ site were almost the same for all BQs tested in this experiment but the maximum turnover rates at this site varied greatly from one derivative to another. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the binding of the PQ molecule to the Q(B) site is attributable not to its quinone ring but to its isoprenoid chain and, moreover, that the electron transfer through the Q(B) site occurs not by replacement of the PQ molecule but by donation of electrons to another PQ molecule. 3amathematical models 3adose response 3aquantitative analysis 3amethylation 3agas exchange 3achlorine 3aisoprenoids 3aequations 3aelectron transfer 3aphotosystem II 3abinding sites 3akinetics 3aoxygen 3aSynechococcus 0aredox reactions 0aderivatives 0abenzoquinone 0amethyl groups1 aOh-hashi, M.1 aKashino, Y.1 aKoike, H.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1995 June, v. 36, no. 4 p.597-605x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02564naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010300130300001600233500001500249520137300264650001701637650001401654650001401668650002401682650002801706650001101734650002201745650001401767650002601781650002401807650001601831650001901847650002201866651001201888653002201900653001601922653002601938653002001964773006601984852000902050930003302059945001302092946001302105655001202118IND2040062920221121041150.0940606e199310  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204006292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatterson, D.T.10aEffects of temperature and photoperiod on growth and development of sicklepod (Cassia obtusifolia)  ap. 574-582.  a2019-12-05  aSicklepod was grown in controlled-environment chambers in 16 day/night temperature regimes ranging from 19/11 to 34/26 C. Maximum dry weight, leaf area, plant height, node number, and leaf number after 46 d occurred at 29/26 and 34/26 C. Temperatures of 29/21 C or lower reduced dry weight by more than 50%. Leaf number, leaf weight, and leaf area were more sensitive to changes in day temperature, whereas plant height and root, stem, and total dry weight were more sensitive to night temperature. Dry matter production was more closely correlated with leaf area duration than with its other component, net assimilation rate. Leaf appearance rate and dry matter production were linearly related to average daily temperature. The low-temperature threshold for leaf production was 13 +/- 1 C. Observations of plant development in photoperiods ranging from 10 to 16 h confirmed that sicklepod is a short-day plant with a critical day length of 13 to 14 h. No reproductive development occurred in photoperiods of 15 or 16 h. Seedlings that emerged in 10-h photoperiods required more than 1-wk exposure to short days to initiate and continue reproductive development. Plants from a North Carolina population flowered earlier than plants from a Florida population in photoperiods of 12, 13, or 14 h, but in an 11-h photoperiod the two populations flowered at the same time. 3aweed biology 3aflowering 3aphenology 3aambient temperature 3adry matter accumulation 3aheight 3anight temperature 3aleaf area 3anet assimilation rate 3asexual reproduction 3aphotoperiod 3aphotoperiodism 3aSenna obtusifolia 3aAlabama 0aplant development 0agrowth rate 0aplant characteristics 0agrowth analysis0 tWeed science.g1993 , v. 41, no. 4 p.574-582x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02658naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245022900127300001600356500001500372520140100387650002001788650001601808650001301824650001201837650002001849650001801869650002001887650001401907650001601921650002001937650001001957650002801967653002101995700001502016700001802031700001502049700001302064773008102077852000902158930003302167945001302200946001102213655001202224IND2061274420221121004847.0980114e199203  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206127442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Y.10aStimulation of the extrusion of protons and H+-ATPase activities with the decline in pyrophosphatase activity of the tonoplast in intact mung bean roots under high-NaCl stress and its relation to external levels of Ca2+ ions  ap. 139-149.  a2019-12-05  aExtrusion of protons as a response to high-NaCl stress in intact mung bean roots was investigated at different external concentrations of Ca2+ ions ([Ca2+]ex). The extrusion of protons was gradually enhanced in the roots exposed to 100 mM NaCl, and high [Ca2+]ex diminished this enhancement of the extrusion. Vesicles of plasmalemma and tonoplast were prepared from the roots and the H+-translocating ATPase (H+-ATPase) activities associated with the two types of membrane and the H+-pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) activity of the tonoplast were assayed. The plasmalemma ATPase was stimulated in parallel with dramatic increases in the intracellular concentration of Na+([Na+]in). High [Ca2+]ex prevented the increase in [Na+]in and diminished the stimulation of ATPase activity. The tonoplast ATPase showed a rapid response to salt stress and was similarly stimulated even at high [Ca2+]ex. The activities of both ATPases were, however, insensitive to concentrations of Na+ ions up to 100 mM. By contrast, H+-PPase activity of the tonoplast was severely inhibited with increasing [Na+]in under salt stress and recovered with high [Ca2+]ex. These findings suggest that high-NaCl stress increases the intracellular concentration of Na+ ions in mung bean roots, which inhibits the tonoplast H+-PPase, and the activity of the plasmalemma H+-ATPase is thereby stimulated and regulates the cytoplasmic pH. 3aplasma membrane 3aVigna mungo 3asalinity 3acalcium 3astress response 3aion transport 3asodium chloride 3atonoplast 3aproton pump 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 0apyrophosphatases1 aKasamo, K.1 aShimosato, N.1 aSakata, M.1 aOhta, E.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1992 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.139-149x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03456naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245011500191300001600306520171400322650001802036650002502054650001302079650003502092650001102127650000902138650001702147650004002164650002602204650003102230650001902261650002502280650002902305650002002334650001802354650004302372650002802415653002702443653003902470653002202509653002402531653002202555700001902577700001602596700001702612700001802629773011002647852000902757856009202766930003302858946001102891655001202902IND4426468120221120223904.0090925e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442646812DNAL7 a195084262pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03942.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Buck, Sylvie14aThe T-DNA integration pattern in Arabidopsis transformants is highly determined by the transformed target cell  ap. 134-145.  aTransgenic loci obtained after Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation can be simple, but fairly often they contain multiple T-DNA copies integrated into the plant genome. To understand the origin of complex T-DNA loci, floral-dip and root transformation experiments were carried out in Arabidopsis thaliana with mixtures of A. tumefaciens strains, each harboring one or two different T-DNA vectors. Upon floral-dip transformation, 6-30% of the transformants were co-transformed by multiple T-DNAs originating from different bacteria and 20-36% by different T-DNAs from one strain. However, these co-transformation frequencies were too low to explain the presence of on average 4-6 T-DNA copies in these transformants, suggesting that, upon floral-dip transformation, T-DNA replication frequently occurs before or during integration after the transfer of single T-DNA copies. Upon root transformation, the co-transformation frequencies of T-DNAs originating from different bacteria were similar or slightly higher (between 10 and 60%) than those obtained after floral-dip transformation, whereas the co-transformation frequencies of different T-DNAs from one strain were comparable (24-31%). Root transformants generally harbor only one to three T-DNA copies, and thus co-transformation of different T-DNAs can explain the T-DNA copy number in many transformants, but T-DNA replication is postulated to occur in most multicopy root transformants. In conclusion, the comparable co-transformation frequencies and differences in complexity of the T-DNA loci after floral-dip and root transformations indicate that the T-DNA copy number is highly determined by the transformation-competent target cells. 3aAgrobacterium 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abacteria 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenome 3aloci 3atransfer DNA 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgenetics 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aDNA Copy Number Variations 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGenome, Plant 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aArabidopsis floral dip 0acomplex and single-copy T-DNA loci 0aco-transformation 0aroot transformation 0aT-DNA integration1 aPodevin, Nancy1 aNolf, Jonah1 aJacobs, Anni1 aDepicker, Ann0 tPlant journal.g2009 Oct., v. 60, no. 1 p.134-145dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03942.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03713naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009000183300001600273500002400289520159000313650001501903650001701918650001901935650001701954650001701971650002301988650004302011650000902054650002002063650001302083650002002096650002502116650002802141650003302169650001202202650009302214650001802307650002602325650004102351650003702392650004202429650004302471650000902514650000902523650002402532650003202556650002402588650002202612650001502634700003002649700003402679700003502713700002602748700003202774700002502806700002902831773009702860852000902957856008502966655001203051IND4407799020221120224112.0080712s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440779902DNAL7 a184911392pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-0970-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPontin, Karina10aIn vitro and in vivo antileishmanial activities of a Brazilian green propolis extract  ap. 487-492.  aIncludes references  aThe in vitro antileishmanial activity of Brazilian green propolis hydroalcoholic extract (BPE) were carried out on Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis against both promastigote (doses ranging from 1 to 750 μg mL⁻¹) and amastigote (10, 100, and 250 μg mL⁻¹) assays in comparison with the positive (amphotericin B) and negative (dimethyl sulfoxide at 1% in physiologic solution) control groups. BPE displayed in vitro antileishmanial activities against promastigote forms of the parasite (p < 0.05). However, it was inactive against its amastigote ones. In the in vitro cytotoxicity assay against Vero cells, BPE showed no cytotoxicity in the maximum doses tested. The high-performance liquid chromatography analysis allowed the identification of caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, aromadendrine-4'-methyl-ether, 3-prenyl-p-coumaric acid (drupanin), and 3,5-diprenil-p-cumárico acid (artepillin C) as major compounds of BPE. In the in vivo assay, using a Balb/C lineage of Mus musculus male mice, groups of ten animals each were treated (1.5 mg kg day⁻¹) with BPE orally (group 1), BPE topically (group 2), BPE orally and topically (group 3), and glucantime (group 4), using NaCl 0.9% (group 5) as the negative control group. Groups 1, 2, and 3 displayed a decrease on lesion development, after 90 days of treatment, by 78.6%, 84.3%, and 90.0%, respectively, while the glucantime-treated group showed 57.7% of decrease, all in comparison with the negative control group. It is the first time that the in vivo antileishmanial activity has been reported for Brazilian green propolis. 3aLeishmania 3aMus musculus 3aamphotericin B 3acaffeic acid 3acytotoxicity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amice 3ap-coumaric acid 3apropolis 3asodium chloride 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdministration, Topical 2aAmphotericin Bxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aCell Survival 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDimethyl Sulfoxidexpharmacology 2aLeishmania braziliensisxdrug effects 2aLeishmaniasis, Cutaneousxdrug therapy 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aParasitic Sensitivity Tests 2aPropolisxchemistry 2aTreatment Outcome 2aVero Cells1 aDa Silva Filho, Ademar A.1 aSantos, Fransérgio Francisco1 aSilva, Márcio Luís Andrade e1 aCunha, Wilson Roberto1 aNanayakkara, N.

  1 aAngelidis, A.S.10aRole of the glycine betaine and carnitine transporters in adaptation of Listeria monocytogenes to chill stress in defined medium  ap. 7492-7498.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes proliferates at refrigeration temperatures, rendering refrigeration ineffective in the preservation of Listeria-contaminated foods. The uptake and intracellular accumulation of the potent compatible solutes glycine betaine and carnitine has been shown to be a key mediator of the pathogen's cold-tolerant phenotype. To date, three compatible solute systems are known to operate in L. monocytogenes: glycine betaine porter I (BetL), glycine betaine porter II (Gbu), and the carnitine transporter OpuC. We investigated the specificity of each transporter towards each compatible solute at 4 degrees C by examining mutant derivatives of L. monocytogenes 10403S that possess each of the transporters in isolation. Kinetic and steady-state compatible solute accumulation data together with growth rate experiments demonstrated that under cold stress glycine betaine transport is primarily mediated by Gbu and that Gbu-mediated betaine uptake results in significant growth stimulation of chill-stressed cells. BetL and OpuC can serve as minor porters for the uptake of betaine, and their action is capable of providing a small degree of cryotolerance. Under cold stress, carnitine transport occurs primarily through OpuC and results in a high level of cryoprotection. Weak carnitine transport occurs via Gbu and BetL, conferring correspondingly weak cryoprotection. No other transporter in L. monocytogenes 10403S appears to be involved in transport of either compatible solute at 4 degrees C, since a triple mutant strain yielded neither transport nor accumulation of glycine betaine or carnitine and could not be rescued by either osmolyte when grown at that temperature.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria monocytogenes 3atransporters 3acarnitine 3abetaine 3acytosol 3aactive transport 3acold stress 3acooling 3amicrobial growth 3acold tolerance 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBetainexmetabolism 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCold Temperature 2aCulture Media 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aListeria monocytogenesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMutation 2aOrganic Cation Transport Proteins1 aSmith, G.M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2003 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.7492-7498x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.12.7492-7498.20033Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdMWLe2004/12/27  aOther US 7aarticle03352naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245017500182300001600357500002400373520108200397650002601479650002101505650001701526650001701543650002001560650001001580650001401590650001501604650000701619650001301626650003901639650000901678650002501687650002701712650001301739650001201752650001201764650004501776650002201821650002301843650003301866650004001899650002001939650003101959650004001990650001302030650002102043650003602064650003802100650000902138650001702147650008802164650006002252700001402312700001502326700001902341700001402360700002002374700001302394700001202407700002002419773009702439852000902536856008502545655001202630IND4407799320221120213513.0080712s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440779932DNAL7 a184967152pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-0997-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qinggui10aExpression and characterization of two pesticide resistance-associated serine protease genes (NYD-tr and NYD-ch) from Culex pipiens pallens for metabolism of deltamethrin  ap. 507-516.  aIncludes references  aTwo deltamethrin resistance-associated serine protease genes (NYD-tr and NYD-ch) were isolated from Culex pipiens pallens in our previous study. To study the function of NYD-Tr and NYD-Ch in the metabolism of deltamethrin, we constructed the recombinant plasmid pET32a(+)/NYD-tr and pET32a(+)/NYD-ch with a 6x histidine tag. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses of the recombinant proteins revealed that the molecular weights of NYD-Tr and NYD-Ch are 42 and 50 kDa. Enzyme activity assay indicated that the recombinant NYD-Tr and NYD-Ch had the corresponding features of trypsin and chymotrypsin. Using BApNA as the substrate, NYD-Tr gave optimal activity between pH 9.0 and 10.5, while NYD-Ch was optimally active over the range of pH 8.0-11.0 using the S(Ala)₂ProPhe-pNA as the substrate. Then, we investigated the metabolism of deltamethrin by NYD-Tr and NYD-Ch. Our results showed that NYD-Tr and NYD-Ch could hydrolyze deltamethrin. The acute oral toxicity of the metabolite to Wistar rats was much lower than deltamethrin. 3aCulex pipiens pallens 3aWestern blotting 3achymotrypsin 3adeltamethrin 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahistidine 3ametabolism 3apH 3aplasmids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arats 3arecombinant proteins 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atoxicity 3atrypsin 2aAnimals 2aBenzoylarginine Nitroanilidexmetabolism 2aBlotting, Western 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCulexxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGene Expression 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInsecticidesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Weight 2aNitrilesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aPyrethrinsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aZhou, Dan1 aSun, Lixin1 aZhang, Donghui1 aQian, Jin1 aXiong, Chunrong1 aSun, Yan1 aMa, Lei1 aZhu, Changliang0 tParasitology research.g2008 Aug., v. 103, no. 3 p.507-516dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-0997-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02717naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174072001700192100002300209245009100232300001800323506007600341520101400417506003701431650002701468650001201495650002101507650001301528650002001541650001501561650001601576650001601592650002001608650002201628650003001650650001801680650002701698650002401725650002001749650003101769650004901800650002101849700001801870700001601888773009901904852000902003856009202012930003302104945002502137946001302162655001202175IND4364485020221207094555.0040916e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436448502DNAL7 a146604052pmid7 aPMC3099122pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.69.12.7514-7516.20032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Exposure to a mildly acidic (pH 5.0 to 6.0) environment provided protection of the pathogen against acid upon subsequent exposure. This adaptive response, however, was found to be strongly dependent on other environmental conditions during the shock, such as temperature or the simultaneous presence of a second stress factor (NaCl). Growth of L. monocytogenes in the presence of glucose resulted in enhanced survival of the pathogen at pH 3.5. Sublethal stresses other than acidic stresses, i.e., osmotic, heat, and low-temperature stresses, did not affect the acid resistance of L. monocytogenes (P > 0.5). More-severe levels of these stresses, however, resulted in sensitization of the pathogen to acid.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aacidity 3astress tolerance 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3aosmolarity 3acold stress 3aheat stress 3afood processing 3afood microbiology 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aCulture Media 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aOsmotic Pressure1 aKendall, P.A.1 aSofos, J.N.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2003 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.7514-7516x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.12.7514-7516.20033Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdMWLe2004/12/27  aOther US 7aarticle03823naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245011000190300001400300520148400314650001601798650001801814650001701832650001701849650002001866650001301886650002101899650001101920650002201931650001201953650001301965650002101978650001301999650001902012650001602031650001402047650002202061650002102083650001702104650001102121650003002132650003102162650006102193650004802254650002302302650002302325650002902348650003802377650003302415650001602448650005402464650002902518650001302547650002102560650002502581650004302606650002702649653001402676653000802690653002902698700001602727700001902743700001902762700001902781773010802800852000902908856009202917930003303009946001103042655001203053IND4426469120221120213430.0090925e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442646912DNAL7 a195003002pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03931.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaofeng10aElongator mediates ABA responses, oxidative stress resistance and anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis  ap. 79-90.  aElongator is a histone acetyl-transferase complex consisting of six subunits, and is highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms. Here, we isolated two novel mutants, elp2 and elp6, during a genetic screening for ABA-hypersensitive Arabidopsis mutants. Map-based cloning identified ELP2 and ELP6, which encode the orthologs of the yeast Elongator subunits, ELP2 and ELP6, respectively. Another Elongator subunit mutant, elp4/elo1, was obtained from the SALK T-DNA collection. The elp1/abo1/elo2 mutant was isolated in a previous study. All four of the Elongator mutants had narrow leaves, reduced root growth, ABA hypersensitivity and an increased accumulation of anthocyanins. Mutations in the core subcomplex subunits ELP1/ABO1 and ELP2, but not in the accessory subcomplex subunits ELP4/ELO1 and ELP6, caused stomatal closing to be supersensitive to ABA. In addition, the four mutants were all more resistant than the wild type to oxidative stress produced by methyl viologen, and to CsCl. Gene expression analysis indicated that the four mutants had increased transcript levels of CAT3 under normal conditions, increased transcript levels of ZAT10 when treated with ABA and reduced transcript levels of MYBL2, which encodes a single-repeat MYB protein, acting as a negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our results suggest that Elongator plays crucial roles in regulating plant responses to ABA, oxidative stress resistance and anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3ahistones 3ahypersensitivity 3aleaves 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3amutation 3aoxidative stress 3aparaquat 3aplant response 3aroot growth 3ascreening 3astomatal movement 3astress tolerance 3atransfer DNA 3ayeasts 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aAnthocyaninsxbiosynthesis 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGermination 2aHistone Acetyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aMutation 2aOxidative Stress 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aElongator 0aABA 0aanthocyanin biosynthesis1 aHua, Deping1 aChen, Zhizhong1 aZhou, Zhengjun1 aGong, Zhizhong0 tPlant journal.g2009 Oct., v. 60, no. 1 p.79-90dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03931.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01702naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245023100124300001600355520048800371650002200859650001900881650001100900650001700911650001900928650001700947650001300964650001000977650002900987650001801016653003101034700001301065700001901078700001801097700001601115700001401131773008101145852000901226930003301235945001301268946001101281655001201292IND2061533020221120203440.0980127e199204  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206153302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnami, I.10aEvidence from crosslinking for a close association of the extrinsic 33 kDa protein with the 9.4 kDa subunit of cytochrome b 559 and the 4.8 kDa product of the psb I gene in oxygen-evolving photosystem II complexes from spinach  ap. 291-297.  aOxygen-evolving photosystem II complexes from spinach, which lack light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins, were treated with a bifunctional crosslinking reagent, hexamethylene-diisocyanate.

Of the 10 S. vitulinus isolates included in the study, 2 were obtained from the Czech Collection of Microorganisms, 5 from the environment, 2 from human clinical samples, and 1 from an animal source. The results of conventional biochemical and molecular tests were used for the reference method for ID, while antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations and PCR for the mecA gene were the reference for AST. Three isolates were incorrectly identified by the BD Phoenix system; one of these was incorrectly identified to the genus level, and two to the species level. The results of AST by the BD Phoenix system were in agreement with those by the reference method used. While the results of susceptibility testing compared favorably, the 70% accuracy of the Phoenix system for identification of this unusual staphylococcal species was not fully satisfactory. 3aStaphylococcus vitulinus 3aaspartate transaminase 3agenes 3ahumans 3amicroorganisms 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aAutomation 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBacteriological Techniquesxmethods 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aHumans 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Testsxmethods 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aStaphylococcusxclassificationxdrug effectsxisolation & purification.1 aHauschild, Tomasz1 aJežek, Petr1 aDimitrijević, Vladimir.1 aVuković, Dragana1 aStepanović, Srdjan0 tCurrent microbiology.g2008 Aug., v. 57, no. 2 p.158-160dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-008-9169-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01661naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011700124300001600241500001500257520059300272650001600865650001000881650002700891650001800918650001600936650002000952650001000972650001700982650001900999653000901018653002301027653001101050653001501061700001401076700001401090773008101104852000901185930003301194945001301227946001101240655001201251IND2061532620221120182357.0980127e199204  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206153262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatoh, E.10aSynchronization of phosphorylation of a chloroplast protein with the cell division cycle in Heterosigma akashiwo  ap. 275-280.  a2019-12-05  aHeterosigma akashiwo cells cultured under various conditions were incubated with [32P] H3PO4 for 4 h at various phases of photoperiods of 12 h of light and 12 h darkness, and the phosphorylated proteins in each subcellular fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Lipoxazolidinone A possesses good potency (1-2 μg/mL) against drug-resistant pathogens methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). Strain NPS8920 exhibits different morphologies in both agar and submerged cultures. The ability of strain NPS8920 to sporulate on saline-based agar media but not on deionized water-based agar medium supported that strain NPS8920 is a marine actinomycete. While strain NPS8920 does not require seawater for growth, the production of lipoxazolidinones by strain NPS8920 can only be detected in the seawater-based media. The optimal production of lipoxazolidinones was observed in the natural seawater-based medium. Strain NPS8920 produced 10-20% of lipoxazolidinones in the synthetic sea salt Instant Ocean®-based medium and no production in the sodium chloride-based and deionized water-based media. 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagar 3aantibiotics 3apathogens 3aseawater 3asodium 2aActinobacteriaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxmetabolism 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aMolecular Structure 2aOxazolidinonesxmetabolism 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology1 aTeisan, Sy1 aTsueng, Ginger1 aMacherla, Venkat R.1 aLam, Kin S.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.761-765dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-008-0344-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02620naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245005700173300001600230500002400246520141900270650002101689650001801710650001101728650001001739650001901749650001901768650002001787650001701807650001501824651002101839651001101860651001601871700002001887700002001907700002201927700002101949700001901970773010801989852000902097856009202106655001202198IND4407934020221120172810.0080718s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440793402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0908-8857.2008.04295.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheldon, Lani D.10aEffects of blood collection on wild birds: an update  ap. 369-378.  aIncludes references  aBlood sampling is often critical for answering a variety of questions about wild birds. However, it is important to assess the impacts, if any, of blood collection on wild birds. Here, we examined the effects of blood sampling on adults or nestlings in three species of free-living birds. First, we examined the effects of blood collection on annual survival and reproductive success in adult buff-breasted wrens Thryothorus leucotis in Panama. In adult wrens, blood collection from the brachial vein during the breeding season had no effect on annual survival or reproductive success. Second, we examined whether blood collection influenced mass gain in developing smooth-billed anis Crotophaga ani in Puerto Rico. In developing anis, blood collection from the femoral or jugular veins had no effect on mass gain of nestlings. Third, in developing European starlings Sturnus vulgaris in British Columbia, Canada, blood collection from the brachial vein had no effect of body condition. Blood collection from the jugular vein had a transient effect on body condition during the first week post-hatch, but this effect disappeared by the second week of age. Lastly, we present an extensive up-to-date review of the literature on the effects of blood collection on free-living avian species. Taken together, these data show that blood collection has no major negative effects on developing or adult birds in the wild. 3aSturnus vulgaris 3aTroglodytidae 3aadults 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3abody condition 3abreeding season 3ajugular vein 3awild birds 3aBritish Columbia 3aPanama 3aPuerto Rico1 aChin, Eunice H.1 aGill, Sharon A.1 aSchmaltz, Gregory1 aNewman, Amy E.M.1 aSoma, Kiran K.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2008 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.369-378dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0908-8857.2008.04295.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03614naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012900181300001600310500002400326520145400350650002901804650002501833650002201858650003101880650001301911650002801924650001301952650001201965650001101977650001301988650001802001650001402019650001902033650001502052650001002067650001402077650003302091650002002124650004002144650002302184650003502207650002502242650004902267650004902316650002902365650003502394650003102429650002702460650002002487700001802507700001802525700002002543700003202563700002302595700002302618700002202641700001702663700002902680773012502709852000902834856008502843655001202928IND4407809420221120173012.0080712s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440780942DNAL7 a183798322pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-008-0343-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaulio, Mari10aMicrobe repelling coated stainless steel analysed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and physicochemical methods  ap. 751-760.  aIncludes references  aCoating of stainless steel with diamond-like carbon or certain fluoropolymers reduced or almost eliminated adhesion and biofilm growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Deinococcus geothermalis, Meiothermus silvanus and Pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis. These species are known to be pertinent biofilm formers on medical implants or in the wet-end of paper machines. Field emission scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that Staph. epidermidis, D. geothermalis and M. silvanus grew on stainless steel using thread-like organelles for adhesion and biofilm formation. The adhesion threads were fewer in number on fluoropolymer-coated steel than on plain steel and absent when the same strains were grown in liquid culture. Psx. taiwanensis adhered to the same surfaces by a mechanism involving cell ghosts on which the biofilm of live cells grew. Hydrophilic (diamond-like carbon) or hydrophobic (fluoropolymer) coatings reduced the adherence of the four test bacteria on different steels. Selected topographic parameters, including root-mean-square roughness (S q), skewness (S sk) and surface kurtosis (S ku), were analysed by atomic force microscopy. The surfaces that best repelled microbial adhesion of the tested bacteria had higher skewness values than those only slightly repelling. Water contact angle, measured (θ m) or roughness corrected (θ y), affected the tendency for biofilm growth in a different manner for the four test bacteria. 3aDeinococcus geothermalis 3aMeiothermus silvanus 3aPseudoxanthomonas 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3aequipment 3ahydrophobicity 3aorganelles 3apaper 3aroughness 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astainless steel 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aCarbonxpharmacology 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxgrowth & development 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxgrowth & development 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aOrganellesxultrastructure 2aPolymersxpharmacology 2aStainless Steel1 aJarn, Mikael.1 aAhola, Juhana1 aPeltonen, Jouko1 aRosenholm, J.

Southern blot analysis showed that a family of genes for VPEs in Arabidopsis thaliana was composed of three genes, for alpha-VPE, beta-VPE and gamma-VPE, respectively. The gene for gamma-VPE was isolated from a genomic library. It was composed of nine exons and eight introns. The positions of the introns were fully conserved among the three genes, with the exception that the alpha-VPE gene was missing the fifth intron found in the beta-VPE and gamma-VPE genes. The predicted gamma-VPE protein was 80% and 57% identical in terms of amino acid sequence to the alpha-VPE protein and beta-VPE protein, respectively. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the gamma-VPE gene was expressed predominantly in the stems, with a lower level of expression in rosette and cauline leaves. However, the expression was not detected in roots, flowers plus buds, or green siliques, in contrast to the high-level expression of the beta-VPE gene in the flowers plus buds. Thus, gamma-VPE seems to be an isoform that is specific to vegetative organs. Members of the VPE family can be separated into two subfamilies, one that is specific to seeds and another that is specific to vegetative organs, such as leaves and stems. The members of the seed subfamily might function in the protein-storage vacuoles of seeds, while those of the vegetative subfamily might function in the lytic vacuoles of non-storage organs. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenes 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic code 3avacuoles 3aenzymes 3aseed development 3astems 3aleaves 3aroots 3abuds 3aflowers 3aseeds 3aprotein synthesis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aSchistosomaxenzymology 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d61395 0ancbi/d61395 0agsdb/d613951 aNishimura, M.1 aHara-Nishimura, I.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1995 Dec., v. 36, no. 8 p.1555-1562x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02662naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013500125300001800260500001500278520154200293650002401835650002501859650001801884650002201902650001901924650001401943650001101957650001001968650002101978653002701999653002002026653001502046653001102061700001502072700001602087773008302103852000902186930003302195945001302228946001102241655001202252IND2051313120221120121544.0960517e199512  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205131312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokota, E.10aBiochemical, immunochemical and immunohistochemical identification of myosin heavy chains in cultured cells of Catharanthus roseus  ap. 1541-1547.  a2019-12-05  aIn the pollen tubes of the lily Lilium longiflorum, myosin, composed of 170-kDa heavy chains is responsible for the intracellular transport of organelles [Yokota and Shimmen (1994) Protoplasma 177: 153]. Polypeptides of 170 kDa with similar antigenicity to this pollen-tube myosin have also been found in other angiosperm cells [Yokota et al. (1995) Protoplasma 185: 178]. To clarify the role of this type of myosin in cytoplasmic streaming, we prepared partially purified myosin fraction from cultured cells of Catharanthus roseus by co-precipitation with F-actin. In a motility assay in vitro with this fraction, rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled F-actin moved with an average velocity of 10.7 micrometers s-1. This sliding velocity was similar to that of the cytoplasmic streaming observed in intact cultured cells. Antibodies raised against the 170-kDa heavy chain of pollen-tube myosin recognized only a single polypeptide of 170 kDa in this partially purified fraction. The same polypeptide was also identified by these antibodies in a crude extract of proteins from cultured cells. The myosin-specific fluorescence was concentrated around the nuclei and was associated with particles of various sizes. Dual localization using antibodies against myosin and against actin revealed that these particles were preferentially co-localized with actin filaments. On the other hand, no component of the crude extract or of the partially purified myosin fraction cross-reacted with antibodies against heavy chains of myosin II from animal cells. 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aplant anatomy 3achemical analysis 3acultured cells 3acytoplasm 3amyosin 3aactin 3amolecular weight 0aprotoplasmic streaming 0aimmunochemistry 0aregulation 0anuclei1 aMimura, T.1 aShimmen, T.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1995 Dec., v. 36, no. 8 p.1541-1547x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02675naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009600123300001800219520149000237650001701727650001001744650001101754650002801765650000801793650002101801650001401822650001001836650002001846650002401866650002101890650001401911650002301925650002501948650002901973653002302002653001102025653002802036700001602064773008302080852000902163930003302172945001302205946001102218655001202229IND2051324220221120101540.0960520e199512  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205132422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Y.10aInteractions of the glutelin Gt13 5' flanking regulatory regions with rice nuclear proteins  ap. 1657-1667.  aThree DNA binding activities, BP-1, BP-2 and BP-3, which interact with the 5' flanking region of the rice glutelin Gt3 gene, were identified by gel retardation assays of rice seed nuclear extracts. The DNA binding activities were seed-specific as identical DNA-protein complexes were not observed when nuclear extracts from leaf tissue or suspension culture cells were analyzed, suggesting that these DNA binding activities are involved in seed-specific expression of the Gt3 gene. The DNA sequences recognized by these DNA binding activities were identified by DNaseI footprinting and Bal 31 nuclease mapping analyses. BP-1 recognizes DNA sequences located at -272 bp to -259 bp relative to the transcriptional start site. This DNA segment contains a sequence motif that is conserved among several seed protein genes, implicating that the motif may be a common cis-regulatory element determining seed-specific expression of these genes. BP-2 interacts with sequences located between -861 bp to -838 bp while BP-3 interacts with sequences upstream of -788 bp. The temporal levels of BP-2 binding activity parallel the steady state levels of the Gt3 mRNAs during seed development. Overall, these results and those obtained from in vivo promoter analysis in transgenic plants [Zhao et al. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. 25: 429] indicate that multiple regulatory elements located at two spatially separated regions of the Gt3 promoter are involved in endosperm-specific and temporal regulation. 3aOryza sativa 3aseeds 3aleaves 3acell suspension culture 3aDNA 3abinding proteins 3aglutelins 3agenes 3agene expression 3aprotein composition 3aDNA footprinting 3anucleases 3achromosome mapping 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 0agenetic regulation 0anuclei 0amolecular sequence data1 aOkita, T.W.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1995 Dec., v. 36, no. 8 p.1657-1667x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02199naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007800127500014900205500002400354500001500378520103800393650002001431650002601451650001901477650001701496650002001513650001901533650003301552653003301585700002001618700001601638773011201654852000901766856008601775655001201861IND4465087120221123041926.0130304s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446508712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomurath, N.10aLight response curves of selected plants under different light conditions  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Light in Horticultural Systems, held October 14-18, 2012, Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPhotosynthesis rates under HPS light were measured on various plant species.

Light compensation points under light qualities with input of red LEDs were between 13-15 µmol m-2 s-1 in all three model plants. Average photosynthetic rates at 100 and 200 µmol m-2 s-1 PPF red and blue/red LED light were above other calculated values for the other light qualities. The photosynthetic rates under blue/green/red LED light declined considerably less, than the purely energetic consideration would anticipate.

Both factors, in turn, depend mainly on genetic factors such as cultivar, clone, rootstock, and environmental factors such as climate, type of soil, water supply, training system, pruning strategy, etc. The effect of the pruning system was studied over three growing season in a trial set up. Albariño vines pruned to two different systems: Cazenave-Marcon (CM) and Sylvoz (Sy), each with 50000 nodes/ha. The pruning system did not produce statistically significant differences, either in production or in pruned wood, except in 1999. In this year, the Sylvoz system, with a yield 25% higher, has produced twice as much pruned wood as the CM system. Neither did the pruning system cause significant differences in the parameters that define the technological quality of the grape, nor were there statistically significant differences in the concentration of free terpenes and grape terpenes. However, the concentration of bound terpenes was higher in the Sy system than in the CM. These differences in the concentration of bound terpenes are due to the greater concentration of bound linalool found in the grapes produced under the Sylvoz system. 3aclimatic factors 3afruit composition 3agrapes 3agrowing season 3apruning 3arootstocks 3asoil types 3aterpenoids 3avegetative growth 3avigor 3avines 3awater supply 3awood 3ayield components 3aSpain1 aGil, M.L.1 aFernández, E.,1 aPita, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 July, , no. 652 p.147-152dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/652/652_17.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03232naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245011900135500014900254500002400403520181200427650001202239650001302251650001302264650001502277650001502292650001202307650001402319650001602333650003102349650001602380650001202396650001702408650001102425650002002436650001402456650001602470650004002486650001702526651001602543700002002559773011202579852000902691856008602700655001202786IND4465087420221123041855.0130304s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446508742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía Victoria, N.10aSupplementary light and higher Fertigation EC in the cultivation of Bromelia improve quality and accelerate growth  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Light in Horticultural Systems, held October 14-18, 2012, Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aIn order to provide Bromelia growers with lacking information about optimal levels of supplementary light and nutrient EC, two consecutive greenhouse experiments were conducted by Wageningen UR Glasshouse Horticulture in Bleiswijk (The Netherlands). In the first experiment a light intensity gradient (17-155 µmol m-2 s-1 PAR ) was installed in the length direction of two 144 m2 greenhouses. In the width direction four mineral nutrition levels were supplied (EC of 0.6, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 dS m-1) to three plant species: Guzmania, Vriesea and Neoregelia (a CAM Bromelia). Each greenhouse had a different (supplementary) photoperiod: 12 or 16 hours. It was concluded that the optimum intensity of supplementary light was 43 μmol m-2 s-1 PAR for Vriesea, and 80 μmol m-2 s-1 PAR for Guzmania and Neoregelia applied during 12 hours. The corresponding optimum EC of the nutrient solution was 1.5. At higher light levels, longer photoperiod, or the same light levels but nutrition with a lower EC, signs of light damage appeared (chlorotic leaves, reduced plant diameter, red spots on leaves). Neoregelia was tolerant to the 16 hour photoperiod. These optima were validated and compared to a non-lighted control by means of a second experiment with 10 cultivars of 4 different genera grown at a EC of 1.5 dS m-1 under three light levels: 43 μmol m-2 s-1 PAR (applied to all Vriesea and Guzmania 'Hilda'), 80 μmol m-2 s-1 PAR (applied to Aechmea, Tillandsia, Guzmania 'Rana' and Guzmania 'Tempo') and no supplementary light (as reference for all varieties). Compared to the reference, the use of supplementary light enhanced plant growth and ornamental quality and it shortened the time to commercial development stage for most studied cultivars, with the exception of Vriesea 'Miranda' and Vriesea 'Stream'. 3aAechmea 3aBromelia 3aGuzmania 3aNeoregelia 3aTillandsia 3aVriesea 3acultivars 3afertigation 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3agrowers 3ahorticulture 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3anutrition 3aphotoperiod 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplant growth 3aNetherlands1 aWarmenhoven, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 956dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/956/956_34.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02211naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014300124300001600267500001500283520122000298650002601518650001701544650002201561650002001583650001401603650001601617650001701633653000901650653001001659700001801669700001401687773008201701852000901783930003301792945001301825946001101838655001201849IND2051769220221123042103.0960619e199209  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205176922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHideg, E.10aDelayed fluorescence and ultraweak light emission from isolated chloroplasts (comparison of emission spectra and concentration dependence)  ap. 689-693.  a2019-12-05  aThe ultraweak light emission of isolated chloroplasts (Hideg and Inaba (1991) Photochem. Photobiol. 52:137) was investigated in comparison to delayed light emission. We compared the concentration dependence and the spectral distribution of the light emitted from isolated chloroplasts stored in the dark for 10 s, 2 min (delayed light emission), 4 and 10 h (ultraweak light emission), respectively. In samples with low chlorophyll concentration, spectra of all emission phenomena were maximal at 685-695 nm, but spectra of ultraweak light, especially that of long term (10 h) emission, were broader in the 700-800 nm region than spectra of delayed light, indicating emission from a bigger variety of chlorophyll molecules. The intensity of delayed light and short term (4 h) ultraweak light exhibited a simple, saturating exponential dependence on chlorophyll concentration, while long term (10 h) ultraweak light emission was best described as a saturating exponential containing a quadratic function of the concentration. This difference suggests that long term ultraweak light emission is brought about by reactions distinct from the earlier described mechanism of electron transport related dark photo-emission. 3aquantitative analysis 3afluorescence 3aSpinacia oleracea 3alight intensity 3aemissions 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 0adark 0alight1 aKobayashi, M.1 aInaba, H.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1992 Sept., v. 33, no. 6 p.689-693x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02603naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245007700133300001600210500014900226500002400375520143200399650000901831650001501840650001101855650001201866650001101878650001001889650001401899650001701913650001001930650001101940700001401951700001501965700001401980773014001994852000902134856008602143655001202229IND4465086420221123042053.0130304s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446508642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlburquerque, M.V.10aDecrease of yield excess through winter pruning in 'Tempranillo' variety  ap. 125-132.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Grapevine Growing, Commerce and Research, held June 30 - July 2, 2003, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aThe low grape yield has been, and continues to be an argument to uphold the quality of the wine. This is the reason why the old vineyards with low yields are the most appraised by winemakers to elaborate “wine of quality”. It is convenient to know how to manage winter pruning to obtain the best grapes while the vines are in full productivity period. Tempranillo is the most widely grown red variety in Spain and is traditionally spur pruned in winter, with two fruitful buds per spur. The yield obtained is occasionally high and provokes the unbalance of the wine elaborated from this variety. The pruning trial carried out has been based on the nature of the buds (fruitful and basebuds) and focused on obtaining more limited yields. The results have shown that the nature of the buds used in the winter pruning have had a decisive influence on yield, shoot vigor and must quality in Tempranillo variety. The use of shorter elements in winter pruning has provoked around 43% yield decrease when using basal and fruitful buds with respect to those including fruitful or regular buds. The application of a shorter pruning has provoked a possible improvement in must quality through the increase of the probable alcoholic degree correlated to the lower yield. To sum up, a considerable reduction in yield could be obtained with the appropriated management of winter pruning instead of waiting until the “vines are old”. 3abuds 3acrop yield 3agrapes 3apruning 3ashoots 3avines 3avineyards 3awine quality 3awines 3awinter1 aYuste, R.1 aMartin, H.1 aYuste, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 July, , no. 652 p.125-132dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/652/652_14.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02538naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245022200129300001600351500001500367520107000382650002001452650001601472650002601488650001901514650001601533650001001549650001501559650002901574650002001603650001501623650003601638650001901674650002001693650001601713650002501729653001101754653001601765653001501781653002301796653001001819700001901829700001701848700001901865773008201884852000901966930003301975945001302008946001102021655001202032IND2051770120221123003107.0960619e199209  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205177012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJovine, R.V.M.10aQuantification of chromophore pigments, apoprotein abundance and isoelectric variants of peridinin-chlorophyll a-protein complexes (PCPs) in the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa pygmaea grown under variable light conditions  ap. 733-741.  a2019-12-05  aAbsorption properties, pigmentation, total protein, apoprotein content, and isoelectric diversity of Peridinin-Chlorophyll a-Protein complexes (PCPs) and their apoproteins were determined for Heterocapsa pygmaea populations photoadapted to different spectral irradiances. Chromatic adaptation of pigmentation was evident and correlated more with quanta absorbed by the cells (AQ cell(-1)) than with quanta available in the surrounding light field (Qpar). Peridinin and chlorophyll content increased as blue-green and red light dosages declined respectively. Immunological determinations indicated PCP apoprotein abundance increased as AQ cell(-1) decreased, while non-PCP protein content was unchanged. PCP apoproteins could account for up to 30% of total protein and exceed by 10-fold the amount required to bind all peridinin molecules into PCP complexes. Isoelectric variants of PCPs were identified, whose relative abundances were light dependent. Results are discussed in the context of future photoregulation studies of PCP gene expression in dinoflagellates. 3asolar radiation 3aapoproteins 3aquantitative analysis 3aplant pigments 3awhite light 3aalgae 3aabsorption 3alight harvesting complex 3alight intensity 3ablue light 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein content 3achlorophyll 3aisoelectric focusing 0agrowth 0agreen light 0aadaptation 0aalgae and seaweeds 0alight1 aTriplett, E.L.1 aNelson, N.B.1 aPrezelin, B.B.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1992 Sept., v. 33, no. 6 p.733-741x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03615naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009700125300001600222500001500238520191900253650002502172650002502197650002502222650002302247650001502270650002202285650002002307650001502327650001402342650001502356650000902371650001402380650002602394650004302420650001702463650004202480650001502522650004502537650001602582650002002598650003602618650002002654650001202674650002702686650001202713653001502725653003402740653002002774653004002794700001702834700001402851773008202865852000902947930003302956945001302989946001103002655001203013IND2051770320221123002901.0960619e199209  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205177032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuroda, H.10aCollapse of peroxide-scavenging systems in apple flower-buds associated with freezing injury  ap. 743-750.  a2019-12-05  aChanges in the metabolic activities of peroxide-producing systems and peroxide-scavenging systems after freezing and thawing in flower buds of the apple, Malus pumila Mill., were studied with special reference to freezing injury. In flower buds of the 'McIntosh' apple that were frozen below lethal temperatures, the activity of NADH-Cyt c reductase (EC 1.6.99.3), one of the enzymes in the electron-transport chains that are related to the peroxide-producing systems, decreased slightly, while that of Cyt c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) hardly changed. By contrast, the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), dehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.8.5.1) and ascorbate peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.11), which are involved in the peroxide-scavenging systems, decreased to very low levels. The activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12) also decreased markedly. However, little change was observed in the activities of hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), glucosephosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) and glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9). Examination of substrates involved in the peroxide-scavenging systems revealed that the levels of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate decreased to approximately 10(-4) to 10(-)5 M and 10(-5) M, respectively, and the levels of GSH decreased to about 10(-5) M or became barely detectable. A decrease in the levels of GSSG also occurred while levels of ascorbate rose slightly. Similar results were observed with flower buds from 'Starking Delicious' and 'Jonathan' apple trees. These results suggest that the freezing injury to apple flower-buds is closely related to the collapse of the peroxide-scavenging systems that are coupled with the pentose phosphate cycle. The results also suggest that the dysfunction of these peroxide-scavenging systems is caused by H2O2, which may be produced during freezing and thawing. 3adehydroascorbic acid 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3ahexokinase 3aelectron transfer 3aMalus domestica 3aperoxidase 3acultivars 3ametabolism 3abuds 3aperoxides 3aquantitative analysis 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3afrost injury 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aisomerases 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3astress response 3aflowers 3aglutathione peroxidase 3athawing 0asubstrates 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH) 0aoxidoreductases 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aSagisaka, S.1 aChiba, K.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1992 Sept., v. 33, no. 6 p.743-750x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02579naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011000123300001300233500001500246520124400261650003001505650001201535650001101547650002601558650002801584650003601612650001901648650003301667650002601700650001601726650001401742650002201756650002701778650001701805650001101822653002701833653001501860653001601875653002701891653001901918700001601937773007801953852000902031930003302040945001302073946001102086655001202097IND2061269420221123003331.0980114e199201  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206126942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndo, M.10aChanges in concentrations of sugars and organic acids in the long-lasting flower clusters of Phalaenopsis  ap. 7-12.  a2019-12-05  aThe explanation for the maintenance of the quality of flower clusters in Phalaenopsis for up to four weeks or more was determined. The concentration of sugars and organic acids and the daily course of CO2 exchange in the florets, the flower stalk and the leaves of intact and cut flower clusters were determined. The concentration of sugars in florets of the cut flower clusters decreased progressively and linearly to 25% of the initial value. The concentration of organic acids in the flower stalk of the intact flower cluster increased progressively, whereas the concentration of malic acid in the flower stalk of the cut cluster decreased. The levels of sugars and organic acids in leaves in the absence of a flower cluster was higher than those in leaves in the presence of a cluster. The leaves and the flower cluster were related as source and sink organ, respectively. The level of sugars in the flower cluster remained high level for a long period of time. The results indicate that the stalk is capable of photosynthesis and has the characteristics of weak-CAM plants. The photosynthate produced by the stalk served to maintain the quality of the cut flower cluster for at least for 50 days and that of the intact flower cluster. 3asource-sink relationships 3ahybrids 3asugars 3aquantitative analysis 3aorganic acids and salts 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphotosynthates 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3anet assimilation rate 3acut flowers 3avase life 3adiurnal variation 3apostharvest physiology 3aPhalaenopsis 3aleaves 0aphalaenopsis musachino 0asenescence 0arespiration 0aphalaenopsis graceperm 0aphotosynthesis1 aIkusima, I.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1992 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.7-12x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03595naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191100001800208245013400226300001800360506007600378520139600454506003701850650001601887650001101903650002201914650002001936650002201956650002101978650002101999650002102020650002602041650004302067650003502110650002402145650001202169650003502181650003302216650002302249650003002272650003302302650002702335650003302362650002302395650007202418650002702490650002802517700001602545700001702561700001602578700001702594700001502611700001302626700001302639773009802652852000902750856009102759930003302850945002502883946001302908655001202921IND4364889420221207094337.0041012e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436488942DNAL7 a152947922pmid7 aPMC4923822pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.8.4604-4612.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

P252 was found in a Triton X-100-soluble brush border membrane vesicle fraction, suggesting that it may be a component of the midgut epithelial cell membrane. P252 was purified to homogeneity, and the amino acid sequence of two internal peptides was determined, but neither of the peptides matched protein sequences in the available databases. The apparent molecular mass of the purified protein was estimated by denaturing gel electrophoresis to be 252 kDa, and it migrated as a single band on native gels. However, gel filtration chromatography indicated an apparent mass of 985 kDa, suggesting that P252 may exist as a homo-oligomer. The associations of P252 with Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac were specific, and K(d) constants were determined to be 28.9, 178.5, and 20.0 nM, respectively. A heterologous competition assay was also done. P252 did not exhibit Leu-pNA hydrolysis activity, and binding to the Cry1A toxins was not inhibited by GalNAc. Binding assays of P252 with various lectins indicated the presence of three antennal N-linked high-mannose-type as well as O-linked mucin-type sugar side chains. While the function of P252 is not yet clear, we propose that it may function with Cry1A toxins during the insecticidal response and/or Cry toxin resistance mechanism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBombyx mori 3amidgut 3aintestinal mucosa 3aplasma membrane 3amembrane proteins 3abinding proteins 3abinding capacity 3acrystal proteins 3ainsecticidal proteins 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki 3abrush border membrane vesicles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBacterial Toxinsxmetabolism 2aBombyxxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aDigestive Systemxmetabolism 2aEndotoxinsxmetabolism 2aEpithelial Cellsxmetabolism 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aMembrane Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMicrovillixmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data1 aShitomi, Y.1 aMoriyama, K.1 aHiguchi, M.1 aHayakawa, T.1 aMitsui, T.1 aSato, R.1 aHori, H.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 Aug., v. 70, no. 8 p.4604-4612x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.8.4604-4612.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041216b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/12/16  aOther US 7aarticle03838naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245018000175300001800355500001500373520231200388650001402700650001102714650001802725650001402743650001102757650002402768650002602792650001102818650001802829650001702847650001302864650001302877650002202890651001102912653001802923653001202941653002602953653002002979653002002999653003503019700002203054773012303076852000903199856009203208930003303300946001103333655001203344IND4426460720221123003417.0090925e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442646072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02133.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampoux, Jean-Paul10aContribution of ploidy-level variation and adaptive trait diversity to the environmental distribution of taxa in the 'fine-leaved fescue' lineage (genus Festuca subg. Festuca)  ap. 1978-1993.  a2019-12-04  aWe assessed the relative contribution of ploidy-level variation and adaptive trait diversity to the diversity of taxon realized niches in a plant lineage with several ploidy levels. A large number of sites covering a wide range of environmental conditions in France. Our material comprised a collection of populations from several taxa of the 'fine-leaved fescue' lineage, namely section Aulaxyper (Festuca rubra s.l.) and subsection Festuca (Festuca ovina s.l.) of the subgenus Festuca. This collection was assessed for several traits related to vegetative growth, investment in seed production, morphology and phenology. Environmental parameters that best differentiate taxon-realized niches were identified by multivariate ordination and logistic regression. Canonical correlation analyses were performed to relate plant traits and ploidy-level variation to these environmental parameters. Taxon differentiation was assessed along the first canonical directions of the plant descriptor (plant-trait and ploidy-level) space. The climatic summer water balance, soil texture and land use were identified as the main environmental parameters differentiating taxon realized niches. Canonical correlation analyses revealed associations between plant traits and these environmental parameters, independent of ploidy-level variation. More specifically, the production of long and abundant rhizomes appeared to be an efficient adaptation to poor climatic summer water balance. In contrast, the ploidy level was rather weakly associated with environmental parameters. The marked prevalence of high ploidy levels in the collection suggests that they could have a competitive advantage in the range of environmental conditions investigated. Adaptive trait diversity appears to contribute more than ploidy-level variation to the present diversity of realized niches for fine-leaved fescue taxa, although plant-trait variations were associated to some extent with ploidy-level variation. However, cytotypes with high ploidy levels could have been efficient colonizers and competitors, favouring the expansion of the lineage and leading to their present prevalence. Furthermore, adaptive trait diversification may have been an efficient factor in niche diversification for the present cytotypes with high ploidy levels. 3acytotypes 3aniches 3aFestuca rubra 3aphenology 3aploidy 3aregression analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3asummer 3aFestuca ovina 3asoil texture 3arhizomes 3aland use 3avegetative growth 3aFrance 0awater balance 0arhizome 0abio-climatic gradient 0aniche modelling 0atrait diversity 0acanonical correlation analysis1 aHuyghe, Christian0 tJournal of biogeography.g2009 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.1978-1993dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02133.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02133naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013700125300001600262520108900278650002201367650001101389650001101400650001701411650001701428650002401445650002201469650001301491650002801504650002501532653002801557700001301585700001401598773008101612852000901693930003301702945001301735946001101748655001201759IND2061273320221123003205.0980114e199203  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206127332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, G.X.14aThe amino acid sequence of ascorbate peroxidase from tea has a high degree of homology to that of cytochrome c peroxidase from yeast  ap. 109-116.  aThe chloroplast isozyme of ascorbate peroxidase from tea leaves was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the amino acid sequences of the peptide fragments were determined. These sequences accounted for 64% of the amino acids in the entire protein. The sequence of one of the peptides can be aligned with the region which includes the proximal histidine that serves as the fifth ligand of the heme iron in guaiacol peroxidases and cytochrome c peroxidase. The sequences of the peptides from ascorbate peroxidase exhibit a higher degree of homology to the sequence of cytochrome c peroxidase from yeast than to those of guaiacol peroxidases from plants. In addition, three of the peptides from ascorbate peroxidase show a high degree of homology to triose-phosphate isomerase from maize. From the available amino acid sequences and the enzymatic and molecular properties of ascorbate and cytochrome c peroxidases, we propose that these hydrogen peroxide-scavenging peroxidases that use either cytochrome c or ascorbate as the electron donor originated from the same ancestral protein. 3aCamellia sinensis 3ayeasts 3aleaves 3achloroplasts 3amitochondria 3aprotein composition 3aascorbate oxidase 3aisozymes 3acytochrome-c peroxidase 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aSano, S.1 aAsada, K.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1992 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.109-116x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle04280naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132040001800173072001700191100002100208245011900229300001800348500001500366506007600381520186200457506003702319650003002356650004702386650001102433650001802444650002002462650001002482650003702492650002502529650001302554650002002567650002902587650003202616650005902648650002902707650003902736650002402775650004102799650001102840650001102851650002002862650002202882650004502904650003002949650002402979650004703003653004103050653001803091653003003109653001203139700001503151700001503166700001503181700001703196700002103213700001503234700001603249773009803265852000903363856009103372930003303463945002503496946001303521655001203534IND4364896920221207094353.0041012e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436489692DNAL7 a152947962pmid7 aPMC4923922pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.8.4635-4641.20042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fecal material was collected from 24 neonates aged between 3 days and 2 months in a neonatal unit (Erinville Hospital, Cork, Ireland). A total of 46 isolates from six neonates were confirmed to be Bifidobacterium species based on a combination of the fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase assay, RAPD [random(ly) amplified polymorphic DNA] PCR, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and partial 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Interestingly, only 1 of the 11 neonates that had received antibiotic treatment produced bifidobacteria. PFGE after genomic digestion with the restriction enzyme XbaI demonstrated that the bifidobacteria population displayed considerable genomic diversity among the neonates, with each containing between one and five dominant strains, whereas 11 different macro restriction patterns were obtained. In only one case did a single strain appear in two neonates. All genetically distinct strains were then screened for CLA production after 72 h of incubation with 0.5 mg of free linoleic acid ml-1 by using gas-liquid chromatography. The most efficient producers belonged to the species Bifidobacterium breve, of which two different strains converted 29 and 27% of the free linoleic acid to the cis-9, trans-11 isomer per microgram of dry cells, respectively. In addition, a strain of Bifidobacterium bifidum showed a conversion rate of 18%/microgram dry cells. The ability of some Bifidobacterium strains to produce CLA could be another human health-promoting property linked to members of the genus, given that this metabolite has demonstrated anticarcinogenic activity in vitro and in vivo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aintestinal microorganisms 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ahumans 3aribosomal DNA 3aBifidobacterium 3afeces 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3anucleotide sequences 3aneonates 3aenzyme activity 3aconjugated linoleic acid 2aAldehyde-Lyasesxmetabolism 2aBifidobacteriumxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysis 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Premature 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxbiosynthesis 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16S 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 0afructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase 0alinoleic acid 0apolymerase chain reaction 0ainfants1 aRoss, R.P.1 aHussey, S.1 aRyan, C.A.1 aMurphy, B.P.1 aFitzgerald, G.F.1 aDevery, R.1 aStanton, C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 Aug., v. 70, no. 8 p.4635-4641x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.8.4635-4641.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041216b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/12/16  aOther US 7aarticle03157naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024002100133024001900154040001800173072001700191100001500208245003400223300001800257500001500275506007600290520165500366506003702021650002202058650002002080650002402100650001402124650002302138650001902161650002602180650001202206650001602218653001802234653001702252653002302269700001602292700001402308700001702322700001402339700001702353773009802370852000902468856009102477930003302568945002502601946001302626655001202639IND4364886420221207081211.0041012e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436488642DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.70.8.4538-4543.20042doi7 aPMC4924342pmcid7 a152947832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The lack of a culture method for noroviruses warrants the use of cultivable model viruses to gain more insight on their transmission routes and inactivation methods. We studied the inactivation of the reported enteric canine calicivirus no. 48 (CaCV) and the respiratory feline calicivirus F9 (FeCV) and correlated inactivation to reduction in PCR units of FeCV, CaCV, and a norovirus. Inactivation of suspended viruses was temperature and time dependent in the range from 0 to 100°C. UV-B radiation from 0 to 150 mJ/cm2 caused dose-dependent inactivation, with a 3 D (D = 1 log10) reduction in infectivity at 34 mJ/cm2 for both viruses. Inactivation by 70% ethanol was inefficient, with only 3 D reduction after 30 min. Sodium hypochlorite solutions were only effective at >300 ppm. FeCV showed a higher stability at pH <3 and pH >7 than CaCV. For all treatments, detection of viral RNA underestimated the reduction in viral infectivity. Norovirus was never more sensitive than the animal caliciviruses and profoundly more resistant to low and high pH. Overall, both animal viruses showed similar inactivation profiles when exposed to heat or UV-B radiation or when incubated in ethanol or hypochlorite. The low stability of CaCV at low pH suggests that this is not a typical enteric (calici-) virus. The incomplete inactivation by ethanol and the high hypochlorite concentration needed for sufficient virus inactivation point to a concern for decontamination of fomites and surfaces contaminated with noroviruses and virus-safe water.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aheat inactivation 3adecontamination 3asodium hypochlorite 3aNorovirus 3aFeline calicivirus 3aheat treatment 3aultraviolet radiation 3aethanol 3airradiation 0aCaliciviridae 0ainactivation 0aCanine calicivirus1 aBijkerk, P.1 aRockx, B.1 aGroot, A. de1 aTwisk, F.1 aKoopmans, M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 Aug., v. 70, no. 8 p.4538-4543x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.8.4538-4543.20043Available from publisher's Web site  a20041216b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/12/16  aOther US 7aarticle02912naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245021600129300001400345520151500359650001301874650001101887650003701898650002201935650001101957650001001968650002901978650001302007650001702020650002002037650002002057650002502077653002802102653001802130653001802148653001802166653001802184653001802202700001702220700001802237700001302255700001702268773007902285852000902364930003302373945001302406946001102419655001202430IND2061270620221122221530.0980114e199201  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206127062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakakibara, H.10aMolecular cloning of the family of glutamine synthetase genes from maize: expression of genes for glutamine synthetase and ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues  ap. 49-58.  aFive cDNA clones for glutamine synthetase (GS), pGS107, pGS112, pGS117, pGS122, and pGS202, was isolated from a maize cDNA library constructed with poly(A)+ RNA from light induced greening leaves. From a comparison of the primary structures, pGS202 was judged to encode a plastidic isoform, and the others to encode cytosolic isoforms. This result confirms that maize GS is encoded by a small multigene family, as is the case in other plant species. Steady-state levels of proteins and mRNAs for the GS isoforms and ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT) were analysed by Western and Northern blottings in different organs, namely, leaves, mesocotyls and roots, and under various physiological conditions. The levels of both plastidic GS and Fd-GOGAT and those of their respective mRNAs were much higher in photosynthetic organs than in non-photosynthetic organs and increased in a similar manner during illumination of etiolated leaves. Thus, the expression of the plastidic GS and Fd-GOGAT in leaves seems to be coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level. Although the cytosolic isoforms of GS, encoded by the four separate genes could not be quantified separately, the levels of their respective mRNAs were very different from one another. The mRNAs that corresponded to pGS107 and pGS112 were abundant and were distributed almost equally in all organs, while those that corresponded to pGS117 and pGS122 were distributed predominantly in young etiolated leaves and roots, respectively. 3aZea mays 3aleaves 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3acomplementary DNA 3aclones 3agenes 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aisozymes 3agenetic code 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0apgs107 clones 0apgs112 clones 0apgs117 clones 0apgs122 clones 0apgs202 clones1 aKawabata, S.1 aTakahashi, H.1 aHase, T.1 aSugiyama, T.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1992 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.49-58x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02341naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245010500173300001800278500002400296520112600320650001701446650000901463650001901472650001701491650002101508650001101529650001901540650001601559650000901575650004401584650001201628650000701640650001401647650001801661650002001679651001001699773012801709852000901837856008501846655001201931IND4410734420221122124502.0080926s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441073442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-008-9787-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelfattah, Mohamed S.10aScreening of terrestrial Streptomyces leading to identification of new stereoisomeric anthracyclines  ap. 2619-2625.  aIncludes references  aThirty different Streptomyces strains were isolated from soil samples collected from different places in Egypt. The strains were isolated using Oatmeal agar and ISP medium 2 agar at pH 7.5. The isolate Streptomyces sp. Eg23 was selected for further working up to yield three new streoisomers of anthracycline metabolites. The structures were elucidated as (7R, 9R, 10S)-e-Rhodomycinone (1), (7R, 9R, 10S) Aklavinone (2), and (9R, 10S) 7-Desoxy-z-Rhodomycinone (3) by interpretation of their 1D and 2D NMR spectra. The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was confirmed by modified Mosher's method. The (7R, 9R, 10S)-e-Rhodomycinone (1) showed activity against human lung cancer cell H460, murine Lewis lung cancer cell LL/2 and human breast cancer cell MCF-7. Compounds 1-3 were known synthetically, but until now have not been isolated as natural products from a microorganism. The results showed that the Streptomyces sp.

We studied a system very different from those that have attracted previous research on this topic: sea snakes (Emydocephalus annulatus) in shallow-water coral-reef areas of New Caledonia. The snakes used habitats non-randomly in terms of substrate types and water depths, with frequent use of coral-rubble areas that also contained the nests of fish (damselfish and blennies) whose eggs are eaten by these snakes. Mate-searching adult male snakes were found across a broader range of habitat types than were foraging females and juveniles. Smaller snakes were found in shallower water. Colour polymorphism was evident (melanism increased with body size, and was more common in males than in females) but did not affect habitat use. The effects of colour morph on operative temperatures of physical models (evident in terrestrial situations) disappeared under water. Habitat use in this population is affected by a snake's body size and sex, but not by colour. Studies of terrestrial snakes have emphasized thermal or camouflage benefits of colour polymorphism, but the superficially similar polymorphism in E. annulatus is not consistent with either of these hypotheses and thus challenges their generality. Similarly, there was no dietary difference between age or sex groups and thus dietary partitioning cannot explain the observed intraspecific habitat partitioning. 3aSerpentes 3aadults 3abody size 3acolor 3aeggs 3afemales 3afish 3aforaging 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amelanosis 3amimicry (behavior) 3anests 3aphysical models 3asnakes 3atemperature 3aNew Caledonia1 aShine, Terri1 aShine, Benjamin0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2003 Sept., v. 80, no. 1 p.1-10dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00213.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010000165300001800265500002400283500001500307520158300322650002501905650001001930650002601940650002901966650001601995650002802011650003002039650001902069650001302088650003302101650002602134650001402160650003502174650001302209650001002222651001702232653002602249700001802275773012802293852000902421856008502430655001202515IND4410733320221122130029.0080926s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441073332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-008-9777-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, P.

Consequently, it has become increasingly important to process lower-grade ores. Phosphorous (P) and particular potassium (K) contained in the iron ore concentrates of the Sishen Iron Ore Mine have a detrimental effect on the steel making process, whereby these alkali's cause cracks to form in the refractory lining of blast furnaces. It is initially essential to determine which microbes are indigenously present at the Sishen Iron Ore Mine before strategising how best to employ them to industrial advantage. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine which microorganisms are indigenous to the iron ore and soil of the Sishen Iron Ore Mine. The bacterial 16S PCR and fungal ITS PCR revealed several bacterial and fungal species present in the mine environment. The bacterial isolates were found to be closely related to Herbaspirillum species, as well as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, while the fungal isolates were closely related to Aureobasidium pullulans, Phaeosphaeria nodorum, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida parapsilosis. Isolating A. fumigatus from the iron ore/soil of the mine may indicate that A. niger, the most common fungi used for the production of citric acid, can adapt to the stringent mine environment. This would allow the application of A. niger for the production of citric acid, which may be used for the chemical leaching of the P and K from the iron ore concentrate of the Sishen Iron Ore Mine. 3aCandida parapsilosis 3asteel 3amicrobial communities 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3acitric acid 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aHerbaspirillum 3aleaching 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3apotassium 3aAcidithiobacillus ferrooxidans 3afurnaces 3afungi 3aSouth Africa 0aLeptosphaeria nodorum1 aCloete, T.

USMAA2-4 could produce approximately 44 wt.% copolymer of P(3HB-co-4HB) with 27 mol% 4HB composition when the combination of oleic acid and 1,4-butanediol are used as carbon sources in 60 h cultivation. The manipulation of carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) resulted in the increase of dry cell weight, PHA content as well as 4HB composition. A new strategy of introducing oleic acid and 1,4-butanediol together and separately at different concentration demonstrated different yield in PHA content ranging from 47 to 58 wt.%. The molecular weight obtained was 234 kDa (by adding 1,4-butanediol and oleic acid together) and 212 kDa (by adding 1,4-butanediol separately).

In the present study, we employ a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and investigate the effect of Cr(VI) on colony morphology of a Bacillus sp. isolated from soil exposed to tannery effluent. The colonies grown at chromium concentrations, control and 100 ppm are found to be opaque and beyond 200 ppm the colonies were translucent thus exhibiting phase variation. CLSM studies on colonies grown on control plates showed significant increase in height and in biovolume as a function of time whereas, the translucent colonies showed very little change in height and biovolume corresponding to the colony growth. Exopolymeric substance (EPS) content of translucent colonies was lesser than that of opaque colonies, indicating that EPS also plays a role in the observed phenomenon of phase variation. Studies on the effect of Cr(VI) on spore formation showed that Cr(VI) concentrations up to 100 ppm favored spore formation, while concentrations beyond 100 ppm showed a steady decline in spore formation. 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3achromium 3aoxidation 3asoil 3aspores 3asporulation 3atoxicity1 aGopal, Judy1 aTata, B.

The process was designed as a two-stage process; a first stage of active growth, where glucose and other nutrients were adequately supplied to the growing cells over 12 h, followed by a second stage of 2 h for spore formation and toxin release. In order to maximize spore and toxin yield and productivity, different quantities of glucose and nutrients were fed separately to the growing cells in four different fermentation runs. In all runs, glucose was converted to bacterial biomass during the first stage and subsequently to spores and crystal protein during the second phase. The best results were obtained with a fermentation run supplied with 190 g glucose in 1500 ml. Up to 20.1 g of bacterial insecticides/l were recovered from fermentation broth with a glucose to toxin conversion yield of 0.159 g/g. Also, a markedly high spore concentration of 2.31 x 10¹² c.f.u./ml was obtained. The spore-crystal protein mixture obtained was tested for its insecticidal activity against three of the most agronomically important pests. Among the bioinsecticide-treated insect pests, Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis was the most susceptible pest with the lowest LC₅₀ of the bioinsecticides against its larval instar and the highest virulence against adults emerged later on from the surviving larvae. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aadults 3abacteria 3abacterial insecticides 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amicrobial biomass 3anutrients 3aspores 3avirulence1 aAlotaibi, S.1 aYoussef, Narmen A.1 aSaleh, W.

The microbial cellulose (MC) from Acetobacter xylinum was used as the support material for immobilization of the bacterium. Nitrate removal took place mainly in the anoxic system. The effects of various operating conditions such as the initial nitrate concentration, pH, and carbon source on biological denitrification were demonstrated experimentally. The system demonstrated a high capacity for reducing nitrate concentrations under optimum conditions. The denitrification rate increased up to a maximal value of 1.6 kg NO₃-N m⁻³ day⁻¹ with increasing nitrate loading rate. Because of its porosity and purity, MC may be considered as appropriate supports for adsorbed immobilized cells. The simplicity of immobilization and high efficiency in operation are the main advantages of such systems. To date, the immobilization of microorganisms onto MC has not been carried out. The results of this research shows that a pilot bioreactor containing P. stutzeri immobilized on MC exhibited efficient denitrification with a relatively low retention time. 3aGluconacetobacter xylinus 3aPseudomonas stutzeri 3abacteria 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3acellulose 3adenitrification 3aimmobilized cells 3anitrates 3aporosity1 aGodini, Hatam1 aDehestani, Said1 aReza Yazdanbakhsh, Ahmad1 aMosavi, Gholamreza1 aKazemnejad, Anoshiravan0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 Nov., v. 24, no. 11 p.2397-2402dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-008-9753-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02471naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008500173300001600258520096500274592002801239650002201267650001201289650002001301650002901321650002501350650001301375650002701388650002701415650002201442650000901464650002901473650001101502650003701513650001901550650003001569650001301599650001001612650001401622650001001636653002001646653003001666653002401696653000801720700001901728773012501747856008401872852000901956655001201965IND60122150520150626000000.0150325e20140421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012215052DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2013.8253982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhagwat, Manasi K.10aAntibacterial activity of herbal extracts against five plant pathogenic bacteria  ap. 892-899.  aThe present study was designed to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against five plant pathogenic bacteria (viz. Xanthomonas campestris , Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae , Erwinia spp., Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas citri). Herbal extracts of leaves and rinds of Garcinia indica , rhizomes of Curcuma aromatica , roots of Glyccyrrhiza glabra , leaves of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis and seeds of Vernonia anthelmintica were used for screening. Screening was done using agar well diffusion method. Relatively potent extracts were shortlisted from this study and were further studied to find out their minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). From the studies, it was observed that extracts of C. aromatica , G. indica and G. glabra have shown lowest MBC values among other tested plant extracts. This study indicates the potential of these potent plant extracts in the management of diseases caused by plant pathogenic bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma aromatica 3aErwinia 3aGarcinia indica 3aNyctanthes arbor-tristis 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aVernonia 3aXanthomonas axonopodis 3aXanthomonas campestris 3aXanthomonas citri 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3aleaves 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aplant extracts 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3arhizomes 3aroots 3ascreening 3aseeds 0aherbal extracts 0aplant pathogenic bacteria 0aagar well diffusion 0aMBC1 aDatar, Ajit G.0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2014 Apr. 21, v. 47, no. 7 p.892-899dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2013.8253983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012000168300001400288520115600302592002801458650004401486650002901530650001601559650001301575650001701588650002101605650001601626650001301642650002701655650001201682650001401694650001701708650001501725650002101740653001301761653002701774653002401801700001901825773011501844856008601959852000902045655001202054IND60528166820221118055406.0161019e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052816682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVadivel, T.10aSynthesis, characterization and antibacterial studies of ruthenium(III) complexes derived from chitosan schiff base  ap. 44-52.  aChitosan can be modified chemically by condensation reaction of deacetylated chitosan with aldehyde in homogeneous phase. This condensation is carried by primary amine (NH2) with aldehyde (CHO) to form corresponding schiff base. The chitosan biopolymer schiff base derivatives are synthesized with substituted aldehydes namely 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy benzaldehyde, and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzaldehyde, becomes a complexing agent or ligand. The Ruthenium(III) complexes were obtained by complexation of Ruthenium with schiff base ligands and this product exhibits as an excellent solubility and more biocompatibility. The novel series of schiff base Ruthenium(III) complexes are characterized by Elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, and Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). The synthesized complexes have been subjected to antibacterial study. The antibacterial results indicated that the antibacterial activity of the complexes were more effective against Gram positive and Gram negative pathogenic bacteria. These findings are giving suitable support for developing new antibacterial agent and expand our scope for applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abenzaldehyde 3abiocompatibility 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3acondensation reactions 3aligands 3aruthenium 3aschiff bases 3asolubility 3athermogravimetry 0aChitosan 0aRuthenium(III) complex 0aAntibacterial study1 aDhamodaran, M.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Sept., v. 90 p.44-52dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245018400206300001100390520142200401592002801823650001401851650001101865650001901876650001201895650001101907650001801918650001201936650002301948650003301971650001402004650001902018650002202037651002002059700002002079773012202099856008302221852000902304655001202313IND60728642820221118235023.0220305e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072864282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-021-01741-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrajman, Božo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3667-113510aEvolutionary origin and systematic position of Euphorbia normannii (Euphorbiaceae), an intersectional hybrid and local endemic of the Stavropol Heights (Northern Caucasus, Russia)  ap. 20.  aThe Caucasus is one of the richest areas in the world in terms of animal and plant diversity, harbouring 6400 plant species. As a part of the Northern Caucasus, the Stavropol Heights are renowned for their local endemism, highlighted by six species of flowering plants endemic to this area. One of them is the annual species Euphorbia normannii, described in 1891, but with uncertain taxonomic position. We here used nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and plastid trnT–trnF sequences to infer the phylogenetic position of E. normannii. The nuclear data inferred its position within E. sect. Myrsiniteae, whereas the plastid data placed it within E. sect. Pithyusa, thus indicating a hybrid origin. Relative genome size (RGS) data indicate that E. normannii has the highest RGS compared to three other annual species belonging to both sections (E. aleppica, E. gaillardotii and E. falcata). Our data are inconclusive whether E. normannii is of allopolyploid or homoploid hybrid origin, or whether later hybridisation and plastid capture from E. sect. Pithyusa was responsible for the incongruent phylogenetic signal. Morphologically, E. normannii is distinct, as are all three before-mentioned annuals, which fall in predominately perennial sections. However, the species most similar to E. normannii is E. falcata from E. sect. Pithyusa and therefore we propose inclusion of E. normannii in this section.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia 3aRussia 3aallopolyploidy 3aanimals 3agenome 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aindigenous species 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 3aspecies diversity 3aCaucasus region1 aGeltman, Dmitry0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2021 Apr., v. 307, no. 2 p.20-20dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6813x0378-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-021-01741-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01275naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006100158300002000219520031100239592002800550650001500578650002300593650002300616650001400639700001800653700001300671700001800684700001400702700001400716773013600730856007400866852000900940655001200949IND60661145720221119083227.0190828e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066114572DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05546f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Weibing10aMagnetic anisotropy of iron-based metallic glassy fibers  ap. 16072-16075.  aFlexible, uniform and surface smooth iron-based metallic glassy fibers (MGFs) were fabricated by a melt-extraction method.

The samples of ovaries were fixed in Mota's basic lead acetate. Toluidine blue was used for detection of MCs and periodic acid-Schiff for detection of KCs. The percentage of KCs in a differential leukocyte count was determined in blood smears stained according to the Pappenheim method. Non-pregnant females with normal ovaries and with cystic rete ovarii were included in the study and the numbers of MCs and KCs were compared in these two groups and in follicular and luteal phases of the oestrous cycle. MCs' distribution in ovaries was different in the guinea pig in comparison to previously studied species: MCs were found exclusively in the superficial layers of cortical stroma and no significant difference was found between the number of MCs in the follicular and luteal phases, neither in normal ovaries, nor in ovaries with cystic rete ovarii. Significantly lower numbers of MCs were found in ovaries with cystic rete ovarii (P < 0.01) in contrast to normal ovaries. A significantly higher percentage of KCs in the peripheral blood was found in the follicular phase (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was found in relation to the presence of cystic rete ovarii. Interestingly, no KCs were found in the samples of ovaries (either in the follicular or luteal phase, and with or without cysts). Thus, the expected role of KCs in ovarian physiology or in the aetiology of the cystic rete ovarii can be excluded.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aestrous cycle 3aetiology 3aguinea pigs 3alead acetate 3aleukocyte count 3amenstrual cycle 3aresearch 3atoluidine blue 3aveterinary medicine 0aNK cells 0aOvary 0aMast cells 0aKurloff cells 0aGuinea pig 0aOvarian cysts1 aČížek, Petr,1 aJekl, Vladimir1 aGozdziewska-Harlajczuk, Karolina1 aKleckowska-Nawrot, Joanna0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2021 May, v. 136 p.512-518dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007900169300001400248520130100262592002801563650002701591650001401618650001601632650001001648650002601658650001101684650001601695650002401711651001001735653002901745653004101774653002701815653002001842653002101862700001801883773013201901856008702033852000902120655001202129IND60767508920221121051434.0220218e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076750892DNAL7 a10.5958/2454-552X.2021.00071.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarn, Aditya10aDrivers of information sources use pattern by the farm households of Bihar  ap. 67-70.  aAgriculture is the main occupation of a large majority of households in Bihar. The differences in demographics and availability and accessibility of various information sources determine the information sources use pattern. Information is one of the basic inputs required prior to, during and after performing any agriculture practices. Present study was conducted in Muzaffarpur and Madhubani districts of Bihar that included a random sample of 120 farmers, 60 each from both the districts. The farmers of Muzaffarpur and Madhubani districts were having varied perceptions on information needs for most of the aspects in agriculture. The step wise multiple regression models revealed that mass media use, education, family size and household expenditure together have explained 53 per cent variation in farmers’ perception on information needs. While, mass media use, education, annual income, family size and personal localite sources use together have determined 61 per cent variation in fulfillment of information needs with respect to various aspects of agriculture.

Farm-level adoption of CA is related to reduced labour and agricultural inputs, more consistent yields, and increased soil nutrient exchange capacity. A good quality land yields good results to everyone, confers good health on the entire family, and causes growth of money, cattle, and grain. The present study depicts hard evidence by identifying marker variables impacting income augmentation through conservation agriculture. A score of 50 farmers has been selected from two blocks of Cooch Behar district of West Bengal, by non-probability snowballing sampling techniques with a total of eighteen independent variables along with income from major crop is used as the dependent variable through a structured interview schedule. A basket of multivariate analytical techniques has been applied along with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as well. The results depict that a blend of diversified farming and farming experiences in CA contributed immensely to scale up income from conservation agriculture approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural conservation practice 3acattle 3aenvironmental management 3afarm income 3alabor 3aneural networks 3asoil nutrients 3aIndia 0aArtificial Neural Network 0aConservation agriculture 0aSnowball sampling1 aĀcār, Es.

As such, it is one of the key public health targets for a salt reduction policy. In this respect, it has been shown that a reduction in the salt content of bread is possible, and an alternative approach involves partial replacement with other, mainly potassium‐based salts, which also counteract the effects of sodium. This replacement should be undertaken on the basis of criteria that maintain the product's sensory profile, and it tends to be more successful in breads with more naturally flavorful taste. The present review was conducted to examine salt intake in Europe and the health problems associated with its excessive consumption; particular focus is placed on the salt content of bread and the effects of its possible reduction and/or correction. The beneficial effects of such changes are highlighted by way of a theoretical calculation in baguette‐type wheat bread. European legislation in the field of nutrition and health claims allows the positive aspects of such salt reduction and replacement methods to be stated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreads 3adiet 3ahealth claims 3apublic health 3asalt content 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3ataste 3awheat 2aAnimals 2aBreadxanalysis 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aDiet, Sodium-Restricted 2aHealth Policy 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aNutrition Policy 2aPotassium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aPublic Health 2aSodium Chloride, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 3aEurope 0aEurope1 aSalas‐Salvado, Jordi0 tNutrition reviews.g2012 Nov., v. 70, no. 11 p.666-678dBlackwell Publishing Incx0029-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2012.00540.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011800164300002000282520121200302592002801514596006901542650002001611650001101631650001001642650001801652650001101670650001301681650001201694650001001706651001001716700001601726700001401742773016901756856008201925852000902007655001202016IND60637040220221122042154.0190414e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063704022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04484-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ruzhong10aEffects of channel morphology on nitrate retention in a headwater agricultural stream in Lake Chaohu Basin, China  ap. 10651-10661.  aFive field tracer experiments and relevant detailed investigations of physical characterizations were conducted to investigate the effects of channel geomorphic settings on nitrate uptake efficiency on a 310-m long geomorphically distinct stream reach in a headwater agricultural stream in Hefei District, Lake Chaohu Basin. The model-fitted parameters from the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage model were used to estimate the transient storage metric ([Formula: see text]) and determine the total nitrate uptake coefficient (k) for the study reach. And then, a nutrient spiraling approach was applied to reach-scale nitrate uptake estimates (Sw, Vf, and U). The results showed that the main channel was the major contributor to nitrate uptake retention, and the higher geomorphic complexity might result in better nitrate uptake efficiency. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis showed strong correlations between the independent variables as geomorphic settings, Reynolds number and transient storage, and the dependent variables as nitrate uptake metrics, which further underscored the importance of stream physical characteristics on measurement of stream nitrate uptake.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 51579061cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aReynolds number 3abasins 3alakes 3aleast squares 3amodels 3anitrates 3astreams 3awater 3aChina1 aXu, Daqiang1 aYin, Qihe0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Apr., v. 26, no. 11 p.10651-10661dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04484-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100002300202245009200225300001800317500002400335520195700359650001702316650001702333650002402350650002002374650001902394650002602413650001802439650003302457650004502490650001602535650001202551650002602563650002802589650003902617653003402656653003402690700001702724700001602741700001902757773012402776852000902900856008702909930003302996945002503029946001303054655001203067IND4393001520221117171245.0070713e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439300152DNAL7 a170668172pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-99.5.18132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL700 0aL001 0aL2001 aRugman-Jones, P.F.10aMolecular identification key for pest species of Scirtothrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)  ap. 1813-1819.  aIncludes references  aEffective plant quarantine and biological control initiatives require rapid and accurate identification of exotic and potentially invasive taxa that may cause high economic losses or environmental damage. The genus Scirtothrips Shull includes several species that are serious agricultural pests, and, because of their minute size and cryptic behavior, prone to undetected transport through international trade of plant material. Although assigning specimens to the genus Scirtothrips is straightforward using traditional taxonomic methods, identification of species is much more difficult and requires expert knowledge of the genus. Furthermore, the validity of some Scirtothrips species is questionable. Therefore, an easy, accurate, and highly reliable technique is desirable for Scirtothrips identification. Here, we provide a simple molecular key based on the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Individual specimens can be identified by amplification of their ITS1 and ITS2 regions with general primers and determining the size of the products by using standard agarose gel electrophoresis, followed in some instances by DNA digestion with the restriction enzymes SacII or PspOM I. The advantage of this identification system is that nonspecialists are able to quickly and cheaply identify individual specimens. Material analyzed for this work was collected in the United States (California), India, South Africa, Kenya, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Australia, New Zealand and Raiatea (Society Islands French Polynesia). We have identified seven pest species with the molecular-based methods described here. It is hoped that this system can be extended to other members of the genus as their ITS1 and ITS2 sequences become available. We also provide molecular confirmation for two new Scirtothrips species, one species from Honduras and one species from New Zealand. 3aScirtothrips 3ainsect pests 3apest identification 3ainsect taxonomy 3ataxonomic keys 3amolecular systematics 3aribosomal DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3anew species 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacer 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsectaxclassificationxgenetics. 0ainternal transcribed spacer 1 0ainternal transcribed spacer 21 aHoddle, M.S.1 aMound, L.A.1 aStouthamer, R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2006 Oct., v. 99, no. 5 p.1813-1819dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-99.5.18133Available from publisher's Web site  a20070731b20070802c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle02326naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011800167300002000285520103100305592002801336650001901364650001001383650002501393650001101418650001401429650003001443650002901473650002701502650002201529650001701551650002201568651001001590700002301600700005701623773016901680856008201849852000901931655001201940IND60637040320221122025423.0190414e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063704032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04497-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzam, Muhammad14aThe effects of energy on investment, human health, environment and economic growth: empirical evidence from China  ap. 10816-10825.  aThe role of energy cannot be passed over in the process of economic growth and development in any economy. China consumes colossal quantity of energy; thus, the central objectives of this study is to empirically evaluate the linkages among energy use, environment by CO₂ emissions, human health by health expenditures, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows, and real GDP per capita used for economic growth over the period of 1995–2016 for China. The nature of the data directed to employ the Canonical cointegrating regression (CCR) method for unknown parameter estimation. Four equations have estimated namely for FDI, health, environment, and economic growth. The result for China during the period under the study reveals that energy consumption has significant positive impact on FDI, health, environment, and economic growth. The study results suggest that policy makers need to chalk out effective policy for effective utilization of energy so as to encourage permissible economic growth and development in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achalk 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aequations 3aforeign direct investment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowth and development 3ahealth care costs 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3aChina1 aKhan, Abdul Qayyum1 aOzturk, Ilhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6521-09010 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Apr., v. 26, no. 11 p.10816-10825dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04497-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011800168520161400286592002801900650002201928650003001950650001601980650001801996650001502014650002202029650002002051650001502071650001502086650002602101650001402127650002202141650001602163650001502179653001502194653003202209653002102241653002102262653003302283653002502316700001702341700001302358700001502371700001302386700001602399700001802415700001702433700002302450773011602473856008702589852000902676655001202685IND60779305220221120150733.0220906e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077930522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiefei10aCombined acid pretreatment and co-hydrothermal carbonization to enhance energy recovery from food waste digestate  aTo achieve clean and efficient utilization of food waste digestate (FWD), a novel strategy of combining acid pretreatment and co-hydrothermal carbonization was developed to prepare value-added hydrochar from food waste digestate. The acid pretreatment of FWD was carried out with 1 M HCl for 8 h at a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:5. In addition to the characterization of physicochemical properties including proximate analysis, elemental content, heating value, and thermal stability of the hydrochar, TG-FTIR-MS and TG-DSC were used to evaluate the pyrolysis gaseous products and combustion performance of hydrochar. The results showed that the combination strategy enhanced the fuel properties of the hydrochar. In particular, the ash content of hydrochar was reduced to a minimum of 6.3%, thereby increasing the heating value by nearly two folds. The acid pretreatment and the addition of wood waste increased the H/C and O/C ratios of hydrochar while enhancing the thermal stability of hydrochar. The peak types of the infrared spectrum and mass spectrum of the pyrolysis gaseous products remained largely unchanged. Based on the comprehensive combustion index and combustion stability index, blending with wood waste could obtain a comparable combustion performance of the hydrochar with multiple cycles of acid pretreatment. The apparent activation energy of hydrochar was 102.0 and 90.4 kJ mol⁻¹ by FWO and KAS methods, respectively. The strategy advocated here presents a new ‘green’ perspective for the large-scale energy recovery from food waste digestate that is currently under-utilized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadministrative management 3aash content 3acarbonization 3acombustion 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy recovery 3afood waste 3ahydrochars 3aproximate composition 3apyrolysis 3athermal stability 3avalue added 3awaste wood 0aSolid fuel 0aBiochar/hydrochar stability 0aGaseous products 0aEnergy potential 0aSustainable waste management 0aFood waste recycling1 aHe, Mingjing1 aXu, Zibo1 aLuo, Zejun1 aGao, Bin1 aRuan, Roger1 aWang, Chi-Hwa1 aWong, K.

Herbicides represent almost half of the total amount of pesticides used. Although important to the reduction of costs and an increase of productivity, their indiscriminate use, as well as that of the other pesticides, is a global environmental problem, since they affect the living organisms. To evaluate the damage caused by herbicides to the environment, different organisms have been used as bioindicators, especially higher plants, due to several advantages. This is a literature review on herbicidal actions in plant bioindicators, as assessed by genetic biomarkers. Also, the present manuscript aimed to characterize the main organisms (Allium cepa, Vicia faba and Tradescantia spp.) and the most used biomarkers (mitotic index, chromosome aberrations, micronuclei, sister chromatid exchange and mutations). We concluded that herbicides induce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in the assessed bioindicators. The data corroborate the existing warnings of the risks that the indiscriminate and increasing use of pesticides poses to the environment and its biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aTradescantia 3aVicia faba 3abiodiversity 3abiomarkers 3achromosome aberrations 3acrossing over 3acytotoxicity 3agenotoxicity 3aherbicides 3amitosis 3amutation 3arisk1 aGuedes, Thays de Andrade1 aFontanetti, Carmem Silvia0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2016 Dec., v. 188, no. 12 p.694-694dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5702-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009000172300001400262520105300276592002801329650002701357650002001384650001001404651001001414653001001424653001201434653001401446653003001460653001201490700001801502700001701520700002401537773013201561856008701693852000901780655001201789IND60767509220221121054718.0220218e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076750922DNAL7 a10.5958/2454-552X.2021.00062.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatha, Madhu C.10aImpact of daesi program on knowledge levels of input dealers in andhra pradesh, India  ap. 82-86.  aMost of the farmers in India seek farm advice from input dealers but majority of these dealers do not have formal agricultural education. In order to build their technical competency in agriculture, National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE) has launched a self-financed “One-year Diploma in Agricultural Extension Services for Input Dealers (DAESI) Program” so that they can blend their business with extension services besides discharging regulatory responsibilities. A knowledge test was developed to study the impact of DAESI Program on knowledge levels of input dealers, by taking 45 trained and 45 non trained dealers randomly from 3 districts of Andhra Pradesh. Results of the study showed that there exists a huge gap in the knowledge levels of trained and non trained input dealers. The findings clearly showed that the diploma programme had contributed to increased knowledge levels of input dealers on crop production technologies which are sufficient to give suitable advice to field level problems of farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural extension 3acrop production 3afarms 3aIndia 0aDAESI 0aFarmers 0aKnowledge 0aNon-trained input dealers 0aTrained1 aKadian, K.

A total of 180 28-day-old Arbor Acres broilers (half males and half females) were randomly allocated to three treatments, each containing six replicates of 10 birds per treatment, using a completely randomized design. Birds were reared at 35, 60 or 85% RH at 32°C for 15 days (temperature increased by 3°C every 3 days from 20 to 32°C within 15 days: 20−23−26−29−32°C). RH affected (P<0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), average daily water consumption (ADWC), blood glucose concentrations, muscle glycogen levels, avian uncoupling protein (av UCP) mRNA expression, and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity in liver of broilers at 42 days of age. The 85% RH decreased (P<0.05) ADFI, ADG and ADWC; 35% RH decreased (P<0.02) ADG. Both 85 and 35% RH increased (P<0.01) blood glucose and decreased (P<0.05) muscle glycogen. Both 85 and 35% RH increased (P<0.05) av UCP mRNA expression. 35% RH decreased (P<0.05) CCO activity. In conclusion, both high and low RH inceased glucose consumption and reduced mitochondrial ATP poduction, leading to a decline in growth rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood glucose 3abroiler chickens 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afeed intake 3afemales 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3agrowth performance 3aliver 3amales 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3arearing 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 0abroiler 0agrowth performance 0amitochondrial ATP poduction 0arelative humidity 0achronic temperature1 aZHANG, Min-hong1 aFENG, Jing-hai1 aDIAO, Hua-jie0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2019 June, v. 18, no. 6 p.1321-1328dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

A. Mey. ex Trevir. (Cyperaceae). In 1833, Meyer described an unnamed variety of C. capillaris L. based on the gatherings of Ledebour from two localities (river Koksun and near Riddersk) in what is today the Kazakhstan Altai. In 1863, Treviranus validly published the name C. ledebouriana, referring to Meyer's unnamed variety and erroneously citing a gathering by Bunge “in summis alpibus Kuraicis”. A herbarium sheet at LE with barcode LE 01006839 was proposed as the (lecto)type of C. ledebouriana by Egorova in 1999 and this was confirmed by Grabovskaya-Borodina in 2012. In studying the original material, I found that sheet LE 01006839 in fact consists of three fragments belonging to two different gatherings and has an incorrect label. These two gatherings are further represented at LE by sheets LE 01006840 and LE 01006841, respectively. I argue that sheet LE 01006839 is not eligible as a type specimen because it consists of two gatherings. Instead, I designate here as the lectotype sheet LE 01006841, which contains well-preserved plants collected by Ledebour with mature utricles. Citation: Shekhovtsova I.

Despite great efforts toward understanding the nanoionic processes underlying resistive switching phenomena, comprehension of the effect of competing redox processes on device functionalities from the materials perspective still represents a challenge. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the concurring reactions of silver and moisture and their impact on the electronic properties of a single-crystalline ZnO nanowire (NW). A decrease in electronic conductivity due to surface adsorption of moisture is observed, whereas, at the same time, water molecules reduce the energy barrier for Ag⁺ ion migration on the NW surface, facilitating the conductive filament formation. By controlling the relative humidity, the ratio of intrinsic electronic conductivity and surface ionic conductivity can be tuned to modulate the device performance. The results achieved on a single-crystalline memristive model system shed new light on the dual nature of the mechanism of how moisture affects resistive switching behavior in memristive devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ananowires 3arelative humidity 3asilver 0aresistive switching 0amemristive devices 0amoisture 0aionics1 aRaffone, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5045-75331 aLuebben, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0218-01831 aBoarino, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1221-25911 aCicero, Giancarlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2920-98821 aValov, Ilia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0728-72141 aRicciardi, Carlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4703-79490 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Oct. 14, v. 12, no. 43 p.48773-48780dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c130203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015500171300001400326520071300340592002801053650001401081650002301095650001301118650001401131700001701145700001801162700002001180700001501200700002201215773009001237856008401327990002301411852000901434655001201443IND60092484720221118024403.0141103e20120430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009248472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2011.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Akihiro10aNOₓ storage/reduction over alkali-metal-nitrate impregnated titanate nanobelt catalysts and investigation of alkali metal cation migration using XPS  ap. 78-82.  aWe reported earlier that KNO₃- and Pt-impregnated potassium titanate nanobelt (KTN) catalysts exhibit high storage capacity and excellent catalytic cycles for NOₓ storage-reduction (NSR) reaction.

The XPS and XRD analyses of the NaNO₃-impregnated KTN catalyst showed that the migration of K⁺ from KTN bulk to the surface nitrate salt took place more predominantly than the migration of Na⁺. Probably for this reason, KNO₃-impregnated KTN materials exhibit the best performance for NSR catalytic cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3anitrates 3apotassium1 aShen, Weihua1 aEda, Tomonori1 aWatanabe, Ryō,1 aIto, Tetsu1 aNaitō, Shūichi,0 tCatalysis today.g2012 Apr. 30, v. 184, no. 1 p.78-82dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2011.10.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012400165520154900289592002801838650002101866650002301887650001701910650001501927650001601942650002601958650001801984650001302002650001402015650002102029650002102050650000702071650002802078650001502106650001702121653001402138653003702152653002802189653002502217700001702242700001802259700001702277700001702294773010702311856008702418852000902505655001202514IND60778170020221123042613.0220621e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077817002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1292692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Bin10aIntracellular transport of biomacromolecular drugs by a designed microgel capsule with pH/redox stimulus-responsiveness  aBiological macromolecular drugs usually have good efficacy and recognition performance. However, due to their large molecular weight and easy degradation/inactivation, general carriers are difficult to transport them into cell stably and safely. Here, a pH/redox dual-responsive microgel capsule was prepared for constructing a double-locked drug delivery system. Firstly, the pH-sensitive poly(ethyleneimine)-block-poly(2-(diisopropylamino ethylmethacry-late)-block-poly(ethyleneimine) triblock copolymers (PEI-PDPA-PEI) were synthesized for preparing polymer vesicles. The PEI layer was crosslinked by disulfide groups to finally obtain pH/redox dual-responsive microgel capsule, marked as P-VesicleGEL. Then, the P-VesicleGEL was used to encapsulate different types of drugs (doxorubicin hydrochloride, rhodamine, proteins, aptamer), and had a higher loading capacity than the corresponding polymer micelles for macromolecules. Compared with small molecules, P-VesicleGEL had much better "double-locked" function for macromolecules. I.e., only when the two “locks” were opened simultaneously the release could be triggered. Furtherly, cell experiments had proved that the P-VesicleGEL had excellent biocompatibility and cell transfection ability. It could not only effectively identify normal and cancer cells, but also transport biological drugs that were difficult to enter into cells by themselves. The microgel capsule designed here is expected to be applied for the intracellular delivery/release of biological macromolecular drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3adisulfides 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3aethyleneimine 3amicelles 3amicrogels 3amolecular weight 3aoligonucleotides 3apH 3aphysiological transport 3arhodamines 3atransfection 0aCopolymer 0aDual-responsive microgel capsule 0aIntracellular transport 0aDrug delivery system1 aZhang, Yuhua1 aChen, Miaoxin1 aXu, Shouhong1 aLiu, Honglai0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129269-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1292693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245011100175300001600286520087500302592002801177650000901205650001401214650001301228650001801241650003001259650001601289700002501305773010701330856005701437852000901494655001201503IND4468831720221119165531.0120907e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446883172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb05320.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHEEN, SHIOWSHUH10aParametric Analysis for the Freezing of Spheroidal or Finitely Cylindrical Objects with Volumetric Changes  ap. 543-549.  aParametric analyses were performed to examine heat transfer in freezing of spheroidal (including prolates and oblates) and finitely cylindrical foods through computerized simulation which considered volumetric changes.

Regression equations for freezing time estimation were developed through screening and central composite analyses and verified experimentally using a food simulator with physical properties similar to lean beef. Sensitivity analysis showed the convective surface heat transfer coefficient was the most significant factor affecting accuracy of calculated freezing time followed by operational temperatures, ther‐mophysical properties and food dimensions.

The droplet wetting scenarios were categorized into four types depending on the synergistic effect of surface energy and pattern size. The silicon (Si) microcavity surfaces (γSᵢ = 69.8 mJ/m²) and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated microcavity surfaces (γPTFE = 15.0 mJ/m²) displayed stable Wenzel and Cassie wetting states, respectively, irrespective of time. In contrast, diamond-like carbon (DLC)-coated (γDLC = 55.5 mJ/m²) and fluorinated diamond-like carbon (FDLC)-coated (γFDLC = 36.2 mJ/m²) surfaces demonstrated a time-dependent transition of wetting states. In particular, the DLC-coated surface showed random filling of microcavities at the earlier time point, while the FDLC-coated surface displayed directional filling of microcavities at the late stage of drop evaporation. Such dynamic wetting scenarios based on surface energy, in particular, the random and directional wetting transitions related to surface energy of nanocoatings have not been explored previously. Furthermore, the microscopic role of nanocoating in the wetting scenarios was analyzed by monitoring the time-dependent deformation and movement of the air–water interface (AWI) at individual cavities using the fluorescence interference-contrast (FLIC) technique. A coating-dependent depinning mechanism of the AWI was responsible for variable filling of cavities leading to time-dependent wetting scenarios. A capillary wetting model was used to relate this depinning event to the evaporation-induced internal flow within the droplet. Interestingly, FLIC analysis revealed that a hydrophilic nanocoating can induce microscopic hydrophobicity near the cavity edges leading to delayed and variable cavity filling. The surface energy-dependent classification of the wetting scenarios may help the design of novel evaporation-assisted thermodynamic and mass-transfer processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adeformation 3adroplets 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquid-air interface 3amass transfer 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3asilicon 3asynergism 3athermodynamics 0ananocoating 0adynamic wetting behavior 0awetting transition 0asurface energy 0ain situ fluorescence microscopy1 aKim, Hongnam,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0329-00291 aRyu, Yong-Sang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3222-42311 aYoon, Eui-Sung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5804-63760 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 03, v. 12, no. 35 p.39881-39891dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c106183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245009500169300001800264500001900282520186600301592002802167650002002195650001302215650001702228650001102245650001202256650002102268650001202289650001402301650001602315700001702331700002702348700002302375700002302398700002102421700002202442700006102464773013602525856008002661852000902741655001202750IND60711554020221121065207.0200928e20200825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071155402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c061092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuncan, Katelyn M.10aCoumarin Partitioning in Model Biological Membranes: Limitations of log P as a Predictor  ap. 8299-8308.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTime-resolved fluorescence measurements were used to quantify partitioning of three different 7-aminocoumarin derivatives into DPPC vesicle bilayers as a function of temperature. The coumarin derivatives were structurally equivalent except for the degree of substitution at the 7-amine position. Calculated log P (octanol: water partitioning) coefficients, a common indicator that correlates with bioconcentration, predict that the primary amine (coumarin 151 or C151) would experience a ∼40-fold partition enrichment in polar organic environments (log PC₁₅₁ = 1.6) while the tertiary amine’s (coumarin 152 or C152) concentration should be >500 times enhanced (log PC₁₅₂ = 2.7). Both values predict that partitioning into lipid membranes is energetically favorable. Time-resolved emission spectra from C151 in solutions containing DPPC vesicles showed that within detection limits, the solute remained in the aqueous buffer regardless of temperature and vesicle bilayer phase. C152 displayed a sharp uptake into DPPC bilayers as the temperature approached DPPC’s gel–liquid crystalline transition temperature, consistent with previously reported results ([J. Phys. Chem. B2017, 121, 4061−4070]). The secondary amine, synthesized specifically for these studies and dubbed C151.5 with a measured log P value of 1.9, partitioned into the bilayer’s polar head group with no pronounced temperature dependence. These experiments illustrate the limitations of using a gross descriptor of preferential solvation to describe solute partitioning into complex, heterogeneous systems having nanometer-scale dimensions. From a broader perspective, results presented in this work illustrate the need for more chemically informed tools for predicting a solute tendency for where and how much it will bioconcentrate within a biological membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3acoumarin 3afluorescence 3alipids 3aoctanol 3asecondary amines 3asolutes 3asolvation 3atemperature1 aCasey, Aoife1 aGobrogge, Christine A.1 aTrousdale, Rhys C.1 aPiontek, Stefan M.1 aCook, Matthew J.1 aSteel, William H.1 aWalker, Robert A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0754-62980 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 25, v. 124, no. 38 p.8299-8308dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c061093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245006300164300002000227520147500247592002801722650001501750650002301765650001601788650001301804650001301817650002101830650001301851650001601864650001901880650001601899700001701915700002101932773013601953856007402089852000902163655001202172IND60638927820221118055517.0190501e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063892782DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc04523e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarszałek, Tomasz,10aDesign directed self-assembly of donor–acceptor polymers  ap. 10938-10947.  aDonor–acceptor polymers with an alternating array of donor and acceptor moieties have gained particular attention during recent years as active components of organic electronics. By implementation of suitable subunits within the conjugated backbone, these polymers can be made either electron-deficient or -rich. Additionally, their band gap and light absorption can be precisely tuned for improved light-harvesting in solar cells. On the other hand, the polymer design can also be modified to encode the desired supramolecular self-assembly in the solid-state that is essential for an unhindered transport of charge carriers. This review focuses on three major factors playing a role in the assembly of donor–acceptor polymers on surfaces which are (1) nature, geometry and substitution position of solubilizing alkyl side chains, (2) shape of the conjugated polymer defined by the backbone curvature, and (3) molecular weight which determines the conjugation length of the polymer. These factors adjust the fine balance between attractive and repulsive forces and ensure a close polymer packing important for an efficient charge hopping between neighboring chains. On the microscopic scale, an appropriate domain formation with a low density of structural defects in the solution deposited thin film is crucial for the charge transport. The charge carrier transport through such thin films is characterized by field-effect transistors as basic electronic elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical reactions 3aelectronics 3ageometry 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3asolar cells 3asolubilization 3atransistors1 aLi, Mengmeng1 aPisula, Wojciech0 tChemical communications.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 52, no. 73 p.10938-10947dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6cc04523e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014500167300001600312520110900328592002801437650001601465650001201481650001601493650001901509650001801528650001501546650001501561650001901576650002001595650002101615653001501636653001001651653001201661653001301673653002901686700001201715700001801727773010701745856008701852852000901939655001201948IND60536628820221116141845.0190409e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053662882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.05.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yin-Hu10aMicroalgal growth with intracellular phosphorus for achieving high biomass growth rate and high lipid/triacylglycerol content simultaneously  ap. 374-381.  aNutrient deprivation is a commonly-used trigger for microalgal lipid accumulation, but its adverse impact on microalgal growth seems to be inevitable. In this study, Scenedesmus sp. LX1 was found to show similar physiological and biochemical variation under oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions during growth with intracellular phosphorus. Under both conditions microalgal chlorophyll content and photosynthesis activity was stable during this growth process, leading to significant increase of single cell weight and size. Therefore, while algal density growth rate dropped significantly to below 1.0×105cellsmL−1d−1 under oligotrophic condition, the biomass dry weight growth rate still maintained about 40mgL−1d−1. Meanwhile, the lipid content in biomass and triacylglycerols (TAGs) content in lipids increased significantly to about 35% and 65%, respectively. Thus, high biomass growth rate and high lipid/TAG content were achieved simultaneously at the late growth phase with intracellular phosphorus. Besides, microalgal biomass produced was rich in carbohydrate with low protein content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aeutrophication 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein content 3atriacylglycerols 0aMicroalgae 0aLipid 0aBiomass 0aBiofuels 0aIntracellular phosphorus1 aYu, Yin1 aHu, Hong-Ying0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Sept., v. 192 p.374-381dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.05.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012200171520143800293592002801731650001901759650002501778650001401803650002401817650002301841650001001864650001701874650000901891650001401900651001201914653001601926653002701942653002401969653001901993653002102012653001202033700002202045700002302067700001902090773012202109856008702231852000902318655001202327IND60778170320221123042604.0220621e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077817032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1292742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtemad, Sahand10aConformance control evaluation of the of cellulose nanocrystals based CO2 foams stabilized in synergy with surfactant  aUsing biomass-derived materials for oil production is not a new concept but using them to stabilize foam via synergistic interactions is new for oil production. There is a lack of research and technology showing the advantage of biomass-derived nanomaterials at reservoir conditions for CO₂ Enhanced oil recovery processes. Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) is an Alberta based wood-derived nanomaterial. In this work, we are testing the feasibility of CNC based CO₂ foam synergistically stabilized by CNC and surfactant. We first design a composition of CNC/surfactant for stable CO₂ foam on the concept of synergy between nanoparticles and surfactant. Then we evaluate the conformance control of CNC-enabled foam in dynamic tests and view how foam evolves over time using computed tomography imaging. Ultra-stable foam is achieved with surfactant concentration as low as 0.05 wt%. Foam potential in limiting the CO₂ pathways is shown and its conformance control ability is confirmed visually. This study demonstrates a cost-effective and simple way of surface modification by using a cationic surfactant via electrostatic interactions. Instead of bringing modified CNCs to the interface for the stabilization, the synergism between DTAB and native CNCs is exploited to obtain Pickering foams with superior stabilities. The results provide baseline information for other research on CNC based fluids for underground applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acationic surfactants 3acellulose 3acomputed tomography 3acost effectiveness 3afoams 3ananocrystals 3aoils 3asynergism 3aAlberta 0aSurfactants 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aCarbon dioxide foam 0aFoam stability 0aMobility control 0aSynergy1 aTelmadarreie, Ali1 aKantzas, Apostolos1 aBryant, Steven0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129274-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1292743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245012200127300001600249500001900265520075100284592002801035650001501063650002301078650001901101650001201120650001501132650001601147651001001163653001401173653001401187700001601201700001601217700001601233700001601249773013601265852000901401655001201410IND60705174720221119212600.0200908e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070517472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJani, J.J.10aEvaluation of Biocontrol Agents, Organic Amendments and Chemicals against Heterodera cajani Koshi infecting Pigeonpea  ap. 180-185.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn order to evaluate the effectiveness of biocontrol agents, organic amendments and chemicals against Heterodera cajani infecting pigeonpea, an experiment was conducted on farmer's field in Bharuch district of Gujarat (India) during three successive seasons (2007–08 to 2009–10).

The need to understand the molecular signatures of these fragile plant surfaces is illustrated with a model plant, Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don). Flat, thin layer chromatographic imprints of leaves/petals were imaged using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI MS), and the results were compared with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) of their extracts. Tandem mass spectrometry with DESI and ESI, in conjunction with database records, confirmed the molecular species. This protocol has been extended to other plants. Implications of this study in identifying varietal differences, toxic metabolite production, changes in metabolites during growth, pest/pathogen attack, and natural stresses are shown with illustrations. The possibility to image subtle features like eye color of petals, leaf vacuole, leaf margin, and veins is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3acolor 3acorolla 3adatabases 3adesorption 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3apathogens 3apests 3athin layer chromatography 3avacuoles 2aCatharanthusxchemistry 2aFlowersxchemistry 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 0amolecular imaging 0asurface-bound metabolites 0aelectrospray ionization (ESI) 0adesorption electrospray ionization (DESI) 0amass spectrometry (MS)1 aPradeep, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Aug. 07, v. 61, no. 31 p.7477-7487dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf40119983Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02664naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013900160500002000299520140100319592002801720650001501748650001001763650001501773650001301788650001801801650001701819650001801836650002501854650001401879650001601893650002001909650001801929650001601947650001601963700006001979773014302039856007502182852000902257655001202266IND60766686820221119211457.0220209e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076668682DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.162272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeb, Madhuparna10aRheological and mass transport characteristics of hydrocolloid incorporated multilayered wheat flour dough sheet (Khaja) during frying  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of the addition of hydrocolloids such as gum arabic and xanthan gum, as well as a mixture of gum arabic and xanthan gum on moisture and oil transport properties in deep fat‐fried multilayered wheat flour dough sheet (Khaja). The dynamic viscoelastic analysis of the dough showed that the hydrocolloid incorporated sample had a larger difference in the storage and loss modulus values, indicating that hydrocolloids had a synergistic effect on increasing the elastic property of the dough. The multilayered wheat flour dough sheet was deep fat‐fried in a fryer at a frying oil temperature of 180°C. Hydrocolloid inclusion reduced the moisture diffusivity of the product, and the moisture diffusivity of the hydrocolloid incorporated sample decreased from 4.60 × 10⁻⁹ to 3.32 × 10⁻⁹ m²/s. The sample containing the combination of gum arabic and xanthan gum reduces oil absorption by 20.13% compared to the control sample. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: Oil absorption in Khaja is influenced by the type of hydrocolloid, moisture content of the dough, frying duration, and temperature of frying. Hydrocolloid significantly affected the viscoelastic characteristics of the dough and reduced the hardness of the product. The dough containing a combination of xanthan gum and gum Arabic decreased oil absorption by around 20% in Khaja.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adough 3agum arabic 3ahardness 3ahydrocolloids 3aloss modulus 3amass transfer 3amoisture diffusivity 3asynergism 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity 3awater content 3awheat flour 3axanthan gum1 aDash, Kshirod K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5520-214X0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.e16227-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.162273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012100172300001400293520115100307592002801458650003001486650001301516650001901529650001901548650001101567650001101578650002001589650001501609650001101624650001101635650001901646650001601665700002801681700002901709773010201738856008101840852000901921655001201930IND60573812320221117213827.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057381232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-016-0294-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazos, Theocharis T.10aMetabolism of xenobiotics by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: Phenol degradation under conditions affecting photosynthesis  ap. 31-40.  aIn the present work, the biodegradation of phenol by axenic cultures of the unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was investigated. Biodegradation proved to be a dynamic bioenergetic process, affected by changes in the culture conditions. Microalgae biodegraded defined amounts of phenol, as a result of the induced stress caused at high concentrations, despite the fact that this process proved to be energy demanding and thus affected growth of the culture. High levels of biodegradation were observed both in the absence of an alternative carbon source and in the presence of acetate as a carbon source. Biodegradation of phenol by Chlamydomonas proved to be an aerobic, photoregulated process. This is the first time that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used for bioremediation purposes. This study has demonstrated that the most important factor in the biodegradation of phenol is the selection of the appropriate culture conditions (presence or absence of alternative carbon source, light intensity, and oxygen availability) that provide the best bioenergetic balance among growth, induced stress, and biodegradation of phenol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aacetates 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3aenergy 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3aphotosynthesis 3axenobiotics1 aKokarakis, Emmanouel J.1 aGhanotakis, Demetrios F.0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2017 Jan., v. 131, no. 1 p.31-40dSpringer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-016-0294-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245017700166520125600343592002801599650002901627650002801656650001201684650002201696650001001718650003101728650001001759650001401769650001801783650002201801650002201823653002701845653003101872653003001903653003701933653003501970700001302005700002002018773010702038856008702145852000902232655001202241IND60778170520221123032218.0220621e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077817052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1292772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiang10aHybrid hydrogels based on polyvinyl alcohol, branched polyethylenimine, polydopamine, and phosphonium-based ionic liquid for effective synergetic antibacterial applications  aExploring effective and sustainable antibacterial agents to combat the bacterial contamination of cultural-heritage objects is an important issue. In this work, inspired by the broad applications of hydrogels in the biomedical field, a hybrid hydrogel was fabricated from the supramolecular assembly of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), branched polyethylenimine (PEI), polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs), and a phosphonium-based ionic liquid (IL), which was denoted as PVA-PDA@PEI-IL. Branched polycationic PEI interacted electrostatically with the negatively charged bacterial membranes, ultimately resulting in cell lysis and death. The released phosphonium-based IL disrupted the bacterial membranes and subsequently eradicated adhered and nearby bacteria. Although the PDA NPs displayed a high photothermal conversion efficiency, local hyperthermia did not appear to enhance the antibacterial activity of the prepared hydrogel. In addition, we also verified the significant antibacterial activity of the resulting hydrogel against the bacterial biofilms that adhered to the different substrate material surfaces. Therefore, our work presented the possibility of potential applications of these antibacterial hydrogels for cultural heritage conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial contamination 3abiofilm 3acultural heritage 3adeath 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afever 3ahydrogels 3aionic liquids 3apolyethyleneimine 3apolyvinyl alcohol 0aAntibacterial hydrogel 0aPolydopamine nanoparticles 0aBranched polyethylenimine 0aSynergistic antibacterial effect 0aCultural heritage conservation1 aWu, Chao1 aZhang, Bingjian0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129277-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1292773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245009400205300002000299520152000319592002801839650002101867650001901888650001001907650001301917650001901930650001701949650002101966650001801987650002802005650001902033650001302052650001602065650001302081650001402094650001702108653003202125653001602157653003102173700002502204700005902229700002102288700002202309700006702331700001902398700002702417700005702444700005702501700006402558773014202622856007802764852000902842655001202851IND60709101120221119110044.0200902e20200806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070910112DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c106992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBesford, Quinn A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1779-917610aProtein Component of Oyster Glycogen Nanoparticles: An Anchor Point for Functionalization  ap. 38976-38988.  aBiosourced nanoparticles have a range of desirable properties for therapeutic applications, including biodegradability and low immunogenicity. Glycogen, a natural polysaccharide nanoparticle, has garnered much interest as a component of advanced therapeutic materials. However, functionalizing glycogen for use as a therapeutic material typically involves synthetic approaches that can negatively affect the intrinsic physiological properties of glycogen. Herein, the protein component of glycogen is examined as an anchor point for the photopolymerization of functional poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymers. Oyster glycogen (OG) nanoparticles partially degrade to smaller spherical particles in the presence of protease enzymes, reflecting a population of surface-bound proteins on the polysaccharide. The grafting of PNIPAM to the native protein component of OG produces OG-PNIPAM nanoparticles of ∼45 nm in diameter and 6.2 MDa in molecular weight. PNIPAM endows the nanoparticles with temperature-responsive aggregation properties that are controllable and reversible and that can be removed by the biodegradation of the protein. The OG-PNIPAM nanoparticles retain the native biodegradability of glycogen. Whole blood incubation assays revealed that the OG-PNIPAM nanoparticles have a low cell association and inflammatory response similar to that of OG. The reported strategy provides functionalized glycogen nanomaterials that retain their inherent biodegradability and low immune cell association.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3ablood 3aglycogen 3aimmunogenicity 3ainflammation 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aphotochemical reactions 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3asynthesis 3atherapeutics 0apoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) 0abiopolymers 0atemperature responsiveness1 aWeiss, Alessia C.

In experiment 1, evaluating the nutritional parameters, four rumen-cannulated Nellore bulls (BW = 410 kg) were used. In experiment 2, evaluating animal performance, 48 Nellore bulls (BW = 358 kg) were used. The treatments were as follows: mineral supplement (MS) alone and MS plus protein-energy supplement provided 3×, 5× and 7×/week. Supplementation frequency did not affect (P > 0.05) intake and digestibility. Average daily gain was greater (P < 0.001) to supplementation compared with MS. The supplementation 5×/week resulted in greater weight gain per hectare (9.24) and higher economic returns during the study period (1.64%) compared to other supplementations. Supplementation 5×/week increased animal performance and positively influenced economic returns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef cattle 3abulls 3acosts and returns 3adigestibility 3agrazing 3agrowth performance 3anutritive value 3aweight gain 3awet season1 aZervoudakis, JoanisTilemahos1 aDe Paula, NelcinoFrancisco1 aHatamoto-Zervoudakis, LucianaKeiko1 ada Rosa e Silva, PedroIvo José Lopes1 ado Nascimento Matos, NúbiaBezerra0 tTropical animal health and production.g2018 Mar., v. 50, no. 3 p.495-501dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-017-1458-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012300171500001400294520093400308592002801242650002101270650001601291650001401307650001301321650001101334650001401345650001901359650003001378650003101408650001001439700002201449700001801471700002201489700002201511700002101533700001601554700002501570700002101595773012801616856008501744852000901829655001201838IND60721704520221120190258.0201224e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072170452DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81218632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkayama, Kaori 10aCorrelation between Human Papillomavirus Codetection Profiles and Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia in Japanese Women  aNAL-light  aHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection is thought to be strongly associated with the precarcinomatous state cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma. To accurately assess the correlation between HPV detection profiles and CIN, the uniplex E6/E7 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used. We detected HPV (37 genotypes) in 267 CIN cases. The detection of a single high-risk HPV genotype occurred in 69.7% of CIN1 and worse than CIN1 (CIN1+) cases whereas other types were detected in 11.6% of cases. Codetection of high-risk HPV genotypes occurred in 4.9% of CIN1+ cases. The high-risk genotype HPV16 was the most frequently detected genotype in CIN1+ lesions; the genotype HPV34 (not a high-risk type) was detected in some CIN3 cases. Furthermore, HPV codetection may not be associated with CIN grades. These results suggest that various HPV genotypes are associated with CIN across all analyzed cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3acorrelation 3adetection 3agenotype 3ahumans 3ainfection 3amicroorganisms 3apolymerase chain reaction 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3awomen1 aKimura, Hirokazu 1 aTeruya, Koji 1 aIshii, Yasuyoshi 1 aFujita, Kiyotaka 1 aFujii, Masahiko 1 aOda, Mizue 1 aSasagawa, Toshiyuki 1 aOkodo, Mitsuaki 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81218633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245011600172300002000288520103200308592002801340650001101368650003601379650001701415650001501432650001901447650001901466650001401485650000901499650001301508650001701521650002201538650003301560650001301593650001601606653002701622653002701649653003101676653003101707653002201738700002201760700001601782700005401798700001701852700005601869773014201925856007802067852000902145655001202154IND60709101220221119152034.0200902e20200803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070910122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c107552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Muhammad Naoshad10aHighly Ordered Nanoporous Carbon Scaffold with Controllable Wettability as the Microporous Layer for Fuel Cells  ap. 39215-39226.  aWe introduce a novel self-standing, nanoporous carbon scaffold (NCS, 25 μm thick), with an ordered inverse opal pore structure (∼85 nm pore) as a microporous layer (MPL) in a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. Unlike previous studies, through chemical functionalization of the pore surfaces, the wettability of the MPL is controllably modified without altering the pore structure. Ex situ environmental scanning electron microscopy experiments revealed water sorption in the hydrophilic NCS under moderate relative humidity (RH) conditions but not in the hydrophobic NCS, wherein water condensation on the surface was noted only at high RH. The influence of structure and wettability of different MPLs on cell performance was gleaned from steady-state cell polarization behavior. For cells operated under dry conditions (≤80% RH), the limiting current for cells with a hydrophilic NCS MPL was the highest while that for cells with a hydrophobic NCS MPL was the lowest regardless of the level of water saturation (RH).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acondensation (phase transition) 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananopores 3aopal 3apolymers 3aporous media 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption 3awettability 0aordered pore structure 0acontrolled wettability 0aoxygen and water transport 0ananoporous carbon scaffold 0amicroporous layer1 aShrivastava, Udit1 aAtwa, Marwa1 aLi, Xiaoan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3022-34381 aBirss, Viola1 aKaran, Kunal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5432-80500 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 03, v. 12, no. 35 p.39215-39226dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c107553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013100174300001800305520156500323592002801888650000801916650001801924650001301942650001101955650001501966650000901981650003001990650001702020700002102037773011002058856008602168852000902254655001202263IND60567000020221118082234.0170418e20170418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056700002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b002402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKline, Margaret C.,10aEvaluating Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction for the Quantification of Human Genomic DNA: Lifting the Traceability Fog  ap. 4648-4654.  aDigital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) end point platforms directly estimate the number of DNA target copies per reaction partition, λ, where the partitions are fixed-location chambers (cdPCR) or aqueous droplets floating in oil (ddPCR). For use in the certification of target concentration in primary calibrant certified reference materials (CRMs), both λ and the partition volume, V, must be metrologically traceable to some accessible reference system, ideally, the International System of Units (SI). The fixed spatial distribution of cdPCR chambers enables real-time monitoring of PCR amplification. Analysis of the resulting reaction curves enables validation of the critical dPCR assumptions that are essential for establishing the SI traceability of λ. We know of no direct method for validating these assumptions for ddPCR platforms. The manufacturers of the cdPCR and ddPCR systems available to us do not provide traceable partition volume specifications. Our colleagues at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a reliable method for determining ddPCR droplet volume and have demonstrated that different ddPCR reagents yield droplets of somewhat different size. Thus, neither dPCR platform by itself provides metrologically traceable estimates of target concentration. We show here that evaluating split samples with both cdPCR and ddPCR platforms can transfer the λ traceability characteristics of a cdPCR assay to its ddPCR analogue, establishing fully traceable ddPCR estimates of CRM target concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acertification 3adroplets 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aoils 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atraceability1 aDuewer, David L.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Apr. 18, v. 89, no. 8 p.4648-4654dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.7b002403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007300170300001600243520096700259592002801226650002001254650001101274650001601285650002601301650001401327650001501341650002001356650001501376650001101391650001601402650001601418653001201434653002101446653002401467653001601491653001401507700002001521773010701541856008701648852000901735655001201744IND60536629220221116141933.0190409e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053662922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.05.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerber, Mandy10aDensity of biogas digestate depending on temperature and composition  ap. 172-176.  aDensity is one of the most important physical properties of biogas digestate to ensure an optimal dimensioning and a precise design of biogas plant components like stirring devices, pumps and heat exchangers. In this study the density of biogas digestates with different compositions was measured using pycnometers at ambient pressure in a temperature range from 293.15 to 313.15K. The biogas digestates were taken from semi-continuous experiments, in which the marine microalga Nannochloropsis salina, corn silage and a mixture of both were used as feedstocks. The results show an increase of density with increasing total solid content and a decrease with increasing temperature. Three equations to calculate the density of biogas digestate were set up depending on temperature as well as on the total solid content, organic composition and elemental composition, respectively. All correlations show a relative deviation below 1% compared to experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3abiogas 3acorn silage 3aelemental composition 3aequations 3afeedstocks 3aheat exchangers 3amicroalgae 3amixing 3apycnometers 3atemperature 0aDensity 0aBiogas digestate 0aTotal solid content 0aComposition 0aFermenter1 aSchneider, Nico0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Sept., v. 192 p.172-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.05.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01692naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014100153300001800294520070200312592002801014650001201042650003601054650001401090650002301104650001201127650001401139700002001153773013401173856007401307852000901381655001201390IND60638928320221118055438.0190501e20160726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063892832DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc04537e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Feng10aRuthenium(0)-catalyzed hydroarylation of alkynes via ketone-directed C–H functionalization using in situ-generated ruthenium complexes  ap. 9715-9718.  aA versatile method for the Ru(0)-catalyzed hydroarylation of alkynes using weakly-coordinating ketones enabled by the in situ generation of a Ru(0) catalyst from an air-stable, inexpensive and user-friendly Ru(ii) precatalyst is reported for the first time.

P.10aWatermelon Juice: Potential Functional Drink for Sore Muscle Relief in Athletes  ap. 7522-7528.  al-Citrulline is an excellent candidate to reduce muscle soreness, and watermelon is a fruit rich in this amino acid. This study investigated the potential of watermelon juice as a functional drink for athletes. An in vitro study of intestinal absorption of l-citrulline in Caco-2 cells was performed using unpasteurized (NW), pasteurized (80 °C for 40 s) watermelon juice (PW) and, as control, a standard of l-citrulline. l-citrulline bioavailability was greater when it was contained in a matrix of watermelon and when no heat treatment was applied. In the in vivo experiment (maximum effort test in a cycloergometer), seven athletes were supplied with 500 mL of natural watermelon juice (1.17 g of l-citrulline), enriched watermelon juice (4.83 g of l-citrulline plus 1.17 g from watermelon), and placebo. Both watermelon juices helped to reduce the recovery heart rate and muscle soreness after 24 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3acitrulline 3aheart rate 3aheat treatment 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aintestinal absorption 3ajuices 3awatermelons 2aAthletes 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aBiological Availability 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aCitrullinexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCitrullusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFruitxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFunctional Foodxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMusclesxphysiology 2aYoung Adult 0al-citrulline 0abioavailability 0acellular transport 0aanaerobic performance 0aCaco-2 cell 0apasteurization 0acellular absorption1 aAlacid, Fernando1 aCarrasco, María1 aMartínez, Ignacio,1 aAguayo, Encarna0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Aug. 07, v. 61, no. 31 p.7522-7528dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf400964r3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02880naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010300171300001400274520136900288592002801657650001501685650001001700650001901710650001701729650001001746650001101756650002001767650001701787650001201804650001801816650001401834650001801848650001501866650002601881650002101907650000901928650001701937650001801954650002401972650001301996650001302009700002202022700001802044700002202062700002202084700002702106700002302133773008702156856008602243852000902329655001202338IND60095681020221122222426.0141104e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009568102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimoda, Asako10aDual crosslinked hydrogel nanoparticles by nanogel bottom-up method for sustained-release delivery  ap. 38-44.  aPolysaccharide–PEG hybrid nanogels (CHPOA–PEGSH) crosslinked by both covalent ester bonds and physical interactions were prepared by the reaction of a thiol-modified poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGSH) with acryloyl-modified cholesterol-bearing pullulan (CHPOA). Experimental parameters, including CHPOA concentration, the degree of acryloyl substitution of CHPOA, and the initial amounts of CHPOA and PEGSH, were modified in order to assess their effect on the size of the nanogels (50–150nm) and on their degradation kinetics, monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) chromatography. Rhodamine-labeled nanogels were injected intravenously into mice and their concentration in blood was determined by a fluorescence assay as a function of post-injection time. The elimination half-life (t₁/₂) of CHPOA–PEGSH nanoparticles was about 15-fold longer (18h) than that of CHP nanogels (1.2h). The half-life enhancement of CHPOA–PEGSH was attributed to the presence of the crosslinker PEG chains, which prevent non-specific protein adsorption, and to the slow hydrolysis kinetics of the crosslinking esters in the biological milieu. The hybrid CHPOA–PEGSH nanogels are expected to be useful as injectable nanocarriers for drugs and proteins, in view of their low surface fouling and slow hydrolysis rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ablood 3achromatography 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3aesters 3aethylene glycol 3afluorescence 3afouling 3afractionation 3ahalf life 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrolysis 3aintravenous injection 3alight scattering 3amice 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene glycol 3aproteins 3apullulan1 aSawada, Shin-ichi1 aKano, Arihiro1 aMaruyama, Atsushi1 aMoquin, Alexandre1 aWinnik, Françoise M.,1 aAkiyoshi, Kazunari0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 99 p.38-44dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01641naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245004600172300001600218500002000234520052300254592002800777650002400805650001600829650002200845650001400867650001000881650001700891650002500908650002200933650002300955650001700978650001900995651001301014773014201027852000901169856008901178655001201267IND4369724120221122043538.0200107e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436972412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8276.2005.00728.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoyle, Barry T.10aAggregation over Firms under Mean Scaling  ap. 366-377.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper analyzes aggregation over firms assuming mean scaling, i.e., the relative distribution of micro variables is independent of the distribution of the aggregates.

The mean scaling hypothesis is not rejected using annual time‐series data on wheat production for crop districts in Manitoba.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3agrain crops 3acosts and returns 3aequations 3awheat 3acase studies 3atime series analysis 3aTriticum aestivum 3aeconometric models 3acooperatives 3amicroeconomics 3aManitoba0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2005 May, v. 87, no. 2 p.366-377dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8276.2005.00728.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02875naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011800176500001400294520143600308592002801744650002601772650002601798650002201824650001801846650001001864650001001874650001601884650002501900650001001925650001501935650001101950650001501961650001501976650002001991650001202011650001102023650001602034700002302050700001902073700002602092700002002118700003302138773012802171856008502299852000902384655001202393IND60721704920221120182312.0201224e20201219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072170492DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81220372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelo, Aryse  Martins10aAspergillosis, Avian Species and the One Health Perspective: The Possible Importance of Birds in Azole Resistance  aNAL-light  aThe One Health context considers health based on three pillars: humans, animals, and environment. This approach is a strong ally in the surveillance of infectious diseases and in the development of prevention strategies. Aspergillus spp. are fungi that fit substantially in this context, in view of their ubiquity, as well as their importance as plant pathogens, and potentially fatal pathogens for, particularly, humans and avian species. In addition, the emergence of azole resistance, mainly in Aspergillus fumigatus sensu stricto, and the proven role of fungicides widely used on crops, reinforces the need for a multidisciplinary approach to this problem. Avian species are involved in short and long distance travel between different types of landscapes, such as agricultural fields, natural environments and urban environments. Thus, birds can play an important role in the dispersion of Aspergillus, and of special concern, azole-resistant strains. In addition, some bird species are particularly susceptible to aspergillosis. Therefore, avian aspergillosis could be considered as an environmental health indicator. In this review, aspergillosis in humans and birds will be discussed, with focus on the presence of Aspergillus in the environment. We will relate these issues with the emergence of azole resistance on Aspergillus. These topics will be therefore considered and reviewed from the “One Health” perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aOne Health initiative 3aagricultural land 3aaspergillosis 3abirds 3acrops 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental health 3afungi 3afungicides 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3aplant pathogens 3astrains 3atravel 3aurban areas1 aStevens, David A.,1 aTell, Lisa A.,1 aVeríssimo, Cristina 1 aSabino, Raquel 1 aXavier, Melissa  Orzechowski0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Dec. 19, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81220373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015500171520111100326592002801437650001501465650001101480650001801491650001801509650001901527650001001546650001001556650000901566650001901575650001401594650001501608650001601623650001601639653001901655653002501674653001101699653001901710700001601729700001601745700001501761700001901776700001701795700001701812773010701829856008701936852000902023655001202032IND60778171220221120050613.0220621e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077817122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1292982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Shuaishuai10aPreparation of 3D superhydrophobic porous g-C3N4 nanosheets@carbonized kapok fiber composites for oil/water separation and treating organic pollutants  aThe diffusion of oil and organic pigments has become a serious environmental pollution problem. The combination of superhydrophobic and photocatalysis is expected to provide an effective, economical and simple solution to this problem. In this paper, a kind of superhydrophobic biomass-based carbon composites bearing a hierarchically structured surface were prepared through direct carbonization of deep eutectic solvents modified porous graphitic nitride (g-C₃N₄) nanosheets@kapok fiber composites (CNS/CKF) under low temperature of 350 °C. The results show that the CNS/CKF composites exhibit outstanding superhydrophobicity (with water contact angle of 162.2°) and process high adsorption capacity up to 28.3–58.1 times its self-weight for a series of oils and organic solvents. The CNS/CKF exhibited excellent visible-light photocatalytic performance, stability and reliability in the degradation of rhodamine b (RhB) solution, and its photocatalytic mechanism was discussed. This work sheds light on combining photocatalysis with special wettability for developing multifunctional materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acontact angle 3ahydrophobicity 3akapok 3alight 3aoils 3aphotocatalysis 3apollution 3arhodamines 3atemperature 3awettability 0aBiomass carbon 0aOil/water separation 0aG-C3N4 0aPhotocatalysis1 aXu, Minjing1 aZhao, Zhuzi1 aPan, Junli1 aZhao, Songjian1 aXue, Jinjuan1 aYe, Zhaolian0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129298-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1292983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245017200205300002000377520205300397592002802450650001102478650001502489650001302504650001702517650001502534653002602549653002702575653002102602653002902623653002202652653002202674653001502696700002102711700001802732700002002750700002502770700006002795700005702855700006002912773014202972856007803114852000903192655001203201IND60709101620221119152101.0200902e20200821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070910162DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c108342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmeyama, Tomokazu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4145-578410aEfficient Exciton Diffusion in Micrometer-Sized Domains of Nanographene-Based Nonfullerene Acceptors with Long Exciton Lifetimes in Blend Films with Conjugated Polymer  ap. 39236-39244.  aPhase-separated structures in photoactive layers composed of electron donors and acceptors in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) generally exert a profound impact on the device performance. In this study, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) where a heteronanographene central core was furnished with branched alkoxy chains of different lengths, TACIC-EH, TACIC-BO, and TACIC-HD, were prepared to adjust the aggregation tendency and systematically probe the relationships of film structures with photophysical and photovoltaic properties. The side-chain length showed negligible effects on the absorption properties and energy levels of TACICs. In addition, regardless of the chain length, all TACIC films exhibited characteristically long singlet exciton lifetimes (1330–2330 ps) compared to those in solution (≤220 ps). Using a conjugated polymer donor, PBDB-T, the best OPV performance was achieved with TACIC-BO that contained medium-length chains, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.92%. TACIC-HD with the longest chains showed deteriorated electron mobility due to the long insulating alkoxy groups. Therefore, the PBDB-T:TACIC-HD-based device revealed a low charge collection efficiency and PCE (8.21%) relative to the PBDB-T:TACIC-BO-based device, but their film morphologies were analogous. Meanwhile, TACIC-EH with the shortest chains showed low solubility and formed micrometer-sized large aggregates in the blend film with PBDB-T. Although the charge collection efficiency of PBDB-T:TACIC-EH was lower than that of PBDB-T:TACIC-BO, the efficiencies of exciton diffusion to the donor–acceptor interface were sufficiently high (>98%) owing to the elongated singlet exciton lifetime of TACIC-EH. The PCE of the PBDB-T:TACIC-EH-based device remained moderate (7.10%). Therefore, TACICs with the long singlet exciton lifetimes in the films provide a clear guideline for NFAs with low sensitivity of OPV device performance to the blend film structures, which is advantageous for large-scale OPV production with high reproducibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aguidelines 3apolymers 3asolar energy 3asolubility 0aorganic photovoltaics 0anonfullerene acceptors 0aphase separation 0asinglet exciton lifetime 0aexciton diffusion 0athienoazacoronene 0aside chain1 aIgarashi, Kensho1 aSasada, Daiki1 aIshida, Keiichi1 aKoganezawa, Tomoyuki1 aOhtani, Shunsuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8669-10891 aTanaka, Kazuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6571-70861 aImahori, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3506-56080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 21, v. 12, no. 35 p.39236-39244dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c108343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009800172300001600270500002000286520062400306592002800930596004400958596001301002650002301015650001501038650002401053650001801077650001701095650001401112650002001126650001801146650002501164650000901189650002301198650002301221650001801244700002001262700001901282773014201301852000901443856008901452655001201541IND4369724420221122043502.0200107e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436972442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8276.2005.00729.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiesel, Kristin10aDo Voluntary Biotechnology Labels Matter to the Consumer?

Retail fluid milk tracks one of the first biotechnology products approved, is fairly standardized and ubiquitous, and allows for cross‐sectional differentiation between labeled and unlabeled products and between conventional and organic brands. The results indicate that voluntary labeling increases the demand for recombinant bovine growth hormone free milk.

Mutations in genes encoding for the SMC contractile apparatus proteins are associated with aortic diseases, such as thoracic aortic aneurysms. Measuring SMC contraction in vitro is challenging, especially in a high-throughput manner, which is essential for screening patient material. Currently available methods are not suitable for this purpose. This paper presents a novel method based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). First, an explant protocol is described to isolate patient-specific human primary SMCs from aortic biopsies and patient-specific human primary dermal fibroblasts for the study of aortic aneurysms. Next, a detailed description of a new contraction method is given to measure the contractile response of these cells, including the subsequent analysis and suggestion for comparing different groups. This method can be used to study the contraction of adherent cells in the context of translational (cardiovascular) studies and patient and drug screening studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaorta 3adrugs 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3apatients 3asmooth muscle 3avasoconstriction 3avasodilation1 aRombouts, Karlijn B.1 aYeung, Kak Khee0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 Feb. 15, , no. 180 p.e63122-e63122dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/631223Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63122/isolation-primary-patient-specific-aortic-smooth-muscle-cells  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245012100169300002000290500001900310520106600329592002801395650002601423650002101449650001201470650002301482700001701505700001901522700001701541700005901558773013801617856008001755852000901835655001201844IND60711555020221121054418.0200928e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071155502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c038732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuang, Cheng-Hsun10aRedox-Hopping and Electrochemical Behaviors of Metal–Organic Framework Thin Films Fabricated by Various Approaches  ap. 20854-20863.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, spatially dispersed redox-active iridium sites are installed on the nodes of a zirconium-based metal–organic framework (MOF), UiO-66, utilizing a self-limiting solution-phase solvothermal deposition in MOF technique. Thin films of the resulting iridium-decorated UiO-66 are then fabricated on conducting substrates by three distinct approaches: drop-casting, spin-coating, and bottom-up solvothermal methods. The redox-hopping and electrochemical behaviors of the iridium-decorated UiO-66 thin films fabricated by distinct methods are investigated. The findings indicate that the rate of charge hopping in these redox-active MOF thin films is not significantly affected by both the method for fabricating thin films and the film thickness. However, remarkably distinct electrochemical behaviors are observed for the iridium-decorated UiO-66 thin films fabricated by different approaches, which suggests that the approach for fabricating MOF thin films may play an important role in the performances of the targeted electrochemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3airidium 3aphysical chemistry1 aLi, Jun-Hong1 aChen, Yu-Chuan1 aWang, Yi-Sen1 aKung, Chung-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5739-15030 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 124, no. 38 p.20854-20863dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c038733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010100160300002000261520154800281592002801829650002801857650003401885650001101919650001101930650001201941650002101953650001701974650001201991650001402003650001602017650001102033653003402044653003002078653001602108653002702124653003802151653002602189700001802215700001602233700001902249700005402268773014202322856007802464852000902542655001202551IND60709101820221119152130.0200902e20200804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070910182DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c108512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Dandan10aPerovskite/Organic Semiconductor-Based Photonic Synaptic Transistor for Artificial Visual System  ap. 39487-39495.  aArtificial visual system with information sensing, processing, and memory function is promoting the development of artificial intelligence techniques. Photonic synapse as an essential component can enhance the visual information processing efficiency owing to the high propagation speed, low latency, and large bandwidth. Herein, photonic synaptic transistors based on organic semiconductor poly[2,5-(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-(2,5-di(thien-2-yl)thieno [3,2-b]thiophene)] (DPPDTT) and perovskite CsPbBr₃ quantum dots are fabricated by a simple solution process. The device can simulate fundamental synaptic behaviors, including excitatory postsynaptic current, pair-pulse facilitation, the transition of short-term memory to long-term memory, and “learning experience” behavior. Combining the advantages of the high photosensitivity of perovskites and relatively high conductivity of DPPDTT, the device can exhibit excellent synaptic performances at a low voltage of −0.2 V. Even under an ultralow operation voltage of −0.0005 V, the device can still show obvious synaptic responses. Tunable synaptic integration behaviors including “AND” and “OR” light logic functions can be realized. An artificial visual system is successfully emulated by illuminating the synaptic arrays employing light of different densities. Therefore, low-voltage synaptic devices based on organic semiconductor and CsPbBr₃ quantum dots with a simple fabrication technique present high potential to mimic human visual memory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aelectric potential difference 3ahumans 3amemory 3aphotons 3aphotosensitivity 3aquantum dots 3asynapse 3athiophene 3atransistors 3avision 0aphotonic synaptic transistors 0aartificial visual systems 0aperovskites 0aorganic semiconductors 0alow electrical energy consumption 0alight logic functions1 aZhang, Junyao1 aDai, Shilei1 aZhang, Jianhua1 aHuang, Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2873-77040 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 04, v. 12, no. 35 p.39487-39495dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c108513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245008700203300002000290506007600310520157500386592002801961506003701989650000802026650003202034650001702066650002002083650001902103650001902122650001502141650001402156650002502170650001602195700002002211700001502231700001702246700001302263773013402276856007502410852000902485655001202494IND60538717520221207131639.0160815e20121114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053871752DNAL7 a10.1021/ja30903022doi7 aPMC35351812pmcid7 a231014372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLieberman, Kate R.10aDynamics of the Translocation Step Measured in Individual DNA Polymerase Complexes  ap. 18816-18823.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aComplexes formed between the bacteriophage phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP) and DNA fluctuate between the pre-translocation and post-translocation states on the millisecond time scale. These fluctuations can be directly observed with single-nucleotide precision in real-time ionic current traces when individual complexes are captured atop the α-hemolysin nanopore in an applied electric field. We recently quantified the equilibrium across the translocation step as a function of applied force (voltage), active-site proximal DNA sequences, and the binding of complementary dNTP. To gain insight into the mechanism of this step in the DNAP catalytic cycle, in this study, we have examined the stochastic dynamics of the translocation step. The survival probability of complexes in each of the two states decayed at a single exponential rate, indicating that the observed fluctuations are between two discrete states. We used a robust mathematical formulation based on the autocorrelation function to extract the forward and reverse rates of the transitions between the pre-translocation state and the post-translocation state from ionic current traces of captured phi29 DNAP–DNA binary complexes. We evaluated each transition rate as a function of applied voltage to examine the energy landscape of the phi29 DNAP translocation step. The analysis reveals that active-site proximal DNA sequences influence the depth of the pre-translocation and post-translocation state energy wells and affect the location of the transition state along the direction of the translocation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aactive sites 3aautocorrelation 3abacteriophages 3aelectric field 3ahemolysins 3ananopores 3anucleotide sequences 3aprobability1 aDahl, Joseph M.1 aMai, Ai H.1 aAkeson, Mark1 aHongyun,0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Nov. 14, v. 134, no. 45 p.18816-18823dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja30903023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245010900176300001800285500001500303520104000318592002801358650001701386650001101403650001601414650001001430650001301440650002301453650001601476650001801492650001901510650004001529650004101569650003901610650002601649650003501675650004201710650004201752650007301794650007401867650007001941650002502011653001902036653001402055653001902069653002502088700001202113700001502125773013302140852000902273856007502282655001202357IND4471214920221119170104.0160905e20130807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447121492DNAL7 a238555862pmid7 a10.1021/jf402174f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chenguang10aEffects of Sulfur Fertilization on the Accumulation of Health-Promoting Phytochemicals in Radish Sprouts  ap. 7552-7559.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of sulfur fertilization on the growth profile, the contents of glucosinolates, anthocyanins, vitamin C, carotenoids, chlorophylls, total phenolics, and the FRAP value in radish seeds and sprouts were investigated. The concentrations of glucosinolates and antioxidants in sprouts were strongly influenced by the process of germination. Sulfur fertilization induced significant increases in the contents of individual glucosinolates, carotenoids, chlorophylls, and total phenolics. The phenolic contents in sprouts cultivated using 20, 60, or 100 mg/L sulfate were 20.7%, 40.4%, and 40.8% higher, respectively, than those of 7-day-old control sprouts. No detectable effects were observed on the contents of 4-methoxy-glucobrassicin and vitamin C. In addition, the accumulation of anthocyanins in 7-day-old sprouts decreased by 14.8–39.3% upon sulfur fertilization. These findings indicated that the application of sulfur fertilization has the potential to enhance the levels of health-promoting compounds in radish sprouts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3asulfur 3agermination 3aseeds 3aradishes 3aphenolic compounds 3acarotenoids 3aascorbic acid 3aglucosinolates 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aAscorbic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCarotenoidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFertilizersxanalysis 2aPhenolsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhytochemicalsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aRaphanusxchemistryxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSeedlingsxchemistryxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxchemistryxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSulfurxpharmacology 0aphytochemicals 0aphenolics 0aradish sprouts 0aantioxidant activity1 aZhu, Yi1 aLuo, Yunbo0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Aug. 07, v. 61, no. 31 p.7552-7559dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf402174f3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02280naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013400164300001100298520113500309592002801444650001501472650001301487650002001500650002901520650002401549650002801573650002501601650002201626700001701648700001801665700001701683773013901700856008201839852000901921655001201930IND60573813220221117213804.0180619e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057381322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-3162-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Fengmei10aAutomated Determination of Chromium (VI) in Tannery Effluent Using Flow Injection Analysis with an Optical Flow Cell and Detector  ap. 32.  aDetermination of hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) in tannery effluent is an important analytical objective for environmental monitoring and assessment. Here, a simple, accurate, and sensitive automated flow injection analysis (FIA) method is proposed in this paper. The procedure is based on a highly selective reaction between Ponceau S and Cr (VI) under acidic condition. The absorbance of the complex compounds was measured using an optical detector at 505 nm. The chemical factors and FIA variables that affect the system were fully discussed and optimized via univariate experimental design. Under the optimal conditions, a linear dynamic range of 0.1–3.0 mg/L with a satisfactory determination coefficient (R ²) of 0.9996 was obtained. The detection limit and relative standard deviation were 0.08 mg/L and 2.27%, respectively. Finally, the method was successfully applied to determine Cr (VI) in field samples of tannery effluent and the results have no significant difference comparing with one official method, indicating this FIA method could be practically promising for determination of Cr (VI) in tannery effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3achromium 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aexperimental design 3aflow injection analysis 3astatistical analysis 3atannery effluents1 aLiu, Haiteng1 aWu, Fengchang1 aLu, Shaoyong0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Jan., v. 228, no. 1 p.32-32dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-3162-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009200167300001600259520076600275592002801041650001301069650001301082650001901095650002301114650001401137650001201151650001601163700001801179700001601197700001701213700001701230700002001247700001901267773009101286856008401377990002301461852000901484655001201493IND60092486620221118024434.0141103e20120520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009248662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2011.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Ik Jun10aMacroporous–mesoporous alumina supported iridium catalyst for hydrazine decomposition  ap. 198-204.  aDecomposition of hydrazine allows the attitude and altitude control of satellite.

The performance of the KCMC-7 measured using 4.5N dual thruster module was satisfactory until the end of life, providing enough thrust for the attitude and altitude control of satellite in the pressure range of 50–350psi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrazine 3airidium 3arehydration1 aShin, Hye Sun1 aShin, Na Ra1 aKim, Su Hyun1 aKim, Su Kyum1 aYu, Myoung Jong1 aCho, Sung June0 tCatalysis today.g2012 May 20, v. 185, no. 1 p.198-204dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2011.08.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245015900195300002000354506007600374520062700450592002801077506003701105650001401142650001601156650001701172650001301189700001801202700001801220700001701238700002201255700001701277700001501294773013401309856007501443852000901518655001201527IND60538717720221207131630.0160815e20121114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053871772DNAL7 a10.1021/ja309172t2doi7 aPMC34985342pmcid7 a230726632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao12aA Biomimetic Route for Construction of the [4+2] and [3+2] Core Skeletons of Dimeric Pyrrole–Imidazole Alkaloids and Asymmetric Synthesis of Ageliferins  ap. 18834-18842.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe pyrrole–imidazole alkaloids have fascinated chemists for decades because of their unique structures. The high nitrogen and halogen contents and the densely functionalized skeletons make their laboratory synthesis challenging. We describe herein an oxidative method for accessing the core skeletons of two classes of pyrrole–imidazole dimers. This synthetic strategy was inspired by the putative biosynthesis pathways and its development was facilitated by computational studies. Using this method, we have successfully prepared ageliferin, bromoageliferin, and dibromoageliferin in their natural enantiomeric form.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalkaloids 3abiomimetics 3abiosynthesis 3anitrogen1 aWang, Xiaolei1 aTan, Xianghui1 aLu, Jianming1 aCormier, Kevin

S199-S202.  aThe aim of this research was to study the inhibitory effect of chlorpyrifos (CPF) on soil microbial activity and to evaluate the efficacy of different organic amendments as a biostimulation agent for sustaining the microbial activity and thereby assisting in the remediation of CPF (10 ppm) contaminated soil. Experiments were carried out under controlled conditions (37 °C) up to 74 days; CPF was analyzed by GC-ECD while dehydrogenase activity (DHA) was measured as one of the indices of soil microbial activity. Throughout the experiment, there was higher microbial activity in uncontaminated soil (S) as compared to CPF contaminated soil (SP) and overall a considerably high reduction (63.51%) in average DHA was noticed in CPF contaminated soil. Organic amendments enhanced the microbial activity over unamended CPF contaminated soil. The trend of DHA on 24th day was MS (SP + 1% Mushroom Spent) >VC (SP + 1% Vermicompost) >BS (SP + 1% Biogas Slurry) >SP (Soil spiked with 10 ppm CPF) >FM (SP + 1% Farmyard Manure). The enhancement in pesticide dissipation over the unamended soil showed the following trend VC (37%)>MS (24%) >FM (1.9%). In spite of sufficient DHA, BS could not enhance pesticide dissipation over the unamended soil (SP). These results indicate the potential of vermicompost and mushroom spent compost as suitable biostimulation agents to sustain the microbial activity in CPF contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3abiogas 3achlorpyrifos 3amicrobial activity 3amushroom compost 3amushrooms 3apesticide persistence 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3aslurries 2aAgaricales 2aAnimals 2aChlorpyrifosxtoxicity 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aManure 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxtoxicity1 aMalik, Anushree1 aSatya, Santosh1 aDureja, Prem0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 Mar., v. 95S p.S199-S202dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008000166300001600246520135500262592002801617650001801645650001901663650001501682650001801697650002101715650001201736650001501748650001301763650000801776650001301784650002601797650001301823650000901836650001201845650001001857650001101867650002101878650001801899650001701917650001301934650003301947650001501980650003101995650001802026650002402044650002202068650001202090650001102102653000802113653000902121653001902130653002402149653001502173653001102188700001802199700001602217700001702233700001702250700001802267773008902285856008402374852000902458655001202467IND60583035020221122072902.0171008e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058303502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGou, Huange10aAssessment of microbial communities in PM1 and PM10 of Urumqi during winter  ap. 202-210.  aRecently, inhalable particulate matter has been reported to carry microorganisms responsible for human allergy and respiratory disease. The unique geographical environment and adverse weather conditions of Urumqi cause double pollution of dust and smog, but research on the microbial content of the atmosphere has not been commenced. In this study, 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing were conducted to investigate the microbial composition of Urumqi's PM1 and PM10 pollutants in winter. Results showed that the bacterial community is mainly composed of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria accounted for the most proportion which was significant difference in some aforementioned studies. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota constitute the main part of the fungal microbial community. The difference of bacterial relative abundance in sample point is greater than in particle sizes. The sequences of several pathogenic bacteria and opportunistic pathogens were also detected, such as Acinetobacter, Delftia, Serratia, Chryseobacterium, which may impact on immunocompromised populations (elderly, children and postoperative convalescence patients), and some fungal genera may cause several plant diseases. Our findings may serve an important reference value in the global air microbial propagation and air microbial research in desert.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aActinobacteria 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3aChryseobacterium 3aDelftia 3aFirmicutes 3aSerratia 3aair 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3achildren 3adust 3aelderly 3afungi 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3aparticle size 3aparticulates 3apatients 3aplant diseases and disorders 3apollutants 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aribosomal RNA 3asecondary infection 3asequence analysis 3aweather 3awinter 0aPM1 0aPM10 0aMicroorganisms 0aCommunity structure 0aSequencing 0aUrumqi1 aLu, Jianjiang1 aLi, Shanman1 aTong, Yanbin1 aXie, Chunbin1 aZheng, Xiaowu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 July, v. 214 p.202-210dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245014600163300001300309520092300322592002801245650001701273650001001290650001501300650001301315650000901328650002301337650001201360650001601372650002001388650000901408650001301417650001601430651001501446651001001461653001701471653001601488653001001504653001501514653001301529653001601542653000901558653001701567653001601584700002301600773012401623856007701747852000901824655001201833IND60620361520221120154631.0220630e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062036152DNAL7 a10.3157/021.128.01022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStidham, John A.12aA New Species of Stick Insect (Phasmatodea: Diapheromeridae: Diapheromera) from Holocene Sandy Areas in Western Texas and New Mexico (U.S.A.)  ap. 1-10.  aA new species of stick insect, Diapheromera arena n.sp., from western Texas and New Mexico is the first new species of Diapheromera described from the United States in several decades. It lacks armature on the head of both sexes and has a unique apomorphy of a distinctly swollen third antennal segment that easily differentiates it from other species in that genus. Despite being broadly sympatric with Diapheromera velii Walsh, the occurrence of this new species only in areas of windblown sand and sand dunes appears to function as habitat separation between these two related stick insects at the local level. Despite the new species' relatively large geographic range, it is a rare taxon and much less common than Diapheromera velii in the same region.

The Veredas' hydrological characteristics are fundamental for the maintenance of biodiversity and economic activities in this region. However, despite this importance, only a few studies have been carried out in these areas, primarily surveys for dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata). Here, we sampled twenty-five palm swamps in a Cerrado region. We found 56 species of Odonata, ten of which were new records for the Mato Grosso do Sul State: Coenagrionidae (6), Libellulidae (3) and Aeshnidae (1). The Veredas harbor both lentic and lotic systems which contribute to the great regional diversity of Odonata. Our results increase our knowledge about Odonata diversity in Veredas areas of the Cerrado, show the importance of these environments for Odonata species, and emphasize the importance of maintaining the Veredas as Permanent Preservation Areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeshnidae 3aCoenagrionidae 3aLibellulidae 3abiodiversity 3acerrado 3ahydrology 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3asavannas 3asurveys 3aswamps 3aBrazil 0aSpecies list 0aDragonfly records 0adistribution 0afirst records 0aCerrado 0aVeredas1 aMoura, Emanuelle Batista1 aKoroiva, Ricardo1 aBorges, Ana Cláudia Piovezan1 aRoque, Fabio de Oliveira0 tEntomological news.g2018 Oct., v. 128, no. 1 p.24-38dAmerican Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44723x0013-872X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3157/021.128.01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01341naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009000162300001800252520033600270592002800606650001300634650001400647650002300661650001800684650001300702650001200715650001400727650001100741700002200752700001900774773012900793856007200922852000900994655001201003IND60658033720221117160533.0190816e20061129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065803372DNAL7 a10.1039/b610857a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabrielsson, Anders10aAcidic iridium hydrides: Implications for aerobic and Oppenauer oxidation of alcohols  ap. 4926-4927.  a[Cp*Ir(H)(bpym)]⁺ and [Cp*Ir(H)(bpy)]⁺ are the first examples of iridium based catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols; the catalytic cycle proceeds via acidic hydrides.

The information on the position, time, and power (peak current) for cloud-to-ground discharges is taken from the archive of the WWLLN. Parameterizations of the sprite initiation probability are proposed for positive and negative discharges. In the calculations, only nighttime events are considered and the probabilistic nature of the sprite initiation, depending on the impulse charge moment change, is taken into account. It is shown that on average, 870 nighttime sprites per twenty-four hours can be initiated globally, 41.4% of them over land and 58.6% over ocean. On the basis of the proposed parameterization, the regional distribution of sprites is analyzed, as well as seasonal and monthly distribution over land and ocean. The annual dynamics of the number of sprites over land and ocean is investigated, revealing the maximum number of events in August and the minimum in January and February.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographical distribution 3alightning 3aprobability 3aresearch 0aSprites 0aSprite initiation 0aSprite global distribution1 aIlin, Nikolay1 aSvechnikova, Ekaterina0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 276 p.106272-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1062723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006500156300001800221520125500239592002801494650001301522650002201535650003101557650002401588650002301612700001601635700001501651700001401666700001601680773013401696856007401830852000901904655001201913IND60633211820221121065611.0190319e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063321182DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cs00614h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Shuang10aOrganic and hybrid resistive switching materials and devices  ap. 1531-1565.  aThe explosive increase in digital communications in the Big Data and internet of Things era spurs the development of universal memory that can run at high speed with high-density and nonvolatile storage capabilities, as well as demonstrating superior mechanical flexibility for wearable applications. Among various candidates for the next-generation information storage technology, resistive switching memories distinguish themselves with low power consumption, excellent downscaling potential, easy 3D stacking, and high CMOS compatibility, fulfilling key requirements for high-performance data storage. Employing organic and hybrid switching media in addition allows light weight and flexible integration of molecules with tunable device performance via molecular design-cum-synthesis strategy. In this review, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the recent advances in organic and hybrid resistive switching materials and devices, with particular attention on their design principles for electronic property tuning and flexible device performance. The current challenges posed with development of organic and hybrid resistive switching materials and flexible memory devices, together with their future perspectives, are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acomputer hardware 3aenergy use and consumption 3ainformation storage 3astorage technology1 aYi, Xiaohui1 aShang, Jie1 aLiu, Gang1 aLi, Run-Wei0 tChemical Society reviews.g2019 Mar. 18, v. 48, no. 6 p.1531-1565dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cs00614h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245017000166300001800336520091500354592002801269650002801297650001401325650002301339650002301362650001201385650001101397650001301408653001801421653003001439653001201469653002601481653002001507700001901527700001801546700001901564700001601583773008101599856008101680852000901761655001201770IND60528164120221118055312.0161019e20160804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052816412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, You-Qing10aSolvent-controlled and selective synthesis of mono- and bis-indolyl products in Brønsted acid catalyzed aza-Friedel–Crafts reactions of indoles with cyclic imines  ap. 4643-4654.  aStudies to investigate the selectivity and scope of acid-catalyzed aza-Friedel–Crafts reactions of seven-membered cyclic imine dibenzo[b,f][1,4]oxazepines with various indoles have been carried out. In the presence of 10 mol% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the selectivity of this reaction can be controlled in different solvents, affording mono-indole substituted products in THF and bis-indole substituted products in DCM as major products. Unsymmetric bis-indole substituted products can be obtained via a sequential procedure. Structurally diverse indole derivatives can be constructed using cyclic imines as the substrates with the reaction featuring: mild conditions, solvent-controlled efficient selectivity, and no need for metals but using easy accessible TFA as a catalyst. Moreover, the potential anti-tumor activity of the new functionalized indole products obtained has been studied by MTT assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aindoles 3ametals 3asolvents 0aCyclic imines 0aFriedel–Crafts reaction 0aIndoles 0aNitrogen heterocycles 0aSolvent effects1 aWei, Zhong-Shu1 aZhu, Chao-Qun1 aRen, Yuan-Yuan1 aWu, Chunrui0 tTetrahedron.g2016 Aug. 04, v. 72 p.4643-4654dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2016.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01428naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245013100161300001400292520032100306592002800627650001400655650001600669651001000685653002200695653002000717653001400737653001600751653001100767700002100778700001900799700001800818700001900836773012500855856007700980852000901057655001201066IND60620361820221120154535.0220630e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062036182DNAL7 a10.3157/021.128.01052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Hirdesh10aFirst Record of Genus Mesambria Stål, 1878 (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Catantopinae) from India with Description of a New Species  ap. 39-48.  aThe genus MesambriaStål, 1878 is reported for the first time from India and a new species, Mesambria indica Kumar & Chandra n. sp. is described.

The mischaracterization of the underlying causes of grassland degradation among policymakers has and continues to be an obstacle to sustainable regional grassland management practices. Accumulating evidence suggests that privatization and sedentarization, small mammals, climate change, harsh environments, fragile soils, and overgrazing contribute to grassland degradation. However, neither obsolete livestock husbandry methods nor the recent conversion of rangelands to agriculture had a meaningful influence. Estimates of the total area of degraded grasslands and the establishment of grassland degradation criteria have not been properly addressed in the literature. Both omissions constitute the basis for investigating the causes of grassland degradation across the QTP and the adoption of measures to manage these grasslands sustainably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aempirical research 3agrassland management 3agrasslands 3aissues and policy 3alivestock husbandry 3aovergrazing 3aprivatization 3arangelands 3asmall mammals 3asoil 3aChina 0aalpine rangelands 0acausative factors 0adegradation criteria 0aecosystem degradation 0agrassland contract policy 0agroup action1 aAdamowski, Jan F.1 aDeo, Ravinesh C.1 aXu, Xueyun1 aGong, Yifan1 aFeng, Qi0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2019 Nov., v. 72, no. 6 p.988-995dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2019.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009400162300001800256520079500274592002801069650002301097650001501120650002201135650002401157650001401181650001501195653002101210653002301231653001601254653002301270653003201293700001601325700001601341700001801357773008101375856008101456852000901537655001201546IND60528164220221118055234.0161019e20160804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052816422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.06.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Anwei10aSubstrate screening of amino transaminase for the synthesis of a sitagliptin intermediate  ap. 4660-4664.  aWe reported herein a new enzymatic route to synthesize a sitagliptin intermediate using an aminotransferase.

Application of chemical products on the plant or in the soil kills a range of the beneficial micro-organisms thereby disturbing ecosystem. Compost tea helps to restore and increase the populations of those beneficial micro-organisms. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the comparison of biopesticide (compost tea) and a chemical pesticide. The experiment was performed in three treatments, which were compost tea, fungicide (Topaz) and no treatment in three replications. After foliar applications of biopesticide and fungicide, the control percentage was estimated based on the number of infected flowers with powdery mildew. The results indicated that there was a significant difference between these treatments on rose in controlling powdery mildew (F = 23.25, p = 0.0015, df = 2), at a probability level of 1% (p ⩽ 0.01). So, that control percentage of compost tea treatment was the most.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprobability 3aPodosphaera pannosa 3afungicides 3afoliar application 3aflowers 3amicroorganisms 3apowdery mildew 3asoil 3afoliar diseases 3aecosystems 3acompost extracts 3aRosa 0acompost tea 0adesign-expert 0aSphaerotheca pannosa 0aTopaz1 aKiani, Leila1 aTafaghodinia, Bahram1 aHashemi, Bahareh0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 47, no. 6 p.658-664dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2013.8170753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245005600212300001200268506007600280520169400356592002802050596016702078506003702245650001902282650001402301650001002315650001702325650001102342650001502353650001302368650001802381650001302399650001402412650003002426700001802456700002402474700002402498773010302522856008202625852000902707655001202716IND60573297620221207122656.0210217e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057329762DNAL7 a278841732pmid7 aPMC51233362pmcid7 a10.1186/s13059-016-1102-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbouelhoda, Mohamed10aRevisiting the morbid genome of Mendelian disorders  ap. 235.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The pathogenicity of many Mendelian variants has been challenged by large-scale sequencing efforts. However, many rare and benign “disease mutations” are difficult to analyze due to their rarity. The Saudi Arabian variome is enriched for homozygosity due to inbreeding, a key advantage that can be exploited for the critical examination of previously published variants. RESULTS: We collated all “disease-related mutations” listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and ClinVar, including “variants of uncertain significance” (VOUS). We find that the use of public databases including 1000 Genomes, ExAC, and Kaviar can reclassify many of these variants as likely benign. Our Saudi Human Genome Program (SHGP) can reclassify many variants that are rare in public databases. Furthermore, SGPD allows us to observe many previously reported variants in the homozygous state and our extensive phenotyping of participants makes it possible to demonstrate the lack of phenotype for these variants, thus challenging their pathogenicity despite their rarity. We also find that 18 VOUS BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants that are listed in BRCA Exchange are present at least once in the homozygous state in patients who lack features of Fanconi anemia. Reassuringly, we could reciprocally demonstrate that none of those labeled as “pathogenic” were observed in the homozygous statue in individuals who lack Fanconi phenotype in our database. CONCLUSION: Our study shows the importance of revisiting disease-related databases using public resources as well as of population-specific resources to improve the specificity of the morbid genome of Mendelian diseases in humans.  aPublisher supplied data  a08-MED497-20, 08-MED489-20, 10-BIO941-20, 09-MED941-20, 10-BIO1356-20, 10-BIO1357-20, 13-BIO1113-20, 15-BIO3688-20cKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFanconi anemia 3adatabases 3agenes 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3ainbreeding 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3aphenotype 3atumor suppressor proteins1 aFaquih, Tariq1 aEl-Kalioby, Mohamed1 aAlkuraya, Fowzan S.0 tGenome biology.g2016 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.235-235dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-1102-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008600164300002000250520147400270592002801744650002101772650001501793650001701808650001101825650002801836650001201864650002201876650001801898650002901916650001101945650001601956653002101972653001601993653003202009653002202041653001902063700001802082700001602100700002202116700005302138773014102191856007802332852000902410655001202419IND60598341420221122085828.0180629e20170726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059834142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b062082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLochala, Joshua10aResearch Progress toward the Practical Applications of Lithium–Sulfur Batteries  ap. 24407-24421.  aThe renaissance of Li–S battery technology is evidenced by the intensive R&D efforts in recent years. Although the theoretical capacity and energy of a Li–S battery is theoretically very high, the projected usable energy is expected to be no more than twice that of state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries, or 500 Wh/kg. The recent “sulfur fever” has certainly gathered new knowledge on sulfur chemistry and electrochemistry, electrolytes, lithium metal, and their interactions in this “new” system; however, a real advance toward a practical Li–S battery is still missing. One of the main reasons behind this is the sensitivity of Li–S batteries to the experimental testing parameters. Sophisticated nanostructures are usually employed, while the practicality of these nanomaterials for batteries is rarely discussed. The sulfur electrode, usually engineered in a thin-film configuration, further poses uncertainties in the knowledge transfer from the lab to industry. This review article briefly overviews the recent research progress on Li–S batteries, followed by a discussion of the Li–S battery system from the authors’ own understandings collected from their past few years of research. The critical findings, the unresolved issues, and the scientific gap between lab research and industrial application are discussed. The future work in Li–S battery research is also explored to propel relevant research efforts toward industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aindustrial applications 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananomaterials 3aresearch and development 3asulfur 3auncertainty 0aLi−S batteries 0aelectrolyte 0athick electrode fabrication 0apouch cell design 0aenergy storage1 aLiu, Dianying1 aWu, Bingbin1 aRobinson, Cynthia1 aXiao, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5520-54390 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 July 26, v. 9, no. 29 p.24407-24421dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b062083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01017naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245013200152300001800284520017400302592002800476650002300504650001100527700001600538773012800554856007200682852000900754655001200763IND60658034020221117160445.0190816e20061205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065803402DNAL7 a10.1039/b610886e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xuan10aConstruction of fused bis(pyran) units from enones via a hydrosilylation–dihydroxylation–acetalization–reduction sequence  ap. 5036-5038.  aHWE coupling of two simple bifunctional fragments provides enones that can be subjected to a four-step sequence to furnish trans-fused bis(pyrans) in good overall yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3apyrans1 aWest, F.

Fecal samples or intestinal contents of 469 snakes, consisting of five species, were analyzed and Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected only from the Japanese grass snake Rhabdophis tigrinus. The mean prevalence of Cryptosporidium sp. in Japanese grass snakes was approximately 26% in the region studied. Histopathological observations revealed that the organism caused proliferative enteritis in the small intestine. Sequence analysis of a fragment of the small subunit rRNA gene has shown that the partial sequence of Cryptosporidium sp. isolated from the snakes was identical to that of the Cryptosporidium snake genotype W11 from New Guinea viper boa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aenteritis 3afeces 3agenes 3agenotype 3agrasses 3aoocysts 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asmall intestine 3asnakes 2aAnimals 2aCryptosporidiosisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCryptosporidiumxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnteritisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFecesxparasitology 2aGenes, rRNA 2aIntestinesxparasitology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOocysts 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSnakesxparasitology 3aJapan 3aNew Guinea 0aJapanxepidemiology.1 aIzumiyama, Shinji1 aYagita, Kenji1 aUne, Yumi1 aHayashidani, Hideki1 aKuro-o, Masaki1 aMori, Akira1 aMoriguchi, Hajime1 aToriba, Michihisa1 aIshibashi, Toru1 aEndo, Takuro0 tParasitology research.g2008 Sept., v. 103, no. 4 p.801-805dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-1045-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245017000155300001800325520119400343592002801537653001901565653002101584653001601605653002301621700002201644700002001666700001101686700002101697700001501718773012601733856003801859852000901897655001201906IND60466406320221120205715.0151124s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046640632DNAL7 a10.1603/EN131432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ri-Zhao10aUse of Pheromone Timed Insecticide Applications Integrated with Mating Disruption or Mass Trapping Against Ostrinia Furnacalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in Sweet Corn  ap. 1390-1399.  aMating disruption and mass trapping of Ostrinia furnacalis (Génuéé), often called the Asian corn borer, were incorporated with insecticides to reduce pesticide use. Pesticides alone are often ineffective owing to problems in timing applications before the larvae enter the protection of corn stalks. In addition, overuse of insecticides has caused environmental contamination and concerns about consumer health. In 2010, 15 insecticides were compared with mating disruption or mass trapping at various dispenser (disp.) densities for reducing egg masses, trap captures, and ear damage. Mass trapping with 30 and 40 disp./ha, mating disruption with 300 disp./ha, or endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, and monosultap (0.55, 0.35, and 0.55 kg/ha, respectively) gave ≈50% ear protection. In 2011, an insecticide alone, no treatments, pheromone alone, and pheromone + insecticide were examined. The same insecticides in combination with mating disruption or mass trapping at ≧200 or≧20 disp./ ha gave >90% ear protection even when chemical applications were reduced to 1 from 3, and the rates were reduced 50–75%. Pheromone dispensers contained >50% of their initial load 30 d after exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 0asex attractant 0aAsian corn borer 0acorn damage 0achemical reduction1 aKlein, Michael G.1 aSheng, Cheng-Fa1 aLi, Yu1 aShao, Dong-Xiang1 aLi, Qi-Yun0 tEnvironmental entomology.g, v. 42, no. 6 p.1390-1399dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN13143  aDNAL 7aarticle01185naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245008900163300001400252520016500266592002800431650001700459650001600476650001900492651001300511651000900524653001400533653001700547653001300564653001300577653001600590653001800606773012500624856007700749852000900826655001200835IND60620362120221120154541.0220630e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062036212DNAL7 a10.3157/021.128.01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreytag, Paul H.10aThree New Species of Bythonia (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Iassinae) from South America  ap. 61-64.  aThree new species are added to the South American genus Bythonia: Two species from Peru and one from Colombia.

In recent years, the degradome sequencing (degradome-seq) libraries became a rich storehouse for researchers to study on RNA processing and regulation. Here, we provided a brief overview of the uses of degradome-seq data in plant RNA biology, especially on non-coding RNA processing and small RNA-guided target cleavages. Some novel applications in RNA research area, such as in vivo mapping of the endoribonucleolytic cleavage sites, identification of conserved motifs at the 5ʹ ends of the uncapped RNA fragments, and searching for the protein-binding regions on the transcripts, were also mentioned. More importantly, we proposed a model for the biologists to deduce the contributions of transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulation to gene differential expression based on degradome-seq data. Finally, we hope that the degradome-based analytical methods could be widely applied for the studies on RNA biology in eukaryotes.  aThis work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [81730108], [81973635] and [31970637].  aPublisher supplied data  a81730108  a31970637  a81973635 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anon-coding RNA 3aprotein binding 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPlant RNA degradome 0aRNA processing 0asmall RNA (sRNA)-guided target cleavages 0agene differential expression (GDE) 0atranscriptional 0apost-transcriptional1 aYin, Xiaopu1 aTang, Zhonghai1 aIto, Hidetaka1 aShao, Chaogang1 aMeng, Yijun1 aXie, Tian0 tRNA biology.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 17, no. 9 p.1223-1227dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2020.17578983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010800160300002000268520234400288592002802632650001302660650001602673650002102689650001302710650001602723650002802739650002102767650001502788650002502803650002202828650001302850650001702863653003302880653002102913653001302934653000902947653002702956700001902983700001603002700006203018773014103080856007803221852000903299655001203308IND60598341520221122085855.0180629e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059834152DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b062102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yepin10aSuperelastic Pseudocapacitors from Freestanding MnO2-Decorated Graphene-Coated Carbon Nanotube Aerogels  ap. 23810-23819.  aIn recent years, the demand for emerging electronic devices has driven efforts to develop electrochemical capacitors with high power and energy densities that can preserve capacitance under and after recovery from mechanical deformation. We have developed superelastic pseudocapacitors using ∼1.5 mm thick graphene-coated single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) aerogels decorated with manganese oxide (MnO₂) as freestanding electrodes that retain high volumetric capacitance and electrochemical stability before, under, and after recovery from 50% compression. Graphene-coated SWCNT aerogels are superelastic and fatigue-resistant with high specific surface area and electrical conductivity. Electrodeposition of MnO₂ onto these aerogels does not alter their superelasticity, with full shape recovery even after 10 000 compression−release cycles to 50% strain. Total (utilized) gravimetric capacitances of these aerogels before compression are similar to those under and after recovery from 50% compression over a wide range of scan rates with capacitances reaching 98 (468), 106 (522), and 128 F/g (626 F/g) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s, respectively. These gravimetric capacitances are preserved even after 10 000 compression–release cycles to 50% strain. Further, 50% compression of these aerogels increases the volumetric capacitance from 1.5 to 3.3 F/cm³. Before compression, the lifetime performances of these aerogels remain largely stable, with capacitance degrading by only ∼14% over the first 2000 charge–discharge cycles and remains constant for further 8000 cycles. Under 50% compression, capacitance displays a similar trend over 10 000 charge–discharge cycles. After recovery from 10 000 compression–release cycles to 50% strain, the aerogels show slightly greater capacitance loss of ∼28% over the first 2000 charge–discharge cycles and an additional ∼10% loss over the subsequent 8000 charge–discharge cycles. Finally, substantially higher gravimetric capacitance is achieved through greater MnO₂ deposition, facilitated by the large porosity of these aerogels, albeit at a loss of capacitance retention upon compression. These capacitors display the feasibility of coating graphene-coated SWCNT aerogels with various pseudocapacitive materials to create superelastic energy-storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3adeformation 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic equipment 3amanganese dioxide 3aporosity 3asurface area 0acompressible pseudocapacitor 0acarbon nanotubes 0agraphene 0aMnO2 0avolumetric capacitance1 aLi, Maxwell P.1 aLiu, Siyuan1 aIslam, Mohammad F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9253-37090 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 July 19, v. 9, no. 28 p.23810-23819dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b062103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245009300204300002000297500001900317520194500336592002802281650002502309650001702334650002102351650001302372650001302385650001502398650002202413650001702435653001702452653002102469653001802490653001602508653001302524700005602537700006702593773014302660856007802803852000902881655001202890IND60715536820221122183811.0201028e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071553682DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c107872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, M.

An important new direction is to integrate 2D materials into crumpled heterostructures, which can have much more complex device geometries. Here, we demonstrate phototransistors from crumpled 2D heterostructures formed from graphene contacts to a monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (MoS₂, WSe₂) channel and quantify the membrane morphology and optoelectronic performance. First, we examined the morphology of folds in the heterostructure and constituent monolayers under uniaxial compression. The 2D membranes relieve the stress by delaminating from the substrate and creating nearly periodic folds whose spacing depends on the membrane type. The matched mechanical stiffness of the constituting layers allows the 2D heterostructure to maintain a conformal interface through large deformations. Next, we examined the optoelectronic performance of a biaxially crumpled graphene–WSe₂ phototransistor. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy shows that the optical band gap of WSe₂ shifts by less than 2 meV between flat and 15% biaxial crumpling, corresponding to a change in strain of less than 0.05%. The photoresponsivity scaled as P–⁰.³⁸ and reached 20 A/W under an illumination power density of 4 μW/cm² at 20 V bias, a performance comparable to flat photosensors. Using photocurrent microscopy, we observe that the photoresponsivity increases by only 20% after crumpling. Both the PL and photoresponse confirm that crumpling and delamination prevent the buildup of compressive strain leading to highly deformed materials and devices with similar performance to their flat analogs. These results set a foundation for crumpled all-2D heterostructure devices and circuitry for flexible and stretchable electronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3adelamination 3aelectric current 3agraphene 3alighting 3amicroscopy 3aphotoluminescence 3aspectroscopy 0a2D materials 0aheterostructures 0aphotodetector 0astretchable 0acrumpled1 aYu, Jaehyung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9925-23091 avan der Zande, Arend M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5104-96460 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 12, no. 43 p.48910-48916dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c107873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245007500205300001600280520206100296592002802357650003002385650002202415650002802437650001702465650001602482650001202498650001502510650001302525650001502538650002002553650002102573650001802594650001002612651001602622653001602638653002902654653001702683653001702700653002002717653001502737700001502752700002302767773012502790856008302915852000902998655001203007IND60633001320221121113610.0200712e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063300132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZingg, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4489-182410aLandscape-scale effects of land use intensity on birds and butterflies  ap. 119-128.  aAlthough today there is ample evidence that biodiversity is affected by agricultural land use intensification, little is known about how species respond to different land use intensity gradients at landscape scale. To properly describe the relationship between biodiversity and land use intensity, intensity indicators need to account for land cover, management intensity, and be assessed at landscape scale. The study was conducted in 91 landscapes of 1 km² in Switzerland. Three different land use intensity indicators were calculated: indicator 1 was defined as the ratio between agricultural and natural area; indicator 2 as the ratio between arable land and permanent grassland; and indicator 3 as the ratio between agricultural area and biodiversity promotion areas (BPA, i.e. wildlife-friendly managed areas under Swiss agri-environment schemes). Species richness and abundance of birds and butterflies were used as biodiversity indicators and trait-based community indices were used to describe bird community changes. Overall, we found that birds were affected by landscape composition and agricultural management, while butterflies were mainly affected by agricultural management. Specifically, from natural (e.g. forest dominated) to agriculture-dominated landscape, bird species richness showed a sharp decrease when 80% or more of the landscape was farmed. Butterfly species richness followed a hump-shaped curve. None of the species groups was significantly correlated with the proportion of arable land versus permanent grassland. Yet species richness of birds and butterflies significantly changed with the proportion of BPA: the lower the proportion of BPA, the lower the observed richness. Finally, when the proportion of agricultural land increased, populations of migratory birds and hedge/tree breeders decreased. We conclude that to further promote farmland biodiversity, natural areas, such as forests, hedges and waterbodies, should cover at least 20% of the agricultural landscapes and the proportion of BPA should be increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagri-environmental policy 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aarable soils 3abutterflies 3aforests 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amigratory birds 3aspecies richness 3asurface water 3atrees 3aSwitzerland 0aAgriculture 0aAgri-environment schemes 0aBiodiversity 0aConservation 0aLandscape scale 0aManagement1 aGrenz, Jan1 aHumbert, Jean-Yves0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 267 p.119-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245012100200300002000321520139000341592002801731650001101759650001301770650002301783650001101806650002201817650001301839650002401852650001501876650001101891650002201902650001501924653001801939653003601957653003001993653003202023653002802055700001602083700001602099700001602115700005402131700005602185773014102241856007802382852000902460655001202469IND60598341720221122085842.0180629e20170726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059834172DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b062312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jungang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1896-299910aGraphene Dots Embedded Phosphide Nanosheet-Assembled Tubular Arrays for Efficient and Stable Overall Water Splitting  ap. 24600-24607.  aBifunctional electrocatalysts are highly desired for overall water splitting. Herein, the design and fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical earth-abundant transition bimetallic phosphide arrays constructed by one-dimensional tubular array that was derived from assembling two-dimensional nanosheet framework has been reported by tailoring the Co/Ni ratio and tunable morphologies, and zero-dimensional (0D) graphene dots were embedded on Co–Ni phosphide matrix to construct 0D/2D tubular array as a highly efficient electrode in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). On the basis of advanced merits, such as the high surface-active sites, well-dispersed graphene dots, and enhanced electron transfer capacity as well as the confinement effect of the graphene dots on the nanosheets, the integrated GDs/Co₀.₈Ni₀.₂P tubular arrays as anode and cathode exhibit excellent OER and HER performance. By use of GDs/Co₀.₈Ni₀.₂P arrays in the two-electrode setup of the device, a remarkable electrocatalytic performance for full water splitting has been achieved with a high current density of 10 mA cm–² at 1.54 V and outstanding long-term operation stability in an alkaline environment, indicating a promising system based on nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts toward potential practical devices of overall water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3achemical reduction 3acobalt 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxygen production 3aphosphides 0agraphene dots 0atransition bimetallic phosphide 0aoxygen evolution reaction 0ahydrogen evolution reaction 0aoverall water splitting1 aSun, Yiqing1 aCao, Shuyan1 aWu, Yunzhen1 aChen, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4053-71471 aSun, Licheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4521-28700 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 July 26, v. 9, no. 29 p.24600-24607dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b062313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016800170520102200338592002801360650002501388650001001413650001401423650001701437650002101454650001401475651001001489653002501499653002701524653001401551653002301565653001501588653001901603700002001622700002201642700002701664700002501691700001901716700002401735773010601759856008801865852000901953655001201962IND60734542320221122231651.0211123e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073454232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1123402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrós, Jorge10aPostmortem investigations on leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) stranded in the Canary Islands (Spain) (1998–2017): Evidence of anthropogenic impacts  aOpportunities for postmortem studies on leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are infrequent due to their predominantly pelagic life history. In this study, the pathological findings and causes of mortality of 13 leatherback turtles stranded in the Canary Islands, Spain, from 1998 to 2017, are described. In addition, concentrations of Se, As, Cd, Pb, Hg, 15 rare earth elements (REE) and other 4 minor elements (ME), 41 persistent organic pollutants, and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in hepatic samples from 5 leatherbacks were determined. 84.62% of the turtles died possibly due to anthropogenic causes (entanglement/fishing interaction - 46.15%; boat strike - 23.07%; plastic ingestion - 15.38%). Although Se, As, and Cd were found at higher hepatic concentrations than those reported for leatherbacks from other locations, no acute lesions were detected. This is the first report of exposure to REE-ME in sea turtles. Organic contaminant hepatic concentrations were generally low or undetectable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermochelys coriacea 3aboats 3aingestion 3alife history 3amarine pollution 3amortality 3aSpain 0aDermochelys coriacea 0aLeatherback sea turtle 0aPathology 0aInorganic elements 0aPollutants 0aCanary Islands1 aCamacho, Maria,1 aCalabuig, Pascual1 aRial-Berriel, Cristian1 aMontesdeoca, Natalia1 aDéniz, Soraya1 aLuzardo, Octavio P.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 June, v. 167 p.112340-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1123403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03781naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013200209300001600341520206700357592002802424650002202452650001702474650003002491650002302521650001002544650001702554650002302571650001902594650002502613650001202638650001302650650001202663650001502675650001102690650001302701650002102714650001302735650001602748650001802764650002002782651001202802653002902814653001602843653002302859653001602882653001502898700001802913700001902931700001702950700001902967773012502986856008303111852000903194655001203203IND60633001520221122062611.0200712e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063300152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Vooren, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8295-017810aAssessing the impact of grassland management extensification in temperate areas on multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity  ap. 201-212.  aIn order to halt further biodiversity loss in the agricultural landscape, measures for grassland management extensification have been proposed and implemented. Apart from biodiversity conservation and enhancement, these measures are expected to affect a range of ecosystem services delivered by these grasslands. It is well-known that grasslands have the potential to contribute to the delivery of multiple ecosystem services, but there generally is a trade-off between provisioning services and regulating services, which is strongly linked to grassland management. This study investigated the effect of the extensification of grassland management on multiple ecosystem service and biodiversity indicators. To do so, two sets of grasslands in Flanders with varying management types were monitored: a regular, intensive management, a meadow bird management and a botanical management. For every monitored grassland, a land use intensity index was calculated and linked to the ecosystem service and biodiversity indicators. The results showed that biomass yield, forage quality, soil mineral N content and number of plant species differed among the various management types and that increasing land use intensity resulted in higher biomass yields, forage quality and soil mineral N content and in a lower number of plant species. However, it was observed that other factors such as the timing of the first cut affected these variables as well. A literature review was subsequently performed to quantify the link between land use intensity of other temperate grasslands and the same response variables. Results of the literature review confirmed the trends that were found in the monitoring data, but an additional effect of manure and slurry application on soil carbon stock was noted. Taken together, the results suggest that the impact of grassland management in terms of fertilization, mowing and grazing on the selected ecosystem service delivery and biodiversity indicators can be predicted, but that other management components should be considered as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiomass production 3abirds 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystem services 3aforage quality 3agrassland management 3agrazing 3aland use 3ameadows 3amonitoring 3amowing 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aslurries 3asoil carbon 3asoil minerals 3atemperate zones 3aBelgium 0aAgri-environment schemes 0aAgroecology 0aMultifunctionality 0aRestoration 0aTrade-offs1 aReubens, Bert1 aBroekx, Steven1 aReheul, Dirk1 aVerheyen, Kris0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 267 p.201-212dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017900171520184600350592002802196650001502224650001602239650001502255650002202270650002202292650001502314650001102329653001302340653003902353653001902392653001502411653003802426653001802464700001602482700001202498700002102510773011602531856008702647852000902734655001202743IND60779302720221120073417.0220906e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077930272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesantes, J.M.10aEffect of dynamic and operational restrictions in the energy management strategy on fuel cell range extender electric vehicle performance and durability in driving conditions  aAiming at increasing fuel cell (FC) stack durability in driving conditions, part of the scientific community has focused its efforts on developing energy management strategies (EMS) for fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCV). Nonetheless, most of these studies do not explicitly explain the effect of constraining the EMS in both degradation and performance when acting on the FC system dynamics or operational space nor consider the FC range-extender (FCREx) architecture for passenger car application. This study evaluates the potential of FCREx architecture to maximize FC stack durability and performance through control strategy dynamic and operational space limitations. For that purpose, a FCV modeling platform was developed and integrated together with an EMS optimizer algorithm and a semi-empirical advanced FC stack degradation model for driving cycle conditions. The resulting modeling platform was then simulated in WLTC 3b driving cycle to predict FC degradation and H₂ consumption with different dynamic and operational restrictions. Practical limits for EMS constraining were identified as —di/dt—ₘₐₓ = 0.001 A/cm²s or iₘᵢₙ = 0.2 A/cm² since they prevented the EMS from fulfilling the constant state-of-charge constraint in high-dynamic driving condition. In this sense, —di/dt—ₘₐₓ = 0.01 A/cm²s and iₘᵢₙ = 0.15 A/cm² were recommended as the combination of constraints that maximizes FC stack durability (+110%) without affecting the FCV operability with only an increase in of 4.7% in H₂ consumption. From these results, a set of recommendations and guidelines for FCREx vehicle manufacturers and FC stack developers were elaborated based on the benefits of understanding the dynamics and operational constraints that the FC system is going to be subjected to under real operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomobiles 3adurability 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy conversion 3afuel cells 3amodels 0aHydrogen 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell 0aRange extender 0aDurability 0aFuel cell hybrid electric vehicle 0aDriving cycle1 aNovella, R.1 aPla, B.1 aLopez-Juarez, M.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.115821-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011000172300001800282520091100300536036401211592002801575596001201603596001901615596001201634650002001646650003101666650001101697650001301708650001401721653001001735653001801745653002401763653002001787653001801807653000801825653003101833653001201864653001301876700001901889700002201908700002601930700002601956700001901982700002102001700002202022700001802044700002202062700002502084773010802109856008602217852000902303655001202312IND60705995520221121061904.0201030e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070599552DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2020.17610812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinicke, Fatima13aAn extension to: Systematic assessment of commercially available low-input miRNA library preparation kits  ap. 1284-1292.  aHigh-throughput sequencing has emerged as the favoured method to study microRNA (miRNA) expression, but biases introduced during library preparation have been reported. We recently compared the performance (sensitivity, reliability, titration response and differential expression) of six commercially-available kits on synthetic miRNAs and human RNA, where library preparation was performed by the vendors. We hereby supplement this study with data from two further commonly used kits (NEBNext, NEXTflex) whose manufacturers initially declined to participate. NEXTflex demonstrated the highest sensitivity, which may reflect its use of partially-randomized adapter sequences, but overall performance was lower than the QIAseq and TailorMix kits. NEBNext showed intermediate performance. We reaffirm that biases are kit specific, complicating the comparison of miRNA datasets generated using different kits.  aThis work was supported by Helse Sør-Øst RHF grants [2015034 and 2016122].

However, the extent to which environmental variables shape the distribution of planktonic ciliates in complex estuarine systems remains unclear. Here, 52 samples were collected from the Pearl River Estuary, China to reveal the influence of environmental variables on planktonic ciliate communities. Distinct community compositions of ciliates were found in three identified water masses: Pearl River diluted water mass, South China Sea surface water mass, and South China Sea bottom water mass. Significant differences in abundance, biomass, cell size, and oral diameter structure of ciliates were also detected among the three water masses. The partial Mantel test showed that water mass (as represented by water temperature and salinity) surpassed other environmental variables to be the primary factor driving the dynamics of the ciliate community. This study revealed the controlling mechanisms of planktonic ciliate communities in a subtropical, hydrographically complex estuarine ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3amarine pollution 3arivers 3asalinity 3asurface water 3awater temperature 3azooplankton 3aChina 3aSouth China Sea 0aAbundance 0aCommunity composition 0aGeographical distance 0aIndicator 0aOral diameter 0aQuantitative protargol staining1 aWang, Ying1 aXu, Jie1 aJiao, Nianzhi1 aXu, Dapeng0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 June, v. 167 p.112341-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1123413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010300206300001800309500001900327520175700346592002802103596005402131650001102185650002802196650000902224650001702233650002302250650001202273650003302285650001902318650001302337650001202350651001402362651002302376700002102399700002302420700002002443700002602463700002602489700001902515700002202534773013702556856008202693852000902775655001202784IND60728640820221118235049.0210223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072864082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-020-02317-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColombet, Zoé1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6179-751710aCaribbean nutrition transition: what can we learn from dietary patterns in the French West Indies?  ap. 1111-1124.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: Despite the urgency regarding increasing rates of obesity and chronic diseases in the Caribbean, few studies described the nutrition transition. We aimed to provide such information by identifying dietary patterns in the French West Indies and their characteristics. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis included 1144 Guadeloupeans and Martinicans from a multistage sampling survey conducted on a representative sample. Dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis followed by a clustering procedure, and described using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: Four patterns were identified: (i) a “prudent” pattern characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, seafood and yogurts, low intakes of fatty and sweet products, and a high Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I); (ii) a “traditional” pattern characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, tubers and fish, low intakes of red and processed meat, snacks, fast foods, and sweetened beverages, with a high DQI-I, mostly shaped by women and older persons; (iii) a “convenient” pattern characterized by high intakes of sweetened beverages, snacks, and fast foods, with the lowest DQI-I, principally shaped by young participants; (iv) a “transitioning” pattern characterized by high consumptions of bread, processed meat, sauces, alcoholic and sweetened beverages, but also high intakes of tubers, legumes, and fish, mainly shaped by men, middle aged, of whom 35% had metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSION: The co-existing dietary patterns in the French West Indies, marked by a generational contrast, seem to reflect different steps in dietary change as described in the literature, suggesting an ongoing nutrition transition.  aPublisher supplied data  aNR-16-CE21-0009cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3abreads 3across-sectional studies 3afish 3afood quality 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprocessed meat 3aseafoods 3asurveys 3aCaribbean 3aFrench West Indies1 aAllès, Benjamin1 aPerignon, Marlène1 aLandais, Edwige1 aMartin-Prével, Yves,1 aAmiot, Marie-Josèphe1 aDarmon, Nicole1 aMéjean, Caroline0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2021 Mar., v. 60, no. 2 p.1111-1124dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-020-02317-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003000142245013200172300001500304520132700319592002801646650002301674650001501697650001301712650002201725650004101747650001801788650001301806650001401819650002301833650002601856650001001882650001601892650002101908650001301929651002101942653001501963653002101978653002301999653000902022653002402031773012602055856007702181852000902258655001202267IND60620362920221120154616.0220630e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062036292DNAL7 a10.3157/021.128.01162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAçıkgöz, Halide Nihâl10aMultiple Drug Analysis of Chrysomya albiceps Larvae Provides Important Forensic Insights to Unravel Drug-Associated Mortalities  ap. 99-107.  aThe primary aim of forensic entomotoxicology is to unravel drug-associated mortalities. This study was designed to analyze and determine impacts of multiple drugs (amitriptyline, citalopram, diazepam and morphine) on the development of Chrysomya albiceps larvae. For this purpose, a domesticated pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) was injected with a toxic dose (54.4 mg) of morphine before euthanizing with diazepam (510 mg), citalopram (476 mg) and amitriptyline (5100 mg) by gavage method. A total of five hundred maggots were collected and residual drugs in collected larvae were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Analysis of maggots showed that the Chrysomya albiceps is the major species. All three drugs were quantified (amitriptyline: 91.45 µg/kg, citalopram: 52.03 µg/kg, and morphine: 5.37 µg/kg) in developing larvae. Moreover, our results showed that at an average temperature of 35°C, Chrysomya albiceps reached the third larval stage in 72 hours. These findings clearly articulate that toxic substances alter the biological life cycles of the arthropods, consequently making forensic entomotoxicology essential for certain quantitative analyses and potential effects on the post-mortem interval. This paper represents the first entomotoxicology study in Turkey using multiple drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomya albiceps 3aarthropods 3adiazepam 3aforensic sciences 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainsect larvae 3amorphine 3amortality 3apostmortem changes 3aquantitative analysis 3aswine 3atemperature 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3aTurkey (country) 0aEntomology 0aEntomotoxicology 0aChrysomya albiceps 0aDrug 0aPostmortem interval0 tEntomological news.g2018 Oct., v. 128, no. 1 p.99-107dAmerican Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44723x0013-872X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3157/021.128.01163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle08390naa a2201633 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245011300180300001800293500001900311520172000330592002802050596004602078596004602124596004602170596004602216596004602262596004602308596004602354596004602400596004602446596004602492596004602538596004602584596004602630596004602676596004602722596004602768596004602814596004602860596004602906596004602952596004602998596004603044596004603090596004603136596004603182596004603228596004603274596004603320596004603366596004603412596004603458596004603504596004603550596004603596596004603642596004603688596004603734596004603780596004603826596004603872596008103918596003003999596006404029596006404093596006404157596008004221596008304301596008304384596018604467596007904653596002804732596014604760650002304906650002004929650002804949650002904977650001205006650001505018650003405033650001205067650004105079650002305120650001205143650002405155650000905179650002805188650002605216700005705242700002305299700002905322700005305351700002705404700002105431700002205452700002005474700002905494700002205523700002605545700002305571700001905594700002805613700001905641700001905660700001805679700002605697700002905723700002605752700001905778700003005797700001705827700003005844700001505874700002405889700001705913700003005930700002005960700001805980700002705998700002806025700002506053700001806078700001906096700001606115700003506131700003206166700001806198700002106216700003406237700002706271700002406298700002606322700002606348700002606374700001706400700003006417700002006447700001806467700003106485773013706516856008206653852000906735655001206744IND60728640920221118235248.0210223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072864092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-020-02364-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarrete-Muñoz, Eva-Maria10aDietary folate intake and metabolic syndrome in participants of PREDIMED-Plus study: a cross-sectional study  ap. 1125-1136.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: We examined the association between dietary folate intake and a score of MetS (metabolic syndrome) and its components among older adults at higher cardiometabolic risk participating in the PREDIMED-Plus trial. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis with 6633 with overweight/obesity participants with MetS was conducted. Folate intake (per 100 mcg/day and in quintiles) was estimated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. We calculated a MetS score using the standardized values as shown in the formula: [(body mass index + waist-to-height ratio)/2] + [(systolic blood pressure + diastolic blood pressure)/2] + plasma fasting glucose–HDL cholesterol + plasma triglycerides. The MetS score as continuous variable and its seven components were the outcome variables. Multiple robust linear regression using MM-type estimator was performed to evaluate the association adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: We observed that an increase in energy-adjusted folate intake was associated with a reduction of MetS score (β for 100 mcg/day = − 0.12; 95% CI: − 0.19 to − 0.05), and plasma fasting glucose (β = − 0.03; 95% CI: − 0.05 to − 0.02) independently of the adherence to Mediterranean diet and other potential confounders. We also found a positive association with HDL-cholesterol (β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.04–0.10). These associations were also observed when quintiles of energy-adjusted folate intake were used instead. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a higher folate intake may be associated with a lower MetS score in older adults, a lower plasma fasting glucose, and a greater HDL cholesterol in high-risk cardio-metabolic subjects.  aPublisher supplied data  aPI13/00673cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/00492cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/00272cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/01123cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/00462cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/00233cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/02184cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/00728cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/01090cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI13/01056cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI14/01722cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI14/00636cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI14/00618cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI14/00696cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI14/01206cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI14/01919cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI14/00853cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI14/01374cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/00473cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/00662cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/01873cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/01094cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/00501cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/00533cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/00381cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/00366cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/01522cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI16/01120cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/00764cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/01183cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/00855cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/01347cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/00525cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/01827cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/00532cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/00215cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/01441cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/00508cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/01732cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aPI17/00926cInstituto de Salud Carlos III  aAdvanced Research Grant 2013–2018, 340918cH2020 European Research Council  a2013ACUP00194cRecercaixa  aPI0458/2013cConsejería de Salud de la Junta de Andalucía  aPS0358/2016cConsejería de Salud de la Junta de Andalucía  aPI0137/2018cConsejería de Salud de la Junta de Andalucía  aPROMETEO/2017/017cConselleria d'Educació, Investigació, Cultura i Esport  aCB06/03cSEMERGEN grant, and funds from the European Regional Development Fund  aCB12/03cSEMERGEN grant, and funds from the European Regional Development Fund  aLong-term effects of an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet on mortality and cardiovascular disease 2014 –2015, No. 201302cThe International Nut & Dried Fruit Council – FESNAD  aYoung Investigators Award in Category of Obesity and T2D 2017cAstraZeneca  aCA16112cEU-COST Action  aGrant of support to research groups no. 35/2011cBalearic Islands Government, Grants from Balearic Islands Health Research Institute (IDISBA) 3aMediterranean diet 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adiastolic blood pressure 3afasting 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asystolic blood pressure 3awaist-to-height ratio1 aVioque, Jesus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2284-148X1 aToledo, Estefanía1 aOncina-Canovas, Alejando1 aMartínez-González, Miguel A.q(Miguel Ángel),1 aSalas-Salvadó, Jordi,1 aCorella, Dolores1 aFitó, Montserrat1 aRomaguera, Dora1 aAlonso-Gómez, Ángel M.1 aWärnberg, Julia,1 aMartínez, J.

The role of other woody hosts in proximity of vineyards as a possible inoculum source for the causal agents of grapevine esca disease mainly remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of Phaeoacremonium spp. on pome and stone fruit with trunk diseases symptoms in northwestern parts of Iran. For this purpose, wood trees samples were collected from apple and apricot trees with trunk disease symptoms. Isolation was made using routine plant pathology methods. Based on the morphological and cultural characteristics, Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and Phaeoacremonium iranianum were identified from apple trees and P. aleophilum was recovered from apricot trees with trunk disease symptoms. A phylogenetic analysis based on the sequence data from β-tubulin gene further confirmed the identity of the species as P. aleophilum and P. iranianum . The results of inoculation assay on detached shoots of apples revealed that P. iranianum is pathogenic on apple. Our results also showed that P. aleophilum isolates from different hosts (apple, apricot and grapevine) were pathogenic on apple and induced wood discolouration on apple stems. There was no significant difference on the length of lesions induced in relation to the origin of the P. aleophilum isolates. This study is the first report on the occurrence of P. iranianum on apple trees with trunk disease symptoms worldwide and the first report on the occurrence of P. aleophilum on apple and apricot in Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyphomycetes 3aVitis 3aapples 3aapricots 3adiscoloration 3adisease reservoirs 3afruit trees 3agenes 3ahosts 3ainoculum 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathology 3ashoots 3astems 3atubulin 3avineyards 3awood 3aIran 0aalternative host 0awood necrosis 0agrapevine dieback 0atrunk diseases 0aVitis vinifera1 aNarmani, Abolfazl1 aKhodaei, Sima1 aMoshari, Somayeh0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 47, no. 6 p.717-727dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2013.8203873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01391naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009700152300002000249520035400269592002800623650002300651650001800674650000900692650001700701650001400718650001100732700001400743700001700757700001900774700001300793700001600806773013600822856007400958852000901032655001201041IND60661144120221119083504.0190828e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066114412DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05371d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jin10aConstruction of a porous three dimensional rare earth metal–sulfur–ligand open framework  ap. 15819-15822.  aA slow reaction between Nd³⁺ and piperazine-1,4-dicarbodithiolate disodium (Na₂(pipzdtc)) affords a three dimensional (3D) anionic [Nd(pipzdtc)₂]ₙⁿ⁻ framework with a dia net.

Here we describe relationships between fungi and the fungivorous millipede, Brachycybe lecontii. Their fungal community is surprisingly diverse, including 176 genera, 39 orders, four phyla, and several undescribed species. Of particular interest are twelve genera conserved across wood substrates and millipede clades that comprise the core fungal community of B. lecontii. Wood decay fungi, long speculated to serve as the primary food source for Brachycybe species, were absent from this core assemblage and proved lethal to millipedes in pathogenicity assays while entomopathogenic Hypocreales were more common in the core but had little effect on millipede health. This study represents the first survey of fungal communities associated with any colobognath millipede, and these results offer a glimpse into the complexity of millipede fungal communities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDiplopoda 3aHypocreales 3aarthropods 3adecay fungi 3afungal communities 3afungivores 3apathogenicity 3asurveys 3awood 0aDiplopoda 0aColobognatha 0aBrachycybe 0aMillipede 0aMycophagy 0aApophysomyces 0aMortierella1 aMarek, Paul E.1 aMorrissey, Ember M.1 aBrewer, Michael S.1 aShort, Dylan P.G.1 aStauder, Cameron M.1 aWickert, Kristen L.1 aBerger, Matthew C.1 aMetheny, Amy M.1 aStajich, Jason E.1 aBoyce, Greg1 aRio, Rita V.M.1 aPanaccione, Daniel G.1 aWong, Victoria1 aJones, Tappey H.1 aKasson, Matt T.0 tFungal ecology.g2019 Oct., v. 41 p.187-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000080x1754-50487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2019.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009400166300001800260500001900278520149400297592002801791596005501819650001501874650002001889650002301909650002001932650001401952650002601966650001601992650001402008650001402022650001202036650002202048650001202070650002302082650001602105700006002121700005902181700002402240700005602264700005702320700006102377700007002438700006002508773013702568856008202705852000902787655001202796IND60728641120221118235003.0210223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072864112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-020-02363-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sanghee14aThe impact of Hayward green kiwifruit on dietary protein digestion and protein metabolism  ap. 1141-1148.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine if an actinidin protease aids gastric digestion and the protein anabolic response to dietary protein. METHODS: Hayward green kiwifruit (containing an actinidin protease) and Hort 16A gold kiwifruit (devoid of actinidin protease) were given in conjunction with a beef meal to healthy older subjects. Twelve healthy older males (N = 6) and females (N = 6) were studied with a randomized, double-blinded, crossover design to assess muscle and whole-body protein metabolism before and after ingestion of kiwifruit and 100 g of ground beef. Subjects consumed 2 of each variety of kiwifruit daily for 14 d prior to each metabolic study, and again during each study with beef intake. RESULTS: Hayward green kiwifruit consumption with beef resulted in a more rapid increase in peripheral plasma essential amino acid concentrations. There were significant time by kiwifruit intake interactions for plasma concentrations of EAAs, branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), and leucine (P < 0.01). However, there was no difference in the total amount of EAAs absorbed. As a result, there were no differences between kiwifruit in any of the measured parameters of protein kinetics. CONCLUSION: Consumption of Hayward green kiwifruit, with a beef meal facilitates protein digestion and absorption of the constituent amino acids as compared to Hort 16A gold kiwifruit.

This novel photocatalyst is magnetically recoverable and maintains an excellent response after multiple reutilization cycles. In addition, its synthesis is based on inexpensive and abundant raw materials and its photocatalytic response is evaluated in the presence of energy efficient, affordable light-emitting diodes (LEDs), thereby providing a promising and feasible alternative to the homogeneous Fenton process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical compounds 3aenergy efficiency 3alight emitting diodes 3amagnetism 3amicrofluidic technology 3ananohybrids 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apyrolysis 3araw materials1 aHueso, J.

Forming a microgrid (MG) is the best way to integrate renewable energy sources (RES) to make a low-carbon path for electrification. Second-life batteries (SLBs), derived from the first-life application of batteries used in EVs, are lower in price as compared to fresh EV batteries and have sufficient remaining capacity as energy storage for MG applications. Therefore, to show the techno-economic feasibility of SLBs, this paper shows a comparative study of MG consisting of photovoltaic (PV)/floating PV/wind/biogas with fresh Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and SLBs. This paper analyses 4 hybrid models with fresh LIBs in off-grid and grid-connected mode, and based on HOMER-Pro an optimal model is finalized for the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Pathumthani, Thailand. From, six different cases of fresh LIBs, the optimal case is also selected by considering the lowest net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE). With the significant amount of reduction in NPC and COE, the grid-connected hybrid models are found to be more economically viable than the off-grid models. The grid-connected optimal hybrid model is further analyzed with SLBs where a range of cost multipliers (CMs) and energy throughputs are considered as the sensitivity parameters for SLBs. The results obtained from HOMER-Pro show that the grid-connected optimal model with SLBs reduces the NPC and COE by 36% and 35%, respectively, compared to the fresh LIBs. Hence, the optimal system shows the lowest NPC and COE as, 4,136,254$ and 0.0411$/kWh, respectively, with the SLBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3abiogas 3acarbon 3acomparative study 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy conversion 3afeasibility studies 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3awind 3aThailand 0aHybrid energy system 0aHOMER-Pro software 0aTechno-economic analysis 0aSensitivity analysis 0aSecond-life Li-ion batteries1 aOngsakul, Weerakorn1 aMadhu M., Nimal0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.115825-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009300207300001600300520118600316592002801502650002801530650001201558650002901570650002501599650002201624650001601646650000901662650001701671650002701688650001401715650001401729650002501743650002001768650001301788651001001801700001701811700001701828700002101845700001301866700002001879700001901899700001901918773012701937856008302064852000902147655001202156IND60637038420221118055949.0200702e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063703842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-018-00836-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfandi, Auliana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8995-262710aGenetic diversity of Phytophthora nicotianae reveals pathogen transmission mode in Japan  ap. 189-200.  aPhytophthora nicotianae is an important soil-borne pathogen in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. To clarify the genetic diversity of P. nicotianae and to understand its mode of transmission in Japan, we developed six new microsatellites markers, consisting of six loci and 39 alleles. In a phylogenetic analysis, 138 isolates, including 125 from Japan and 13 from overseas, were shown to differ, even though some were collected from the same host and location, suggesting that there is no geographic or host plant clustering. Population structure analysis also revealed a highly admixed population of P. nicotianae in Japan. Molecular analysis suggested high variance between individuals but no significant differences between populations. Both A1 and A2 mating types were present in the same population, which could be due to high levels of variance between individuals in the population. The absence of geographical structure between populations also suggests that the pathogen is able to migrate from one population to another. We propose that this phenomenon could result from human activities related to the transport of plant and associated agricultural materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora nicotianae 3aalleles 3aanthropogenic activities 3adisease transmission 3agenetic variation 3ahost plants 3aloci 3amating types 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3atemperate zones 3avariance 3aJapan1 aHieno, Ayaka1 aWibowo, Arif1 aSubandiyah, Siti1 aAfandi, 1 aSuga, Haruhisha1 aTsuchida, Koji1 aKageyama, Koji0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2019 May, v. 85, no. 3 p.189-200dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3871472x1345-26307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-018-00836-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008100172300001600253520166800269592002801937650003101965650001001996650001602006650002902022650001502051650001302066650001302079650001502092650001302107650002102120650002802141651001202169653003002181653001602211653001902227653004102246653002102287700001902308700002302327700001802350700002102368700002002389700001802409700002002427700001802447700001802465773012502483856008302608852000902691655001202700IND60633001920221122062603.0201230e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063300192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMäkeläinen, Sanna10aCoincidence of High Nature Value farmlands with bird and butterfly diversity  ap. 224-233.  aThe amount of High Nature Value farmland (HNVf) is a commonly used environmental indicator for assessing the performance of the Common Agricultural Policy, to support sustainable agriculture and monitor changes in agricultural land use in Europe. HNVf comprises agricultural areas of semi-natural state, low-intensity farming and fine-scale landscape mosaics of different habitat types. For a successful implementation, the identification of HNVf should correctly reflect the variation in biodiversity values between different agricultural landscapes. We examined how well the Finnish HNVf indicator and the sub-indicators constituting it – recalculated for the purposes of this study for five study regions – reflect the variation in bird and butterfly species richness and diversity patterns at different spatial scales. We found that butterfly diversity index was positively associated with the HNVf indicator at the finest scale of 0.5 km × 0.5 km squares. Among the HNVf sub-indicators, extensive cultivation of grasslands was most strongly related to the farmland bird diversity and the density of edge to the butterfly diversity. Thus, the HNVf concept reflects well the distribution of butterflies in the Finnish agricultural landscapes but insufficiently the diversity patterns of farmland birds. Importantly, semi-natural vegetation and long-term pastures – the backbone of the concept – presently occur in small and highly fragmented patches in agricultural landscapes in Finland. The Pan-European concept of HNVf has restricted application to farmland birds of this boreal country and the national HNVf concept may need to be revised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3abirds 3abutterflies 3aenvironmental indicators 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscapes 3apastures 3aspecies richness 3asustainable agriculture 3aFinland 0aAgricultural biodiversity 0aButterflies 0aFarmland birds 0aHigh Nature Value farmland indicator 0aSpecies richness1 aHarlio, Annika1 aHeikkinen, Risto K1 aHerzon, Irina1 aKuussaari, Mikko1 aLepikkö, Katri1 aMaier, Andrea1 aSeimola, Tuomas1 aTiainen, Juha1 aArponen, Anni0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 269 p.224-233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01333naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245010600155300001800261520022600279592002800505650001500533650002100548650002300569650001100592650001700603650001500620650001300635650001400648650001100662700001900673700002000692700001800712700001900730773012900749856007200878852000900950655001200959IND60658034820221117160510.0190816e20061031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065803482DNAL7 a10.1039/b611089d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Soo Jin10aOrganic–inorganic hybrid nanomaterial as a new fluorescent chemosensor and adsorbent for copper ion  ap. 4539-4541.  aFunctionalized silica nanotube (FSNT) possessing the phenanthroline moiety as a fluorescent receptor was fabricated by sol–gel reaction, and the binding ability of FSNT with metal ions was evaluated by fluorophotometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3abinding capacity 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3afluorescence 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3ananotubes 3asilica1 aLee, Shim Sung1 aLah, Myoung Soo1 aHong, Jae-Min1 aJung, Jong Hwa0 tChemical communications.g2006 Oct. 31, , no. 43 p.4539-4541dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b611089d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245010500158300002000263500001900283520171700302592002802019650000802047650001302055650001502068650001202083650001402095650002002109653002402129653001802153653002102171653002402192653001602216653001602232700001402248700005202262700001202314700005502326773014302381856007802524852000902602655001202611IND60715537420221122151735.0201028e20200911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071553742DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c113982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tao10aDesigning Re-Entrant Geometry: Construction of a Superamphiphobic Surface with Large-Sized Particles  ap. 49155-49164.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRe-entrant geometries can effectively trap air pockets beneath coating surfaces, prevent the penetration of low surface tension organic liquids, and achieve superamphiphobic performance. However, the creation of re-entrant geometries through particle-based spray coating remains a challenge. In the past decade, various studies have focused on the preparation of superamphiphobic coatings using ultrafine nanoparticles (10–15 nm) using conventional spray-coating methods. In this work, we aim to fabricate a spray-coated superamphiphobic surface using large particles with a hierarchical structure. The study systematically investigated the wetting behaviors of liquids with different topographies obtained using large particles (i.e., smooth, micro, nano, and micro/nanostructures) by different coating methods. The findings suggested that compared with the typical colloid template method, the surface obtained using the spray-coating method showed much greater roughness, which greatly enhanced the oleophobicity of the coating. Furthermore, only hierarchically monodisperse hollow SiO₂ spheres (MDH-SiO₂) showed excellent superamphiphobicity, which was independent of the hollow sphere size. While maintaining the coating roughness, by applying solid C@SiO₂ as a reference sample, the important role of the hollow structure of MDH-SiO₂ at the solid–liquid–air interface was confirmed. Nanosphere-surrounded hollow structures were shown to serve as a re-entrant type structure, preventing the imbibition of the liquid, finally leading to a stable Cassie state. This design strategy may provide useful guidelines for the fabrication of large particle-based spray-coated superamphiphobic surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ageometry 3aimbibition 3aliquids 3aroughness 3asurface tension 0asuperamphiphobicity 0aspray-coating 0ahollow structure 0are-entrant geometry 0aair pockets 0amicrosphere1 aLv, Chang1 aJi, Lvlv1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6145-38771 aHe, Xia1 aWang, Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1514-15890 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Sept. 11, v. 12, no. 43 p.49155-49164dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c113983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012000168300001600288520134100304592002801645596006001673650002501733650003801758650002801796650000901824650002401833650001401857650001101871650002301882650003001905650001001935650002001945650001001965700002001975700005901995773012702054856008302181852000902264655001202273IND60637038520221118055930.0200702e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063703852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-019-00838-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Mitsutaka10aDevelopment of a selective medium and antisera for Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae from seeds of barley and wheat  ap. 211-220.  aBacterial black node, a disease of barley and wheat, is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (synonym pv. japonica, hereafter Psj). Here a selective medium, serine-potassium tellurite-based Psj-selective agar (SPTPsjA) was developed to isolate and detect Psj. After 5–7 days on SPTPsjA at 25 °C, characteristic black Psj colonies formed with an efficiency equal to that on potato–peptone–glucose agar. Except for P. viridiflava, P. cichorii, and some strains of P. syringae group bacteria, SPTPsjA either inhibited growth of other phytopathogenic bacteria or enabled their discrimination. To facilitate diagnosis of Psj, we prepared three antisera against three strains; in a slide agglutination test, the antisera reacted to all tested strains of Psj and failed to react to P. viridiflava and P. cichorii although some strains of other P. syringae group bacteria were indistinguishable from Psj with SPTPsjA and antisera. When barley and wheat seeds from fields in which bacterial black node had occurred were placed on SPTPsjA in the dark at 25 °C for 7 days, black colonies grew on the medium around the seeds. Among these strains, only those responsive to the above antisera were pathogenic on barley. These results show that the combination of SPTPsjA and antisera can isolate Psj from seeds of barley and wheat.  aPublisher supplied data  a25063CcMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 3aPseudomonas cichorii 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3aPseudomonas viridiflava 3aagar 3aagglutination tests 3aantiserum 3abarley 3agrowth retardation 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aseeds 3aselective media 3awheat1 aSogou, Kazuhiro1 aInoue, Yasuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5266-76030 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2019 May, v. 85, no. 3 p.211-220dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3871472x1345-26307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-019-00838-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245007300178300001600251520201000267592002802277650002402305650001302329650002202342650002102364650001402385650000902399650001702408650001702425650001102442650001702453650001602470650001202486650000702498650001102505650001102516653001602527653001202543700001702555700002002572700002102592773014102613856008702754852000902841655001202850IND60767507120221121034148.0220218e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076750712DNAL7 a10.5958/2231-6744.2021.00024.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanday, Zahid Bashir10aEffect of different additives on bale silage quality of maize fodder  ap. 167-172.  aThe present study was conductedto evaluate the effect of different additives on the bale silage quality of maize fodder. An experiment was conducted with four different treatments of maize fodder before bailing them. These treatments consisted of; control without additive (MF₀), Lactobacillus casei at 10⁶ CFU/g (NCDC-17) of fresh fodder (MFLAB), Silotan, a commercial product at 15ml/100 kg of fresh maize fodder (MFST) and formaldehyde at 0.5% of fresh maize fodder (MFFA) as silage additives. The bale silage of four such treatments MF₀, MFLAB, MFST and MFFA,in replications (3*9 treatments) was prepared by using a high power 100 kg bailing machine. Each treatment was evaluated after 60 days of ensiling in terms of quality parameters like chemical composition, fermentation characteristics, microbial (LAB) counts and in vitro DM degradability. The evaluation of bale silage revealed a significant increase (P<0.001) in pH and decrease (P<0.001) in ammonia nitrogen in MFFA. There was no significant effect on DM, CP, EE and ADF contents of any treatment, however a significant increase (P<0.001) in WSC was observed in MFFA, with a decrease (P<0.001) in WSC of MFLAB. The TVFAs were significantly increased (P<0.001) in MFLAB and MFST, with a decrease (P<0.001) in MFFA. There was a significant decrease (P<0.001) in acetate content of MFFA while a significant reduction (P<0.001) in butyrate was observed in MFST and MFFA. There was a significant decrease (P<0.001) in Lactic acid content of MFFA. The in vitro DM degradability was significantly increased (P<0.05) in MFLAB. There was no significant effect of treatments on methane (ml/g DM) production in any of the treatments. The microbial counts were found significantly increased (P<0.05) in MFLAB, whilst a decrease (P<0.05) of microbial count was noted in MFFA, Yeast counts were significantly decreased (P<0.05) in MFST with increase in MFFA. It was concluded that Silotan or MFLAB can be used to improve the quality of bale silage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3aacetates 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanimal nutrition 3abutyrates 3acorn 3afeed quality 3afermentation 3aforage 3aformaldehyde 3alactic acid 3amethane 3apH 3asilage 3ayeasts 0aBale Silage 0aSilotan1 aMalik, Raman1 aChauhan, Prince1 aNaliyapara, H.B.0 tIndian journal of animal nutrition.g2021 June, v. 38, no. 2 p.167-172dAnimal Nutrition Society of IndiawJournal:2071x2231-67447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2231-6744.2021.00024.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100003500148245015900183300001800342500002400360520075900384650001601143650005301159650001901212650002101231650001101252650001501263650002901278650001601307650002401323650003701347650001501384650001001399650001301409700002501422700003201447773010001479852000901579856008801588655001201676IND4417966820221118015457.0090320s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441796682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmorim, Leiliane Coelho André10aAnalysis of hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in urine using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector  ap. 2900-2904.  aIncludes references  aThe determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites in human urine is the method of choice for assessing exposure to carcinogenic compounds.

The microwave process showed to be suitable for the extraction of several polar compounds classes of petroleum. The proposed microwave extraction method and GCxGC identification of polar compounds of petroleum samples are of practical interest for the petrochemical industry due to corrosion and related problems associated with these polar compounds in refinery equipments. The GCxGC/time-of-flight MS technique shows to be very important in the total separation of different classes of compounds and allows the identification of many compounds in these classes. 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3acorrosion 3aemulsions 3aexposure duration 3aindustry 3amass spectrometry 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3aoils 3aorganic compounds 3apetroleum 3apolar compounds 3atemperature1 aVon Mühlen, Carin1 aBortoluzzi, Janaína H.1 aZini, Claudia A.1 aFortuny, Montserrat1 aDariva, Claudio1 aCoutinho, Raquel C.C.1 aSantos, Alexandre F.1 aCaramão, Elina B.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Apr. 3, v. 1216, no. 14 p.2860-2865dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.09.0763Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02024naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011900166300001400285500002400299520110800323650002001431650002201451650001501473650002601488650001601514650001501530773009501545852000901640856008501649655001201734IND4417750520221118015420.0090313s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441775052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-008-9276-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTague, Christina10aModeling hydrologic controls on denitrification: sensitivity to parameter uncertainty and landscape representation  ap. 79-90.  aIncludes references  aThis paper presents a general discussion of the interplay between model structure and hydrologic parameters in the context of denitrification estimation using coupled hydro-ecosystem models at a watershed scale. Given the key role played by hydrology in denitrification models, sensitivity analysis of hydrologic parameters is needed to determine both uncertainty in denitrification estimates and to suggest how measured data, such as streamflow, can be effectively used to reduce this uncertainty. This paper contributes to the broad goal of sensitivity analysis by examining the linkage between landscape tessellation, calibration, and the ability of models to capture hot-spot contributions to watershed scale denitrification across a range of N-loading. For a small mid-Atlantic forested watershed, denitrification estimates using RHESSys (regional hydro-ecologic simulation system) are compared across different strategies for calibration and landscape tessellation. Results demonstrate the utility of several potential approaches to account for hydrologically mediated hot-spots within landscapes. 3adenitrification 3ahydrologic models 3alandscapes 3aparameter uncertainty 3astream flow 3awatersheds0 tBiogeochemistry.g2009 Mar., v. 93, no. 1-2 p.79-90dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-008-9276-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02488naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010000167300001600267520122400283650005001507650002701557650001301584650002001597650001401617650001001631650001101641650002601652650001401678650001601692650004301708650001101751700002201762700002301784700002201807773010901829852000901938856008501947930003302032946001302065655001202078IND4419313620221118015656.0090417e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441931362DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-009-9143-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawson, Erica D. 10aMolecular Detection of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis  ap. 117-127.  aWe developed molecular diagnostic assays for the detection of Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE), two streptococcal pathogens known to cause both pharyngitis and more invasive forms of disease in humans. Two real-time PCR assays coupled with an internal control were designed to be performed in parallel. One assay utilizes a gene target specific to GAS, and the other utilizes a gene target common to the two species. Both assays showed 2-3 orders of magnitude improved analytical sensitivity when compared to a commercially available rapid antigen test. In addition, when compared to standard culture in an analysis of 96 throat swabs, the real-time PCR assays resulted in clinical sensitivity and specificity of 91.7 and 100%, respectively. As capital equipment costs for real-time PCR can be prohibitive in smaller laboratories, the real-time PCR assays were converted to a low-density microarray format designed to function with an inexpensive photopolymerization-based non-enzymatic signal amplification (NESA[trade mark sign]) method. S. pyogenes was successfully detected on the low-density microarray in less than 4 h from sample extraction through detection. 3aStreptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aantigens 3adetection limit 3aequipment 3agenes 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3apathogens 3apharyngitis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3athroat1 aTaylor, Amber W. 1 aSmagala, James A. 1 aRowlen, Kathy L. 0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2009 May, v. 42, no. 1 p.117-127dNew York : Humana Press Incx1073-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-009-9143-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02900naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010000168300001800268520147800286650001801764650001501782650001301797650001001810650001301820650001201833650002101845650000901866650001201875650001101887650001001898650001001908651001001918651001801928653003401946653002301980653002802003700001602031700002702047700001502074700001502089700002002104700001302124773011902137852000902256856008502265930003302350946001102383655001202394IND4419308420221118015554.0090417e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441930842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-008-9324-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, R.

The system comprises of a series of tanks with open dug wells in the recharge zone of the tank that reharvest back the seepage water. Thus, the rainwater remaining in the tank as well as partial seeped water is used for providing round the year full irrigation. This system was evaluated in field in Keonjhar district of Orissa of eastern India with six tanks and five wells in two drainage lines. The total command area of the system of six tanks and five wells in both drainage lines is 23 ha and the total irrigation potential is 44.5 ha. The total cost of the system is US $19,180 making the cost of irrigation resource creation as US $426 per ha which is much less than about $2,220 per ha for major and medium irrigation projects in the last decade of 20th century. The system increased the rice yields from 1.92 t ha ⁻ ¹ to a range of 2.25 to 3.8 t ha ⁻ ¹ depending upon the package of practices or the amount of inputs. The farmers went for crops in post-monsoon and summer season and the cropping intensity rose to 112% in the first year, 126% in the second year and 132% in the third year. The internal rate of return from the system was 13.4% at the present level of utilization, which is about 2.4% more than the prime-lending rate of Indian banks, and 3.4% more than the lending rate for agricultural purposes. 3acost analysis 3acrop yield 3acropland 3acrops 3adrainage 3afarmers 3airrigation rates 3arain 3aseepage 3asummer 3atanks 3awells 3aIndia 3aUnited States 0aTank and open dug well system 0aCropping intensity 0aInternal rate of return1 aKannan, K. 1 aMohanty, Sheelabhadra.1 aNanda, P. 1 aSahoo, N. 1 aMohanty, R.

Group members share refuges (rock crevices), which may promote parasite transmission. We measured connectivity of individuals in networks constructed from patterns of common crevice use and observed patterns of parasitism by three blood parasites (Hemolivia, Schellackia and Plasmodium) and an ectoparasitic tick (Amblyomma vikirri). Data came from a 1-year mark-recapture study of four populations. Transmission networks were constructed to represent possible transmission pathways among lizards. Two lizards that used the same refuge within an estimated transmission period were considered connected in the transmission network. An edge was placed between them, directed towards the individual that occupied the crevice last. Social networks, a sub-set of same-day only associations, were small and highly fragmented compared with transmission networks, suggesting that non-synchronous crevice use leads to more transmission opportunities than direct social association. In transmission networks, lizards infested by ticks were connected to more other tick-infested lizards than uninfected lizards. Lizards infected by ticks and carrying multiple blood parasite infections were in more connected positions in the network than lizards without ticks or with one or no blood parasites. Our findings suggest higher levels of network connectivity may increase the risk of becoming infected or that parasites influence lizard behaviour and consequently their position in the network. 3aAmblyomma 3aPlasmodium 3ablood 3alizards 3amark-recapture studies 3aparasitism 3arisk 3asocial networks 3aticks 3aSouth Australia 0aParasite transmission 0aGroup-living1 aBull, C.

The assay is based on the emission of light by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) upon annealing of two hybridization probes. The analysis of melting curve profiles of the probes and templates allowed the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms. The assay was applied to the detection of alleles at the cor locus in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) that confers recessive resistance to corky root disease. Probes and primers for the assay were designed after the characterization of a single nucleotide polymorphism between alleles of PCR products amplified using a linked marker. That polymorphism was validated in a collection of lettuce varieties representing different genetic backgrounds. The FRET hybridization probes approach provided fast and accurate genotyping of breeding material directly in a one-tube reaction. The absence of electrophoresis makes this approach suitable for applications that require automation and high-throughput genotyping analyses such as marker-assisted selection programs. 3aLactuca sativa 3alettuce 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aSphingomonas suberifaciens 3abacterial diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aalleles 3aloci 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA probes 3anucleotide sequences 3afluorescence 3anucleic acid hybridization 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0acor locus 0afluorescence resonance energy transfer hybridization probes1 aJen̲n̲i, Es.1 aFortin, M.G.0 tMolecular breeding.g2004 May, v. 13, no. 4 p.323-332dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1380-3743/contents3electronic resource  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/08/26  aNon-US 7aarticle04019naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003100132040001800163072000900181072000900190100002000199245009400219300001800313500002400331500001500355506007600370520178400446506003702230650001202267650000902279650001302288650001702301650001802318650001402336650001702350650002202367650000902389650005202398650002102450650001602471650002502487650003102512650001802543650003102561650001602592650005202608650002502660650002102685650002802706650002102734650002902755650003902784650003002823650002302853653002802876653001202904700001902916700001102935700001802946773011802964852000903082856008103091856005403172930003303226945002503259946001303284655001203297IND4363939520221207124409.0040817e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436393952DNAL7 a152474002pmid7 aPMC5190892pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.104.0398182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aGallagher, C.E.10aGene duplication in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway preceded evolution of the grasses  ap. 1776-1783.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite ongoing research on carotenoid biosynthesis in model organisms, there is a paucity of information on pathway regulation operating in the grasses (Poaceae), which include plants of world-wide agronomic importance. As a result, efforts to either breed for or metabolically engineer improvements in carotenoid content or composition in cereal crops have led to unexpected results. In comparison to maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa) accumulates no endosperm carotenoids, despite having a functional pathway in chloroplasts. To better understand why these two related grasses differ in endosperm carotenoid content, we began to characterize genes encoding phytoene synthase (PSY), since this nuclear-encoded enzyme appeared to catalyze a rate-controlling step in the plastid-localized biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme had been previously associated with the maize Y1 locus thought to be the only functional gene controlling PSY accumulation, though function of the Y1 gene product had never been demonstrated. We show that both maize and rice possess and express products from duplicate PSY genes, PSY1 (Y1) and PSY2; PSY1 transcript accumulation correlates with carotenoid-containing endosperm. Using a heterologous bacterial system, we demonstrate enzyme function of PSY1 and PSY2 that are largely conserved in sequence except for N- and C-terminal domains. By database mining and use of ortholog-specific universal PCR primers, we found that the PSY duplication is prevalent in at least eight subfamilies of the Poaceae, suggesting that this duplication event preceded evolution of the Poaceae. These findings will impact study of grass phylogeny and breeding of enhanced carotenoid content in an entire taxonomic group of plant crops critical for global food security.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agrasses 3arice 3aZea mays 3abiosynthesis 3amessenger RNA 3aevolution 3aOryza sativa 3aphytoene synthase 3acorn 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3agene duplication 3acarotenoids 3anucleotide sequences 3agene expression regulation 2aBase Sequence 2aCarotenoidsxbiosynthesis. 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Plantxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Duplication 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPoaceaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aZea maysxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0aPoaceae1 aMatthews, P.D.1 aLi, F.1 aWurtzel, E.T.0 tPlant physiology.g2004 July, v. 135, no. 3 p.1776-1783dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.104.0398183Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/09/22  aOther US 7aarticle03015naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002000161245015600181300001400337500002400351500001500375520119500390650003001585650002701615650000901642650001901651650003001670650001501700650002301715650003401738650001101772650001701783650001801800650003301818650002701851650002301878650002301901650001601924653001501940653001401955653001401969653001801983653002002001700001602021700001602037700001902053700002402072700001402096700001602110773012002126852000902246856007702255930003302332945002502365946001102390655001202401IND4364763720221118015317.0041001e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436476372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Near-isogenic rice lines C101LAC and C101A51 carrying these two major genes for blast resistance in the background of a most blast-susceptible genotype were used for developing the pyramids. The closely linked RFLP marker RZ536 and NBS-LRR r10 marker for Pi-1 and a PCR-based SAP marker RG64 for Piz-5 were used to identify the genes in the parents and in marker-assisted breeding of the pyramided populations. To achieve multiple resistance against blast and blight in this cultivar, these blast-resistant pyramids were transformed with the cloned bacterial blight resistance gene Xa21 known to confer resistance to all races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Bioassays with six independent transformants showed that transgenic CO39 plants were resistant to both pathogens, M. grisea and Xoo. We report here the stacking of three major genes (Pi-1 + Piz-5 + Xa21) into rice using two different approaches of molecular breeding: marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genetic transformation. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3agenetic transformation 3arice 3aplant breeding 3amarker-assisted selection 3abiolistics 3agenetic resistance 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3ablight 3aOryza sativa 3ablast disease 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3amajor genes 0aPiz-5 gene 0aPi-1 gene 0aXa21 gene 0agene transfer 0agene pyramiding1 aBaisakh, N.1 aOliva, N.P.1 aVeraCruz, C.M.1 aGnanamanickam, S.S.1 aDatta, K.1 aDatta, S.K.0 tMolecular breeding.g2004 Aug., v. 14, no. 1 p.61-71dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1380-3743/contents3electronic resource  a20041005b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02726naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245015300160300001400313500002400327500001500351520102800366650002801394650001801422650002501440650002301465650001201488650002001500650003001520650003001550650001401580650001401594650002101608650002301629650002701652650002301679650002601702650002001728650001801748653001901766700001601785700001501801700001801816700001701834700001701851700001701868773012001885852000902005856007702014930003302091945002502124946001102149655001202160IND4364761120221118015254.0041001e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436476112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The marker-assisted selection program was initiated from a doubled-haploid line issued from the mapping population and involved three cycles of marker-assisted backcross (MAB). Two populations, derived by selfing the plants selected after the first selection cycle, were genotyped and evaluated phenotypically for their resistance level. The additive and epistatic effects of the four resistance factors were re-detected and validated in these populations, indicating that introgression of 4 QTLs in this MAB program was successful. A decrease of the effect for the moderate-effect QTLs and of the epistatic interaction was observed. Phenotypic evaluations of horticultural traits were performed on sample of each backcross generation. The results indicated an efficient return to the recipient phenotype using this MAB strategy. 3aquantitative trait loci 3asweet peppers 3aPhytophthora capsici 3agenetic resistance 3aalleles 3aCapsicum annuum 3amarker-assisted selection 3afungal diseases of plants 3aphenotype 3aepistasis 3aagronomic traits 3achromosome mapping 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3aadditive gene effects 3agenetic markers 3aintrogression 0aplant breeding1 aPalloix, A.1 aServin, B.1 aDaubeze, A.M.1 aSignoret, P.1 aHospital, F.1 aLefebvre, V.0 tMolecular breeding.g2004 Aug., v. 14, no. 1 p. 9-20dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1380-3743/contents3electronic resource  a20041005b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02313naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001300146245012100159300001600280500002400296500001500320520099600335650001501331650002201346650001601368650001401384650001701398650002201415650001101437650002901448650001301477650001401490650002001504650001701524653001301541653001901554700001601573773009401589852000901683856007001692930003301762945002501795946001101820655001201831IND4364732120221118015220.0040930e20040901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436473212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL210 0aM120 0aM0011 aWang, C.10aEffects of sex steroids on gonadal development and gender determination in the sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus  ap. 483-498.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrevious work has demonstrated the presence of various sex steroids in molluscs and suggested their possible functions in the control of reproduction. However, their potential roles in early sexual development have remained unexplored. The results of the present study showed that injections of estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) all accelerated gonadal differentiation and shifted sex ratios toward more males in the sea scallop. Morphological changes were also observed in the females of steroid-injected groups. Estradiol appeared to stimulate oocyte growth while testosterone appeared to induce degeneration of oocytes. No parallel changes were noted in males of steroid-injected groups. Hermaphroditic animals were also found in the progesterone- and DHEA-injected groups. Together, these results support the hypothesis that sex steroids are involved in invertebrate reproduction and may be exploited for gender manipulation in bivalve aquaculture. 3aprasterone 3aanimal morphology 3amariculture 3asex ratio 3aprogesterone 3asex determination 3agonads 3aPlacopecten magellanicus 3ascallops 3aestradiol 3amollusc culture 3atestosterone 0asteroids 0aanimal anatomy1 aCroll, R.P.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 238, no. 1-4 p.483-498dElsevier Pub.

A protein delivery system was developed based on a proteolytic mechanism used by Solanaceous plants to produce the very small (18 amino acid) signaling peptide systemin from the polypeptide prosystemin. Fusion of the gene encoding the 23 kDa protein prosystemin with the antimicrobial peptide (pep11) sequence, replacing the systemin sequence, allowed for expression in transgenic tomato plants. Six days after inoculation with the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans, detached leaflets of transgenic tomato (Rutgers) exhibited a reduction in lesion size of at least 50 percent. 3atomatoes 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3apolypeptides 3agenetic resistance 3aleaf blight 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aplant proteins 3aPhytophthora infestans 3afungal diseases of plants 3aantimicrobial peptides 3agene expression 3apotatoes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3aleaves 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aOspina-Giraldo, M.1 aClemente, T.0 tMolecular breeding.g2004 Aug., v. 14, no. 1 p.83-89dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1380-3743/contents3electronic resource  a20041005b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02558naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245008400161300001400245500002400259500001500283520061300298650002300911650002000934650002000954650002000974650002300994650002101017650003001038650002001068650002101088650002201109650001001131650002201141650001401163650001401177650002201191650002901213650002701242650001801269650002201287650001501309650002901324650002201353650001801375653002701393653003001420700001401450700001301464700001501477700001701492700001501509700001701524700002101541700001501562700002001577773012001597852000901717856007701726930003301803945002501836946001101861655001201872IND4364764920221118015304.0041001e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436476492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, many sources of resistance are known amongst primitive and wild relatives of cultivated potato, Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum. Currently, in the UK, the major threat is due to Globodera pallida, resistance to which has not yet been effectively deployed in potato cultivars. We have performed linkage and QTL analysis of a tetraploid potato population segregating for the 'H3' source of resistance to G. pallida that was introgressed into cultivated potato from the primitive species, Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigena. This source is highly effective against the most common UK pathotype of G. pallida (Pa2/3) and its deployment in breeding material is a major goal. We adopted an approach involving bulked segregant analysis (BSA) as well as genome wide linkage analysis using AFLP and SSR markers. BSA provided a concentration of markers linked in coupling to a QTL on linkage group IV, and improved the accuracy of the QTL localisation. By performing an analysis on residual scores after removal of the effects due to the major QTL, we detected a second QTL on linkage group XI. 3aquantitative trait loci 3aplant breeding 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3alinkage groups 3agene segregation 3aSolanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum 3aGlobodera pallida 3apotatoes 3achromosome mapping 3aautopolyploidy 3ainterspecific hybridization 3acyst nematodes 3apest resistance 3aSolanum tuberosum subsp. andigenum 3agenetic markers 3aintrogression 0abulked segregant analysis 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0alinkage (genetics)1 aMcLean, K.1 aPande, B.1 aPurvis, A.1 aHackett, C.A.1 aBradshaw, J.E.1 aWaugh, R.0 tMolecular breeding.g2004 Sept., v. 14, no. 2 p.105-116dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1380-3743/contents3electronic resource  a20041005b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03332naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245010200160300001500262500002400277500001500301520160300316650002801919650002501947650001901972650001101991650001702002650002302019650001002042650002002052650001802072650003002090650001202120650002302132650002702155650002302182650001802205650003702223650001902260650002602279653002002305653002202325653002502347700001702372700002102389700001902410700002002429700001602449773012202465852000902587856007702596930003302673945002502706946001102731655001202742IND4364766820221118015111.0041001e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436476682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Resistance to the diseases kernel discoloration (KD) and Fusarium head blight (FHB) in barley is complex and technically difficult to assess, and therefore QTLs for these traits are suitable targets for MAS. We selected two lines, from a QTL mapping population created using the resistant variety Chevron, and crossed them to susceptible parents to generate two validation populations. Genetic maps of both populations were developed for five chromosomes covering 15 selected regions containing QTLs for FHB severity, KD score and concentration of deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin produced by the FHB pathogen. QTL analyses using these validation populations confirmed that five of the possible 15 QTL regions were associated with at least one of the three traits. While some QTL were detected inconsistently across environments, QTL that could be subjected to validation in both populations were confirmed in both populations in seven out of eight instances. A QTL for KD score on chromosome 6(6H) was confirmed in both validation populations in eight of nine environments and was also associated with FHB in three of six environments. A QTL for FHB on chromosome 2(2H) was confirmed and was also associated with KD and heading date. Marker assisted selection at these two QTLs should enhance disease resistance, however, the QTL on chromosome 2(2H) will also delay heading date. 3aquantitative trait loci 3aFusarium graminearum 3aplant breeding 3abarley 3abiosynthesis 3agenetic resistance 3aseeds 3aHordeum vulgare 3adiscoloration 3afungal diseases of plants 3aheading 3achromosome mapping 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3ascab diseases 3agenotype-environment interaction 3adeoxynivalenol 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 0aGibberella zeae 0aplant development 0aCochliobolus sativus1 aNduulu, L.M.1 aMuehlbauer, G.J.1 aDill-Macky, R.1 aRasmusson, D.C.1 aSmith, K.P.0 tMolecular breeding.g2004 Sept., v. 14, no. 2 p.91-104dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1380-3743/contents3electronic resource  a20041005b20041101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/10/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02920naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001400137245013000151300001300281500002400294500001500318520123600333650001701569650004501586650002801631650002701659650001201686650004301698650003701741650002201778650002801800650002601828650002001854650002301874650000901897650002201906650001401928650002001942650003501962653002301997653001602020653003702036653003702073700001702110773009102127852000902218856007002227930003302297945002502330946001102355655001202366IND4364714420221118015132.0040929e20040901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436471442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aM120 0aM0011 aLiu, Z.J.10aDNA marker technologies and their applications in aquaculture genetics.

With DNA markers, it is theoretically possible to observe and exploit genetic variation in the entire genome. Popular genetic markers in the aquaculture community include allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, RFLP, RAPD, AFLP, microsatellite, SNP, and EST markers. The application of DNA markers has allowed rapid progress in aquaculture investigations of genetic variability and inbreeding, parentage assignments, species and strain identification, and the construction of high-resolution genetic linkage maps for aquaculture species. Well-designed studies using these genetic markers will undoubtedly accelerate identification of genes involved in quantitative trait loci (QTL) for marker-assisted selection. In this review, the principles, potential power, requirements, advantages, and disadvantages of the various marker types are discussed, along with their applications in a variety of aquaculture studies. Included are discussions on how to efficiently exploit research progress made from the Human Genome Project and from other model species such as zebrafish for the benefit of aquaculture genomics and aquaculture genetics research. 3afish culture 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aquantitative trait loci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ahybrids 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aanimal identification 3aanimal genetics 3achromosome mapping 3afish 3agenetic variation 3aallozymes 3agenetic markers 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aliterature reviews 0aaquaculture 0arandom amplified polymorphic DNA 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aCordes, J.F.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 238, no. 1-4 p.1-37dElsevier Pub.

Two efficacy trials were conducted. In Trial 1, channel catfish eggs in their natural gelatinous matrix were treated with hydrogen peroxide at 0, 500, and 750 mg l-1. Channel catfish eggs in Trial 2 had the gelatinous matrix removed before treatment with hydrogen peroxide at 0 and 500 mg l-1. Each treatment regimen was tested in triplicate and each egg jar contained ~17,400 eggs. Hydrogen peroxide was administered as a 15-min flow-through treatment applied once daily for a total of six applications. Control jars were similarly treated with culture water. Samples of exposure water were collected during each treatment and analyzed to verify actual treatment concentrations. Hydrogen peroxide treatment efficacy was assessed by comparing the percent egg hatch in the treatment group to the untreated control group in each trial. Mean percent hatch in Trial 1 was 44% (control), 54% (500 mg l-1), and 69% (750 mg l-1). Hydrogen peroxide treatment at either 500 or 750 mg l-1 significantly (P<0.01) increased the percent hatch compared to the untreated control group. In Trial 2, hydrogen peroxide treatment at 500 mg l-1 significantly (P<0.01) increased the percent egg hatch (67%) relative to the untreated controls (57%). Hydrogen peroxide treatment reduced egg mortality and increased the percent hatch of channel catfish eggs regardless of whether eggs were incubated in the gelatinous matrix or without the matrix in comparison to the untreated control. 3aIctalurus punctatus 3acatfish 3afreshwater fish 3adisease control 3afish diseases 3amycoses 3aSaprolegnia parasitica 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aantifungal properties 3afish culture 3afreshwater aquaculture 3awater quality 3afish eggs 3ahatching1 aValentine, J.J.1 aSchreier, T.M.1 aGaikowski, M.P.1 aCrawford, T.G.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 238, no. 1-4 p.135-142dElsevier Pub.

Synergism in expression from the promoter of the defense gene PR-1a was also observed. Although the ROS hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid were poor inducers alone, they enhanced the level of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity expressed from the PR-1a promoter when applied with SA to a transgenic plant bearing a PR-1a::GUS fusion. PR-1a expression was not correlated with increased cell death as determined by Evans blue staining. There was no effect on the timing at which expression was increased by the mixture compared with the separate treatments. The mixture of hydrogen peroxide and SA partially mimicked the effect of a commercial product Oxycom that has field efficacy in improving plant performance. Repetitive applications of Oxycom enhanced expression from the PR-1a promoter and the production of the PR-1 protein. Enhanced activity occurred systemically both from aerial applications to single leaves and from root drenches. Root application strongly promoted veinal expression for the PR-1a promoter compared with confluent production in leaves of sprayed seedlings. Application methods and timing may aid in the success of activators of systemic acquired resistance in field conditions. 3aapplication timing 3acell death 3aapplication methods 3asalicylic acid 3apromoter regions 3aperacetic acid 3asystemic acquired resistance 3ahydrogen peroxide 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3asynergism 3aresistance mechanisms 3aenzyme activity 3atobacco 3aplant genetics 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 3atransgenic plants 3adosage 3abeta-glucuronidase 3asynergists 0aOxycom 0areactive oxygen species1 aYang, K.Y.1 aAnderson, A.

Farmed Atlantic cod has a body composition different from wild-captured cod. The most prominent differences are the higher condition factor, larger liver and smaller head. The main purpose of the present work was to compare activities of some major hydrolytic enzymes in liver and digestive tract of farmed cod, which had been starved 10 and 25 days before slaughter, with the corresponding activities in wild-captured cod. Ten wild-captured and 10 farmed cod (3.1-4.6 kg) were subjected to analyses. It was found that the amount of stomach pepsin activity was significantly lower in farmed cod, whereas the content of tryptic enzyme activities, particularly chymotrypsin, were slightly higher. Due to the high hepato-somatic index (14.4), the farmed cod had a much higher β-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in liver than the wild-captured cod. Increasing the pre-slaughter starving period from 10 to 25 days gave no significant reduction in any of the digestive enzyme activities measured. This indicates that the activities of digestive enzymes in carnivorous species, like cod, remain at high levels even during long time starvation. 3afish farms 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3afeeds 3adietary fat 3aanimal morphology 3afeed deprivation 3acod (fish) 3apepsin 3afarmed fish 3aslaughter 3amarine fish 3atrypsin 3aGadus morhua 3achymotrypsin 3amariculture 3awild animals 3afeed composition 3aenzyme activity 3afish culture 3adietary protein 3aliver 3abody composition 0acondition factor 0ahepato-somatic index 0aproteinases0 tAquaculture.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 238, no. 1-4 p.343-353dElsevier Pub.

Use of coated FAA in diets could provide benefits by slowing the rate of FAA absorption and perhaps by increasing utilization efficiency. A laboratory feeding trial was conducted to determine the effect of two coatings--tripalmitin-polyvinyl alcohol (TPA) and cellulose-acetate-phthalate (CAP)--on absorption of supplemental methionine by Nile tilapia. Forty-five adult fish (mean weight, 185 g) were stocked individually in 5-l aquaria and fed one of three, semipurified diets containing uncoated L-[35S]methionine (UM) or TPA- or CAP-coated methionine as 50% of the dietary sulfur amino acid requirement. Three fish were taken from each treatment 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h after force-feeding to measure relative rates of 35S uptake and the amount of 35S-activity in intestinal tissues, liver, spleen, muscle, and blood plasma. Methionine uptake was highest in the foregut area, but absorption appeared to occur throughout the length of the intestine, including the hindgut. TPA-coated methionine was absorbed more slowly than uncoated methionine and fish fed with TPA-coated methionine had significantly lower levels of 35S-activity in tissues than fish fed with UM. Activity of labeled methionine in tissues of fish fed with CAP-coated methionine usually was not significantly different from 35S-activity in fish fed with UM. The TPA coating appeared to effectively slow the absorption of free methionine in the gut of Nile tilapia, but additional work is needed to determine if TPA-coated methionine is utilized more efficiently than the uncoated amino acid. 3aOreochromis niloticus 3atilapia (common name) 3afreshwater fish 3afeed conversion 3adigestive tract 3aintestinal absorption 3aliver 3aspleen 3amuscle tissues 3afish feeding 3afeeds 3afeed supplements 3amicroencapsulation 3afree amino acids 3amethionine 3atriacylglycerols 3aalcohols 3afish culture 3afreshwater aquaculture 0atripalmitin-polyvinyl alcohol 0acellulose-acetate-phthalate1 aReigh, R.C.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 238, no. 1-4 p.355-367dElsevier Pub.

The sulfide removal capacity of two local soils (Terre Rosse and Bazalt) was compared with four commercially available hematite ores. Terre Rosse soil, with iron content of 8% by mass, showed high reactivity towards sulfide. 57Fe Mossbauer analysis of the soil revealed that the iron content is distributed as hematite (43%), goethite (33%) and iron silicates (24%). Dissolution potential experiments conducted at a high sulfide concentration (1200 mg S l-1 at the end of the reaction) showed that 1 kg of Terre Rosse soil can remove up to 25 g of H2S-S at pH values typical in aquaculture practice (near neutral), and that the reactive iron phase (i.e. the part that reacts with sulfide) is ~40% of the total iron mass in the soil. The dissolution potential experiments were considered in conjunction with the analysis of the temperature evolution (300-5 K) of the Mossbauer data that also revealed ~40% of the iron content to exist as nano-structured iron-oxides phases. The anticipated high surface-to-volume ratio and enhanced reactivity of such nanophase iron oxides, compared to bulk "micronic" materials is supposed to be the likely cause of the high reactivity of this soil. In an experiment performed with gradual addition of low sulfide concentrations (up to about 10 mg S l-1) to simulate biological sulfide formation in anaerobic sediments, sulfide breakthrough occurred after the removal of 9.5 g S (kg soil)-1. Under anaerobic conditions, sulfide removal was found to proceed via a redox reaction (end product: elemental sulfur) followed by FeS precipitation. Reaction kinetics was found to be pseudo-first order with respect to the total sulfide concentration. The iron oxides in the soil react rapidly in the presence of sulfide--the reactive iron fraction in the soil dissolves almost completely after about 1 day in the presence of a high sulfide concentration (>0.9 g S l-1). At low concentrations, 2 g of Terre Rosse reduced the sulfide concentration from 200 to about 5 mg S l-1 in around 120 h (solution VOLUME=63 ml). In practical terms, it is hypothesized that an addition of 3 to 4 kg-soil m-2-sediment prior to seasonal de-stratification of fish farming reservoirs will significantly reduce the toxic effects and rapid oxygen consumption rates associated with sulfide dispersal following abrupt mixing of the water column. 3afreshwater aquaculture 3asoil chemical properties 3airon oxides 3aspectral analysis 3ahydrogen sulfide 3atoxic substances 3aadverse effects 3asediments1 aRitvo, G.1 aSlijper, I.1 aHearne, G.1 aCochva, M.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 238, no. 1-4 p.263-281dElsevier Pub.

Sugar beet seedlings of the susceptible cv. Auris were grown in a standard soil for 14 days. A monoconidial culture of a C. beticola isolate was grown to produce conidia. In experiment 1, roots were immersed in a conidial suspension of isolate code IRS 00-4, or in tap water (control), for 2 days. After incubation seedlings were potted in a peat - fine river sand mixture and placed at low relative humidity (RH) (<80%) or high RH (approximately equal to 100%). Twelve days after infection, seedlings at high RH showed more disease incidence (90%) than seedlings grown at low RH (disease incidence = 25%), whereas no disease symptoms developed in the control seedlings. Cercospora leaf spots (CLSs) developed on the cotyledons, leaves, petioles and stems of the seedlings. In experiment 2, roots were immersed in a conidial suspension of isolate code IRS 00-2 for 5 h. Thirty-four days after infection at high RH, 100% disease incidence was observed in the treated seedlings and one CLS in the control treatment. First indications of leaf spot development were observed as reddish purple discolouration of individual parenchymatic cells. Because splash dispersal and symptoms due to infested soil were excluded, we showed that it is possible to obtain CLS symptoms in sugar beet seedlings when their roots were immersed in conidial suspensions of C. beticola, thus demonstrating that roots can be a primary infection site. 3aroot diseases 3asugar beet 3aCercospora beticola 3aconidia 3afungal diseases of plants 3asuspensions 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3aleaf spot 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afoliar diseases 3aroots 3ainfection 3adisease incidence 0aisolation 0aleaf spotting1 aSchneider, H.J.H.M.1 aTermorshuizen, A.A.J.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2004 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.103-106dKluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0929-1873/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/01/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03586naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001700119245010700136300001600243500002400259500001500283520189500298650001402193650002002207650001402227650002002241650002102261650001302282650004502295650004702340650001402387650001602401650002302417650001802440650001502458650001602473650002202489650002102511650000902532650001802541650002402559650001302583650001202596651001502608653003302623653001402656653002802670700001702698773012202715852000902837856009302846930003302939945002502972946001102997655001203008IND4364679620221118015309.0040927e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436467962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aRisede, J.M.10aPathogenic and genetic diversity of soilborne isolates in Cylindrocladium from banana cropping systems  ap. 139-154.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPathogenicity and genetic variation were investigated within a collection of 104 banana-infecting isolates of Cylindrocladium (teleomorph Calonectria) originating from different countries and representing previously described morphological taxa or species. These root-rot fungi, along with endoparasitic nematodes, have been reported to be causal agents of necrotic lesions that induce root breakage and toppling of banana plants. Little is known about the individual pathogenic effects of the species involved or their genetic diversity. In the present study, among the five morphological taxa found in the banana rhizosphere, only isolates showing an atypical morphology relative to Cylindrocladium gracile (named Cy. gracile-like isolates) and Cy. spathiphylli isolates were pathogenic on banana cultivar Grande Naine. When comparing the latter isolates with others of the same species, but originating from different hosts, an analysis of rDNA spacer polymorphism partitioned isolates of Cy. spathiphylli by host into a banana - tea group and a Heliconia - Spathiphyllum group. Furthermore, isolates from Heliconia were not pathogenic on banana. A pathogenicity assessment of representative isolates from the Cy. gracile-like and the Cy. spathiphylli taxa on six different banana cultivars yielded no evidence of differential interactions between isolates and banana genotypes. Significant differences in susceptibility between banana genotypes were nevertheless detected that could potentially be exploited by breeders. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed a genetic similarity ranging from 70% to 100% within Cy. spathiphylli isolates from bananas regardless of the geographic origin. Moreover, Cy. gracile-like isolates were highly similar but showed only 60% similarity relative to the Cy. gracile reference isolates, thus raising questions about their species status. 3aHeliconia 3alesions (plant) 3aphylogeny 3aCylindrocladium 3adisease severity 3agenotype 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3acultivars 3aCalonectria 3astrain differences 3apathogenicity 3aprovenance 3ateleomorphs 3agenetic variation 3acropping systems 3aMusa 3aSpathiphyllum 3asoil-borne diseases 3aroot rot 3abananas 3aGuadeloupe 0aCylindrocladium spathiphylli 0aisolation 0aCylindrocladium gracile1 aSimoneau, P.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2004 Feb., v. 110, no. 2 p.139-154dKluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0929-1873/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02135naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003500097040001800132100001900150245009900169300001600268520063800284650001500922650001600937650001500953650001000968650000900978650001300987650000901000653003201009653003101041653003101072653002601103653003701129653003101166653002701197653003001224653003201254653004501286653004901331653002801380653003901408773009701447852000901544856004801553939003301601945000801634946001101642655001201653991626495810742620221118015131.0830805e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830068162DNAL7 a10.1017/S0022149X000094572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSprent, J.F.A.10aAscaridoid nematodes of amphibians and reptiles: Typhlophorus, Hartwichia and Trispiculascaris  ap. 179-189.  aFour little-known ascaridoid species occurring in crocodilians are discussed.

Feld1 is responsible for cat allergy and has also been established to cause cat-induced asthma. The allergen is a 38 kDa dimer composed of two 19 kDa subunits. Each 19 kDa subunit comprises two disulfide linked polypeptide chains, a light alpha-chain and a heavy beta-chain containing an N-linked oligosaccharide. In this study a variety of endoproteinase digestions of the native allergen in combination with HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry was used to determine the position of the disulfide bridges and to demonstrate that the peptide chains are linked in an anti parallel way. Enzymatic digestion of the reduced and alkylated peptides located the N-glycan to Asn33. Moreover, Feld1 is found to be partially truncated and to exist in several isoforms. Sequential degradation of the glycosylated peptide with specific glycosidases monitored by mass spectrometry, shows that the glycan is a heterogenous triantennary complex type structure. The heterogeneity is caused by terminal sialic acid and a fucose residue attached to a beta-galactose residue. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 3aanimal physiology 2aAlkylation 2aAllergensxchemistry 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCats 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDisulfidesxchemistry 2aGlycoproteinsxchemistry 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aHydrolysis 2aIsomerism 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPeptide Mapping 2aPolysaccharidesxchemistry 2aProtein Conformation 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization1 aSchou, C.1 aRoepstorff, P.0 tBiological chemistry.g1997 Aug., v. 378, no. 8 p.899-908x1431-67307nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02903naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001600146245017800162300001600340500002400356520126700380650002601647650002301673650002601696650001201722650003201734650002001766650001401786650001401800650001801814650002001832650002301852650004401875650001001919650001601929650001401945650001701959650001601976650001401992650001602006650001402022650001702036650002702053700001602080773009302096852000902189856007002198930003302268945002502301946001102326655001202337IND4363793020221118015151.0040809e20040802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436379302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aM001 0aM1201 aHuang, C.H.10aEffect of dietary vitamin E on growth, tissue lipid peroxidation, and liver glutathione level of juvenile hybrid tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus x O. aureus, fed oxidized oil  ap. 381-389.  aIncludes references  aA feeding experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin E levels on growth, tissue lipid peroxidation, and liver glutathione level of juvenile hybrid tilapia fed diets containing oxidized oil.

However, a large proportion of such products available on the international market may possess genetically modified (GM) components. This report concerns a study to investigate the fate and survival of ingested GM soy DNA fragments (120 and 195 bp) and a 180-bp fragment of the lectin gene of soybean (Glycine max) during feeding trials with Atlantic salmon post-smolt. Specifically, the study focused on the fate of selected GM soy DNA fragments from feed to fish to investigate their survival through the fish gastrointestinal (GI) tract and whether the DNA could be traced in a variety of fish tissues. Fish were fed three experimental diets for 6 weeks, which were formulated from defined components and represented either GM or non-GM materials (17.2% of the fish meal was replaced with either GM or non-GM soy). A control diet composed of fish meal as the only protein source was used for comparison purposes. The transgenic sequences (120 and 195 bp) and the lectin gene (180 bp) could be detected in the GM soy feed. In the fish GI tract, however, only the smaller DNA fragment (120 bp) could be amplified from the content of the stomach, pyloric region, mid intestine and distal intestine. No transgenic or conventional soy DNA fragments could be detected in liver, muscle or brain tissues resected from sacrificed fish. The sensitivity limit of the method was evaluated to be 20 copies. These data indicate that GM soy transgenic sequences may survive passage through the GI tract but that they cannot be traced in fish tissues. 3aSalmo salar 3asalmon 3aanadromous fish 3aintestines 3afish feeding 3afish culture 3afeed composition 3aplant source protein 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3atransgenic plants 3agenetic engineering 3alectins 3asequence analysis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aBruce, I.J.1 aRahman, M.A.1 aHemre, G.I.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Aug. 2, v. 237, no. 1-4 p.391-405dElsevier Pub.

The method has general validity in the present study indicated by highly significant correlations obtained between calculated and experimentally obtained % prehatch survival.

The biosynthetic pathways of C27-BRs were examined using a cell-free enzyme solution prepared from tomato seedlings that yielded the biosynthetic sequences cholesterol leads to cholestanol and 6-deoxo-28-norteasterone in equilibrium with 6-deoxo-28-nor-3-dehydroteasterone in equilibrium with 6-deoxo-28-nortyphasterol leads to 6-deoxo-28-norcastasterone leads to 28-norcastasterone (28-norCS). Arabidopsis CYP85A1 that was heterologously expressed in yeast mediated the conversion of 6-deoxo-28-norCS to 28-norCS. The same reaction was catalyzed by an enzyme solution from wild-type tomato but not by an extract derived from a tomato dwarf mutant with a defect in CYP85. Furthermore, exogenously applied 28-norCS restored the abnormal growth of the dwarf mutant. These findings indicate that the C-6 oxidation of 6-deoxo-28-norCS to 28-norCS in tomato seedlings is catalyzed by CYP85, just as in the conversion of 6-deoxoCS to CS. Additionally, the cell-free solution also catalyzed the C-24 methylation of 28-norCS to CS in the presence of NADPH and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a reaction that was clearly retarded in the absence of NADPH and SAM. Thus it seems that C27-BRs, in addition to C28-BRs, are important in the production of more active C28-BRs and CS, where a SAM-dependent sterol methyltransferase appears to biosynthetically connect C27-BRs to C28-BRs. Moreover, the tomato cell-free solution converted CS to 26-norCS and [2H6]CS to [2H3]28-norCS, suggesting that C-28 demethylation is an artifact due to an isotope effect. Although previous feeding experiments employing [2H6]CS suggested that 28-norCS was synthesized from CS in certain plant species, this is not supported in planta. Altogether, this study demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that 28-norCS is not synthesized from CS but from cholesterol. In addition, CS and [2H6]CS were not converted into BL and [2H6]BL, respectively, confirming an earlier finding that the active BR in tomato seedlings is not BL but CS. In conclusion, the biosynthesis of 28-norBRs appears to play a physiologically important role in maintaining homeostatic levels of CS in tomato seedlings.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atomatoes 3abiosynthesis 3avegetable crops 3abiochemical pathways 3acholesterol 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxidation 3adwarf cultivars 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aCholestanolsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCholesterolxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0asteroids 0amolecular sequence data 0acastastereone1 aChang, S.C.1 aLee, J.S.1 aTakatsuto, S.1 aYokota, T.1 aKim, S.K.0 tPlant physiology.g2004 July, v. 135, no. 3 p.1231-1242dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.104.0435883Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/09/21  aOther US 7aarticle03439naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001800180245011700198300001600315500002400331520135400355650002201709650001001731650001101741650002701752650002001779650001501799650002801814650002001842650002401862650001101886650002001897650003101917650001201948650002301960650001201983650002601995650002602021650002502047650005002072650005402122650003402176650005102210650005002261653002702311653001902338653002702357700001502384700001802399773010902417852000902526856007402535856011102609930003302720945002502753946001102778655001202789IND4363770020221118015011.0040806e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436377002DNAL7 a153076702pmid7 a10.1002/ps.8752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF110 0aF6001 aEllis, M.C.B.14aThe effect of different spray liquids on the foliar retention of agricultural sprays by wheat plants in a canopy  ap. 786-794.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this work was to examine the effect of liquid properties on spray retention in a range of situations representative of practical pesticide application. Liquids with different physical properties were sprayed with conventional flat-fan and air-induction nozzles onto outdoor-grown wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L cv Axona) at growth stages between GS 22 and GS 35. Since total retention is affected by leaf surface as well as plant growth stage and canopy density, the experiments included spraying both single leaves and groups of plants with different canopy densities. Retention on whole plants was strongly influenced by plant growth and canopy properties. Individual leaf surfaces were not as water-repellent as was found previously for younger indoor-grown plants, reducing the effect of dynamic surface tension on retention. This, combined with the increased probability of droplets hitting foliage in a denser canopy, gave reduced differences in retention between liquids when compared with similar measurements made previously on younger plants. With a leaf area index greater than 7, retention on whole plants was almost independent of liquid. Air-induction nozzles gave lower levels of retention than flat-fan nozzles, with this difference greatest when spraying high dynamic surface tension liquids and at low crop densities. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3acanopy 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease control 3afungicides 3aplant growth substances 3afoliar spraying 3apesticide adjuvants 3aleaves 3asurface tension 3aphysicochemical properties 3aliquids 3aplant architecture 3anozzles 3afield experimentation 3alaboratory techniques 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aPesticide Synergistsxadministration & dosage 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSurface Tensionxdrug effects 2aSurface-Active Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aTriticumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 0anozzle characteristics 0acanopy density 0aspray liquid retention1 aWebb, D.A.1 aWestern, N.M.0 tPest management science.g2004 Aug., v. 60, no. 8 p.786-794dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.8753Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-4998/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDdMKSe2004/08/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02066naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191100001600200245012900216300001800345500002400363520049100387650001300878650000900891650002500900650002000925650002100945650002400966650002400990650001901014650004501033650003201078650002401110700001801134700001801152700001901170700001901189773011501208852000901323856009401332856007701426930003301503945002501536946001101561655001201572IND4363767620221118014950.0040806e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436376762DNAL7 a152183832pmid7 a10.1023/B:BILE.0000032968.56387.452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS100 0aS200 0aX3001 aVijeeta, T.10aPhospholipase-mediated preparation of 1-ricinoleoyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine from soya and egg phosphatidylcholine  ap. 1077-1080.  aIncludes references  a1-Ricinoleoyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was prepared by incorporating ricinoleic acid completely in the sn-1 position of egg and soya phosphatidylcholine (PC) using immobilized phospholipase A1 as the catalyst.

To comply with the new regulations, the EU wants new techniques such as adapted feeding strategies and low emission building techniques to reduce ammonia emissions from livestock buildings. However, such ammonia restriction measures are only useful when their efficiency can be measured in the field. Current reliable measuring techniques are mainly based on continuous measurements over a long period (up to 200 days), and this requires expensive equipment. This makes them unsuitable for permanent evaluation on a large number of buildings. The main objective of the study presented here was the development of a procedure to determine NH3 emissions from livestock buildings in the field, based on a limited number of measuring days. This method allows several buildings to be evaluated 'simultaneously' with the same measuring installation. In this study, high frequent ammonia measurements were taken from real livestock buildings for a year and were used to calculate NH3 emission factors for pig houses. A procedure was developed based on the knowledge that NH3 emission is strongly related to other variables that can be more easily measured over a yearly period, such as temperature, ventilation rate, number of animals and animal weight. Another assumption was that farm management could have significant influence on NH3 emission, and consequently, this must be incorporated into the predictions. The prediction error between the measured and the calculated total NH3 emission was less than 3% when only 8 days were selected over a whole year, on condition that 4 days were selected within the same growth period and 4 other days are selected in at least two other growth periods. 3aammonia 3aemissions 3ameasurement 3aanimal housing 3aswine 3aequations 3alinear models1 aClaes, S.1 aHendriks, J.1 aDarius, P.1 aBerckmans, D.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2004 July, v. 88, no. 3 p.351-358dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103electronic resource  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/09/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03451naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001800146245010500164300001400269500002400283500001500307520192000322650001702242650001902259650002102278650001202299650001802311650001502329650001402344650001602358650001402374650002702388650001102415650002002426650002302446650001202469650003202481650001402513650002202527653001202549653002602561653002502587700001602612700001802628773009102646852000902737856007002746930003302816945002502849946001102874655001202885IND4363782720221118015049.0040809e20040802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436378272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL210 0aM001 0aM1201 aNa-Nakorn, U.10aAllotriploidy increases sterility in the hybrid between Clarias macrocephalus and Clarias gariepinus  ap. 73-88.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHybrids between female Thai walking catfish (Clarias macrocephalus) and male African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) are capable of reproducing, and this has led to introgression of genes from the paternal species into natural populations of the native C. macrocephalus. Therefore this study was conducted aiming at producing sterile triploid hybrids by means of cold shock. Eggs from C. macrocephalus were fertilized with sperm from C. gariepinus and were subsequently immersed in cold water (7°C) starting 4.5 min after water activation of the eggs, and lasting for 14 min. The cold shock induced 72%, 74% and 88% triploid fish with 44-49% hatching success compared to the control value of 69-78%. At 28 weeks old body weight of the triploid fish was smaller than the diploid counterparts. The frequencies of retarded gonads and ovotestes were smaller in diploid as compared to the triploid hybrids. The average gonado-somatic index (GSI) of female diploid F1 hybrids was significantly higher than those of the triploids whereas male GSI of the two groups were not statistically different. Fifty percents of the diploid testes produced a few spermatozoa while only 15.8% of the triploid testes did. Likewise larger percentage of the female diploid hybrids (64.3%) had well-developed ovaries marked with vitellogenic oocytes as compared to the triploids (21%). At 44-week-old, although the triploid and diploid females showed similar response to hormone injection, the triploids produced significantly less eggs than the diploids. Both diploid and triploid eggs were capable to fertilize sperm of C. macrocephalus. However, all fry from the triploid F1 hybrids died at yolk absorption, whereas approximately 80% of the fry from diploid F1 hybrids survived. No survived fry at yolk absorption were obtained from fertilization between C. macrocephalus eggs and sperm obtained from both triploid and diploid F1 hybrids. 3afish culture 3aallopolyploidy 3aanimal fertility 3ahybrids 3aanimal growth 3agerm cells 3atriploidy 3acold stress 3asex ratio 3afreshwater aquaculture 3agonads 3afreshwater fish 3aClarias gariepinus 3acatfish 3ainterspecific hybridization 3amortality 3asexual dimorphism 0aClarias 0aClarias macrocephalus 0agonado-somatic index1 aRangsin, W.1 aBoon-ngam, J.0 tAquaculture.g2004 Aug. 2, v. 237, no. 1-4 p.73-88dElsevier Pub.

Existing mechanical harvesting systems cause excessive seed (up to 55%) and leaf losses. Harvesting is therefore still commonly done by hand, but manual labour is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. The objective of this study was to design and test a cutter/feeder mechanism for mechanical harvesting of lentils. A self-propelled experimental harvester, which cuts and collects shoots without threshing, was developed for this purpose. Its performance was compared to hand harvesting, in rolled and unrolled fields, using a split plot design. Lentils with 22% moisture (wet basis) were harvested, and then threshed using a stationary thresher. The experimental harvester was operated at 5 km h-1 and a cutting height of 59 mm above the ground. Shattering losses of seed and straw were not significantly different from that which occurred in hand harvesting (F-statistic F<1). Residue losses were those left in the stubble, representing 2% of the seed and 20% of the straw, which can be partially recovered by grazing. 3aseeds 3acutting 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3awater content 3aharvesters 3astraw 3akinematics 3amechanical harvesting 3aLens culinaris 3alentils 3ashoots 3aWest Asia 3aNorthern Africa 0acutter/feeder mechanisms 0aprocessing technology 0amechanical feeding 0aself-propelled harvesters 0acrop residues 0aharvesting losses1 aJaber, N.S.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2004 July, v. 88, no. 3 p.295-304dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/153751103electronic resource  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/09/13  aNon-US 7aarticle04582naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164072000900182072000900191100001400200245010400214300001800318500002400336500001500360506007600375520196200451506003702413650002502450650002602475650002802501650001802529650002202547650002402569650001202593650002602605650002602631650001402657650002402671650002902695650002002724650001002744650001902754650001302773650003902786650002802825650002102853650002602874650003002900650003802930650001702968650002402985650004403009650002503053650004403078650004003122650003103162650003103193650002403224650003803248650002703286653002403313653002203337653003103359700001403390700002103404700001503425773011103440852000903551856008203560856005103642930003303693945002503726946001303751655001203764IND4364066520221207140532.0040824e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436406652DNAL7 a152732952pmid7 aPMC5192032pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.104.0226162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF5001 aPrice, J.10aGlobal transcription profiling reveals multiple sugar signal transduction mechanisms in Arabidopsis  ap. 2128-2150.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aComplex and interconnected signaling networks allow organisms to control cell division, growth, differentiation, or programmed cell death in response to metabolic and environmental cues. In plants, it is known that sugar and nitrogen are critical nutrient signals; however, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nutrient signal transduction is very limited. To begin unraveling complex sugar signaling networks in plants, DNA microarray analysis was used to determine the effects of glucose and inorganic nitrogen source on gene expression on a global scale in Arabidopsis thaliana. In whole seedling tissue, glucose is a more potent signal in regulating transcription than inorganic nitrogen. In fact, other than genes associated with nitrate assimilation, glucose had a greater effect in regulating nitrogen metabolic genes than nitrogen itself. Glucose also regulated a broader range of genes, including genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction, and metabolite transport. In addition, a large number of stress responsive genes were also induced by glucose, indicating a role of sugar in environmental responses. Cluster analysis revealed significant interaction between glucose and nitrogen in regulating gene expression because glucose can modulate the effects of nitrogen and vise versa. Intriguingly, cycloheximide treatment appeared to disrupt glucose induction more than glucose repression, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is an intermediary event required before most glucose induction can occur. Cross talk between sugar and ethylene signaling may take place on the transcriptional level because several ethylene biosynthetic and signal transduction genes are repressed by glucose, and the repression is largely unaffected by cycloheximide. Collectively, our global expression data strongly support the idea that glucose and inorganic nitrogen act as both metabolites and signaling molecules.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3anitrogen metabolism 3aglucose 3amicroarray technology 3anutrient availability 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3agenes 3agene induction 3anitrates 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCluster Analysis 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aRNAxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agene downregulation 0agene upregulation 0agene expression regulation1 aLaxmi, A.1 aSt. Martin, S.K.1 aJang, J.C.0 tplant cell.g2004 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.2128-2150dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.104.0226163Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20040929b20041003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle03363naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164072000900182072000900191100001600200245012100216300001800337500002400355506007600379520094100455506003701396650002501433650002101458650002101479650002501500650002501525650002001550650001301570650001901583650001201602650001301614650001601627650002901643650001801672650001201690650002001702650002401722650007201746650004801818650001301866650003801879650002001917650002801937650001301965650001401978650001401992650003302006650002302039650003402062650002402096650002702120650006002147653002802207653001402235700001702249700001502266773011102281852000902392856008202401856005102483930003302534945002502567946001302592655001202605IND4364068620221207140530.0040824e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436406862DNAL7 a152582682pmid7 aPMC5192072pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.104.0240182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aThorlby, G.14aThe SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 gene, required for freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, encodes a beta-glucosidase  ap. 2192-2203.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe sensitive to freezing2-1 (sfr2-1) mutation causes freezing sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Transcription of SFR2 was observed to be constitutive rather than stress inducible and was distributed throughout most aerial tissues. SFR2 encodes a protein homologous to family 1 glycosyl hydrolases (beta-glycosidases), but the predicted AtSFR2 protein is divergent from all other family 1 beta-glycosidases of Arabidopsis, showing closer homology to the sequences of several beta-glycosidases from thermophilic archea and bacteria.

Compatible mrb1 mutant strains were able to mate and form dikaryotic hyphae; however, proliferation within infected tissue and the ability to induce tumor development of infected maize (Zea mays) plants were drastically impaired. Surprisingly, manifestation of the mrb1 mutant phenotype selectively depended on the a2 mating type locus. The a2 locus contains, in addition to pheromone signaling components, the genes lga2 and rga2 of unknown function. Deletion of lga2 in an a2deltamrb1 strain fully restored pathogenicity, whereas pathogenicity was partially regained in an a2deltamrb1deltarga2 strain, implicating a concerted action between Lga2 and Rga2 in compromising pathogenicity in deltamrb1 strains. Lga2 and Rga2 localized to mitochondria and Mrb1 interacted with Rga2 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Conditional expression of lga2 in haploid cells reduced vegetative growth, conferred mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial DNA degradation, and interfered with respiratory activity. The consequences of lga2 overexpression depended on the expression strength and were greatly exacerbated in deltamrb1 mutants. We propose that Lga2 interferes with mitochondrial fusion and that Mrb1 controls this activity, emphasizing a critical link between mitochondrial morphology and pathogenicity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUstilago zeae 3aloci 3agenes 3asexual reproduction 3amitochondria 3afungal proteins 3asmut diseases 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amutants 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agene deletion 3apathogenicity 3amitochondrial DNA 3aDNA damage 3aphenotype 0amitochondrial function 0alga2 gene 0arga2 gene1 aAuffarth, K.1 aKahmann, R.1 aBasse, C.W.0 tplant cell.g2004 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.2233-2248dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.104.0226573Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20040930b20041003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/09/30  aOther US 7aarticle02425naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135072000900153072000900162100001700171245012400188300001600312500002400328520065400352650001701006650000901023650001601032650001701048650001501065650001401080650002301094650002501117650002601142650001701168650004701185650005201232650003001284650004301314650004601357650002401403700001601427700001501443700001401458700001501472700001301487773010801500852000901608856007401617856011101691930003301802945002501835946001101860655001201871IND4364040920221118015417.0040820e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436404092DNAL7 a151545182pmid7 a10.1002/ps.8382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aH0001 aKakimoto, T.10aNovel 3,3a,5,9b-tetrahydro-2H-furo[3,2-c][2] benzopyran derivatives: synthesis of chiral glycol benzyl ether herbicides  ap. 493-500.  aIncludes references  aNovel tricyclic 3,3a,5,9b-tetrahydro-2H-furo[3,2-c][2]benzopyran (TFB) derivatives were synthesized, and their herbicidal activities were elucidated.

Their insertion into the outer membrane is insensitive to thermolysin pretreatment of chloroplasts and does not require ATP. It has therefore been assumed that insertion of outer-membrane proteins proceeds through a different pathway from import into the interior of chloroplasts, which requires a thermolysin-sensitive translocon complex and ATP. Here, we show that a model outer-membrane protein, OEP14, competed with the import of a chloroplast interior protein, indicating that the two import pathways partially overlapped. Cross-linking studies showed that, during insertion, OEP14 was associated with Toc75, a thermolysin-resistant component of the outer-membrane protein-conducting channel that mediates the import of interior-targeted precursor proteins. Whereas almost no OEP14 inserted into protein-free liposomes, OEP14 inserted into proteoliposomes containing reconstituted Toc75 with a high efficiency. Taken together, our data indicate that Toc75 mediates OEP14 insertion, and therefore plays a dual role in the targeting of proteins to the outer envelope membrane and interior of chloroplasts.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPisum sativum 3apeas 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3achloroplasts 3acell membranes 3aplant proteins 3aprotein transport 3asignal peptide 3aliposomes (artificial) 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Membranexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aIntracellular Membranesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLiposomesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPeasxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteins 2aProtein Precursorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Sorting Signals 2aProtein Transportxphysiology 0achloroplast outer membrane proteins 0aproteoliposomes 0ainsertion signal 0aprotein import 0aprotein cross-linking 0aprotein insertion1 aChen, L.J.1 aSmith, M.D.1 aSu, Y.S.1 aSchnell, D.J.1 aLi, H.M.0 tplant cell.g2004 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.2078-2088dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.104.0239523Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20040929b20041003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle01022naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002700115245010700142300001600249520011100265650002500376650001500401653001400416653002600430653002200456700002000478773017300498852000900671939003300680945000800713946001100721655001200732991626477050742620221118015543.0831104s1981    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830097282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamilton-Attwell, V.L.10aSEM studies of the integumental variation within samples of Schistosoma mattheei Veglia & Le Roux 1929  ap. 111-112.  aSchistosoma mattheei, variation of integumental structures of mid-dorsal area, scanning electron microcopy 3aSchistosoma mattheei 3aintegument 0avariation 0aMorphology, Trematoda 0aParasite surfaces1 avan Eeden, J.A.0 tProceedings -

The correlations between IFM and MCL and MTSS and MCL data were less strong (r2 = 0.9245 and 0.9339, respectively), due to some deviating results. These deviations concerned mainly substances with pKa values between 1 - 4 and were probably caused by the differences in the pH of the two mobile phases. The standardization of chromatographic conditions is a prerequisite of interlaboratory reproducibility of retention indices. 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 0acomparisons1 aHill, D.W.1 aRehorek, A.0 tJournal of liquid chromatography & related technologies.g1996, v. 19, no. 8 p.1291-1316x1082-60767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/108260796080063193Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02735naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010600170300001600276500002400292520161700316650002901933650001601962650001001978650001501988650001502003650002502018650001202043650001502055650001102070700002002081700001902101700001902120700001902139773010202158852000902260856009202269655001202361IND4401268920221118051730.0080210s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440126892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2007.00333.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnozuka, Mari10aInvolvement of thiaminase II encoded by the THI20 gene in thiamin salvage of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 266-275.  aIncludes references  aThe physiological significance of thiaminase II, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of thiamin, has remained elusive for several decades. The C-terminal domains of THI20 family proteins (THI20/21/22) and the whole region of PET18 gene product of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are homologous to bacterial thiaminase II. On the other hand, the N-terminal domains of THI20 and THI21 encode 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase and 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate kinase involved in the thiamin synthetic pathway. In this study, it was first indicated that the C-terminal domains of the THI20 family and PET18 are not required for de novo thiamin synthesis in S. cerevisiae, using a quadruple deletion strain expressing the N-terminal domain of THI20. Biochemical analysis using cell-free extracts and recombinant proteins demonstrated that yeast thiaminase II activity is exclusively encoded by THI20. It appeared that Thi20p has an affinity for the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin, and HMP produced by the thiaminase II activity is immediately phosphorylated. Thi20p was found to participate in the formation of thiamin from two synthetic antagonists, pyrithiamin and oxythiamin, by hydrolyzing both antagonists and phosphorylating HMP to give HMP pyrophosphate. Furthermore, 2-methyl-4-amino-5-aminomethylpyrimidine, a presumed naturally occurring thiamin precursor, was effectively converted to HMP by incubation with Thi20p. It is proposed that the thiaminase II activity of Thi20p is involved in the thiamin salvage pathway by catalyzing the hydrolysis of HMP precursors in S. cerevisiae. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantagonists 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3aphosphates 3arecombinant proteins 3athiamin 3athiaminase 3ayeasts1 aKonno, Hiroyuki1 aKawasaki, Yuko1 aAkaji, Kenichi1 aNosaka, Kazuto0 tFEMS yeast research.g2008 Mar., v. 8, no. 2 p.266-275dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2007.00333.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02404naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008400169300001600253500002400269520119300293650002101486650001201507650001801519650001601537650002201553650005101575650001801626650001201644650001301656650001401669650005201683650002001735650001401755650001101769700002301780773010201803852000901905856009201914655001202006IND4401269120221118051727.0080210s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440126912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2007.00329.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalia, Aditi14aThe SSK2 MAPKKK of Candida albicans is required for oxidant adaptation in vitro  ap. 287-299.  aIncludes references  aThe Ssk2p (MAPKKK) of Candida albicans was deleted and functions assigned based on phenotyping studies. SSK2 deletion was first attempted using the UAU1 disruption method. All transformants lacking one copy of SSK2 appeared to be triploids, suggesting that the SSK2 is essential for the organism. To verify this observation, a strain was constructed in which one allele was deleted using the SAT1 flipper disruption method. The second allele was then placed under control of the on/off tetracycline-regulatable (TetR) promoter. The transcription of SSK2 was measured by reverse transcriptase-PCR and although the promoter was somewhat leaky, transcript was significantly reduced in an ssk2/TetR-SSK2 transformant (AT2) in the presence of doxycycline. Strains AT1 and AT2 constructed using the SAT1 flipper and TetR promoter method, respectively, were studied phenotypically in different growth media to determine the role of Ssk2p in morphogenesis. The mutants were also compared under on/off conditions in the presence of 1.5 M NaCl and various types of oxidants. Strain AT2 demonstrated resistance to 1.5 M NaCl in the absence of doxycycline but was inhibited by 8 mM hydrogen peroxide. 3aCandida albicans 3aalleles 3aculture media 3adoxycycline 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aoxidants 3aphenotype 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asodium chloride 3atriploidy 3ayeasts1 aCalderone, Richard0 tFEMS yeast research.g2008 Mar., v. 8, no. 2 p.287-299dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2007.00329.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03226naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002200160245009700182300001300279500002400292520147000316650002101786650001201807650001401819650002201833650001301855650000901868650001001877650002701887650001401914650001201928650001701940650001201957650002301969650001201992650000902004650003802013650001202051650001102063650002202074650002502096650002002121650000902141650002702150650002202177650002002199651001202219651001202231700003202243700002102275700002202296700003702318700002402355700002302379773010802402852000902510856008102519655001202600IND4401623220221118051449.0080217s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440162322DNAL7 a179821592pmid7 a10.1093/jhered/esm0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarker, Laurie L.10aMolecular Genetic Insights on Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) Ecology and Conservation in Namibia  ap. 2-13.  aIncludes references  aThe extent and geographic patterns of molecular genetic diversity of the largest remaining free-ranging cheetah population were described in a survey of 313 individuals from throughout Namibia. Levels of relatedness, including paternity/maternity (parentage), were assessed across all individuals using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, and unrelated cheetahs (n = 89) from 7 regions were genotyped at 38 loci to document broad geographical patterns. There was limited differentiation among regions, evidence that this is a generally panmictic population. Measures of genetic variation were similar among all regions and were comparable with Eastern African cheetah populations. Parentage analyses confirmed several observations based on field studies, including 21 of 23 previously hypothesized family groups, 40 probable parent/offspring pairs, and 8 sibling groups. These results also verified the successful integration and reproduction of several cheetahs following natural dispersal or translocation. Animals within social groups (family groups, male coalitions, or sibling groups) were generally related. Within the main study area, radio-collared female cheetahs were more closely interrelated than similarly compared males, a pattern consistent with greater male dispersal. The long-term maintenance of current patterns of genetic variation in Namibia depends on retaining habitat characteristics that promote natural dispersal and gene flow of cheetahs. 3aAcinonyx jubatus 3aanimals 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aloci 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apaternity 3aprogeny 3areproduction 3asurveys 2aAcinonyxxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aCats 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcology 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aHoming Behavior 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMolecular Biology 2aSocial Behavior 3aNamibia 0aNamibia1 aWilkerson, Alison J.

This variability is mainly determined by variations in the sea level pressure gradient across Fram Strait and thus geostrophic wind stress. Ice thickness anomalies, formed at the Siberian coast and in the Chukchi Sea, propagate across the Arctic to Fram Strait and contribute to the variability of the ice export on a timescale of about 9 years. Large anomalies of the ice export through Fram Strait cause fresh water signals, which reach the Labrador Sea after 1-2 years and lead to significant changes in the deep convection. The associated anomalies in ice cover and ocean heat release have a significant impact on air temperature in the Labrador Sea and on the large-scale atmospheric circulation. This affects the sea ice transport and distribution in the Arctic again. Sensitivity studies, simulating the effect of large ice exports through Fram Strait, show that the isolated effect of a prescribed ice/fresh water anomaly is very important for the climate variability in the Labrador Sea. Thus, the ice export through Fram Strait can be used for predictability of Labrador Sea climate up to 2 years in advance. 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3afreshwater 3aheat 3aice 3aicebergs 3asea level 3awind 3aArctic region 3aChukchi Sea1 aMikolajewicz, Uwe1 aHaak, Helmuth1 aJungclaus, Johann0 tClimate dynamics.g2006 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.17-34dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-005-0060-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03128naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245009900165300001600264500002400280520163900304650002701943650001201970650002801982650001002010650001302020650001002033650001602043650001702059650000902076650002402085650002102109650001402130650001802144650001402162650001002176653002402186653002202210653002902232653003002261653002002291700001602311700001702327700001802344700001502362700001602377773011602393852000902509856009202518655001202610IND4401606020221118051330.0080217s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440160602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03614.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeir, D.10aColorimetric / fluorescent bacterial sensing by agarose-embedded lipid / polydiacetylene films  ap. 787-795.  aIncludes references  aDevelopment of a new chromatic (colorimetric/fluorescence) bacterial sensor, for rapid, sensitive and versatile detection of bacterial proliferation. We constructed agarose-embedded chromatic films which produce dramatic colour changes and fluorescence transformations in response to bacterial growth. The sensing constructs comprise glass-supported Langmuir-Schaeffer phospholipid/polydiacetylene films that undergo both blue-red transformations and induction of intense fluorescence following interactions with bacterially secreted amphiphilic compounds that diffuse through the agarose. The agarose matrix coating the sensor film further contains growth nutrients, facilitating signal amplification through promotion of bacterial culture proliferation. The agarose layer also constitutes an effective barrier for reducing background signals not associated with the bacteria. We demonstrate the applications of the new sensor for the detection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and for screening specimens of physiological fluids (blood and urine) and foods (meat) for bacterial contaminations. The experiments demonstrate that the new agarose-embedded film constructs are capable of bacterial detection through visible colour transitions and fluorescence emission recorded in conventional apparatuses. This work demonstrated a new simple chromatic platform for bacterial detection, based on the generation of easily recorded colour and fluorescence changes. The new bacterial detection scheme is highly generic and could be employed for varied practical uses, in which, rapid reporting on bacterial presence is required. 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aagarose 3abacterial contamination 3ablood 3acoatings 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3afluorescence 3ameat 3amicrobial detection 3amicrobial growth 3anutrients 3aphospholipids 3ascreening 3aurine 0abacterial detection 0abacterial sensors 0aLangmuir-Schaeffer films 0amembrane active molecules 0apolydiacetylene1 aSilbert, L.1 aVolinsky, R.1 aKolusheva, S.1 aWeiser, I.1 aJelinek, R.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2008 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.787-795dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03614.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02767naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002800160245009800188300001400286500002400300520124100324650002601565650001201591650001001603650001401613650002201627650002001649650003701669650001601706650002401722650001201746650002401758650002401782650002201806650002501828650005101853650002801904650001401932650002601946651002301972700002801995700002102023700003002044773010902074852000902183856008102192655001202273IND4401623120221118051308.0080217s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440162312DNAL7 a179890632pmid7 a10.1093/jhered/esm0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNigenda-Morales, Sergio10aMHC DQB-1 Polymorphism in the Gulf of California Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) Population  ap. 14-21.  aIncludes references  aOne of the most isolated populations of fin whales occurs in the Gulf of California (GOC) with 400-800 individuals. This population shows reduced neutral genetic variation in comparison to the North Pacific population and thus might also display limited adaptive polymorphism. We sampled 36 fin whales from the GOC and assessed genetic variation at exon 2 of the major histocompatibility complex class II DQB-1 genes responsible for eliciting immune responses. Three divergent alleles were found with higher nonsynonymous than synonymous substitution rates within the peptide-binding region positions as well as the likely retention of ancient alleles, indicating that positive selection has shaped diversity in this species. Limited levels of nonneutral polymorphism, in addition to previously described low levels of neutral polymorphism, are consistent with the results of previous studies on vertebrate populations that have remained small and demographically stable for a very long time. Such low genetic variation in the GOC fin whales could be explained by 2 demographic scenarios: an ancient isolated population with limited gene flow or a more recent founder event after the last glacial maximum with very restricted gene flow. 3aBalaenoptera physalus 3aalleles 3aexons 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3aimmune response 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3avertebrates 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aFin Whalexgenetics 2aGenes, MHC Class II 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 3aGulf of California1 aFlores-Ramírez, Sergio1 aUrbán-R., Jorge1 aVázquez-Juárez, Ricardo0 tJournal of heredity.g2008 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.14-21dThe American Genetic Associationx0022-15037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esm0873Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02093naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245005900169300001600228500002400244520119900268650002301467650002401490650001101514650002201525700002401547700002001571773011801591852000901709856008501718655001201803IND4401566220221118051329.0080217s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440156622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10666-005-9007-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Justin C.10aSpatial attributes and reserve design models: A review  ap. 163-181.  aIncludes references  aA variety of decision models have been formulated for the optimal selection of nature reserve sites to represent a diversity of species or other conservation features. Unfortunately, many of these models tend to select scattered sites and do not take into account important spatial attributes such as reserve shape and connectivity. These attributes are likely to affect not only the persistence of species but also the general ecological functioning of reserves and the ability to effectively manage them. In response, researchers have begun formulating reserve design models that improve spatial coherence by controlling spatial attributes. We review the spatial attributes that are thought to be important in reserve design and also review reserve design models that incorporate one or more of these attributes. Spatial modeling issues, computational issues, and the trade-offs among competing optimization objectives are discussed. Directions for future research are identified. Ultimately, an argument is made for the development of models that capture the dynamic interdependencies among sites and species populations and thus incorporate the reasons why spatial attributes are important. 3aconservation areas 3aecological function 3amodels 3aspecies diversity1 aReVelle, Charles S.1 aLevin, Simon A.0 tEnvironmental modeling and assessment.g2005 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.163-181dSpringer Netherlandsx1420-20267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-005-9007-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02798naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245017100166300001600337500002400353520129400377650005001671650001901721650002801740650001501768650002001783650001901803650003301822650001601855650001401871650004701885650001801932650002201950650000901972650002701981650002402008651000902032700003502041700002602076700002402102700002002126773010002146852000902246856008502255655001202340IND4401531420221118051353.0080217s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440153142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0313-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantillana, Nery10aPhylogenetic diversity based on rrs, atpD, recA genes and 16S-23S intergenic sequence analyses of rhizobial strains isolated from Vicia faba and Pisum sativum in Peru  ap. 239-247.  aIncludes references  aIn this study 17 isolates from effective nodules of Vicia faba and Pisum sativum var. macrocarpum growing in different soils from Peru were isolated and characterized. The isolates, presenting 11 different RAPD profiles, were distributed in three groups on the basis of their 16S-RFLP patterns. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains from 16S-RFLP groups I, II and III were closely related (identities higher than 99.5%) to Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii DSM 30141 (=ATCC 14480), R. leguminosarum bv. viciae DSM 30132T and Rhizobium etli CFN42T (=USDA 9032T), respectively. The analysis of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer (ITS) and two housekeeping genes, atpD and recA, confirmed the identification of strains from group I, however those from groups II and III were phylogenetically divergent to strains DSM 30132T and CFN42T. These results support the fact that the 16S rRNA gene is not adequate for identification at species level within genus Rhizobium and suggest the existence of putative new species within the phylogenetic group of R. leguminosarum. They also confirm the need of a taxonomic revision of R. leguminosarum since the reference strains of the three biovars included in this study are phylogenetically divergent according to their ITS, atpD and recA gene sequences. 3aPisum sativum subsp. sativum var. macrocarpum 3aRhizobium etli 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aVicia faba 3aessential genes 3aintergenic DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3aspecies identification 3ataxonomic revisions 3aPeru1 aRamírez-Bahena, Martha Helena1 aGarcía-Fraile, Paula1 aVelázquez, Encarna1 aZúñiga, Doris0 tArchives of microbiology.g2008 Mar., v. 189, no. 3 p.239-247dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0313-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03313naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002200160245010700182300001800289520153400307650000901841650002201850650004801872650001201920650003401932650006101966650002802027650004702055650002702102650003802129650003402167650001102201650003102212650003402243650001702277650002302294650002102317650002002338650002702358650002702385650002402412650006002436650005302496700002402549773007402573852000902647856008102656939003302737946001302770655001202783IND4374922220141222000000.0051002e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437492222DNAL7 a161953682pmid7 a10.1096/fj.04-3620rev2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, Kirk P.10aNovel therapeutic opportunities for Alzheimer's disease: focus on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  ap. 1592-1601.  aAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder with dementia in the elderly. The AD brain pathology is characterized by deposits of amyloid-{szligbeta} (A{szligbeta}) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles but also (among other aspects) by signs of a chronic inflammatory process. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of developing AD and delays its onset. Classical targets of NSAIDs include cycloxygenase, nuclear factor [kappa]B, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Modulation of these pathways, all of which have been implicated in AD pathogenesis, could explain the NSAID effect on AD progression. However, recent studies indicate that a subset of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen may have direct A{szligbeta}-lowering properties in cell cultures as well as transgenic models of AD-like amyloidosis. A renewed interest in the old and a discovery of new pharmacological properties of these drugs are providing vital insight for future clinical trials. In this review we will summarize how the combination of traditional (anti-inflammatory) and new (anti-amyloidogenic) properties of some NSAIDs is providing unprecedented opportunities for drug discovery and could potentially result in novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AD.--Townsend, K.

A total of 221 specimens ranging from 31 to 120 cm total length (TL) and 550 to 12 000 g total weight (TW) were collected. Chitala chitala constitutes an important component of riverine fisheries of India and is considered one of the most commercially important and highly priced foods in addition to being an aquarium fish. The species has recently undergone heavy fishing pressure, leading to an alarming decline in natural populations and deserving of high conservation importance. Length-weight relationships of C. chitala from wild populations had not yet been studied. Hence, the study objective was to evaluate length-weight relations of C. chitala from eleven populations in order to help in conservation and management of the riverine population. 3aaquarium fish 3afisheries 3afoods 3apopulation dynamics 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aDeepak, P.K.1 aNegi, R.S.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2009 Apr., v. 25, no. 2 p.232-233dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2008.01206.x 7aarticle02786naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245016700159300001600326500002400342520114500366650001201511650002601523650002301549650002501572650002401597650002101621650001301642650001801655650001801673650002201691650002101713650002301734650002501757650001501782650004701797650001001844650001401854650001101868650002001879650001901899650001001918651001301928653004501941653002901986653002902015653002702044700001802071773009802089852000902187856004802196655001202244IND4441590020221118051438.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444159002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0372-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaz, Irum10aBiochemical, molecular characterization and growth promoting effects of phosphate solubilizing Pseudomonas sp. isolated from weeds grown in salt range of Pakistan  ap. 199-207.  aIncludes references  aThree species of phosphate solubilizing bacteria viz, Pseudomonas mendocina Khsr2, Pseudomonas stutzeri Khsr3 and Pseudomonas putida Khsr4 were isolated from roots of weeds Lactuca dissecta D.

Preliminary identification of bacterial isolate was made on the basis of morphological and biochemical characters and confirmed by partial 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. The genetic diversity among the isolates was evaluated by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA finger printing and similarity matrix was measured. All the Pseudomonas sp. were capable of solubilizing phosphate, produced phytohormones: Indole-3-acetic acid, Gibberellic acid, Trans-zeatin riboside and Abscisic acid in culture media and were found to be efficient in stimulating root/shoot length and dry weight and proline contents of Zea mays L (advance germplasm line: Islamabad Gold) seedlings grown under normal and NaCl (20 dS m⁻¹) stress.

To address this area of research, relative protein expression of 2 heme transporters, Feline Leukemia Virus, Subgroup C, Receptor 1 (FLVCR1) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), was assessed using Western-blot analysis in human placental tissue in relation to maternal/neonatal iron status and placental iron concentration. Placental FLVCR1 (n = 71) and BCRP (n = 83) expression were assessed at term (36.6-41.7 wk gestation) in a cohort of pregnant adolescents (13-18 y of age) at high-risk of iron deficiency. Both FLVCR1 and BCRP were detected in all placental samples assayed. Placental FLVCR1 expression was positively related to placental BCRP expression (n = 69; R² = 0.104; P < 0.05). Adolescents that were anemic at delivery had lower placental FLVCR1 expression (n = 49; P < 0.05). Placental FLVCR1 expression was positively associated with placental iron concentration at delivery (n = 61; R² = 0.064; P < 0.05). In contrast, placental BCRP expression was not significantly associated with maternal iron status or placental iron content. Both FLVCR1 and BCRP are highly expressed in human placental tissue, but only FLVCR1 was significantly inversely associated with maternal iron status and placental iron concentration. Further analysis is needed to explore potential functional roles of FLVCR1 in human placental iron transport.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFeline leukemia virus 3aanemia 3abreast neoplasms 3aheme 3ahumans 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3apregnant adolescents 3aprotein synthesis 3areceptors 3atransporters 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxmetabolism 2aAdolescent 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxcomplicationsxmetabolism. 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aHemexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aIronxbloodxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlacentaxmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Hematologicxmetabolism 2aPregnancy in Adolescencexmetabolism 2aReceptors, Virusxmetabolism1 aYoung, Melissa F.1 aEssley, Bridget V.1 aMcNanley, Thomas J.1 aCooper, Elizabeth M.1 aPressman, Eva K.1 aMcIntyre, Allison W.1 aOrlando, Mark S.1 aAbkowitz, Janis L.1 aGuillet, Ronnie1 aO'Brien, Kimberly O.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2011 July, v. 141, no. 7 p.1267-1272dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.110.1357983Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03794naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002900181245011500210300001800325500002400343506007600367520193700443506003702380650000802417650001602425650002102441650001802462650001702480650002602497650002902523650003802552650002802590650001002618650001002628650003502638650002302673650001802696650001802714650005202732650001002784650001402794650001202808650002002820700002002840700001202860700002202872700002902894700001902923773013702942852000903079856008003088856004803168655001203216IND4394075320221207135739.0070812e20070815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439407532DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00553-072doi7 aPMC19509802pmcid7 a176018212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostantini, Verónica P.10aEffects of Different Animal Waste Treatment Technologies on Detection and Viability of Porcine Enteric Viruses  ap. 5284-5291.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnteric pathogens in animal waste that is not properly processed can contaminate the environment and food. The persistence of pathogens in animal waste depends upon the waste treatment technology, but little is known about persistence of porcine viruses. Our objectives were to characterize the porcine enteric viruses (porcine noroviruses [PoNoVs], porcine sapoviruses [PoSaVs], rotavirus A [RV-A], RV-B, and RV-C) in fresh feces or manure and to evaluate the effects of different candidate environmentally superior technologies (ESTs) for animal waste treatment on the detection of these viruses. Untreated manure and samples collected at different stages during and after treatment were obtained from swine farms that used conventional waste management (CWM) and five different candidate ESTs. The RNA from porcine enteric viruses was detected by reverse transcription-PCR and/or seminested PCR; PoSaV and RV-A were also detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell culture immunofluorescence (CCIF) and experimental inoculation of gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs were used to determine RV-A/C infectivity in posttreatment samples. The PoSaV and RV-A were detected in pretreatment samples from each farm, whereas PoNoV and RV-C were detected in pretreatment feces from three of five and four of five farms using the candidate ESTs, respectively. After treatment, PoSaV RNA was detected only in the samples from the farm using CWM and not from the farms using the candidate ESTs. RV-A and RV-C RNAs were detected in four of five and three of four candidate ESTs, respectively, after treatment, but infectious particles were not detected by CCIF, nor were clinical signs or seroconversion detected in inoculated Gn pigs. These results indicate that only RV-A/C RNA, but no viral infectivity, was detected after treatment. Our findings address a public health concern regarding environmental quality surrounding swine production units.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aRotavirus A 3aanimal pathogens 3aanimal wastes 3acell culture 3aenvironmental quality 3aenvironmental technology 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aexpressed sequence tags 3afarms 3afeces 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afood contamination 3apathogenicity 3apublic health 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aswine 3aviability 3aviruses 3awaste treatment1 aAzevedo, Ana C.1 aLi, Xin1 aWilliams, Mike C.1 aMichel, Frederick C.

Understanding variation in nest predation rates is complicated by the diverse assemblage of species known to prey on nests. As part of a long-term study of grassland bird ecology, we monitored populations of predators known to prey on grassland bird nests. We used information theoretic approach to examine the predator community's association with habitat at multiple scales, including local vegetation structure of grassland patches, spatial attributes of grassland patches (size and shape), and landscape composition surrounding grassland patches (land cover within 400 and 1600 m). Our results confirmed that nest predators respond to habitat at multiple scales and different predator species respond to habitat in different ways. The most informative habitat models we selected included variability in local vegetation (CV in the density of forbs), local patch (area and edge-to-interior ratio), and landscape within a 1600 m buffer around grasslands (percent of land covered by human structures and development). As a separate question, we asked if models that incorporated information from multiple scales simultaneously might improve the ability to explain variation in the predator community. Multi- scale models were not consistently superior to models derived from variables focused at a single spatial scale. Our results suggest that minimizing human development on and surrounding conservation land and the management of the vegetation structure on grassland fragments both may benefit grassland birds by decreasing the risk of nest predation. 3aagroecosystems 3abirds of prey 3abuffers 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahuman development 3aland cover 3aland management 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anests 3apredation 3arisk 3avegetation structure1 aWolfenbarger, L.

The isolates showed variability in virulence test. Unweighted paired group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis was used to group the isolates into distinct clusters. The clusters generated by RAPD grouped all the isolates into six categories at 40% genetic similarity. High level of diversity was observed among the isolates of different as well as same state. Some of the RAPD (OPN 4, OPN 12, and OPN 20) markers clearly distinguished majority of the isolates into the area specific groups. The ITS I, 5.8rDNA and ITS II regions of 11 isolates representing different RAPD groups were amplified with primers ITS 1 and ITS 4 and digested with seven restriction enzymes. The restriction enzymes DraI, MboI, RsaI, and AluI were found to be suitable for differentiating the isolates into five categories by showing isolate specific ITS-RFLP patterns. The isolates were variable in their nucleotide sequences of the ITS regions. This is the first study on genetic diversity among chickpea isolates of R. bataticola. 3aDNA 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3achickpeas 3acluster analysis 3acrops 3aenzymes 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aroot rot 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence 2aCicerxmicrobiology 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 5.8Sxgenetics 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aRhizoctoniaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aDubey, Sunil C.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2009 Nov., v. 96, no. 4 p.607-619dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-009-9375-y 7aarticle02814naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003100152245008600183300001600269500002400285500001500309520151900324650002101843650001101864650002701875650001701902650001301919650001301932650000901945650002501954650001801979650001401997650001502011650001302026650002202039650002502061651001102086653002402097700001902121700002902140700001902169773010402188852000902292856005502301655001202356IND4458904520221118051527.0110610e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445890452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.00995.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrueger-Hadfield, Stacy A.10aGenetic population structure and mating system in chondrus crispus (rhodophyta)¹  ap. 440-450.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aChondrus crispus Stackh. has been intensely studied, yet no study to date has elucidated its population structure or mating system despite many populations in which there was a haploid bias and lack of male gametophytes. Therefore, 12 nuclear microsatellite loci were identified in this red alga. Microsatellite markers were developed and tested against a panel of specimens collected from two shore levels at two sites in Brittany, France: Pointe de Primel and Pointe de la Jument, Concarneau. Single locus genetic determinism was verified at eight polymorphic loci, as only one band was observed for haploid genotypes, whereas one or two bands were observed for diploids. These markers enabled the detection of unique genotypes within sampled populations, indicating that very few fronds shared the same multilocus genotype. This finding suggests that asexual reproduction was not the prevailing mode of reproduction. In addition, we explored the hierarchical population structure showing that gene flow is restricted at small spatial scales (<50 m) between upper and lower Chondrus-range populations within a shore. Sexual reproduction predominated in the populations of C. crispus studied, but probably due to fine-scale spatial substructuring, inbreeding was also significant. In conclusion, this study reveals that fine-scale genetic variation is of major importance in C. crispus, suggesting that differences between microhabitats should be essential in understanding evolutionary processes in this species. 3aChondrus crispus 3afronds 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agametophytes 3adiploidy 3ahaploidy 3aloci 3aasexual reproduction 3amicrohabitats 3agene flow 3ainbreeding 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3apopulation structure 3aFrance 0asexual reproduction1 aCollén, Jonas1 aDaguin-Thiébaut, Claire1 aValero, Myriam0 tJournal of phycology.g2011 June, v. 47, no. 3 p.440-450dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.00995.x 7aarticle01834naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245006500161300001600226500002400242520087700266650001601143650001701159650001401176650001301190650001101203650001101214700001601225700003101241700001601272700002401288700002601312773008901338852000901427856004801436655001201484IND4431010620221118051249.0100108e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443101062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-009-9377-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeftahi, A.14aThe effects of cotton gauze coating with microbial cellulose  ap. 199-204.  aIncludes references  aMicrobial cellulose is a pure form of cellulose with widespread applications. It is very applicable for medical usage specially wound dressings due to its high liquid absorbency and hygienic nature. In this study, microbial cellulose formed/coated on cotton gauze samples during its biosynthesis in a static medium (Hestrin & Scharm) for 6 days by Acetobacter Xylinium. Some essential factors of treated gauze samples, like water absorbency, drying time (water holding time), and amount of vertical wicking were determined and compared with untreated samples. Results showed that cotton gauze coating with microbial cellulose increases water absorbency and wicking ability over 30%, and reduces drying time about 33%. It can be concluded that covering of cotton gauze with microbial cellulose can promote some important characteristics of it specially for wound dressings. 3aAcetobacter 3abiosynthesis 3acellulose 3acoatings 3acotton 3adrying1 aKhajavi, R.1 aRashīdī, ʻAlī Riz̤ā.1 aSattari, M.1 aYazdanshenas, M.

CYP450s are most abundant in the liver, a major site of drug metabolism, and play key roles in the metabolism of a variety of substrates, including drugs and environmental contaminants. Interaction of two or more different drugs with the same enzyme can account for adverse effects and failure of therapy. Human CYP3A4 metabolizes about 50% of all known drugs, but little is known about the orthologous CYP450s in horses. We report here the genomic organization of the equine CYP3A gene cluster as well as a comparative analysis with the human CYP3A gene cluster. The equine CYP450 genes of the 3A family are located on ECA 13 between 6.97-7.53 Mb, in a region syntenic to HSA 7 99.05-99.35 Mb. Seven potential, closely linked equine CYP3A genes were found, in contrast to only four genes in the human genome. RNA was isolated from an equine liver sample, and the approximately 1.5‐ kb coding sequence of six CYP3A genes could be amplified by RT‐PCR. Sequencing of the RT‐PCR products revealed numerous hitherto unknown single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these six CYP3A genes, and one 6‐ bp deletion compared to the reference sequence (EquCab2.0). The presence of the variants was confirmed in a sample of genomic DNA from the same horse. In conclusion, orthologous genes for the CYP3A family exist in horses, but their number differs from those of the human CYP3A gene family. CYP450 genes of the same family show high homology within and between mammalian species, but can be highly polymorphic. 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aadverse effects 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aliver 3apharmacokinetics 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP3Axgenetics 2aHorsesxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMultigene Family1 aDemmel, S.1 aPeters, L.M.1 aLeeb, T.1 aMevissen, M.1 aHaase, B.0 tAnimal genetics.g2010 Dec., v. 41Suppls2 p.72-79dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02111.x 7aarticle01530naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245004200193300001400235500002400249520044800273650001200721650002200733650001200755650004000767650001200807650002600819650003400845651001500879651001500894700001900909700002000928700002200948773009200970852000901062856008501071655001201156IND4401501420221118051326.0080217s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440150142DNAL7 a163449822pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-005-0061-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAverʹi︠a︡nov, A.

We provide the first description of the biology of diapriine wasps, Acanthopria spp. and Mimopriella sp., which attack the larvae of Cyphomyrmex fungus-growing ants. In Puerto Rico, the koinobiont parasitoids Acanthopria attack Cyphomyrmex minutus, while in Panama at least four morphospecies of Acanthopria and one of Mimopriella attack Cyphomyrmex rimosus. Of the total larvae per colony, 0-100% were parasitized, and 27-70% of the colonies per population were parasitized. Parasitism rate and colony size were negatively correlated for C. rimosus but not for C. minutus. Worker ants grasped at, bit, and in some cases, killed adult wasps that emerged in artificial nests or tried to enter natural nests. Parasitoid secondary sex ratios were female-biased for eclosing wasps, while field collections showed a male-biased sex ratio. Based on their abundance and success in attacking host ants, these minute wasps present excellent opportunities to explore how natural enemies impact ant colony demography and population biology. 3aCyphomyrmex rimosus 3aDiapriidae 3aadults 3aant colonies 3acorrelation 3ademography 3alarvae 3amorphospecies 3anatural enemies 3anests 3aparasitic wasps 3aparasitism 3asex ratio 3aPanama 3aPuerto Rico1 aZimmerman, Jess K.1 aWcislo, William T.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2006 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.17-21dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-005-0048-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02339naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010600174300001600280520093200296650001301228650001701241650001501258650001701273650001501290650000901305650002101314650001101335650002001346650001101366650001301377650001201390650002101402651001101423651001001434653001701444653001901461653001301480653001701493700001601510700003701526700003801563773009901601852000901700856009201709930003301801946001101834655001201845IND4434830620221118051300.0100402e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443483062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2009.01300.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFenoglio, Stefano10aLife cycle and nymphal feeding of Besdolus ravizzarum (Plecoptera: Perlodidae), a threatened stonefly  ap. 149-153.  aWe have studied some aspects of Besdolus ravizzarum biology in the Apennines. This stonefly has a very localized distribution in southeastern France and northern Italy. This species is considered threatened. For this reason it is especially relevant to improve knowledge about its natural history, previously unknown. Despite the large size of nymphs, this species shows a univoltine life cycle. The growth is slow but uniform from October to April or May when the short flight period occurs. The analysis of the gut contents indicates this species is a predator, feeding mainly on Baetidae and Chironomidae. It is notable that the development of this carnivorous species through cold periods coincides with the season with higher richness and density of potential prey in Apennine streams. Further studies are needed to improve knowledge of the distribution of the species and to start planning effective conservation efforts. 3aBaetidae 3aChironomidae 3aPerlodidae 3abiogeography 3acarnivores 3acold 3adigestive system 3aflight 3anatural history 3anymphs 3aplanning 3astreams 3aunivoltine habit 3aFrance 3aItaly 0aconservation 0anorthern Italy 0astonefly 0atrophic role1 aBo, Tiziano1 aLópez-Rodríguez, Manuel Jesús1 aTierno de Figueroa, José Manuel.0 tInsect science.g2010 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.149-153dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-96097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2009.01300.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100402b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03387naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245006900169300001500238520211100253650002402364650002302388650002702411650002502438650001102463650001202474650001002486650001402496650001202510650001402522650001402536650002202550650001802572651001002590653001202600653001202612700002202624700002502646700001502671773010502686852000902791856008502800930003302885946001102918655001202929IND4439110720221118051334.0100625e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443911072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-010-0299-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Michael J. 10aSalmonid predator-prey dynamics in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, USA  ap. 85-100.  aOur objective was to evaluate the long-term sustainability of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss populations subjected to a range of fishing mortality (F) in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, USA, while providing for bull trout Salvelinus confluentus and kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka recovery. In order to achieve our objective, we developed a density-dependent stochastic predator-prey simulation model for the three major predators (lake trout, rainbow trout, and bull trout) on kokanee in Lake Pend Oreille. As F increased from 0.0 to 1.0, lake trout numbers in 2015 declined 90% for gillnetting, 76% for angling, and 48% for trap netting. At fishing mortality rates observed in Lake Pend Oreille during 2006, all methods combined and angling alone suppressed the lake trout population, but not gillnetting or trap netting alone. As F increased from 0.0 to 0.3, rainbow trout numbers in 2015 declined by 38%. Abundance of adult bull trout increased by 5.8% per year during 1996-2006, after implementation of no-kill regulations, which met the Federal Recovery Plan criterion of a stable or increasing trend in abundance. By 2010, total consumption of kokanee by lake trout, rainbow trout, and bull trout would increase by 20% if fishing mortality on lake trout and rainbow trout declined by 30% from 1996 levels, and would decrease by 14% if fishing mortality on lake trout and rainbow trout increased by 30% from 1996 levels. At rates of fishing mortality exerted on lake trout and rainbow trout in 2006, the likelihood of kokanee collapse was 65% within the next decade. Therefore, fishing mortality would need to be at least 6% higher on both lake trout and rainbow trout to reduce the likelihood of kokanee collapse to 50%. We conclude that kokanee biomass is presently out of balance with predation in Lake Pend Oreille, because kokanee production cannot compensate for all predation loss. Our findings suggest that a combination of unusually high kokanee production and unusually low predation are likely needed for kokanee to survive the next decade in Lake Pend Oreille. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aOncorhynchus nerka 3aSalvelinus confluentus 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3aadults 3abiomass 3alakes 3amortality 3anetting 3apredation 3apredators 3asimulation models 3asport fishing 3aIdaho 0aKokanee 0aFishing1 aSchill, Daniel J.1 aFredericks, James P.1 aDux, Andy 0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 Aug., v. 650, no. 1 p.85-100dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0299-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100628b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02492naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245010800173300001800281520111300299650002201412650001501434650002501449650001501474650001201489650004301501650002601544650000701570650002701577650001601604653003801620653002601658700001401684700001701698700001701715700001501732700001701747773014901764852000901913856009201922930003302014946001102047655001202058IND4437298420221118051305.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443729842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02276.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Yong-Guang12aA pulsed electric field procedure for promoting Maillard reaction in an asparagine-glucose model system  ap. 1303-1309.  aEffects of pulsed electric field (PEF) on pH, intermediate products, asparagine and glucose content, browning value, reducing power as well as antioxidant activity of an asparagine-glucose solution were explored in this paper. Results showed that the solution's UV-Vis absorbance at 294 nm and 420 nm was significantly increased from 0 to approximately 1.14 and 0.74, respectively, at PEF intensity of 40 kV cm⁻¹ for 7.35 ms treatment. The temperature of PEF treated samples were overall lower than 40 °C. It was also detected that the antioxidant activity of treated sample was correspondingly increased by 20.33%. Meanwhile, 14% reduction of asparagine content and 66% reduction of glucose content were observed. It was demonstrated from high performance liquid chromatography analysis that Maillard reaction in the model system had been enhanced by PEF treatment as no 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde was generated. This study indicates that pulsed electric field treatment, especially with higher intensities, is a means to significantly promote the Maillard reaction in an asparagine-glucose solution. 3aMaillard reaction 3aabsorbance 3aantioxidant activity 3aasparagine 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3apH 3apulsed electric fields 3atemperature 0aasparagine-glucose model solution 0apulsed electric field1 aWang, Jun1 aYu, Shu-Juan1 aZeng, Xin-An1 aHan, Zhong1 aLiu, Yan-Yan0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2010 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.1303-1309dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02276.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02094naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002100139245011200160300001600272520095400288650002601242650002601268650000801294650001801302650001601320650001501336650001801351651001401369651002101383653001001404700002201414700001601436700001501452773008201467852000901549856007901558930003301637945001301670946001301683655001201696IND2041104620221118051216.0940727e199402  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204110462DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.1.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCockfields, S.D.10aHatch of blackheaded fireworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) eggs and prediction with temperature-driven models  ap. 101-107.  aEgg hatch of blackheaded fireworm, Rhopobota naevana (Hubner), was monitored in Wisconsin and British Columbia.

Caterpillars on trees along a southfacing forest edge, picked up far less virus than did caterpillars on trees in the forest interior, and edge caterpillars died at a slower rate. Reduced transmission is presumed to result from the inactivation of virus by high UV radiation at the forest edge. The pattern of reduced transmission of virus at the forest edge may explain, in part, the pattern of prolonged outbreak of forest tent caterpillar in highly fragmented forests. 3aforest trees 3aBaculoviridae 3aedge effects 3aMalacosoma disstria 3alarvae 3aOntario 0atransmission 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0aforest borders1 aKaupp, W.J.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1995 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.1175-1178x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/24.5.11753Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02547naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245018700156300001600343520130400359650002701663650002701690650000801717650001101725650001601736650001601752650002701768650001401795650001101809650001501820651001901835653001601854700001801870700002001888773008201908852000901990856007901999930003302078945001302111946001302124655001202137IND2051469820221118051502.0960530e199408  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205146982DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.4.9792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenson, E.P.10aComparison of developmental rates of two separate populations of Periplaneta fuliginosa (Dictyoptera: Blattidae) and equations describing development, preoviposition, and oviposition  ap. 979-986.  aPeriplaneta fuliginosa (Serville) were collected from Clemson, SC, in the Piedmont region, and Charleston, SC, in the coastal region. Maximal developmental rates of eggs and number of nymphs emerging from oothecae hatching at five temperature increments (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C) were recorded in the laboratory for each population. Developmental rates were also recorded for the first male and female to mature from 1-d-old nymphs hatched from the same ootheca. For first females, preoviposition (time to first ootheca) and oviposition rates, egg developmental rate, and number of nymphs emerged were recorded. Between 20 and 30 degrees C, coastal nymphs developed 5% faster than Piedmont nymphs. At 15 degrees C, only eight cockroaches reached adulthood after 56 mo. Oviposition and preoviposition rates of the coastal population were about 25% faster. Biologically these differences appear insignificant because they are less than variation in literature values. From data pooled from this experiment and the literature, coefficients of the Sharpe-DeMichele developmental rate model were calculated for egg and nymphal development, preoviposition, and oviposition. The regressions had high r2 values and provide a quantitative basis for understanding population processes in this insect. 3aPeriplaneta fuliginosa 3abiological development 3aova 3anymphs 3aoviposition 3atemperature 3ageographical variation 3aequations 3amodels 3apopulation 3aSouth Carolina 0acomparisons1 aZungoli, P.A.1 aSmith, L.M.

This model describes six major aspects of colony life history: nest founding, brood raiding, territory expansion, queen death, possible requeening, and colony death. Individual colony territories are represented by rectangles, whose sides change independently depending upon the presence and size of neighboring colonies. Growing colonies try to occupy free space, while retaining square territorial dimensions whenever possible. The growth of fire ant populations in the model compared well with available field data. The model predicted that competitive exclusion caused by territorial interactions should occur when areas reach 70-90% territory coverage. Several computer experiments were conducted with the model to examine the importance of colony growth rate, brood raiding activity, and other parameters on the relative success of sequentially founding colony cohorts. A 1-wk advantage in founding generally increased the long-term survival of young colonies by 40-80%. We also examined the factors affecting average coverage of an area by colony territories. Maximum coverage was achieved under a continuous influx of 50 queens/(ha.wk) or a single settlement of 1000 queens/ha; both values were much less than actual magnitudes of queen influx observed in the field. 3asimulation models 3aSolenopsis invicta 3aqueen insects 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3aintraspecific competition 3aterritoriality 0acolony growth 0acolony founding 0acolony mortality 0aterritory 0abrood raiding 0acolonies 0apopulation ecology1 aPorter, S.D.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.912-922x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.4.9123Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03141naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245013900158300001800297520187300315650001802188650002602206650001702232650002102249650001702270650001902287650001802306650001302324650002502337650001502362653001402377653002502391653003202416653002402448700001502472773008402487852000902571856008002580930003302660945001302693946001302706655001202719IND2051476620221118051521.0960530e199408  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205147662DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.4.10252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgnoffo, C.M.10aAntioxidant and oxidative enzyme effects on the inactivation of inclusion bodies of the Heliothis baculovirus by simulated sunlight-UV  ap. 1025-1029.  aThe sunlight-UV (SUV) inactivation of field-applied viral and other microbial insecticides has been attributed to a direct effect on DNA or generation of highly reactive radicals, or both. Therefore, it may be possible to inhibit this inactivation by use of antioxidants or oxidative enzymes. Our objective was to determine whether antioxidants and oxidative enzymes would inhibit the UV inactivation of Baculovirus heliothis, a singly enveloped nucleopolyhedrosis virus (HzSNPV) of larvae of the Helicoverpa/Heliothis complex. A series of blacklight fluorescent lamps, built into a temperature-control cabinet, were used to simulate the ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B spectrum of sunlight. Three antioxidants (propyl gallate, ascorbic acid, phenylthiocarbamide) all provided some level of UV protection of polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIB) of HzSNPV. Propyl gallate, however, provided the best protection of HzSNPV (0.2 mg/ml propyl gallate gave 99% UV protection of PIB). Fifty percent UV protection with propyl gallate, ascorbic acid or phenylthiocarbamide was obtained at 0.01 mg/ml, 1.0 mg/ml, or 0.068 mg/ml, respectively. Catalase was the best of three oxidative enzymes tested. The enzyme concentration required to provide 50% UV protection of HzSNPV with either catalase, superoxide dismutase, or peroxidase was 0.4 mg/ml, 2.3 mg/ml, or 3.8 mg/ml, respectively. The increased UV stability provided by an antioxidant or oxidative enzyme supports the hypothesis that reactive radicals, generated by SUV, can cause inactivation of field-applied viral and other microbial insecticides. Although the materials we used increased persistence of HzSNPV, none could be used practically to provide UV protection of commercial microbial insecticides. Others, however, might be used as spray-tank additives, or physically bonded to PIB to provide protection against SUV. 3aBaculoviridae 3aultraviolet radiation 3ainactivation 3aviral morphology 3aantioxidants 3apropyl gallate 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aperoxidase 0astability 0aradiation protection 0apolyhedral inclusion bodies 0aphenylthiocarbamide1 aGarcia, C.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.1025-1029x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.4.10253Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03206naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245013000156300001600286500001500302520206800317650001802385650001102403650001702414650002302431650001102454650001302465650002302478650002402501650001502525651001402540653000902554653001602563773008202579852000902661856007902670930003302749945001302782946001302795655001202808IND2046327220221118051434.0950606e199504  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204632722DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/24.2.3322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, L.J.10aHabitats of twospotted spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) during winter and spring in a cotton-producing region of Australia  ap. 332-340.  a2019-12-04  aWinter and spring habitats of the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, were investigated to determine the source of mites infesting seedling cotton crops. The two possibilities were that mites may overwinter in diapause in the soil or litter of cotton fields or they may overwinter on suitable vegetation. Few mites were found in litter or soil collected from fallow cotton fields in winter Significant numbers of diapause mites were found in utter at only 2 of 15 sites. At one of these sites the abundance of mites in litter declined dramatically following cultivation. The cotton crops at these two sites were late maturing and, therefore, more mites may have been induced to diapause because of cooler temperatures, shorter days, and possibly lower food quality than at other sites where more typical, earlier maturing crops were grown. The contribution of mites that overwinter in the soil or utter of cotton fields to infestations on the subsequent cotton crop is not likely to be significant. Vegetation from within and from the borders of fallow cotton fields and from sites remote from cotton (> 1-km distance) were examined for presence of mites in winter and spring. Remote sites were further classified as adjacent to permanent water (wet) or not (dry). Nondiapausing mites, actively feeding and reproducing, were found on a wide range of plant species (37) in the vicinity of cotton fields in winter and spring. Natural senescence of these plants in spring probably forces mites to disperse, often onto young cotton seedlings nearby, resulting in a pronounced edge effect in cotton fields. Mite abundance on weeds was far lower at dry remote than at cotton sites, possibly caused by the lack of a continuous sequence of hosts. Mite abundance at wet remote sites was intermediate between cotton and dry remote sites, probably because they provide a continuity of hosts for mites. Management of the weeds on cotton farms through winter/spring could potentially reduce levels of mite infestation of cotton seedlings in the following season. 3aoverwintering 3awinter 3aplant litter 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aspring 3adiapause 3apopulation density 3aTetranychus urticae 3avegetation 3aAustralia 0asoil 0ainfestation0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1995 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.332-340x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/24.2.3323Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02457naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245016200155300001600317520131600333650001401649650002301663650002001686650001101706650001301717650002001730650000801750653003501758653002301793653002201816700001601838773008201854852000901936856007901945930003302024945001302057946001302070655001202083IND2046326820221118051431.0950606e199504  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204632682DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/24.2.3062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevin, D.M.10aBarley yellow dwarf luteovirus effects on tethered flight duration, wingbeat frequency, and age of maiden flight in Rhopalosiphum padi (Homoptera: Aphididae)  ap. 306-312.  aClonal Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) were reared on oats, Avena sativa L., that were either healthy or infected with the PAV strain of barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDV). Alate aphids of known posteclosion age were tethered in a wind tunnel and exposed to air speeds of 1 m/s. Flight durations, wingbeat frequencies, and the posteclosion age of maiden flight were recorded. Both viruliferous and nonviruliferous R. padi that begin their maiden flight through the posteclosion age of 40 h appear to exhibit similar tethered flight behavior, including flight duration and the earliest age that maiden flight can commence. Viruliferous aphids older than 40 h had maiden flights of shorter duration than did their younger viruliferous counterparts. Nonviruliferous aphids maintained about the same average length of flight duration for all ages in which flight occurred. The oldest posteclosion age at which an aphid began its maiden flight was 65 and 88.7 h for viruliferous and nonviruliferous aphids, respectively. Wingbeat frequencies of R. padi were independent of the age at which maiden flight began and were unaffected by the presence of BYDV. These findings suggest that there is a broader window of opportunity for nonviruliferous R. padi to aerially move long distances than their viruliferous counterparts. 3ainfection 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3adisease vectors 3aflight 3aduration 3aanimal behavior 3aage 0abarley yellow dwarf luteovirus 0awingbeat frequency 0amaiden flight age1 aIrwin, M.E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1995 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.306-312x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/24.2.3063Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01794naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245011300157300001600270500001500286520069900301650001001000650001301010650002701023650001101050650002201061650002701083653001001110653002101120653001401141653001001155700001401165773008201179852000901261856007901270930003301349945001301382946001301395655001201408IND2046326720221118051423.0950606e199504  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204632672DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/24.2.2982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFouillaud, M.10aFungi associated with nests of the paper wasp polistes hebraeus (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) on La Reunion Island  ap. 298-305.  a2019-12-04  aPaper wasp, Polistes hebraeus (F.), nests appear to serve as reservoirs of fungi.

Traits studied were larval feeding acceptance, oviposition ability, and oviposition preference. A preliminary attempt to select for potato intolerance in larval feeding in the Morelos population reduced feeding acceptance of potato after three generations. Host-related difference between the populations in oviposition ability could be explained by inheritance of as few as one gene or two genes with epistasis, suggesting that major genetic change in at least one locus was involved in the original host expansion of L. decelineata from native hosts to potato. Significant dominance by genome from the Rhode Island population was expressed by hybrids in both feeding acceptance and oviposition preference. Results were used to develop a working hypothesis to explain genetic mechanisms responsible for the original host expansion of L. decemlineata to potato. 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3afeeding behavior 3aoviposition 3afood plants 3agenetic variation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3apopulation 0aoviposition preferences1 aLogan, P.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1995 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.278-287x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/24.2.2783Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02350naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245010900156300001600265500001500281520121700296650000801513650001401521650001601535650001801551650001101569650001601580650001801596650002201614651001001636653001001646653002701656653001101683700001701694773008201711852000901793856007901802930003301881945001301914946001301927655001201940IND2051462020221118051343.0960530e199408  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205146202DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.4.8052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattisti, A.10aTemperature-dependent growth model for eggs and larvae of Cephalcia arvensis (Hymenoptera: Pamphiliidae)  ap. 805-811.  a2019-12-04  aThe sawfly, Cephalcia arvensis Panzer, is a pest of the Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) and has caused large outbreaks in Europe. The variability in the diapause length and the adaptability of the immature stages to a wide range of temperatures makes it difficult to predict the attacks and the phenology. In this paper, the effects of variable temperature regimes on both embryonic and larval development are studied in a natural environment. The experimental conditions covered the whole temperature range of the areas colonized by the pest. Several models were considered and their estimation were performed using the DEVAR software program applied to natural fluctuating temperatures. Before the application of DEVAR, its predictive power was tested using hypothetical data sets. The program was able to find parameter values leading to an excellent model fit. Four models were validated using data from three generations of natural populations of the pest. All models gave a good prediction for both embryos and larvae in all the years considered. The model can be usefully applied in population dynamics and in timing the application of both insecticides and entomopathogenic nematodes against the pest. 3aova 3aCephalcia 3aPicea abies 3agrowth models 3alarvae 3atemperature 3aembryogenesis 3acomputer software 3aItaly 0adevar 0abiological development 0agrowth1 aCescatti, A.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.805-811x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.4.8053Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02490naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002100139245010400160300001600264520138800280650004301668650002701711650002501738650002301763650001501786650002201801650001601823650001301839650002501852653002201877773008201899852000901981856007901990930003302069945001302102946001302115655001202128IND2051461820221118051402.0960530e199408  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205146182DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/23.4.7952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalgenbach, J.F.10aDistribution of parasitized and nonparasitized potato aphid (Homoptera: Aphididae) on staked tomato  ap. 795-804.  aThe distribution patterns of parasitized and nonparasitized potato aphids, Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas), were assessed on four plantings of staked tomatoes from 1988 to 1990. Within plant distribution of nonparasitized aphids changed through the season, with the highest percentage of aphids found on the middle plant stratum during the first approximately 60 d and on the upper stratum after this time. Aphid parasitism was inversely density dependent (i.e., rates of parasitism were highest on plantings with low overall potato aphid populations). In addition, parasitism varied within plants, with higher parasitism rates in the middle compared with the upper plant strata. Taylor's power law described an aggregated distribution pattern for both nonparasitized and parasitized aphids, regardless of leaf sample site used for analysis. Analysis of covariance for homogeneity of slopes indicated that the index of aggregation (b) from Taylor's power law remained consistent among years and among sample leaves. The third most recently expanded leaf from the uppermost of the plant (leaf T3) provided the highest relative level of precision among all single-leaf sample units for mean estimates at low aphid densities and was similar in precision to a sample unit consisting of the three uppermost leaves. A binomial sampling plan is presented that uses leaf T3 as a sample unit. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aMacrosiphum euphorbiae 3aspatial distribution 3apopulation density 3aparasitism 3aspatial variation 3aparasitoids 3asampling 3astatistical analysis 0abinomial sampling0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1994 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.795-804x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.4.7953Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01647naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005800126300001400184500001500198520076000213650002300973650002300996650002401019650001401043650003401057650002601091650002401117651001201141653001601153653001401169773007101183852000901254939003301263946001301296655001201309IND9002773720221118051510.0900611e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900277372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvers, W.D.10aCollaborative teaching through electronic programming  ap. 33-34.  a2019-12-05  aExtension collaborated with the Indiana Dairy and Nutrition Council, Inc. and Milk Promotion Services of Indiana.

Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are usually correlated while habitat degradation may occur independently of them. Natural and anthropogenic disturbances increase the spatial fragmentation of seagrass meadows with unknown consequences on the vegetative development achieved by seagrass. 2. Cover and spatial fragmentation of Thalassia testudinum meadows in three coral reef lagoons of the Veracruz Reef System,VRS (SW Gulf of México) were quantified by analysing low-altitude images acquired by photographic and digital video cameras from a helium-filled blimp. Spatial fragmentation was quantified as the ratio of the length of meadow edge to meadow area. The number of blowouts (erosive gaps in seagrass meadows) was also recorded. 3. Meadow cover was negatively correlated with the length of meadow edge to meadow area ratio. The number of blowouts per ha of T. testudinum meadow was negatively correlated with meadow cover and positively with the length of meadow edge to meadow area ratio. Wave exposure is probably a main component of the processes determining the cover and spatial fragmentation of T. testudinum meadows in VRS. 4. Low cover and high spatial fragmentation of T. testudinum meadows in VRS are associated with low vegetative development of this seagrass species. 3aanthropogenic activities 3acorals 3acorrelation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ameadows 3avideo cameras 3aMexico1 aRamírez-García, Pedro.0 tAquatic conservation.g2011 May, v. 21, no. 3 p.224-230dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1052-76137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.1188 7aarticle03437naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002100183245014600204300001800350500002400368506007600392520142500468506003701893650002501930650001601955650002001971650001901991650003002010650001302040650002802053650002602081650005802107650003702165650004902202650005002251650004302301650001302344650001002357650002302367650002302390650002702413650003302440650004002473650004102513650004402554650002102598700002302619773010802642852000902750856008202759856003002841655001202871IND4395889620221207143022.0071007e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439588962DNAL7 a177208672pmid7 aPMC20026062pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.107.0533302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiserli, Eirini10aUV-B Promotes Rapid Nuclear Translocation of the Arabidopsis UV-B-Specific Signaling Component UVR8 and Activates Its Function in the Nucleus  ap. 2662-2673.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArabidopsis thaliana UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is a UV-B-specific signaling component that binds to chromatin and regulates UV protection by orchestrating expression of a range of genes. Here, we studied how UV-B regulates UVR8. We show that UV-B stimulates the nuclear accumulation of both a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-UVR8 fusion and native UVR8. Nuclear accumulation leads to UV-B induction of the HY5 gene, encoding a key transcriptional effector of the UVR8 pathway. Nuclear accumulation of UVR8 is specific to UV-B, occurs at low fluence rates, and is observed within 5 min of UV-B exposure. Attachment of a nuclear export signal (NES) to GFP-UVR8 causes cytosolic localization in the absence of UV-B. However, UV-B promotes rapid nuclear accumulation of NES-GFP-UVR8, indicating a concerted mechanism for nuclear translocation. UVR8 lacking the N-terminal 23 amino acids is impaired in nuclear translocation. Attachment of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to UVR8 causes constitutive nuclear localization. However, NLS-GFP-UVR8 only confers HY5 gene expression following UV-B illumination, indicating that nuclear localization, although necessary for UVR8 function, is insufficient to cause expression of target genes; UV-B is additionally required to stimulate UVR8 function in the nucleus. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms through which UV-B regulates gene expression in plants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aamino acids 3agene expression 3agene induction 3agreen fluorescent protein 3alighting 3aphysiological transport 3aultraviolet radiation 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aChromosomal Proteins, Non-Histonexmetabolism 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aMutationxgenetics 2aNuclear Export Signals 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Transportxradiation effects 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aJenkins, Gareth I.0 tplant cell.g2007 Aug., v. 19, no. 8 p.2662-2673dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.107.0533303Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/ 7aarticle03617naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001600182245017500198300001800373500002400391506007600415520148100491506003701972650002502009650002002034650002902054650001302083650001902096650002002115650002202135650001602157650001102173650002402184650006102208650001802269650002602287650002502313650001602338650004002354650003202394650002502426650002802451650004802479650002002527650002202547650003402569650003402603700001602637700001802653700001602671700001902687700001702706700001802723773011502741852000902856856008102865856003302946655001202979IND4390238220221207143022.0070408e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439023822DNAL7 a172770942pmid7 aPMC18518372pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.106.0953492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Gil-Je10aEpsinR2 Interacts with Clathrin, Adaptor Protein-3, AtVTI12, and Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate.

Epsins have been implicated in various protein-trafficking pathways in animal and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells. Plant cells also contain multiple epsin-related proteins. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), EPSIN1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking of soluble proteins. In this study, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis EpsinR2 in protein trafficking in plant cells. EpsinR2 contains a highly conserved ENTH domain but a fairly divergent C-terminal sequence. We found that the N-terminal ENTH domain specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-P in vitro and has a critical role in the targeting of EpsinR2. Upon transient expression in protoplasts, hemagglutinin epitope-tagged EpsinR2 was translocated primarily to a novel cellular compartment, while a minor portion localized to the Golgi complex. Protein-binding experiments showed that EpsinR2 interacts with clathrin, AtVTI12, and the Arabidopsis homologs of adaptor protein-3 δ-adaptin and adaptor protein-2 α-adaptin. Localization experiments revealed that hemagglutinin epitope-tagged EpsinR2 colocalizes primarily with δ-adaptin and partially colocalizes with clathrin and AtVTI12. Based on these findings, we propose that EpsinR2 plays an important role in protein trafficking through interactions with δ-adaptin, AtVTI12, clathrin, and phosphatidylinositol-3-P.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aGolgi apparatus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aclathrin 3aplant proteins 3aprotein binding 3aprotein transport 3aprotoplasts 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Compartmentation 2aClathrinxmetabolism 2aDNA Primers 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGolgi Apparatusxmetabolism 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphatidylinositol Phosphatesxmetabolism 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Transport 2aQb-SNARE Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aKim, Hyeran1 aKang, Hyangju1 aJang, Mihue1 aLee, Dong Wook1 aLee, Sookjin1 aHwang, Inhwan0 tPlant physiology.g2007 Apr., v. 143, no. 4 p.1561-1575dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.106.0953493Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle03020naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245011000180300001600290500002400306520112800330650002001458650001201478650001601490650001801506650002001524650002601544650002201570650001201592650001901604650001101623650001101634650001501645650001101660650001401671650001501685650000901700650002001709650001301729650001001742650001801752650001201770650002401782650003701806650001101843650002001854650002401874650002001898650001301918650001701931650002301948650002001971650003101991651001502022651001502037653001902052653002902071653003102100700001802131700001702149773009902166852000902265856004802274655001202322IND4390986320221118051602.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439098632DNAL7 a174532792pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-006-0154-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKi, Seo Jin10aSolar and Tidal Modulations of Fecal Indicator Bacteria in Coastal Waters at Huntington Beach, California  ap. 867-875.  aIncludes references  aThe coastal waters at many beaches in California and the United States are afflicted with fecal pollution, which poses a health risk for people exposed to the water through recreational activities such as swimming, surfing, and diving. Identifying sources of pollution is complicated by oceanographic transport/mixing processes and the nonconservative behavior of microorganisms exposed to sunlight and hostile marine conditions. This article investigates the variation of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in the surf zone and the adjacent coastal marsh by applying autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses that illustrate solar and tidal modulations. A steady state bioreactor model was developed to explain solar inactivation in the surf zone, whereas a dynamic model was applied to explain tidally influenced disturbances in the coastal marsh. These models applied to intensive monitoring datasets on FIB and environmental variables have provided insights into the biologic and physical processes controlling coastal water quality, specifically the influence of sunlight and tides on bacterial levels. 3aautocorrelation 3abeaches 3abioreactors 3acoastal water 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aindicator species 3amarshes 3amicroorganisms 3amixing 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apeople 3apollution 3arecreation 3arisk 3asolar radiation 3aswimming 3atides 3awater quality 2aAnimals 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aOceans and Seas 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aRisk Assessment 2aSunlight 2aTime Factors 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutantsxanalysis 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aCoastal waters 0aFecal indicator bacteria 0aSolar and tidal modulation1 aEnsari, Semsi1 aKim, Joon Ha0 tEnvironmental management.g2007 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.867-875dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-006-0154-5 7aarticle02946naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245009400192300001600286500002400302520163700326650001501963650001501978650002101993650001002014650001202024650001802036650001102054650000902065650001602074650001202090650001802102650002702120650001802147650002002165650001602185700001902201700002302220700002002243700002502263700002002288773010402308852000902412856005502421655001202476IND4460350820221118051613.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446035082DNAL7 a214533652pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01663.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMOIR, MELINDA L.10aIdentifying and Managing Threatened Invertebrates through Assessment of Coextinction Risk  ap. 787-796.  aIncludes references  aInvertebrates with specific host species may have a high probability of extinction when their hosts have a high probability of extinction. Some of these invertebrates are more likely to go extinct than their hosts, and under some circumstances, specific actions to conserve the host may be detrimental to the invertebrate. A critical constraint to identifying such invertebrates is uncertainty about their level of host specificity. We used two host-breadth models that explicitly incorporated uncertainty in the host specificity of an invertebrate species. We devised a decision protocol to identify actions that may increase the probability of persistence of a given dependent species. The protocol included estimates from the host-breadth models and decision nodes to identify cothreatened species. We applied the models and protocol to data on 1055 insects (186 species) associated with 2 threatened (as designated by the Australian Government) plant species and 19 plant species that are not threatened to determine whether any insect herbivores have the potential to become extinct if the plant becomes extinct. According to the host-breadth models, 18 species of insect had high host specificity to the threatened plant species. From these 18 insects, the decision protocol highlighted 6 species that had a high probability of extinction if their hosts were to become extinct (3% of all insects examined). The models and decision protocol have added objectivity and rigor to the process of deciding which dependent invertebrates require conservation action, particularly when dealing with largely unknown and speciose faunas. 3aextinction 3aherbivores 3ahost specificity 3ahosts 3ainsects 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3arisk 3auncertainty 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aExtinction, Biological 2aInvertebrates 2aRisk Assessment 2aUncertainty1 aVESK, PETER A.1 aBRENNAN, KARL E.C.1 aKeith, David A.1 aMcCarthy, Michael A.1 aHughes, Lesley.0 tConservation biology.g2011 Aug., v. 25, no. 4 p.787-796dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01663.x 7aarticle02574naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245008900163300001600252520149500268650001601763650001701779650001201796650005301808650002001861650003001881650001901911650001301930650001101943650004101954650002201995773010302017852000902120930003302129945002502162946001302187655001202200IND4373003220221118051439.0050804e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437300322DNAL7 a159425472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMoyers, S.B.10aMedications as adjunct therapy for weight loss: approved and off-label agents in use  ap. 948-959.  aAlthough a nutritionally balanced, energy-controlled diet and regular exercise form the cornerstone of weight management, supporting therapies may include antiobesity medications when a clinician determines that pharmacologic assistance could contribute to treatment success. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved certain medications for helping achieve weight loss in patients with obesity or overweight who have comorbidities. However, some clinicians prescribe medications not approved for weight loss for this purpose. Evidence from clinical trials indicates that weight loss resulting from the use of many of these off-label pharmaceutical agents is modest, but in a range that correlates with favorable modification of cardiovascular risk factors, and significant when compared with placebo plus diet and lifestyle modification. Clinical trials also demonstrate a slight but significant effect in the weight-maintenance phases following weight loss. Pharmacotherapy alone, without behavior modification, is not effective; patients who respond to medication typically regain weight when the drug is discontinued. The fact that many weight-loss medications are sold over the Internet without a prescription suggests that they are being used without medical supervision. The purpose of this review is to present evidence for and against the obesity medications currently used in clinical practice, and the possible role for these agents in a person's overall weight loss plan. 3aweight loss 3adrug therapy 3aobesity 2aAnti-Obesity Agentsxeconomicsxtherapeutic use. 2aChronic Disease 2aCombined Modality Therapy 2aDiet, Reducing 2aExercise 2aHumans 2aObesityxdiet therapyxdrug therapy. 2aTreatment Outcome0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2005 June, v. 105, no. 6 p.948-959x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080624b20080704c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/09/02  aOther US 7aarticle02276naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245005000144300001600194500001500210520136400225650002201589650003501611650002101646650001201667650002001679653001501699653002501714700001701739773010201756852000901858930003301867945002501900946001301925655001201938IND4373007220221118051335.0050804e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437300722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLoos, R.J.F.10aGene-diet interactions on body weight changes  ap. S29-S34.  a2019-12-05  aObesity is one of the most pressing problems in the industrialized world. The susceptibility to obesity is partly determined by genetic factors, but an "obesity-promoting environment" is typically necessary for its phenotypic expression. Such a genetically mediated susceptibility to environmental exposure is referred to as gene-environment interaction. This article reviews the effect of genotype-diet interactions on body weight and body composition changes. A few well-controlled studies with monozygotic twins have specifically addressed the genetic background of interindividual variation in response to overfeeding or energy restriction. Some individuals will gain or lose weight more easily than others, but subjects sharing the same genotype (monozygotic twins) will respond in a similar way, suggesting that the responsiveness to diet is mediated by their genotype. Further evidence for gene-environment interactions comes from candidate gene studies. Genes involved in pathways regulating energy expenditure and food intake may play a role in the predisposition to obesity. For example, DNA sequence variation in genes encoding the adrenergic receptors and uncoupling proteins are of particular relevance. This growing body of research may help in the development of antiobesity treatments and perhaps genetic tests to predict the risk for obesity. 3aenergy metabolism 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3abody composition 3aobesity 3ahuman nutrition 0aoverweight 0agenetic epidemiology1 aRankinen, T.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2005 May, v. 105, no. 5 p.S29-S34x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/03/31  aOther US 7aarticle01965naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245004000141300001600181500001500197520102700212650002201239650001701261650001901278650001201297650002801309650001401337650002001351653001901371700001701390700001401407773010201421852000901523930003301532945002501565946001301590655001201603IND4373008420221118051538.0050804e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437300842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHill, Jo.10aWeight maintenance: what's missing?  ap. S63-S66.  a2019-12-05  aObesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, but there are few proven strategies for either preventing further weight gain or producing permanent weight loss. Our first priority should be to prevent the gradual weight gain experienced by much of the population. Although this will require less behavior change than producing and maintaining weight loss, helping Americans make and sustain the behavior changes needed to prevent gradual weight increases will be challenging. Because approximately 65% of Americans are already overweight or obese, we must also develop effective strategies to help achieve and maintain an amount of weight loss that improves their health and quality of life. Our real challenge is not in helping people lose weight but in helping them keep it off. Many programs have been shown to produce weight loss but few, if any, have been successful in maintenance of weight loss. Our challenge is in understanding how to help people keep off the weight they can lose in several ways. 3aphysical activity 3ahuman health 3ahuman behavior 3aobesity 3aweight control programs 3alifestyle 3abehavior change 0aweight control1 aThompson, H.1 aWyatt, H.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2005 May, v. 105, no. 5 p.S63-S66x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/03/27  aOther US 7aarticle01938naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245008000143300001700223520106900240650001901309650001701328650001901345650001201364650002801376700001901404700001801423773010301441852000901544930003301553945002501586946001301611655001201624IND4373010820221118051514.0050804e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437301082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRolls, B.J.10aChanging the energy density of the diet as a strategy for weight management  ap. S98-S103.  aA growing body of laboratory-based, clinical, and epidemiological data suggests that low-energy-dense diets are associated with better diet quality, lower energy intakes, and body weight. Dietary energy density can be lowered by adding water-rich fruits, vegetables, cooked grains, and soups to the diet, and by reducing the diet's fat content. Low-energy-dense diets can be successfully incorporated into clinical dietetics since they help lower energy intake without reducing food volume and thus help individuals avoid feeling hungry and deprived. There are multiple steps that could be taken by nutrition professionals and food manufacturers to encourage the consumption of low-energy-dense diets. The goal is to develop reduced-calorie eating plans that meet personal food preferences and also provide satisfying food portions. Since using energy density to guide food choices leads to food patterns consistent with dietary guidelines, policy level initiatives should be devised to help ensure that low-energy-dense diets are affordable and accessible to all. 3aweight control 3adiet therapy 3aenergy density 3asatiety 3aepidemiological studies1 aDrewnowski, A.1 aLedikwe, J.H.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2005 May, v. 105, no. 5 p.S98-S103x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/03/31  aOther US 7aarticle03297naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015000154520202600304592002802330650001202358650001502370650001102385650001602396650001902412650001902431650001502450650001302465650001102478650004302489650002802532650002902560650002002589651001002609700001802619700002602637700002102663773012002684856007402804852000902878655001202887IND60787907120221116211822.0220811e20220806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078790712DNAL7 a10.3390/w141524352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Tong 10aMapping Prospective Areas of Water Resources and Monitoring Land Use/Land Cover Changes in an Arid Region Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques  aGroundwater is a vital water resource for economic, agricultural, and domestic purposes in arid regions. To reduce water scarcity in arid regions, recently, remote sensing and GIS techniques have been successfully applied to predict areas with prospective water resources. Thus, this study attempted to spatially reveal groundwater potential zones (GWPZs) and to conduct change detection on the desert fringes of Wadi Asyuti, a defunct tributary of Egypt’s Nile basin in eastern Sahara. Eleven influential groundwater factors generated from remote sensing imagery, and geological, hydrological, and climatic conditions were combined after giving a weight to each factor through a GIS-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with the weighted overlay technique (WOT). The results revealed six distinctive zones with scores ranging from very low (10.59%) to excellent (3.03%). Thirty-three productive groundwater wells, Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence change detection (CCD), a land use map derived from Sentinel-2, and the delineated flooding zone derived from Landsat-8 data were used to validate the delineated zones. The GWPZs indicated that 48% of the collected wells can be classified as consistent to excellent. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and image classification were applied to the multi-temporal Landsat series and Sentinel-2 along with the InSAR CCD data derived from Sentinel-1 images to reveal dramatic changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) in terms of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities in the structurally downstream area, which is the most promising area for future developments. Overall, the integration of radar and multispectral data through the GIS technique has the ability to provide valuable information about water resources in arid regions. Thus, the tested model is a promising technique, and such information is extremely significant for the guidance of planners and decision makers in the area of sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aarid zones 3abasins 3agroundwater 3aimage analysis 3ainterferometry 3aland cover 3aland use 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3asustainable development 3asynthetic aperture radar 3awater shortages 3aEgypt1 aCheng, Wuqun 1 aAbdelkareem, Mohamed 1 aAl-Arifi, Nasir 0 tWater.g2022 Aug. 06, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141524353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01511naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011300164300002000277520046500297592002800762650001700790650001600807650001600823650001200839650002800851650001400879650001000893700002100903700002100924700002100945773012400966856007401090852000901164655001201173IND60640827620221120221529.0190505e20160706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064082762DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra09798g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShravage, Bhupendra12aA concave microwell array fabricated using the ommatidium of the common fruit fly for efficient cell culture  ap. 64266-64270.  aMicrofluidics technology holds great promise for designing state-of-the-art culture chips due to its ability to incorporate the nanoliter liquid transport.

To determine possible roles of sRNA in plant–pathogen interaction, we carried out a high-throughput sRNA sequencing of Brassica campestris using non-infected plants and plants infected with Erwinia carotovora. Consistent with our hypothesis that distinct classes of host sRNAs alerts their expression levels in response to infection, we found that: (1) host 28-nt sRNAs were strongly increased under pathogen infection; and (2) a group of host sRNAs homologous to the pathogen genome also accumulated at significantly higher level. Our data thus suggest several distinct classes of the host sRNAs may enhance their function by up-regulation of their expression/stability in response to bacterial pathogen challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPectobacterium carotovorum 3aRNA 3atranscriptome 3aErwinia 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3apathogens 2aBrassicaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aPectobacterium carotovorumxgrowth & development 2aRNA, Small Untranslatedxbiosynthesis 2aTranscriptome 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris0 tBiotechnology letters.g2014 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.371-381dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-013-1362-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001100295520190600306592002802212596007402240650003402314650002102348650001402369650002702383650001402410650001702424650001702441650001902458650001102477650003202488650002002520650001702540700001902557700001402576700001302590700001602603773011902619856008302738852000902821655001202830IND60725355720221120184852.0220109e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072535572DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-020-00570-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wanggang10aIrigenin exerts anticancer effects on human liver cancer cells via induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and cell cycle arrest  ap. 12.  aIrigenin has been reported to exhibit remarkable anticancer effects against several human cancers. Nonetheless, the anticancer effects of irigenin against the human liver cancer cells are still largely unexplored. Consistently, this study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of irigenin against human liver cancer cells and to unveil the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results showed that irigenin significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the growth of the human HepG2 and SNU-182 liver cancer cells with an IC₅₀ value of 14 µM. Nonetheless, the cytotoxic effects of irigenin against the normal THLE-2 cells were comparatively lower as evident from the IC⁵⁰ of 120 μM. The AO/EB and DAPI staining showed that irigenin induces apoptosis in the human liver cancer cells. Annexin V/PI staining assay revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of apoptotic HepG2 and SNU-182 liver cancer cells upon treatment with irigenin. It was found that the number of apoptotic HepG2 and SNU-182 cells enhanced from 2.3 to 41.75% and 1.16 to 51.9% at IC50, respectively. Western blot showed a considerable increase in Bax and decrease in the Bcl-2 expression upon irigenin treatment further confirming the induction of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that irigenin also induces G2/M cell cycle arrest of HepG2 and SNU-182 cells. The percentage of G2/M phase HepG2 and SNU-182 cells increased from 17.92 to 34.35% and 23.97 to 38.23% at IC₅₀, respectively This was also accompanied by decrease in the expression of CDK1 and Cyclin-B in HepG2 and SNU-182 cells. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that irigenin inhibits the growth of the human liver cancer cells via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These results point towards the potential of irigenin as a lead for the development of chemotherapy for liver cancer.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017FE467 (-047)cYunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3achemistry 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliver neoplasms 3amitochondria1 aKuang, Yingmin1 aWang, Dan1 aLi, Zhen1 aXia, Renpin0 tApplied biological chemistry.g2021 Dec., v. 64, no. 1 p.12-12dSpringer SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-020-00570-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010500167300001400272520174200286592002802028650004402056650002402100650002202124650002102146650001502167650001502182650000902197650001402206650001402220650001802234650003302252650001102285650001702296650003702313650002002350700002602370700001702396700002102413700001902434700002202453700002102475700002102496700001202517773010802529856008202637852000902719655001202728IND60085276320221122003215.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008527632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2012.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSueyoshi, Mark10aPreparation and characterization of adsorbents for treatment of water associated with oil production  ap. 80-87.  aTwo sets of adsorbents were prepared from locally available raw materials, characterized and tested. The first set consists of crushed natural attapulgite and crushed attapulgite mixed with petroleum tank-bottom sludge and carbonized at 650°C. Another set was prepared using trunk of date palm tree (Phoenix dactylifera) activated at 700 and 800°C. Both sets were characterized using BET surface area and pore distributions, FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM. Natural attapulgite and attapulgite/sludge composite exhibited different characteristics and adsorptive capacities for oil removal from oily water. Adsorptive capacities were calculated from the breakthrough curves of a column test. An oily water solution of about 500mg-oil/L was passed through both the attapulgite and attapulgite/sludge columns until the column effluent concentration exceeded a reference limit of 10mg-oil/L. Uptake was calculated at this limit at 155 and 405mg-oil/g-adsorbent, respectively. This was lower than the performance of a commercial activated carbon sample (uptake calculated at 730mg-oil/g-adsorbent). Relatively, the date palm, carbonaceous-based adsorbent samples showed less significant differences in both bulk and surface properties. Uptake significantly improved to 1330–1425mg-oil/g-adsorbent. Attempt was made to associate this performance with the difference in the surface areas between the two sets. However, other factors are found to be important as the second set has a range of surface area less than that of the commercial sample. As evidenced by FTIR, XRD and TEM, the activated carbonaceous materials developed porous structures which form defective graphitic sheet ensembles that serve as additional adsorption sites in the sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asludge 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater treatment1 aAl-Maamari, Rashid S.1 aJibril, Baba1 aTasaki, Masaharu1 aOkamura, Kazuo1 aKuwagaki, Hitoshi1 aYahiro, Hidenori1 aSagata, Kunimasa1 aHan, Yu0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2012 Sept., v. 97 p.80-87dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2012.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003200135040001800167100003000185245009800215300001000313506007600323520134800399592002801747506003701775650001601812650000901828650001001837650001301847650001001860650001301870650002501883650001901908650001501927650001301942650001301955650001401968650001601982650002201998650001302020650001202033650001102045650003102056650001802087650001102105650004102116650006602157700002602223700003102249700002202280700001902302700002102321700003902342773011702381856007902498852000902577655001202586IND50063462320221207072756.0190131e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006346232DNAL7 aPMC35775812pmcid7 a233694652pmid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-55-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavarini, Saulo Petinatti10aMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor as a cause of chronic cardiac insufficiency in cattle  ap. 7.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChronic cardiac insufficiency was associated with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in a cow. An eight-year-old cow developed a progressive condition (over a period of three months) characterized by an enhanced abdominal volume, reluctance to move, a positive jugular pulse, watery diarrhea and death. At necropsy, moderate subcutaneous edema and an enhanced hepatic lobular pattern were observed. A 23x20x11 cm firm, grayish-white mass adhered to and infiltrated the right atrium. Multiple firm, yellowish-white nodules of 0.5 to 12 cm in diameter were diffusely scattered in the epicardium and parietal pericardium. Histologically, the tumor was poorly circumscribed with foci of infiltration of the myocardium. The neoplastic cells had two major histologic patterns, Antoni types A and B. Within occasional foci, pleomorphic cells with an epithelioid appearance were present in addition to multinucleated cells with periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive cytoplasmic globules. Foci of cartilaginous and granular differentiations were interspersed among the neoplastic cells. Multiple vessels presented wall hyalinization and tumoral embolus. Large necrotic foci with mineralization and cholesterol clefts were also observed. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for S100 protein, vimentin and neuron-specific enolase labeling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acholesterol 3acows 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3aedema 3aembolism 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amineralization 3amyocardium 3anecropsy 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3apericardium 3aperipheral nerves 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxpathology 2aFatal Outcome 2aFemale 2aHeart Failurexetiologyxveterinary. 2aNerve Sheath Neoplasmsxcomplicationsxpathologyxveterinary.1 aGomes, Danilo Carloto1 aBandinelli, Marcele Bettim1 aWouters, Flademir1 aSonne, Luciana1 aDriemeier, David1 aFarias da Cruz, Cláudio Estêvão0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2013 Dec., v. 55, no. 1 p.7-7dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-55-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03773naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245010100204300001600305500002000321520180900341592002802150596003402178596005702212596003202269650002202301650002602323650002702349650001802376650001802394650001002412650001602422650002502438650004202463650001402505650002902519650001902548650001502567650001302582650001002595651001902605700005702624700006502681700005902746700005802805700005802863700005802921700005702979773011303036856007303149852000903222655001203231IND60752112120221119125415.0210929e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075211212DNAL7 a10.1111/wre.125002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKošnarová, Pavlína1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9907-500710aApera spica‐venti in the Czech Republic develops resistance to three herbicide modes of action  ap. 420-429.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInvestigation of molecular mechanisms of herbicide resistance to three modes of action was carried out in a population of Apera spica‐venti with resistance to herbicides inhibiting acetolactate synthase (ALS), acetyl‐CoA‐carboxylase (ACCase) and inhibitors of photosystem‐II (PSII). Greenhouse experiments were conducted to detect and characterize resistance pattern to pyroxsulam (ALS inhibitor), pinoxaden (ACCase) and chlorotoluron (PSII) using the recommended rate of each herbicide alone and in tank‐mix, sequential application and dose–response tests. Metabolic detoxification and/or reduced herbicide uptake and translocation studies were conducted using dose–response tests with the herbicides in combination with malathion. After treatment, leaves from surviving plants were collected for pyrosequencing to identify target‐site mutations in specific regions of ALS, ACCase and psbA genes. Among 32 analysed plants, target‐site mutations in specific regions were detected for ALS and ACCase gene, but no psbA mutations were found. Dose–response assay showed high resistance factors for pyroxsulam (RF = 269.4), pinoxaden (RF = 66.3), but lower for chlorotoluron (RF = 14.3). Testing for metabolic detoxification by pre‐treatment with malathion resulted in an increased susceptibility to pinoxaden in all doses, some increased susceptibility to chlorotoluron at the highest doses and no difference for pyroxsulam. Our results indicate that while target‐site mutations were present for ALS and ACCase sites of action, metabolic detoxification does play a role for pinoxaden resistance. This research provided key insights into the resistance mechanisms in Apera spica‐venti and will be important for developing control strategies for this weed in the Czech Republic.  aPublisher supplied data  cBundesamt für Landwirtschaft  cBundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft  cMinisterstvo Zemědělství 3aApera spica-venti 3aacetolactate synthase 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3achlorotoluron 3adose response 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3aherbicide resistance 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amalathion 3ametabolic detoxification 3aphotosystem II 3apyroxsulam 3aresearch 3aweeds 3aCzech Republic1 aHamouz, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1318-88691 aHamouzová, Kateřina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6902-60871 aLinn, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9780-56351 aSen, Madhab K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2191-49581 aMikulka, Jakub1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6071-30161 aŠuk, Jaromír1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5664-85731 aSoukup, Josef1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2890-23590 tWeed research.g2021 Oct., v. 61, no. 5 p.420-429dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44597x0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.125003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011800168300001800286520127100304592002801575650002301603650001201626650001501638650001201653650002101665650002501686650002601711650002701737650001701764650001401781650002001795650001501815650001101830650002201841650001901863650001301882650001301895653002301908653001901931653001601950653001301966653002101979653003202000653001002032700001802042773014202060856008602202852000902288655001202297IND60677700120221121225323.0211020e20191126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067770012DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2019.16827332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMkadem, Hind10aRecovery and Characterization of Fish Oil from By-products of Sardine (Sardina pilchardus) in the Canning Process  ap. 1037-1050.  aThe objective of this study aimed to recover and characterize fish oil from by-products generated in the sardine fillet canning process. The oil was recovered by hydraulic pressing at 85°C for 30 min. This experiment was done twice a month for one year. The recovery oil samples were analyzed for their fatty acids profile, acidity, peroxide value, and p-anisidine value. The results of this study showed that recovery yield varied significantly during the year depending on the catching period, from 6.0% (April) to 32.9% (July). The average values of acidity, peroxide value, and p-anisidine value were 1.43% oleic acid, 4.61 mEq active oxygen/kg oil, and 4.25, respectively. The fatty acid categories and individual fatty acids of the recovered oil showed a significant seasonal dependency. The sum of polyunsaturated fatty acids ranged from 35.29 to 42.93%. Within this group, the most important acids are eicosapentaenoic acid 20:5 n-3 (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid 22:6 n-3 (DHA). The EPA and DHA ranges were 20.46–24.95% and 4.57–10.18%, respectively. This study confirmed the ability to recover high quality food-grade oil from by-products of the fish canning industry that can be used in other food products to ameliorate their nutritional quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSardina pilchardus 3aacidity 3abyproducts 3acanning 3acanning industry 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afish fillets 3afish oils 3anutritive value 3aoleic acid 3aoxygen 3ap-anisidine value 3aperoxide value 3apressing 3asardines 0aSardina pilchardus 0acooked sardine 0aby-products 0afish oil 0acanning industry 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0ayield1 aKaanane, Amar0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2019 Nov. 26, v. 28, no. 10 p.1037-1050dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2019.16827333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010300161300002000264520094500284592002801229650001501257650003101272650001101303650001301314650001201327650001101339650001101350700001901361700001901380700001701399773012401416856007401540852000901614655001201623IND60618636020221120220227.0181030e20180720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061863602DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra04417a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArsentev, M.

Among the studied adsorption sites, few sites were found to be suitable for physisorption with binding energy up to 0.10 eV per H₂. To increase the activity of hydrogen sorption, the possibility of generating S-vacancies, by removing sulfur atoms from the basal plane of monolayer TiS₃, was investigated. Despite the fact that the structures containing vacancies were found to be stable enough, there was no increase in the activity towards hydrogen adsorption. The same effect was obtained with the use of common methods of increasing of the H₂ adsorption energy: the decoration of the two-dimensional material with alkali metals (Li, Na). This might be caused by the negatively charged surfaces of single layer TiS₃, which hinder the increase in binding by alkali metals through a weak electrostatic interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3alithium 3asodium 3asulfur1 aPetrov, A.

This study seeks to characterize the temporal and spatial properties of uncertainty in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager surface rainfall product over tropical ocean basins. Two uncertainty analysis frameworks are introduced to qualitatively evaluate the properties of uncertainty under a hierarchy of spatiotemporal data resolutions. The first framework (i.e. ‘climate method’) demonstrates that, apart from random errors and regionally dependent biases, a large component of the overall precipitation uncertainty is manifested in cyclical patterns that are closely related to large-scale atmospheric modes of variability. By estimating the magnitudes of major uncertainty sources independently, the climate method is able to explain 45–88% of the monthly uncertainty variability. The percentage is largely resolution dependent (with the lowest percentage explained associated with a 1° × 1° spatial/1 month temporal resolution, and highest associated with a 3° × 3° spatial/3 month temporal resolution). The second framework (i.e. ‘weather method’) explains regional mean precipitation uncertainty as a summation of uncertainties associated with individual precipitation systems. By further assuming that self-similar recurring precipitation systems yield qualitatively comparable precipitation uncertainties, the weather method can consistently resolve about 50% of the daily uncertainty variability, with only limited dependence on the regions of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3aclimate 3arain 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis1 aKummerow, Christian D.1 aElsaesser, Gregory S.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 38, no. 1 p.23-42dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2016.12596763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002100185245010400206500002000310506007600330520142500406592002801831506003701859650002001896650002301916650002401939650001801963650002101981650001902002650001102021650001202032650002502044650001102069650004302080650002102123650001802144650001102162650002202173650002502195650000902220650001602229700001802245700002602263700001902289700001702308700002402325700002602349700002102375700002302396700002202419700002002441700002502461700002102486773014002507856007802647852000902725655001202734IND60595585720221207105903.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059558572DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2017010122doi7 aPMC60014472pmcid7 a296886232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Ulrike,10aIn Vitro and In Vivo Inhibition of Intestinal Glucose Transport by Guava (Psidium Guajava) Extracts  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSCOPE: Known pharmacological activities of guava (Psidium guajava) include modulation of blood glucose levels. However, mechanistic details remain unclear in many cases. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated the effects of different guava leaf and fruit extracts on intestinal glucose transport in vitro and on postprandial glucose levels in vivo. Substantial dose‐ and time‐dependent glucose transport inhibition (up to 80%) was observed for both guava fruit and leaf extracts, at conceivable physiological concentrations in Caco‐2 cells. Using sodium‐containing (both glucose transporters, sodium‐dependent glucose transporter 1 [SGLT1] and glucose transporter 2 [GLUT2], are active) and sodium‐free (only GLUT2 is active) conditions, we show that inhibition of GLUT2 was greater than that of SGLT1. Inhibitory properties of guava extracts also remained stable after digestive juice treatment, indicating a good chemical stability of the active substances. Furthermore, we could unequivocally show that guava extracts significantly reduced blood glucose levels (≈fourfold reduction) in a time‐dependent manner in vivo (C57BL/6N mice). Extracts were characterized with respect to their main putative bioactive compounds (polyphenols) using HPLC and LC‐MS. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrated that guava leaf and fruit extracts can potentially contribute to the regulation of blood glucose levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPsidium guajava 3aactive ingredients 3abioactive compounds 3ablood glucose 3adigestive juices 3afruit extracts 3afruits 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aguavas 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman cell lines 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal properties 3amice 3apolyphenols1 aStübl, Flora1 aSchwarzinger, Bettina1 aSandner, Georg1 aIken, Marcus1 aHimmelsbach, Markus1 aSchwarzinger, Clemens1 aOllinger, Nicole1 aStadlbauer, Verena1 aHöglinger, Otmar1 aKühne, Tobias,1 aLanzerstorfer, Peter1 aWeghuber, Julian0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2018 June, v. 62, no. 11 p.e1701012-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2017010123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013200162300001400294500001500308520090900323592002801232650002101260650002201281650000901303650002201312650001101334650001901345650004401364650001401408650002201422650001201444653002101456700002201477700001601499700001701515773010801532856008201640852000901722655001201731IND60085276420221122031119.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008527642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasui, M.10aSynthesis, crystal structure modeling and thermal decomposition of yttrium propionate [Y₂(CH₃CH₂COO)₆·H₂O]·3.5H₂O  ap. 88-93.  a2019-12-06  aAn yttrium propionate complex was synthesized and characterized for its application as precursor for Y₂O₃ based oxide thin films deposition and YBa₂Cu₃O₇₋ₓ superconducting thin films.

However, their deployment hinges on the development of new anode materials, since it has been shown that many important anode materials employed in lithium ion batteries, such as graphite and silicon, are inadequate for sodium-ion batteries. We have simply prepared novel SnS/C nanocomposites through a top-down approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Their electrochemical performance has been significantly improved when compared to bare SnS, especially in terms of cycling stability and rate capabilities. SnS/C nanocomposites exhibit excellent capacity retention, at various current rates, and deliver capacities as high as 400 mA h g⁻¹ even at the high current density of 800 mA g⁻¹ (2C). Ex situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and operando X-ray absorption near edge structure studies have been performed in order to unravel the reaction mechanism of the SnS/C nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3ananocomposites 3areaction mechanisms 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aJin, Aihua1 aHuang, Xin1 aYang, Yao1 aHuang, Rong1 aBrock, Joel D.1 aSung, Yung-Eun1 aAbruña, Héctor D.,0 tRSC advances.g2018 June 29, v. 8, no. 42 p.23847-23853dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra04421j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009200160520142700252592002801679650001301707650000901720650001101729650001001740700001801750773012001768856007401888852000901962655001201971IND60787907320221116211714.0220811e20220806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078790732DNAL7 a10.3390/w141524372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeidan, Mohamad 10aUnsteady Friction Modeling Technique for Lagrangian Approaches in Transient Simulations  aThis study investigates the simulation of celerity attenuation and head damping in transient flows using a Lagrangian approach rather than an Eulerian approach. Typically, the Lagrangian approach requires orders of magnitude fewer calculations, resulting in the rapid solution of very large systems. Additionally, it is based on a simple physical model. As the method is continuous in both time and space, it is less sensitive to the structure of the network and the length of the simulation process. Most recent studies, however, have focused on the development and improvement of computational routines for modeling in an Eulerian environment. This results in the development of adequate models that are suitable for Eulerian models but not applicable in Lagrangian-based models. As a result of this fixation, a bias was created towards using Eulerian approaches in transient simulations. It also diverts resources from further development of Lagrangian models. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a friction model that is more accurate and compatible with Lagrangian methods without compromising their performance. To the authors’ knowledge, such a model is yet to be published in the literature. This study presents a new friction modeling technique that compensates for both the local and convective acceleration terms for the Lagrangian transient modeling approach without compromising the computational time.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3ahead 3amodels 3awater1 aOstfeld, Avi 0 tWater.g2022 Aug. 06, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141524373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04167naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018900165300001600354520230900370592002802679650001302707650002502720650001102745650002602756650001202782650002402794650002402818650002602842650001802868650001102886650001702897650001402914650003002928650002302958650001402981650001102995650001203006650002203018650001103040650001903051650002203070650001103092651001003103653001703113653002703130653003403157653001003191653001303201653000903214653001003223653000903233653000803242653000903250653001103259653000803270700002303278700001703301773009503318856008303413852000903496655001203505IND60529832920221120170354.0180830e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052983292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWada, Minoru10aDynamics of bacterial community structure on intertidal sandflat inhabited by the ghost shrimp Nihonotrypaea harmandi (Decapoda: Axiidea: Callianassidae) in Tomioka Bay, Amakusa, Japan  ap. 657-666.  aCallianassid (ghost) shrimp has been claimed as an ecosystem engineer, as it is one of the most powerful bioturbating macrobenthos in intertidal sandflats. However, our knowledge about the relationship between areal distribution of bottom-dwelling ghost shrimps and dynamics of sediment microbial community structure remains obscured. We used automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to reveal the bacterial community dynamics in the sediment of intertidal sandflat of Tomioka Bay, Kyushu, Japan, which is predominantly inhabited by a burrow-dwelling callianassid shrimp Nihonotrypaea harmandi. We found that the bacterial community structures of high and middle shrimp population areas were significantly differentiated from those of low population area (ANOSIM, R=0.10–0.18, p<0.01), while the former two areas were statistically indistinguishable (ANOSIM, R=−0.015, p>0.1). These results illustrated the potential importance of shrimp population density as a key factor in shaping the bacterial community structure and interpreting their dynamics in the sandflat. Furthermore, greater similarity between burrow and non-burrow communities was found in samples taken in autumn through winter than in those in summer (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05), whereas the phylotype richness was not simply differentiated by seasons. These results suggest not only that environmental variables including water temperature and salinity of the water column overlying the sandflat could exert notable impacts on the sediment bacterial community dynamics, but that the bio-irrigation and mixing by the ghost shrimp in permeable sandflat would strongly homogenize sediment particles, enhance solute transport surrounding the burrow and ambient subsurface substrate, and therefore reduce spatial differentiation of the bacterial community structure between the two sites. A comparison between present and previous studies of axiidean (former taxonomic group name, thalassinidean) ghost shrimps provides us with a comprehensive understanding of the shrimps' impacts on bacterial community dynamics, highlighting the importance of sediment permeability, a characteristic determined by the type of sediment, as a key controlling factor to shape spatial heterogeneity of bacterial community structure around burrow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDecapoda 3aanalysis of variance 3aautumn 3abacterial communities 3aburrows 3acommunity structure 3aecosystem engineers 3aenvironmental factors 3alittoral zone 3amixing 3apermeability 3aphylotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation density 3asediments 3ashrimp 3asolutes 3aspatial variation 3asummer 3awater salinity 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aJapan 0aGhost shrimp 0aNihonotrypaea harmandi 0aBacterial community structure 0aARISA 0aSandflat 0arITS 0aARISA 0arRNA 0aOTU 0anMDS 0aANOSIM 0aTOC1 aUrakawa, Tatsuyuki1 aTamaki, Akio0 tGene.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 576, no. 2 p.657-666dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245015000152300001800302520134700320592002801667650001301695650003601708650001801744650002601762650001001788650001101798650001401809650003401823650002001857700002401877700002001901700002101921773013201942856007502074852000902149655001202158IND60538516120170621000000.0160815e20120425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053851612DNAL7 a10.1021/ja301252h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Lei13aAn Exciton-Coupled Circular Dichroism Protocol for the Determination of Identity, Chirality, and Enantiomeric Excess of Chiral Secondary Alcohols  ap. 7117-7125.  aChiral mono-ols are among the most sought after targets in asymmetric synthesis, and therefore, their chemical characterization and associated enantiomeric excess (ee) values are commonly reported. A simple optical method for determining alcohol identity and ee could be widely used. Toward this end, an in situ-generated multicomponent assembly that creates diastereomeric tris(pyridine) metal complexes incorporating chiral secondary alcohols was explored using exciton-coupled circular dichroism (ECCD). Qualitative models were proposed to predict the preferential diastereomer and its twist, and computational studies provided a rationalization of the CD spectra. Different ECCD spectra found for diastereomers formed in the self-assembled tris(pyridine) complexes were used to determine the absolute configurations of chiral mono-ols. Linear discriminant analysis was successfully employed to classify the alcohol analytes, thereby allowing identification of the alcohols. Conformational effects imparted by heteroatoms were also explored, further expanding the substrate scope. Finally, ee calibration curves allowed the determination of the ee of unknown samples of three chiral secondary alcohols with an average error of 3%. The assay described here is unique because no preparation of structurally elaborated chiral hosts is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adiastereomers 3adiscriminant analysis 3ahosts 3amodels 3apyridines 3astandard operating procedures 3astereoisomerism1 aPescitelli, Gennaro1 aAnslyn, Eric V.1 aDi Bari, Lorenzo0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Apr. 25, v. 134, no. 16 p.7117-7125dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja301252h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245018000166520106400346592002801410650002201438650002501460650001001485650001101495650001301506650001401519650002001533650001701553650001001570650001001580650000901590650001301599653009301612700001501705700001601720700001901736700001501755700001801770700001701788700001901805700001301824773009201837856008601929852000902015655001202024IND60713132220221121231027.0211227e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071313222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1217452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Yaxin10aFluorescence switch of gold nanoclusters stabilized with bovine serum albumin for efficient and sensitive detection of cysteine and copper ion in mice with Alzheimer's disease  aThe near-infrared fluorescence of gold nanoclusters stabilized with bovine serum albumin (BSA -AuNCs) centered at 675 nm could be enhanced by cysteine and then effectively quenched by copper ion (Cu²⁺), therefore, cysteine and copper ion could be detected in sequence. At “on” state, fluorescence enhancement of BSA-AuNCs is generated due to the reaction between cysteine and BSA-AuNCs, via filling the surface defect of gold nanoclusters, while Cu²⁺ can further oxidize the reductive sulfydryl of cysteine and interact with amino acids presented in the BSA chain, inducing gold nanoclusters to aggregate, thus causing “off” state with fluorescence quenching. Fluorescence switch of BSA-AuNCs can be used for cysteine and Cu²⁺ detection in mice brain with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vitro, with fast response, high chemical stability and sensitivity. Besides, it was able to image the endogenous Cu²⁺ in liver and heart of AD mice in situ.

It is possible to select healthy larvae by observing different kinds of lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCossidae 3aLissonota 3aendoparasitoids 3afriction 3afungi 3ahumans 3alarvae 3amelanization 3aMexico1 aLlanderal, C.0 tSouthwestern entomologist.g2014 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.285-290dSociety of Southwestern Entomologistsx0147-17247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3958%2F059.039.02063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012100168300001400289520120200303592002801505650001701533650002201550650001601572650001601588650002401604650001401628650001501642650001501657650001101672650001701683650001601700700001801716773010501734856008101839852000901920655001201929IND60085416420221122182214.0141101e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008541642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuan-Yuan10aKinetic study of enantioselective hydrolysis of (R, S)-ketoprofen ethyl ester using immobilized T. laibacchii lipase  ap. 40-46.  aImmobilized Trichosporon laibacchii lipase was used to catalyzed enantioselective hydrolysis of (S)-ketoprofen from (R, S)-ketoprofen ethyl ester in an aqueous system containing Tween-80 as the emulsifier. An inherent kinetic model based on irreversible ping-pong bi–bi mechanism with competitive inhibition of both enantiomer products was developed. The diffusion limitations and enzyme deactivation were proved to be negligible. The solution of ordinary differential equations “ode45” was successfully combined with Matlab optimization function “fmincon” to estimate kinetic parameters. The kinetic experiments were carried out in a 100mL stirred tank reactor at various temperatures (30, 35, 40 and 45°C) at 200rpm. The simulated values of the model fitted the experimental values well and the kinetic constant has a good fitness with Arrhenius equation. Thus, the kinetic model proposed here is feasible and can be used for mechanism interpretation of the hydrolytic resolution of racemic ketoprofen ester and the reactor scale-up design. High enantiomeric ratio (E of 87) indicates that this biotransformation is a promising example for the industrial production of (S)-ketoprofen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichosporon 3abiotransformation 3aemulsifiers 3aenantiomers 3aenzyme inactivation 3aequations 3ahydrolysis 3aketoprofen 3amodels 3apolysorbates 3atemperature1 aLiu, Jun-Hong0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 54, no. 1 p.40-46dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2011.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014100176500001900317520197800336592002802314650001502342650001002357650001802367650001002385650001402395650001802409650001802427650002202445650001202467653001402479653002102493653002802514653002202542653001602564653002602580653002002606700003302626700002702659700002902686700007002715700004502785773009202830856008602922852000903008655001203017IND60696112320221122221059.0201223e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069611232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e039692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBezerra, Isis Morais10aGlass ionomer cements compared with composite resin in restoration of noncarious cervical lesions: A systematic review and meta-analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRestoring noncarious cervical lesions are challenging to clinical practice. This study aimed to compare the clinical performance/longevity of glass ionomer cements (GIC) and composite resins (CR) used for noncarious cervical lesions (NCCL) through a systematic review and meta-analysis (MA).Randomized and controlled clinical trials and nonrandomized clinical trials, which compared the clinical performance/longevity of CR and GIC (conventional and/or resin-modified) in the treatment of NCCL, were included.The methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Seven MAs were performed considering (1) the clinical performance of the parameters in common: retention, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, secondary caries, color, anatomic form, surface texture and (2) a follow-up time of 12, 24 and 36 months. The prevalence of successful restorations and the total number of restorations per clinical parameter/follow-up time were used to calculate the relative risk (95% CI).After screening of the studies, 13 studies were used for quantitative synthesis. The risk difference (CI 95%, α, I²) between GIC and CR for anatomic form was 0.00 (-0.02, 0.02; p = 0.83; 0%); for color was -0.02 (-0.08, 0.04; p = 0.48; 80%); for surface texture was -0.02 (-0.06, 0.02; p = 0.31; 63%); for secondary caries was -0.00 (-0.01, 0.01; p = 0.87; 0%); for marginal discoloration was 0.01 (-0.01, 0.03; p = 0.23; 3%); for marginal adaptation was 0.01 (-0.01, 0.04; p = 0.34; 32%) and for retention was 0.07 (0.02, 0.12; p = 0.003; 76%).GIC showed a clinical performance significantly higher than CR in regard to retention, whereas for the other parameters, GIC was similar to CR.NCCLs is increasingly prevalent among the population and this type of lesion causing defects in the tooth that affect not only aesthetics but also everyday habits, such as drinking, eating and teeth brushing, due to the sensitivity these lesions cause.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3acolor 3adiscoloration 3aglass 3alongevity 3ameta-analysis 3arelative risk 3asystematic review 3atexture 0aDentistry 0aDental materials 0aEvidence-based medicine 0aClinical research 0aRoot caries 0aGlass ionomer cements 0aComposite resin1 aBrito, Arella Cristina Muniz1 ade Sousa, Simone Alves1 aSantiago, Bianca Marques1 aCavalcanti, Yuri Wanderley1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3570-99041 ade Almeida, Leopoldina de Fátima Dantas0 tHeliyon.g2020 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.e03969-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e039693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245016800152300001800320520135300338592002801691650001901719650002501738650001001763650002001773650001701793650002101810650001801831650001201849650001901861650001901880700001601899700001701915700002001932700001301952700001501965773011001980856007502090852000902165655001202174IND60529603720221119070530.0160717e20130416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052960372DNAL7 a10.1021/ac400750r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhao10aNitroreductase Detection and Hypoxic Tumor Cell Imaging by a Designed Sensitive and Selective Fluorescent Probe, 7-[(5-Nitrofuran-2-yl)methoxy]-3H-phenoxazin-3-one  ap. 3926-3932.  aA highly selective and sensitive fluorescence probe, 7-[(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methoxy]-3H-phenoxazin-3-one (1), is developed for imaging the hypoxic status of tumor cells via the indirect detection of nitroreductase. The detection mechanism is based on the fact that nitroreductase can selectively catalyze the reduction of the nitro group in 1 to a hydroxylamine or amino group in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as an electron donor that is indispensable, followed by the 1,6-rearrangement–elimination and the release of resorufin. As a result, the reaction produces a distinct color and fluorescence change from almost colorless and nonfluorescent to pink and strong red fluorescence. The fluorescence increase of probe 1 at λ₅₅₀/₅₈₅ ₙₘ is directly proportional to the concentration of nitroreductase in the range of 15–300 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.27 ng/mL. The ready reduction of the nitro group in 1 under hypoxic conditions leads to the establishment of a sensitive and selective fluorescence method for imaging the hypoxic status of tumor cells, and with this method Hela and A549 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (even for different extents of hypoxia) can be differentiated successfully. This method is simple and may be useful for the imaging of disease-relevant hypoxia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aanaerobic conditions 3acolor 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydroxylamine 3ahypoxia 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasm cells1 aLi, Xiaohua1 aGao, Xinghui1 aZhang, Yangyang1 aShi, Wen1 aMa, Huimin0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Apr. 16, v. 85, no. 8 p.3926-3932dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac400750r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008500165500001900250520129800269592002801567650001201595650001401607650001401621650001701635650001301652650001401665650001301679651001001692653002501702653001301727653002501740653001501765700005501780700005901835700001601894700002001910700001601930700002201946773008701968856008502055852000902140655001202149IND60717682320221118023256.0210405e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071768232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2020.1050232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Liguo10aDistribution and behavior of plutonium isotopes in Western Pacific marginal seas  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to atmospheric nuclear weapon tests carried out by various countries and the ground-level test series conducted at Marshall Islands by the US, marine environments have been extensively contaminated by plutonium over the Western Pacific marginal seas, especially in the China Seas. The released plutonium isotopes can serve as geochemical tracers for various physical and biogeochemical ocean processes. In this critical review, the source term, temporal-spatial distribution and geochemical behavior of plutonium isotopes in seawater and sediments in the China Seas are summarized and discussed, and then they are compared to those in the neighboring seas. A database of plutonium activity concentrations, isotope ratio, and inventories in marine environments in the China Seas is established. We concluded that global fallout and the Pacific Proving Grounds were still the major source of plutonium in the China Seas. The spatial distributions of plutonium in the China Seas indicated surface plutonium activity concentration in sediments in estuary area is lower than that in shelf region, and we thus clarified that plutonium in seawater in nearshore area is scavenged more efficiently than in open sea. Finally, future research needs for plutonium in marine environments are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatenas 3adatabases 3aestuaries 3ageochemistry 3aisotopes 3aplutonium 3aseawater 3aChina 0aSpatial distribution 0aSediment 0aSource and transport 0aChina Seas1 aZheng, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0616-55701 aZhou, Zhengchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3966-97351 aBu, Wenting1 aWang, Zhongtang1 aZheng, Wang1 aYamada, Masatoshi0 tCatena.g2021 Mar., v. 198 p.105023-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1050233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01681naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245014600129300001800275520053000293592002800823650002300851650002700874650001300901650001700914650002000931650000900951650002100960650000700981650001300988650003901001653002101040653002801061653001401089653002501103700001801128773015201146852000901298655001201307IND60705738420221119192721.0200807e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070573842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarika, A.R.10aProduction of a Bacteriocin PSY2 from Marine Perch-Associated Lactococcus lactis PSY2 with Inhibitory Activity Against Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 2722-2727.  aMarine LABs and their bacteriocins are receiving increased focus due to their unique potentialities in antimicrobial strategy and in biopreservation.

These non-absorbable materials specifically bind bile acids (BAs) in the intestine, preventing bile acid (BA) reabsorption into the blood through enterohepatic circulation. Therefore, it is important to understand the structure-property relationships between the polymer sequestrant and its ability to bind specific BAs molecules. In this review, we describe pleiotropic effects of bile acids, and we focus on BAS with various molecular architectures that result in different mechanisms of BA sequestration. Here, we present 1) amphiphilic polymers based on poly(meth)acrylates, poly(meth)acrylamides, polyalkylamines and polyallylamines containing quaternary ammonium groups, 2) cyclodextrins, and 3) BAS prepared via molecular imprinting methods. The synthetic approaches leading to individual BAS preparation, as well as results of their in vitro BA binding activities and in vivo lipid-lowering activities, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aReview 0abile acid sequestrant 0aPleiotropic effect 0aCholestyramine 0aCyclodextrin 0amolecular imprinting1 aŽák, Aleš,1 aPoláková, Lenka1 aHobzová, Radka1 aHromádka, Róbert1 aŠirc, Jakub0 tEuropean journal of medicinal chemistry.g2017, dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:26767x0223-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010700178500001900285520115400304592002801458650004401486650002001530650001901550650002301569650001301592650002601605650001001631650001801641650001901659650001301678650001301691650004401704650001801748650001301766650002101779650002101800653001201821653001401833653001901847653001401866653001201880653002201892653001401914653002401928653002001952700001701972700002101989700002102010700006802031700005802099700001902157773009202176856008602268852000902354655001202363IND60696112420221122221241.0201223e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069611242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e039752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalekhosseini, Shifteh10aFabrication and characterization of hydrocortisone loaded Dextran-Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic acid micelle  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA nanomicelle based drug delivery systems is a formulation that can improve the bioavailability and dissolution rate of water-insoluble drugs. In this study, the Dextran-Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid copolymer was synthesized with esterification reaction, confirmed using the fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. The used method for nanomicelle preparation was nanoprecipitation and the critical micelle concentration value was obtained 10 μg/mL. The particle size of the nanomicelle was less than 100 nm ± 4 nm with narrow size distribution (Polydispersity index = 0.06). Hydrocortisone was loaded to this system. The obtained results for the encapsulation efficiency were 79%, and the drug release was adjusted to a first-order kinetic model with 90% release of drug within the 12 h. The MTT assay showed that even in the high concentration of micelle, the cell viability was remained higher than 90%. Considering the toxicity investigation findings, the Dextran-Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid micellar systems can be suggested as a considerable drug delivery system in hydrocortisone pharmaceutical dosage forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abioavailability 3acell viability 3acomposite polymers 3acortisol 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aesterification 3akinetics 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3awater solubility 0aMicelle 0aCopolymer 0aHydrocortisone 0aMTT assay 0aPhysics 0aMaterials science 0aChemistry 0aBiological sciences 0aHealth sciences1 aRezaie, Aram1 aKhaledian, Salar1 aAbdoli, Mohadese1 aZangeneh, Mohammad Mahdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6892-29551 aHosseini, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5432-88751 aBehbood, Leila0 tHeliyon.g2020 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.e03975-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e039753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245008300204500001900287520176200306592002802068650001202096650001902108650001502127650001202142650001902154650001902173650001002192650001002202650001202212650001502224650001302239650001002252650001302262650001502275650002202290650002002312650001002332651001002342653002102352653002202373653001602395653002502411653002302436700001502459700001902474700001802493700001602511773011202527856008402639852000902723655001202732IND60717447820221116235437.0210121e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071744782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e013602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yajie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3913-281210aCascading response of flora and terrestrial mollusks to last deglacial warming  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe cascading impacts of climate-driven vegetation change on terrestrial invertebrates via trophic and habitat routes is a matter of outstanding concern. However, the combined responses of plant-animal associations in terrestrial ecosystems have seldom been reported on geological timescales, which raises the important questions of how frequently and to what extent such multi-trophic shifts in taxa have occurred during previous warming scenarios. Here we use a combination of mollusk, palynological, and climatic proxy evidence preserved within loess deposits in the southern Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) to demonstrate how long-term changes in hydroclimatic dynamics during the past 26 kyr were reflected in the subsequent ecological changes. Specifically, there was a shift from a predominantly cold-tolerant mollusk fauna in a dry-steppe environment under cold-dry conditions during the last glacial, to a predominantly thermal-mesophilous fauna in a meadow-steppe environment under a warm temperate climate in the early-middle Holocene. Warmth-adapted mollusk species such as Opeas striatissimum and Punctum orphana were found to have been associated with several deciduous tree taxa (e.g., Corylus, Quercus, and Pterocarya) in both the Holocene record and in the modern ecosystem (based on surveys of 356 surface-soil plots). This suggests there is a clear ecological interdependency between specific vegetation types and mollusk assemblages. As such, the long-term vegetation-mollusk fossil records highlight the indirect impacts of climate change on terrestrial invertebrate turnover via plant-derived food structure and habitat routes, with major implications for understanding how these ecosystems are likely to respond to future climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorylus 3aHolocene epoch 3aPterocarya 3aQuercus 3aclimate change 3acold tolerance 3afauna 3aflora 3afossils 3aglaciation 3ahabitats 3aloess 3amolluscs 3apalynology 3aplant-based foods 3atemperate zones 3atrees 3aChina 0aClimatic warming 0aLong-term impacts 0aLand snails 0aSynchronous turnover 0aPlant associations1 aWu, Naiqin1 aJiang, Wenying1 aLi, Fengjiang1 aLu, Houyuan0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2020 Dec., v. 24 p.e01360-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e013603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245005200158300001600210520156400226592002801790650002101818650001501839650001601854650001901870650001901889650001301908650001401921650001901935650001701954650001501971650001301986650001101999650000902010650001402019650001702033653001602050653001502066653002202081653002002103653001502123700001902138700003402157773009502191856003802286852000902324655001202333IND50066362820221121053300.0130514s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006636282DNAL7 a10.1071/FP130612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Susanne14aThe mixotrophic nature of photosynthetic plants  ap. 425-438.  aPlants typically have photosynthetically competent green shoots. To complement resources derived from the atmospheric environment, plants also acquire essential elements from soil. Inorganic ions and molecules are generally considered to be the sources of soil-derived nutrients, and plants tested in this respect can grow with only inorganic nutrients and so can live as autotrophs. However, mycorrhizal symbionts are known to access nutrients from organic matter. Furthermore, specialist lineages of terrestrial photosynthetically competent plants are mixotrophic, including species that obtain organic nutrition from animal prey (carnivores), fungal partners (mycoheterotrophs) or plant hosts (hemi-parasites). Although mixotrophy is deemed the exception in terrestrial plants, it is a common mode of nutrition in aquatic algae. There is mounting evidence that non-specialist plants acquire organic compounds as sources of nutrients, taking up and metabolising a range of organic monomers, oligomers, polymers and even microbes as sources of nitrogen and phosphorus. Plasma-membrane located transporter proteins facilitate the uptake of low-molecular mass organic compounds, endo- and phagocytosis may enable the acquisition of larger compounds, although this has not been confirmed. Identifying the mechanisms involved in the acquisition of organic nutrients will provide understanding of the ecological significance of mixotrophy. Here, we discuss mixotrophy in the context of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition drawing parallels between algae and plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal nutrition 3acarnivores 3ahost plants 3ainorganic ions 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphagocytosis 3aphosphorus 3apolymers 3ashoots 3asoil 3asymbionts 3atransporters 0aendocytosis 0amixotrophy 0aorganic nutrients 0aplant nutrition 0aroot hairs1 aRaven, John A.1 aPaungfoo-Lonhienne, Chanyarat0 tFunctional plant biology.g2013, v. 40, no. 5 p.425-438dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP13061  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245008900210300001600299506007600315520097500391592002801366506003701394650002901431650001101460650000901471650001001480650001401490650001301504650000901517650001501526650002201541650001601563650002001579650003001599650001401629650002201643650001801665700002101683700002501704700002101729773009101750856008101841852000901922655001201931IND60549124420221207125914.0160906e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054912442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10126-016-9708-62doi7 aPMC50072682pmcid7 a272365142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehler, Carola E.10aDevelopment of an Efficient Genome Editing Method by CRISPR/Cas9 in a Fish Cell Line  ap. 449-452.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCRISPR/Cas9 system has been used widely in animals and plants to direct mutagenesis. To date, no such method exists for fish somatic cell lines. We describe an efficient procedure for genome editing in the Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha CHSE. This cell line was genetically modified to firstly overexpress a monomeric form of EGFP (cell line CHSE-E Geneticin resistant) and additionally to overexpress nCas9n, a nuclear version of Cas9 (cell line CHSE-EC, Hygromycin and Geneticin resistant). A pre-validated sgRNA was produced in vitro and used to transfect CHSE-EC cells. The EGFP gene was disrupted in 34.6 % of cells, as estimated by FACS and microscopy. The targeted locus was characterised by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of PCR products; inactivation of the EGFP gene by deletions in the expected site was validated in 25 % of clones. This method opens perspectives for functional genomic studies compatible with high-throughput screening.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3aclones 3afish 3agenes 3ageneticin 3agenomics 3aloci 3amicroscopy 3amolecular cloning 3amutagenesis 3aplants (botany) 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asomatic cells1 aBoudinot, Pierre1 aMartin, Samuel A.

Pathogenic germline variants in CCM1, CCM2, or CCM3 can be identified in nearly 100% of CCM patients with a positive family history. In line with the concept that tumor-like mechanisms are involved in CCM formation and growth, we here demonstrate an abnormally increased proliferation rate of CCM3-deficient endothelial cells in co-culture with wild-type cells and in mosaic human iPSC-derived vascular organoids. The observation that NSC59984, an anticancer drug, blocked the abnormal proliferation of mutant endothelial cells further supports this intriguing concept. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA sequencing revealed that co-culture induces upregulation of proangiogenic chemokine genes in wild-type endothelial cells. Furthermore, genes known to be significantly downregulated in CCM3⁻/⁻ endothelial cell mono-cultures were upregulated back to normal levels in co-culture with wild-type cells. These results support the hypothesis that wild-type ECs facilitate the formation of a niche that promotes abnormal proliferation of mutant ECs. Thus, targeting the cancer-like features of CCMs is a promising new direction for drug development.  aPublisher supplied data  a03Z22CN11cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung  a161L0276cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung  a03Z22DN11cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung  a03Z22Di1cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung  aRA2876/2-2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aFOVB-2020-01cResearch Network Molecular Medicine of the University Medicine Greifswald  aFOVB-2021-07cResearch Network Molecular Medicine of the University Medicine Greifswald 3aRNA 3aantineoplastic agents 3achemokines 3acoculture 3adrug development 3aendothelial cells 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3amutants 3aorganoids1 aSchwefel, Konrad1 aMalinverno, Matteo1 aSkowronek, Dariush1 aLeopoldi, Alexandra1 aPilz, Robin A.1 aBiedenweg, Doreen1 aBekeschus, Sander1 aPenninger, Josef M.1 aDejana, Elisabetta1 aFelbor, Ute0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2022 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.340-340dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04355-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245008300201300002000284520153900304592002801843650001801871650002101889650002201910650001701932650001901949650002401968650001001992650001102002650001502013650001902028650001802047650001702065650001202082650002102094650001902115650002602134650001102160653003702171653002202208653002402230653002802254653001602282653001402298700001402312700001902326700001602345700001402361700001502375700001502390700006002405700001702465700001402482773015002496856008102646852000902727655001202736IND60754956020221119160839.0211027e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075495602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c046322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Haojie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7460-437410aPotential of Producing Flavonoids Using Cyanobacteria As a Sustainable Chassis  ap. 12385-12401.  aNumerous plant secondary metabolites have remarkable impacts on both food supplements and pharmaceuticals for human health improvement. However, higher plants can only generate small amounts of these chemicals with specific temporal and spatial arrangements, which are unable to satisfy the expanding market demands. Cyanobacteria can directly utilize CO₂, light energy, and inorganic nutrients to synthesize versatile plant-specific photosynthetic intermediates and organic compounds in large-scale photobioreactors with outstanding economic merit. Thus, they have been rapidly developed as a “green” chassis for the synthesis of bioproducts. Flavonoids, chemical compounds based on aromatic amino acids, are considered to be indispensable components in a variety of nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic applications. In contrast to heterotrophic metabolic engineering pioneers, such as yeast and Escherichia coli, information about the biosynthesis flavonoids and their derivatives is less comprehensive than that of their photosynthetic counterparts. Here, we review both benefits and challenges to promote cyanobacterial cell factories for flavonoid biosynthesis. With increasing concerns about global environmental issues and food security, we are confident that energy self-supporting cyanobacteria will attract increasing attention for the generation of different kinds of bioproducts. We hope that the work presented here will serve as an index and encourage more scientists to join in the relevant research area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aEscherichia coli 3abiobased products 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon dioxide 3adietary supplements 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aflavonoids 3afood chemistry 3afood security 3ahuman health 3amarkets 3aphotobioreactors 3aphotosynthesis 3asecondary metabolites 3ayeasts 0acarbon fixation and distribution 0ashikimate pathway 0aaromatic amino acid 0aphenylpropanoid pathway 0aP450 enzyme 0apromoters1 aWang, Yan1 aZhao, Pengquan1 aWang, Litao1 aZhang, Su1 aMeng, Dong1 aYang, Qing1 aCheong, Lingzhi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6760-85531 aBi, Yonghong1 aFu, Yujie0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 69, no. 42 p.12385-12401dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c046323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02057naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014400167500002200311500002200333520098500355592002801340653003501368653003501403653003901438653003101477700001101508700001201519700001301531773010601544856008401650852000901734655001201743IND60613769120221119013536.0180914s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061376912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shuyue10aSynthesis and biological evaluation of novel 1-(aryl-aldehyde-oxime)uracil derivatives as a new class of thymidine phosphorylase inhibitors  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aA novel series of 1-(aryl aldehyde oxime) uracil derivatives were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for its inhibitory activity against thymidine phosphorylase.

In general, these results indicated these compounds are promising inhibitors of thymidine phosphorylase for the potential treatment of anti-angiogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 0a1-(aryl-aldehyde-oxime)-uracil 0aDerivatives/anti-proliferative 0aActivities/thymidine phosphorylase 0aInhibitory/docking studies1 aLi, Ke1 aJin, Yi1 aLin, Jun0 tEuropean journal of medicinal chemistry.g2017, dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:26767x0223-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300001600267520176000283592002802043650001802071650001602089650002202105650001502127650001302142650001202155650001202167650002202179650002202201650001902223650001102242650000702253650003402260650003302294650003802327650003702365653003402402653002202436653003902458653005302497653002902550653003002579700001702609700001402626700001702640700001302657700001802670700001502688700001802703700001302721700001802734700001602752700002002768700001402788700001902802700001502821773010302836856008402939852000903023655001203032IND60123394320221121003346.0150325e20141126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012339432DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2014.9073792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zuozhen10aBio-precipitation of Calcite with Preferential Orientation Induced by Synechocystis sp. PCC6803  ap. 884-899.  aThis article presents a research study on the deposition process of Ca ²⁺ induced by Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 in BG11 liquid medium with different Ca ²⁺ concentrations and different pH. The changes of Ca ²⁺ concentrations were measured by using atomic absorption method and the corresponding dynamical models were studied. Minerals and cells were analyzed by high resolution transmission electron microscope, selected area electron diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope, X-ray diffraction. The selected area electron diffraction patterns were analyzed by Digital Micrograph 3.7 software. The result showed that Ca ²⁺ concentrations decreased faster in the experimental group. The changes of calcium carbonate precipitation were fitting to an exponential model. PH 7 and Ca ²⁺ concentration of 1.5 g/L were most conducive to calcium carbonate precipitation in the corresponding gradient range. The result of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed that minerals in the experimental group differed obviously from that of the control group in the surface morphology, but both of them were calcites. It also showed that a certain number of minute calcites adhesion to the outer surfaces of S. PCC6803 cells. The result of scanning electron microscopy displayed that many sunken holes emerged on the surfaces of the prismatic calcium carbonate minerals. The results of X-ray diffraction proved that minerals induced by S. PCC6803 were calcites with preferential orientation. This article discusses the process of carbonate formation and the possible role played by S . PCC6803. It may be useful to further study the mechanism of microbial carbonates deposition in the field of geology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechocystis 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acomputer software 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 0adifferent Ca2+ concentrations 0adynamical process 0aextracellular polymeric substances 0ahigh resolution transmission electron microscopy 0apreferential orientation 0aSynechocystis sp.

From September to November 2012, we used a motorized aspirator to collect 2,144 female Ae. aegypti from 569 homes. These were grouped into 220 to use semi-nested RT-PCR for DENV, and positive groups were analyzed individually. Five groups (2.27%) were positive for DENV. Individual analysis yielded eight groups that tested positive, six with DENV-2, one DENV-1, and one DENV-4. The latter was not reported by the surveillance system that year. The mean number of female mosquitoes per household was 3.77 ± 5.71, and the rate of viral infection of Ae. aegypti was 0.4%. Most infected mosquitoes (49%) were concentrated in 10% of the houses. Monitoring Ae. aegypti infected with DENV has the potential to complement the current system of clinical and entomological surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aDengue virus 3adisease outbreaks 3afemales 3amonitoring 3apopulation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3aMexico1 aSánchez-Casas, Rosa M.1 aGaitan-Burns, Alejandro1 aDíaz-González, Esteban E.1 aIbarra-Juarez, Luis A.1 aGarza, Carlos E.

P6 Isolated from a Mangrove Ecosystem  ap. 500-510.  aAfter screening of over 300 yeast strains isolated from the mangrove ecosystems, it was found that Aureobasidium sp. P6 strain had the highest inulin-hydrolyzing activity. Under the optimal conditions, this yeast strain produced an inulin-hydrolyzing activity of 30.98 ± 0.8 U/ml after 108 h of a 10-l fermentation. After the purification, a molecular weight of the enzyme which had the inulin-hydrolyzing activity was estimated to be 47.6 kDa, and the purified enzyme could actively hydrolyze both sucrose and inulin and exhibit a transfructosylating activity at 30.0 % sucrose, converting sucrose into fructooligosaccharides (FOS), indicating that the purified enzyme was a β-D-fructofuranosidase. After the full length of a β-D-fructofuranosidase gene (accession number KU308553) was cloned from Aureobasidium sp. P6 strain, a protein deduced from the cloned gene contained the conserved sequences MNDPNGL, RDP, ECP, FS, and Q of a glycosidehydrolase GH32 family, respectively, but did not contain a conserved sequence SVEVF, and the amino acid sequence of the protein from Aureobasidium sp. P6 strain had a high similarity to that of the β-fructofuranosidase from any other fungal strains. After deletion of the β-D-fructofuranosidase gene, the disruptant still had low inulin hydrolyzing and invertase activities and a trace amount of the transfructosylating activity, indicating that the gene encoding an inulinase may exist in the Aureobasidium sp. P6 strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAureobasidium 3aamino acid sequences 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3aconserved sequences 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3afructooligosaccharides 3agenes 3ainulin 3ainulinase 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3ascreening 3asucrose 3ayeasts1 aMa, Yan1 aChi, Zhe1 aLiu, Guang-Lei1 aChi, Zhen-Ming0 tMarine biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.500-510dSpringer USx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-016-9712-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011500163520142900278592002801707650006701735650002501802650001101827650005001838650002301888650001901911650002601930650001501956650002401971650002301995700001702018700001502035700001902050700001702069700001902086700001702105700002802122700001702150700001802167773012902185856007402314852000902388655001202397IND60651334720221117221850.0190711e20190612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065133472DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111213992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinker, Rachel  T.10aTowards a Unified and Coherent Land Surface Temperature Earth System Data Record from Geostationary Satellites  aOur objective is to develop a framework for deriving long term, consistent Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) from Geostationary (GEO) satellites that is able to account for satellite sensor updates. Specifically, we use the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) model driven with Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) information and Combined ASTER and MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) products. We discuss the results from our comparison of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite East (GOES-E) with the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (MOD11) products, as well as several independent sources of ground observations, for daytime and nighttime independently. Based on a six-year record at instantaneous time scale (2004&ndash;2009), most LST estimates are within one std from the mean observed value and the bias is under 1% of the mean. It was also shown that at several ground sites, the diurnal cycle of LST, as averaged over six years, is consistent with a similar record generated from satellite observations. Since the evaluation of the GOES-E LST estimates occurred at every hour, day and night, the data are well suited to address outstanding issues related to the temporal variability of LST, specifically, the diurnal cycle and the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, which are not well represented in LST retrievals form Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aEarth system science 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3aretrospective studies 3asatellites 3asurface temperature 3atemporal variation1 aMa, Yingtao 1 aChen, Wen 1 aHulley, Glynn 1 aBorbas, Eva 1 aIslam, Tanvir 1 aHain, Chris 1 aCawse-Nicholson, Kerry 1 aHook, Simon 1 aBasara, Jeff 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 June 12, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111213993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016300164500001900327520188900346592002802235650001802263650001902281650001802300650001602318650001502334650002102349650001602370650001202386650000902398650002402407650002502431650001902456650002502475650001302500650002202513650001702535650002402552650002302576650002202599650001502621650001902636651001002655653003102665653003002696653001902726653002102745653002402766700001502790700001502805700001502820700001502835700001702850700001702867773008702884856008502971852000903056655001203065IND60717682520221118023147.0210405e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071768252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2020.1050352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rui10aSoil prokaryotic community structure and co-occurrence patterns on the fragmented Chinese Loess Plateau: Effects of topographic units of a soil eroding catena  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil prokaryotes composition and diversity are the key to uncovering the mechanisms that drive variations in soil biogeochemical processes. Soil erosion is a primary factor that affects the spatial distribution of the soil prokaryotic community, but how soil prokaryotes in soil-eroding catena respond to environmental factors related to topography remains largely unclear. In this study, topsoils were sampled from three typical erosion geomorphic units (autonomous, transitional and depositional zones) in 2018 to identify the soil prokaryotic community and interactions among the species on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The alpha-diversity was greater but the beta-diversity was lower in the autonomous and transitional zones than in the depositional zone. Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were 73% and 68% lower in the autonomous and transitional zones than in the depositional zone. In addition, Deltaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae were significantly higher in the autonomous and transitional zones. A less clustered network and fewer co-occurrences within the prokaryotic community and functional groups of processes were found in the depositional zone than in the autonomous and transitional zones. The alpha-diversity index was significantly negatively correlated with clay particles, soil water content, soil organic carbon (SOC), and ratio of SOC and nitrogen (C/N) but positively correlated with total nitrogen (TN). The higher relative abundances of copiotrophic groups (including Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, etc.) in the depositional zone was mainly due to the increased SOC caused by the deposition of SOC-rich clay.

In particular, bitter is sensed by receptors encoded by the family of TAS2R genes. In this research, using a DNA pool‐seq approach coupled with next generation semiconductor based target resequencing, we analysed nine porcine TAS2R genes (TAS2R1, TAS2R3, TAS2R4, TAS2R7, TAS2R9, TAS2R10, TAS2R16, TAS2R38 and TAS2R39) to identify variability and, at the same time, estimate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele frequencies in several populations and testing differences in an association analysis. Equimolar DNA pools were prepared for five pig breeds (Italian Duroc, Italian Landrace, Pietrain, Meishan and Casertana) and wild boars (5–10 individuals each) and for two groups of Italian Large White pigs with extreme and divergent back fat thickness (50 + 50 pigs). About 1.8 million reads were obtained by sequencing amplicons generated from these pools. A total of 125 SNPs were identified, of which 37 were missense mutations. Three of them (p.Ile53Phe and p.Trp85Leu in TAS2R4; p.Leu37Ser in TAS2R39) could have important effects on the function of these bitter taste receptors, based on in silico predictions. Variability in wild boars seems lower than that in domestic breeds potentially as a result of selective pressure in the wild towards defensive bitter taste perception. Three SNPs in TAS2R38 and TAS2R39 were significantly associated with back fat thickness. These results may be important to understand the complexity of taste perception and their associated effects that could be useful to develop nutrigenetic approaches in pig breeding and nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3aMeishan 3aPietrain 3abackfat 3afat thickness 3afeed intake 3agene frequency 3agenes 3alandraces 3amissense mutation 3aprediction 3asemiconductors 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aswine 3ataste 3ataste receptors 3awild boars1 aBertolini, F.1 aSchiavo, G.1 aScotti, E.1 aUtzeri, V.

Recently, heat stress is considered one of the major constraints affecting crop growth and yield at world level. Heat stress reduced the plant growth, photosynthesis, mineral nutrients, and yield attributes. Heat stress caused both ultrastructural alterations and oxidative stress in different parts of plants. Plants can tolerate certain levels of heat stress by maintaining membrane stability, adjusting antioxidants and compatible solutes, and scavenging reactive oxygen species. Heat tolerance in plants can be improved by selecting heat-tolerant cultivars, genetic engineering, and exogenous application of osmolytes, microbes, mineral nutrients, soil amendments, and proper agricultural practices. This review is devoted to discuss the plants’ physiological and biochemical responses to heat stress and various integrated approaches to improve heat stress tolerance in plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a5634/Punjab/NRPU/R&D/HEC/2016cHigher Education Commission, Pakistan 3acultivars 3afinancial economics 3agenetic engineering 3aglobal warming 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3amicroorganisms 3anutrients 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3areactive oxygen species 3asoil amendments 3asolutes 3astress tolerance1 aRizwan, Muhammad1 aArif, Muhammad Saleem1 aAhmad, Rehan1 aHasanuzzaman, Mirza1 aBaṣārat Alī, Es.,1 aHussain, Afzal0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2020 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.456-480dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-019-09994-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03958naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245008100210300001600291506007600307520180700383536013502190592002802325596009202353506003702445650001902482650002502501650001802526650001102544650001402555650002402569650001702593650001602610650001002626650001002636650002502646650001702671650001402688650001902702650001002721650000902731650001402740650001302754650003302767650002202800650002402822650001302846650001202859653000802871653001902879653001202898653003002910700001502940700001602955700001602971700001202987700002002999700001603019700001703035773011403052856008503166852000903251655001203260IND60689938120221207141603.0200424e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068993812DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2018.15171842doi7 aPMC62371632pmcid7 a304155872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Jiayuan10aMa Huang Tang ameliorates bronchial asthma symptoms through the TLR9 pathway  ap. 580-593.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aContext: Ma Huang Tang (MHT) has been used to treat influenza, fever, bronchial asthma, etc. as a traditional Chinese medication. However, the anti-inflammation mechanism of MHT remains unclear. Objective: The study identifies the possible mechanisms of MHT on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced acute bronchial asthma in mice. Materials and methods: First, an asthma-related protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. And then, the acute bronchial asthma mice models were established by exposing to aerosolized 1% ovalbumin for 30 min/day for 1 week, and the mice were administered 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 g/kg of MHT daily. To evaluate therapeutic effect, sensitization time, abdominal breathing time, eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and tissue and trachea pathology were examined. Related genes were measured using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The expression levels of TLR9 in lung and trachea tissues were determined by immunohistochemical staining. Results: MHT had a LD₅₀ = 19.2 g/kg against asthma, while MHT at high doses (8 g/kg) effectively extended the sensitization time and abdominal breathing time and alleviated OVA-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation and mitigated pathological changes. The RNA-seq assay showed that the high-dose MHT resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of TLR9, TRAF6, TAB2, etc. in the lung tissue. Immunohistochemical assay confirmed the down-regulated of TLR9. Molecular docking revealed that six MHT compounds potentially mediated the TLR9 signaling pathway. Discussion and conclusions: MHT could mitigate the pathological changes of acute asthma-like syndrome through inhibition of the TLR9 pathway. Results of this study may provide a reference for the development of a novel therapy for patients with allergic asthma.  aThis work was supported by National Science and Technology Major Projects for New Drug Development [grant number: 2017ZX09305005].  aPublisher supplied data  a2017ZX09305005cNational Science and Technology Major Projects for New Drug Development0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEphedra sinica 3aToll-like receptor 9 3aanimal models 3aasthma 3abreathing 3acomputer simulation 3adrug therapy 3aeosinophils 3afever 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainfluenza 3alethal dose 50 3alungs 3amice 3aovalbumin 3apatients 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atissues 0aMHT 0abioinformatics 0atargets 0aimmunohistochemical assay1 aWu, Jiming1 aWang, Jiali1 aGuo, Yaping1 aGao, Le1 aLiang, Honggang1 aHuang, Jian1 aWang, Jinhui0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 56, no. 1 p.580-593dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2018.15171843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013400168300001600302520140900318592002801727650002401755650002101779650001501800650002301815650001901838650001801857650000901875650002001884650001801904653002301922653001301945653001801958653001801976700001801994700001702012700001402029700001602043773010702059856008502166852000902251655001202260IND60637970520221120103422.0190523e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063797052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Zhiyuan10aNew insight into the aggregation of graphene oxide in synthetic surface water: Carbonate nanoparticle formation on graphene oxide  ap. 366-374.  aGraphene oxide (GO), used in a wide variety of applications, is increasingly being introduced into aquatic environments; this situation calls for research on GO aggregation and sedimentation to regulate the environmental behaviors and risks. Many studies have investigated the aggregation and the mechanism of GO in water with a single background salt (monosalt system); however, this may not reflect real water environments where multiple salts coexist (multisalt system). A typical synthetic surface water (soft water) with representative multisalts was therefore used to study the aggregation and sedimentation of GO. The GO concentration-dependent aggregation (low concentration aggregation, high concentration stability) was observed in the soft water, and this concentration-dependent aggregation is opposite to the aggregation in monosalt systems (NaCl or CaCl2 solutions). The presence of GO sheets induced the formation of amorphous CaMg(CO3)2 nanoparticles on the GO surfaces in the soft water, and the formed nanoparticles promoted the aggregation and sedimentation of low concentrations of GO through bridging action. Neutral and alkaline conditions were favorable for the formation of CaMg(CO3)2 nanoparticles and the induced GO aggregation. These findings show a new mechanism of GO aggregation in environmentally relevant waters and help us to better evaluate the environmental fate of GO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3acalcium chloride 3acarbonates 3aenvironmental fate 3agraphene oxide 3ananoparticles 3arisk 3asodium chloride 3asurface water 0aColloidal behavior 0aGraphene 0aSurface water 0aSedimentation1 aWang, Yanlong1 aZhou, Qingbo1 aYang, Kun1 aLin, Daohui0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 July, v. 250 p.366-374dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017400165300001400339520185800353592002802211650001602239650002202255650002002277650002802297650001502325650003202340650002002372650002102392650001102413650001902424650001502443650001802458650001302476650002102489700002402510700001902534700002402553700002002577700002002597773010502617856008102722852000902803655001202812IND60085416720221122182131.0141101e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008541672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2011.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteban, Luis10aProduction of structured triacylglycerols rich in palmitic acid at sn-2 position and oleic acid at sn-1,3 positions as human milk fat substitutes by enzymatic acidolysis  ap. 62-69.  aThis paper studies the synthesis of structured triacylglycerols (STAGs) of type oleic acid–palmitic acid–oleic acid (OA–PA–OA or OPO) by acidolysis of PA enriched triacylglycerols (TAGs) (79.2% PA, 74.5% PA at sn-2 position) and several OA-rich free fatty acid (FFA) fractions. The PA located at sn-1,3 positions was replaced by OA, maintaining the PA at sn-2 position; for this purpose several sn-1,3 specific lipases (lipase DF from Rhizopus oryzae, Palatase 20000L from Mucor miehei, Lipozyme RM IM from Rhizomucor miehei, Lipozyme TL IM from Thermomyces lanuginosus and lipase QLC from Alcaligenes sp.) were tested in experiments carried out in presence of solvent at 37°C. Lipase DF immobilized on Accurel MP1000 was selected because this lipase gave a high incorporation of OA at the extreme positions of TAGs (50.4%) in short reaction times (1h) or IOT (intensity of treatment, lipase amount×reaction time/TAG amount) of only 0.4glipase×h/g TAG, maintaining a high content of PA at sn-2 position (68.6%). Using this lipase, the influence of FFA/TAG molar ratio and purity of OA-rich FFAs were studied. With a 6:1 FFA/TAG molar ratio and 90% OA it was possible to obtain STAGs with 67.2% OA at sn-1,3 positions and 67.8% PA at sn-2 position (57.2% of total PA was located at sn-2 position). Next, the synthesis of OPO STAGs was studied in solvent-free media at 50°C. The best results were also attained with a 6:1 FFA/TAG molar ratio, 90% OA and using an IOT of 1.9glipase×h/g TAG. In these conditions it was possible to obtain STAGs with identical composition to the previously obtained with solvent. These STAGs were purified by two procedures which differed in that solvent was or was not used to separate STAGs and FFAs. Both with and without hexane, STAGs were obtained with approximately 99% purity and over 96% recovery yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes 3aRhizomucor miehei 3aRhizopus oryzae 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3aacidolysis 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3afat substitutes 3afree fatty acids 3ahexane 3ahuman milk fat 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3asolvents 3atriacylglycerols1 aJiménez, María J.1 aHita, Estrella1 aGonzález, Pedro A.1 aMartin, Lorena,1 aRobles, Alfonso0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 54, no. 1 p.62-69dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2011.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245002700169300001800196520088200214592002801096650001801124650002001142650002001162650002401182650001801206650002001224650001801244650001501262650002301277650001101300650002301311650001301334650001201347650001101359700001801370773010601388856004801494852000901542655001201551IND4469270420221118173749.0120815e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446927042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-011-0198-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, E.

In marine habitats, Dothideomycetes dominate on mangrove substrata, and halosphaeriaceous species are most numerous on submerged woody substrata in coastal waters, while yeasts are common in seawater and estuarine habitats. In freshwater, Ingoldian anamorphic fungi are most numerous on decaying leaves, while ascomycetes (Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes) are prevalent on submerged/exposed woody substrata. Unique fungi are found in tropical waters and differ from those in temperate locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBasidiomycota 3aDothideomycetes 3aSordariomycetes 3aaquatic communities 3aaquatic fungi 3aaquatic habitat 3acoastal water 3afreshwater 3afungal communities 3aleaves 3amarine environment 3aseawater 3atropics 3ayeasts1 aPang, Ka-lai,0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2012 Aug., v. 21, no. 9 p.2403-2423dSpringer-Verlagx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-011-0198-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245017400168300001200342520101500354592002801369650002901397650002601426650001301452650001401465650002101479650001601500650002101516650002101537650001901558651001201577700002401589773015001613856008201763852000901845655001201854IND60572539220221122055845.0180619e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057253922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-017-5927-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhazaei, Esmaeil10aApplicability of geochemical techniques and artificial sweeteners in discriminating the anthropogenic sources of chloride in shallow groundwater north of Toronto, Canada  ap. 218.  aElevated levels of chloride concentration due to anthropogenic activities including the road salts, septic effluent and agricultural sources are common in shallow groundwater of the recent glacial deposits north of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Identifying suitable techniques for discriminating the source of the chloride concentration helps to better plan the protection of groundwater in the area. This paper examines the applicability of geochemical techniques with emphasis on Panno et al. (Ground Water 44: 176–187, 2006) and Mullaney et al. (2009) graphical approaches for discriminating the sources of chloride with known causes of impacts. The results indicated that the graphical methods developed using Cl⁻, Br⁻ and/or total nitrogen (N) could identify the combined sources of road salts and septic systems. However, discriminating between the road salts, septic effluent or agricultural sources needs to be complemented by other techniques including the artificial sweeteners and isotope tracers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aartificial sweeteners 3abromides 3achlorides 3aglacial deposits 3agroundwater 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen content 3aseptic systems 3aOntario1 aMilne-Home, William0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 May, v. 189, no. 5 p.218-218dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-5927-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245012100212500002900333506007600362520084500438592002801283506003701311650001101348650001501359650001201374650001201386653001501398653002401413700001601437700001901453773009401472856008501566852000901651655001201660IND60690749020221207064603.0200508e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069074902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e004492doi7 aPMC57276112pmcid7 a292644092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzimek, Phillip10aMaterialists on Facebook: the self-regulatory role of social comparisons and the objectification of Facebook friends  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, we examine chronic materialism as a possible motive for Facebook usage. We test an explanatory mediation model predicting that materialists use Facebook more frequently, because they compare themselves to others, they objectify and instrumentalize others, and they accumulate friends. For this, we conducted two online surveys (N₁ = 242, N₂ = 289) assessing demographic variables, Facebook use, social comparison, materialism, objectification and instrumentalization. Results confirm the predicted mediation model. Our findings suggest that Facebook can be used as a means to an end in a way of self-regulatory processes, like satisfying of materialistic goals. The findings are the first evidence for our Social Online Self-regulation Theory (SOS-T), which contains numerous predictions that can be tested in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amodels 3aprediction 3asurveys 3atesting 0aPsychology 0aInformation science1 aBaer, Fiona1 aFörster, Jens0 tHeliyon.g2017 Nov., v. 3, no. 11 p.e00449-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e004493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245014700170300001800317520165700335592002801992650001502020650001202035650001402047650001402061650001202075650001602087650001702103650001702120650001402137650002002151650002802171650001702199650001002216650001602226650001802242650002302260650001302283650001902296650001702315650001502332650002402347650001402371650000902385650001102394650001402405700002202419700003302441700002602474700002202500700002102522700002102543773010302564856008502667852000902752655001202761IND60583288720221118093720.0171010e20171010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058328872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.7b006442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErmakov, Yuri A.10aHigh-Affinity Interactions of Beryllium(2+) with Phosphatidylserine Result in a Cross-Linking Effect Reducing Surface Recognition of the Lipid  ap. 5457-5470.  aBeryllium has multiple industrial applications, but its manufacture is associated with a serious occupational risk of developing chronic inflammation in the lungs known as berylliosis, or chronic beryllium disease. Although the Be²⁺-induced abnormal immune responses have recently been linked to a specific MHC-II allele, the nature of long-lasting granulomas is not fully understood. Here we show that Be²⁺ binds with a micromolar affinity to phosphatidylserine (PS), the major surface marker of apoptotic cells. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that, like that of Ca²⁺, binding of Be²⁺ to PS liposomes is largely entropically driven, likely by massive desolvation. Be²⁺ exerts a compacting effect on PS monolayers, suggesting cross-linking through coordination by both phosphates and carboxyls in multiple configurations, which were visualized in molecular dynamics simulations. Electrostatic modification of PS membranes by Be²⁺ includes complete neutralization of surface charges at ∼30 μM, accompanied by an increase in the boundary dipole potential. The data suggest that Be²⁺ can displace Ca²⁺ from the surface of PS, and being coordinated in a tight shell of four oxygens, it can mask headgroups from Ca²⁺-mediated recognition by PS receptors. Indeed, 48 μM Be²⁺ added to IC-21 cultured macrophages specifically suppresses binding and engulfment of PS-coated silica beads or aged erythrocytes. We propose that Be²⁺ adsorption at the surface of apoptotic cells may potentially prevent normal phagocytosis, thus causing accumulation of secondary necrotic foci and the resulting chronic inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalleles 3aapoptosis 3aberyllium 3acalcium 3acalorimetry 3acrosslinking 3aerythrocytes 3agranuloma 3aimmune response 3aindustrial applications 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amanufacturing 3amolecular dynamics 3anecrosis 3aneutralization 3aphagocytosis 3aphosphates 3aphosphatidylserines 3areceptors 3arisk 3asilica 3atitration1 aKamaraju, Kishore1 aDunina-Barkovskaya, Antonina1 aVishnyakova, Khava S.1 aYegorov, Yegor E.1 aAnishkin, Andriy1 aSukharev, Sergei0 tBiochemistry.g2017 Oct. 10, v. 56, no. 40 p.5457-5470dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.7b006443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245009200175300001600267500001500283520081100298592002801109650002501137650001901162650001201181650005801193650002301251650002801274650002501302650001301327650002101340650000901361650005101370650000901421650001701430653002301447653002801470653001401498653002801512653000901540653003201549700001301581700001801594700001401612773010601626852000901732856007601741655001201817IND4374393220221119052432.0181004e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437439322DNAL7 a158723902pmid7 a10.1354/vp.42-3-3822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshioka, K.10aCell Proliferation Activity of Proliferating Bile Duct after Bile Duct Ligation in Rats  ap. 382-385.  a2019-12-04  aThe cell proliferation activity of proliferating bile ducts produced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in rats was examined histologically, immunohistochemically, and ultrastructurally. Proliferating bile ducts, which were similar to normal bile ducts, increased with time after BDL. The cell proliferation activity of proliferating bile ducts, measured using proliferating-cell nuclear antigen and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine antibodies, tended to be high at 1 and 3 days after BDL and decreased progressively at 2 to 4 weeks after BDL. On the other hand, α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblast-like cells increased continuously after BDL.

Current SAR ship detection methods based on deep learning (DL) are difficult to deploy on satellites, because these methods usually have complex models and huge calculations. To solve this problem, based on the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) algorithm, we propose a lightweight on-board SAR ship detector called Lite-YOLOv5, which (1) reduces the model volume; (2) decreases the floating-point operations (FLOPs); and (3) realizes the on-board ship detection without sacrificing accuracy. First, in order to obtain a lightweight network, we design a lightweight cross stage partial (L-CSP) module to reduce the amount of calculation and we apply network pruning for a more compact detector. Then, in order to ensure the excellent detection performance, we integrate a histogram-based pure backgrounds classification (HPBC) module, a shape distance clustering (SDC) module, a channel and spatial attention (CSA) module, and a hybrid spatial pyramid pooling (H-SPP) module to improve detection performance. To evaluate the on-board SAR ship detection ability of Lite-YOLOv5, we also transplant it to the embedded platform NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Experimental results on the Large-Scale SAR Ship Detection Dataset-v1.0 (LS-SSDD-v1.0) show that Lite-YOLOv5 can realize lightweight architecture with a 2.38 M model volume (14.18% of model size of YOLOv5), on-board ship detection with a low computation cost (26.59% of FLOPs of YOLOv5), and superior detection accuracy (1.51% F1 improvement compared with YOLOv5).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aweather1 aZhang, Xiaoling 1 aZhang, Tianwen 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Feb. 20, v. 14, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140410183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245018700167300001600354500001500370520127500385592002801660650001501688650002101703650001901724650001401743650002201757650002701779650001501806650001701821653001701838700002001855700002001875700001701895700001801912700001901930700001801949700001901967700001901986700001802005700001802023700001802041700001902059700002002078700001702098700002102115700001902136700001902155700001502174773012702189856008202316852000902398655001202407IND60089500920221116150628.0141102e20120106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008950092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, Seon Rang10aCells with dysfunctional telomeres are susceptible to reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide via generation of multichromosomal fusions and chromosomal fragments bearing telomeres  ap. 204-210.  a2019-12-06  aDuring genotoxic stress, reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a prime mediator of the DNA damage response. Telomeres function both to assist in DNA damage repair and to inhibit chromosomal end-to-end fusion. Here, we show that telomere dysfunction renders cells susceptible to H₂O₂, via generation of multichromosomal fusion and chromosomal fragments. H₂O₂ caused formation of multichromosomal end-to-end fusions involving more than three chromosomes, preferentially when telomeres were erosive. Interestingly, extensive chromosomal fragmentation (yielding small-sized fragments) occurred only in cells exhibiting such multichromosomal fusions. Telomeres were absent from fusion points, being rather present in the small fragments, indicating that H₂O₂ cleaves chromosomal regions adjacent to telomeres. Restoration of telomere function or addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevented development of chromosomal aberrations and rescued the observed hypersensitivity to H₂O₂. Thus, chromosomal regions adjacent to telomeres become sensitive to reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide when telomeres are dysfunctional, and are cleaved to produce multichromosomal fusions and small chromosomal fragments bearing the telomeres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3ahypersensitivity 3aacetylcysteine 3atelomeres 3ahydrogen peroxide 3achromosome aberrations 3aDNA repair 3agenotoxicity 0aantioxidants1 aPark, Jeong-Eun1 aJuhn, Kyoung-Mi1 aJu, Yeun-Jin1 aJeong, Jaemin1 aKang, Chang-Mo1 aYun, Hyun Jin1 aYun, Mi-yŏng,1 aShin, Hyun-Jin1 aJoo, Hyun-Yoo1 aPark, Eun-Ran1 aPark, In-Chul1 aHong, Sung Hee1 aHwang, Sang-gu,1 aKim, Haekwon1 aCho, Myung-Haing1 aKim, Sang Hoon1 aPark, Gil Hong1 aYi, Ki-ho,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 6, v. 417, no. 1 p.204-210dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245014500210500001900355506007600374520178900450592002802239506003702267650001102304650001702315650002702332650002202359650001802381650001702399650001502416650001402431650002302445650001802468651001002486653002602496653001402522700002302536700003202559700002202591700002302613773009302636856008502729852000902814655001202823IND60690749120221207064600.0200508e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069074912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e004942doi7 aPMC57519942pmcid7 a293221092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMali, Matilda10aInfluence of hydrodynamic features in the transport and fate of hazard contaminants within touristic ports. Case study: Torre a Mare (Italy)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe environmental quality of Torre a Mare port (Italy) was assessed evaluating on one side, the chemical concentration of nine metals and metalloids within bottom sediments and on the other one, by exploring the impact of hydrodynamic conditions in contaminant’s transport within the most polluted basins. The investigated port was selected as case study because it resulted much more polluted than it was expected based on the touristic port activities and related stressors loading on it. In order to determine the origin and fate of contaminants in the port basin, 2D numerical simulations were carried out by MIKE21 software. The hydrodynamic module (HD) based on a rectangular grid was initially used to characterize the flow field into two domains that cover the inner and offshore harbor area. Then, advection–dispersion (AD) and water quality (WQ) modules were coupled in order to simulate the simultaneous processes of transport and dispersion of hypothetical pollutant sources. The dissolved/suspended sediment particulates (DSS) were selected as contaminant tracers. The comparative analysis between simulation responses and the real metal contaminant distribution showed high agreement, suggesting that contaminants mainly come from outside port and tend to accumulate in the inner basin. In fact, hydrodynamic circulations cause inflowing streams toward the harbor entrance and the particular port morphology hampers the exit of fine sediments from the inner basin, enhancing thus the accumulation of sediment-associated contaminants within the port area. The study confirms that the quality of touristic port areas strongly depends on both pollution sources located within and outside the port domain and it is controlled mainly by the hydrodynamic-driven processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasins 3acase studies 3achemical concentration 3acomputer software 3ahydrodynamics 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apollution 3asuspended sediment 3awater quality 3aItaly 0aEnvironmental science 0aHydrology1 aMalcangio, Daniela1 aDell’ Anna, Maria Michela1 aDamiani, Leonardo1 aMastrorilli, Piero0 tHeliyon.g2018 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.e00494-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e004943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011800168300001300286520076800299592002801067650003401095650002101129650002101150650001101171650001101182650001401193650001301207650002301220650001201243653000801255653000901263653000901272653000701281653000801288653001201296653000801308653000901316653000901325653000801334653000801342653000801350653000801358653001101366653001001377653000701387653000901394653000801403653001201411653000801423653001001431653000701441653000801448653000801456653000901464653000801473653001001481653000901491653000901500653001001509653000801519653000901527653001901536653003301555653002001588700002201608700003101630773008601661856008301747852000901830655001201839IND60697549720221121015619.0200605e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069754972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrouard, Julie10aIn vitro models for deciphering the mechanisms underlying the sexual transmission of viruses at the mucosal level  ap. 1-10.  aSexually transmitted viruses infect the genital and colorectal mucosa of the partner exposed to contaminated genital secretions through a wide range of mechanisms, dictated in part by the organization of the mucosa.

Although the systematic identification and characterization of lncRNAs have been increasingly reported in model species, information concerning non-model species is still lacking. Here, we report the first systematic identification and characterization of lncRNAs in two sea cucumber species: (1) Apostichopus japonicus during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and in heathy tissues and (2) Holothuria glaberrima during radial organ complex regeneration, using RNA-seq datasets and bioinformatics analysis. We identified A. japonicus and H. glaberrima lncRNAs that were differentially expressed during LPS challenge and radial organ complex regeneration, respectively. Notably, the predicted lncRNA-microRNA-gene trinities revealed that, in addition to targeting protein-coding transcripts, miRNAs might also target lncRNAs, thereby participating in a potential novel layer of regulatory interactions among non-coding RNA classes in echinoderms. Furthermore, the constructed coding-non-coding network implied the potential involvement of lncRNA-gene interactions during the regulation of several important genes (e.g., Toll-like receptor 1 [TLR1] and transglutaminase-1 [TGM1]) in response to LPS challenge and radial organ complex regeneration in sea cucumbers. Overall, this pioneer systematic identification, annotation, and characterization of lncRNAs in echinoderm pave the way for similar studies and future genetic, genomic, and evolutionary research in non-model species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aHolothuria 3aToll-like receptor 1 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alipopolysaccharides 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aprediction 3asequence analysis 3atranslation (genetics)1 aWang, Ruijia1 aLi, Tianqi1 aLi, Yuqiang1 aTian, Meilin1 aJiao, Wenqian1 aHuang, Xiaoting1 aZhang, Lingling1 aHu, Xiaoli1 aWang, Shi1 aBao, Zhenmin0 tMarine biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.485-499dSpringer USx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-016-9711-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010600178300001600284520112800300592002801428650002001456650001001476650001401486650000901500650001301509650001201522650002801534650001501562650001001577650000901587650001301596650001301609650001301622650001301635651001501648653001201663653000901675653001201684653002001696653000901716653001201725700002401737773008901761856008401850852000901934655001201943IND60546028820221118213720.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054602882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2014.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEagles-Smith, Collin A.10aMercury bioaccumulation in estuarine wetland fishes: Evaluating habitats and risk to coastal wildlife  ap. 147-155.  aEstuaries are globally important areas for methylmercury bioaccumulation because of high methylmercury production rates and use by fish and wildlife. We measured total mercury (THg) concentrations in ten fish species from 32 wetland and open bay sites in San Francisco Bay Estuary (2005–2008). Fish THg concentrations (μg/g dry weight ± standard error) differed by up to 7.4× among estuary habitats. Concentrations were lowest in open bay (0.17 ± 0.02) and tidal wetlands (0.42 ± 0.02), and highest in managed seasonal saline wetlands (1.27 ± 0.05) and decommissioned high salinity salt ponds (1.14 ± 0.07). Mercury also differed among fishes, with Mississippi silversides (0.87 ± 0.03) having the highest and longjaw mudsuckers (0.37 ± 0.01) the lowest concentrations. Overall, 26% and 12% of fish exceeded toxicity benchmarks for fish (0.20 μg/g wet weight) and piscivorous bird (0.30 μg/g wet weight) health, respectively. Our results suggest that despite managed wetlands' limited abundance within estuaries, they may be disproportionately important habitats of Hg risk to coastal wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3abirds 3aestuaries 3afish 3ahabitats 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3apiscivores 3aponds 3arisk 3asalinity 3atoxicity 3awetlands 3awildlife 3aCalifornia 0aMercury 0aFish 0aWetland 0aBioaccumulation 0aBird 0aEstuary1 aAckerman, Joshua T.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 Oct., v. 193 p.147-155dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016400165300001600329520115000345592002801495596009701523596006201620596009001682596005901772596007901831650002201910650001501932650001101947650001001958650001601968650002601984650003702010650002002047650002402067650002202091650001702113650001802130650001102148650001302159650001402172650001502186650003302201650002602234650001302260650003702273700001302310700001602323700001602339700001902355700001502374700001302389700001502402700001802417773014502435856008102580852000902661655001202670IND60626819920221119030826.0181230e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062681992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1423-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongying10aHollow and porous nickel sulfide nanocubes prepared from a metal-organic framework as an efficient enzyme mimic for colorimetric detection of hydrogen peroxide  ap. 129-137.  aHollow, porous NiS nanocubes were prepared by a hydrothermal method starting from Ni–Co Prussian blue analogue nanocubes as the template. The morphology and structure of the NiS nanocubes were tuned by adjustment of the ion-exchange rate and the degree of chemical etching, and they were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen sorption measurements. The NiS nanocubes are shown to act as a peroxidase mimic that can catalyze the oxidization of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine by hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), producing a visible color change, for which the absorbance is best measured at 652 nm. The outstanding activity may result from the unique structure of the NiS nanocubes. The catalytic oxidation follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics and shows a ping-pong mechanism of enzyme action. The findings were used to develop a rapid, sensitive, and selective colorimetric H₂O₂ assay with a response that is linear in the 4–40 μM range with a detection limit of 1.72 μM (signal-to-noise ratio of 3).

We studied the conformational dynamics of PD-L1 through principal component analysis of existing crystal structures combined with classical and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. We identified the maximum structural displacements that take place in all PD-L1 crystal structures and in the molecular dynamics trajectories. We found that these displacements are attributed to specific flexible regions in the protein. We also investigated the conformational preference for small molecule binding and highlighted a methionine residue at the binding site, which plays a key role in drug binding. The binding mechanism of PD-L1 to other binding partners is also discussed in detail from a computational perspective. We hope that the data presented here support the ongoing efforts to discover effective therapies targeting the PD-1 immune-checkpoint pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3aligands 3amethionine 3amolecular conformation 3amolecular dynamics 3aprincipal component analysis1 aBarakat, Khaled0 tBiochemistry.g2017 Oct. 10, v. 56, no. 40 p.5428-5439dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.7b006553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05172naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001400192245019900206300001600405506007600421520170500497536054102202592002802743596016802771596012202939596008403061596008803145506003703233650001703270650003403287650002503321650001903346650002503365650002403390650002003414650001703434650001603451650001603467650002003483650001203503650001103515650004303526650002303569650001903592650002003611650000903631650001903640650000903659650001703668650001703685650002003702653004003722653001903762653002103781653002303802653002503825653004303850653001203893700001703905700001403922700001603936700001503952700001803967700001803985700001604003700001904019700001704038700001704055700001604072700001704088700001704105773011404122856008504236852000904321655001204330IND60689938320221207141421.0200424e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068993832DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2018.15239332doi7 aPMC62824632pmcid7 a310705262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiu10aEthanol extract of Schisandrae chinensis fructus ameliorates the extent of experimentally induced atherosclerosis in rats by increasing antioxidant capacity and improving endothelial dysfunction  ap. 612-619.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aContext: Schisandrae chinensis fructus, the dried ripe fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. (Magnoliaceae) has been used for thousands of years as a traditional Chinese herb, which can attenuate and prevent the development of cardiovascular events. Objective: To evaluate the effects of the ethanol extracts from Schisandrae chinensis fructus fruit (EESC) on experimental atherosclerosis (AS) in rats. Materials and methods: Treatment with EESC (0.35, 0.7, 1.4 g/kg/d, i.g.) and simvastatin (4 mg/kg/d, i.g.) on AS rats for 3 weeks. Sprague–Dawley rats on normal chow and under water treatment were used as control. The content of schisandrin, schisandrin A and schisandrin B in EESC was detected by HPLC. Aortic pathology changes, serum biochemical indices and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and heame oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expressions were measured. Results: Schisandrin, schisandrin A and schisandrin B contents were 291.8, 81.46 and 279.1 mg/g of dry weight, respectively. EESC significantly reduced the aortic plaque area (76.5, 90.5 and 73.9% reduction), regulated the levels of serum lipid (p < 0.05), enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities (p < 0.01), reduced the malondialdehyde levels (72.5, 69.3, 67.3%), and up-regulated the Nrf-2 and HO-1 expression (p < 0.05). Furthermore, EESC reduced the levels of oxidized-LDL and endothelin-1 and thromboxane B2 but increased that of 6-keto prostaglandin F1α (p < 0.05). Acute toxicity was calculated on mice to be LD₅₀ > 20 g/kg. Conclusions: EESC positively affects the treatment of AS in vivo and the findings will provide a reliable theoretical basis for developing novel therapeutics.  aThis work was supported by the Sichuan Province Academic and Technical Leaders Cultivate Support Funds, the Science and Technology Program for Public Wellbeing of Chengdu [grant number 2014-HM01-00107-SF]; the Key Project of Research and Development Plan of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province [grant number 2018SZ0078]; the Research funds of Chengdu science and technology office [grant number 2015-HM01-00347-SF], and the Research funds of Sichuan traditional Chinese medicine administration [grant number 2016Q040].  aPublisher supplied data  a2014-HM01-00107-SFcthe Sichuan Province Academic and Technical Leaders Cultivate Support Funds, the Science and Technology Program for Public Wellbeing of Chengdu  a2018SZ0078cthe Key Project of Research and Development Plan of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province  a2015-HM01-00347-SFcthe Research funds of Chengdu science and technology office  a2016Q040cthe Research funds of Sichuan traditional Chinese medicine administration0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMagnoliaceae 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSchisandra chinensis 3aacute toxicity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3aendothelins 3aenzyme activity 3aethanol 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alaboratory animals 3alethal dose 50 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3aprostaglandins 3arats 3atherapeutics 3athromboxanes 3awater treatment 0aHaematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining 0alipid lowering 0aoxidative stress 0aendothelial injury 0aimmunohistochemistry 0ahigh-performance liquid chromatography 0astatins1 aCao, Jiahong1 aSun, Yong1 aDai, Yaolan1 aZhu, Jiali1 aZhang, Xuemei1 aZhao, Xiaoqin1 aWang, Liwen1 aZhao, Tingting1 aLi, Yongbiao1 aLiu, Youping1 aWei, Guihua1 aZhang, Tiane1 aYan, Zhiyong0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 56, no. 1 p.612-619dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2018.15239333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015800167520203400325592002802359650002102387650004402408650001202452650001202464650002302476650001102499650002502510650001102535650002902546650001102575650001202586650000702598650001102605650001402616650002002630650001502650651001302665653001002678653001202688653001402700653001202714653001902726653002302745653001702768700002002785700002402805700002102829700002502850700001702875700002002892700002402912700002702936773011802963856008203081852000903163655001203172IND60717448220221117000325.0211129e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071744822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2020.1012282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashir, Farzana10aEfficient utilization of low cost agro materials for incorporation of copper nanoparticles to scrutinize their antibacterial properties in drinking water  aWater, a blessing for human beings and guarantees the existence of all species present on this planet. However, its scarcity and pollution disrupts the health security of millions of people every year. Consequently, it needs utmost attention and precautions to make it clean, clear and hygienic. Similarly, under the current energy and economic scenario, it is also difficult to find new ways to efficiently use the significant amount of biomass produced annually. Therefore, in this study, a chemical reduction method was used for preparation of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). Synthesized nanoparticles were successfully incorporated onto bagasse and rice husk and employed for removal of bacteria (E. coli) from synthetic water. The morphological characteristics and size distribution of CuNPs were examined through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify the presence of functional groups of substrate materials before and after incorporation of CuNPs. Whereas, concentration of copper in prepared materials was determined through Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Various factors were investigated to maximize bacteria removal, including material dose, contact time and pH. The results showed that the optimal conditions for removing bacteria from water were a material dose of 2.0 g, a contact time of 100–120 min, and a pH range of 5–9. Bacterial removal efficiency of CuNPs incorporated rice husk was measured 100%, higher than 95% achieved by using CuNPs incorporated bagasse. The quality of treated water was evaluated for copper contents and was found to be within the permissible limit set by Pakistan Standard and Quality Control Authority. Derived materials were quite efficient and stable and no significant difference in antibacterial properties was observed over a period of 5 weeks. Consequently, the formation of such materials is considered environmentally friendly, economical and highly applicable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abagasse 3abiomass 3achemical reduction 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3aenergy 3aenvironmental technology 3ahumans 3ahygiene 3apH 3apeople 3apollution 3aquality control 3arice hulls 3aPakistan 0aCuNPs 0aBagasse 0aRice husk 0aE. coli 0aDrinking water 0aProcess parameters 0aOptimization1 aIrfan, Muhammad1 aAḥmad, Tauṣīf,1 aIqbāl, Jāvīd,1 aButt, Muhammad Tahir1 aSadef, Yumna1 aUmbreen, Misbah1 aShaikh, Irfan Ahmed1 aMoniruzzaman, Muhammad0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Feb., v. 21 p.101228-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2020.1012283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010500164300002000269520105100289592002801340650001101368650001301379650001301392650001701405650001901422650002101441650001701462650002001479650001601499650000801515650001401523650001301537650001301550650001101563653001601574653001201590653002601602653002301628700002301651700006501674700002801739700005901767773015001826856008101976852000902057655001202066IND60754956320220219000000.0211027e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075495632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c050642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanlı, Merve10aFormation of Bioactive Tyrosine Derivatives during Sprouting and Fermenting of Selected Whole Grains  ap. 12517-12526.  aSprouting is a popular method in cereal processing because sprouted grains are accepted to have high nutritional value. The increased proteolytic activity by sprouting increases the free amino acids in grains. It was hypothesized that an increased amount of tyrosine can be utilized by microorganisms during fermentation to form higher amounts of bioactive tyrosine derivatives. Sprouting increased the tyrosine and tyramine contents considerably, but increases and decreases in l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) and dopamine were specific to the cereal. More tyramine, l-DOPA, and dopamine formation was observed during sourdough fermentation than that in yeast fermentation. As a result of the combined application of sprouting (48 h at 20 °C) and sourdough fermentation (36 h at 30 °C), the amounts of dopamine, l-DOPA, and tyramine found in rye were 27, 50, and 136 mg/kg, respectively. Cereal products rich in dopamine and l-DOPA can thus be produced as functional food ingredients with their positive effects on human health and mood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-dopa 3adopamine 3aemotions 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3afunctional foods 3ahuman health 3anutritive value 3aproteolysis 3arye 3asourdough 3atyramine 3atyrosine 3ayeasts 0agermination 0amalting 0aneuroactive compounds 0ayeast fermentation1 aÇelik, Ecem Evrim1 aKocadağlı, Tolgahan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0549-84881 aKanmaz, Evrim Özkaynak1 aGökmen, Vural,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9601-53910 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 69, no. 42 p.12517-12526dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c050643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245012300212300001600335520096200351592002801313650001301341650002301354650002501377650002001402650002001422650001301442650001301455650001501468650001501483650001001498650001401508650002401522650001101546650001001557650001101567651001101578653002401589653002401613653001201637653002201649700002201671700002001693700002601713700002601739773010701765856008401872852000901956655001201965IND60606875320221122064324.0180730e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060687532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeichenthal, Scott1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9634-532310aCharacterizing the spatial distribution of ambient ultrafine particles in Toronto, Canada: A land use regression model  ap. 241-248.  aExposure models are needed to evaluate the chronic health effects of ambient ultrafine particles (<0.1 μm) (UFPs).

In total, 405 road segments were included in the analysis. The final model explained 67% of the spatial variation in mean UFPs and included terms for the logarithm of distances to highways, major roads, the central business district, Pearson airport, and bus routes as well as variables for the number of on-street trees, parks, open space, and the length of bus routes within a 100 m buffer. There was no systematic difference between measured and predicted values when the model was evaluated in an external dataset, although the R² value decreased (R² = 50%). This model will be used to evaluate the chronic health effects of UFPs using population-based cohorts in the Toronto area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairports 3abus transportation 3abusiness enterprises 3adata collection 3aexposure models 3ahighways 3aland use 3amonitoring 3aopen space 3aparks 3aparticles 3aregression analysis 3asummer 3atrees 3awinter 3aCanada 0aUltrafine particles 0aLand use regression 0aTraffic 0aBuilt environment1 aVan Ryswyk, Keith1 aGoldstein, Alon1 aShekarrizfard, Maryam1 aHatzopoulou, Marianne0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Jan., v. 208 p.241-248dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016800167300001600335520179600351592002802147650003102175650001902206650002202225650001502247650001702262650000902279650002002288650003102308650001502339650002002354650002202374650001802396650002002414650001302434650004002447700001802487700002002505773009102525856008102616852000902697655001202706IND60549124820221120055607.0160906e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054912482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10126-016-9713-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Songqian10aTranscriptomic Analysis of Compromise Between Air-Breathing and Nutrient Uptake of Posterior Intestine in Loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), an Air-Breathing Fish  ap. 521-533.  aDojo loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) is an air-breathing fish species by using its posterior intestine to breathe on water surface. So far, the molecular mechanism about accessory air-breathing in fish is seldom addressed. Five cDNA libraries were constructed here for loach posterior intestines form T01 (the initial stage group), T02 (mid-stage of normal group), T03 (end stage of normal group), T04 (mid-stage of air-breathing inhibited group), and T05 (the end stage of air-breathing inhibited group) and subjected to perform RNA-seq to compare their transcriptomic profilings. A total of 92,962 unigenes were assembled, while 37,905 (40.77 %) unigenes were successfully annotated. 2298, 1091, and 3275 differentially expressed genes (fn1, ACE, EGFR, Pxdn, SDF, HIF, VEGF, SLC2A1, SLC5A8 etc.) were observed in T04/T02, T05/T03, and T05/T04, respectively. Expression levels of many genes associated with air-breathing and nutrient uptake varied significantly between normal and intestinal air-breathing inhibited group. Intraepithelial capillaries in posterior intestines of loaches from T05 were broken, while red blood cells were enriched at the surface of intestinal epithelial lining with 241 ± 39 cells per millimeter. There were periodic acid-schiff (PAS)-positive epithelial mucous cells in posterior intestines from both normal and air-breathing inhibited groups. Results obtained here suggested an overlap of air-breathing and nutrient uptake function of posterior intestine in loach. Intestinal air-breathing inhibition in loach would influence the posterior intestine’s nutrient uptake ability and endothelial capillary structure stability. This study will contribute to our understanding on the molecular regulatory mechanisms of intestinal air-breathing in loach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMisgurnus anguillicaudatus 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3aepithelium 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aintestines 3anutrient uptake 3asequence analysis 3asurface water 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aCao, Xiaojuan1 aTian, Xianchang0 tMarine biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.521-533dSpringer USx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-016-9713-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245011900164300001600283520042500299592002800724650001400752650001200766650001000778650001600788651001100804700002300815700003100838700003000869700002500899700001500924773012200939856007801061852000901139655001201148IND60130454420221119034905.0151127e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013045442DNAL7 a10.3958/059.039.02122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPujade-Villar, J.10aFirst Record of Loxaulus Mayr from Mexico, with Descriptions of Two New Species (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae, Cynipini)  ap. 343-354.  aTwo new species of oak gallwasp, Loxaulus hyalinus Pujade-Villar & Melika n. sp. and L. laeta Pujade-Villar n. sp. are described from Mexico.

The first is the production of sustainable carbon-based absorbents: using a CE approach, our experiments re-valorize solid wastes generated in the vegetable tanning from leather industry to obtain activated carbons for environmental applications. The second benefit is related to biogas energy recovery, which plays a key role in achieving the targets of the European Renewable Directive, since biogas is a renewable fuel which presents additional environmental value reducing the release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.Sustainable activated carbons were obtained from biocollagenic industrial waste by chemical activation (KOH, NaOH, K2CO₃), with and without a previous pyrolysis step, at different activation temperature (750 °C and 900 °C) and different activating agent/precursor weight ratio. The microporous adsorbent materials obtained showed good chemical and textural properties, with BET specific surface area and total pore volume of up to 1600 m² g⁻¹ and 0.76 cm³ g⁻¹, respectively. These efficient and low cost activated carbons showed a siloxane adsorption capacity of up to 500 mg g⁻¹, higher than that of the commercial steam activated carbons supplied by adsorbent producers that reached values of up to 349 mg g⁻¹.The industrial biocollagenic waste if vegetal tanning successfully performed as precursor for sustainable low-cost activated carbons, and the materials obtained were proved to be efficient for gaseous pollutants abatement applications. Thus, this work resulted in an efficient valorization method that assists the reduction of coal extraction by obtaining eco-friendly activated carbons that can be beneficially used for biogas upgrading in waste-to-energy applications in a circular economy scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiogas 3acircular economy 3acoal 3aecological value 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aenvironmental technology 3agreenhouses 3aindustrial wastes 3aleather industry 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3asteam 3asurface area 3atemperature 3avegetables 0aVegetable-tanned leather waste 0aAlkaline chemical activation 0aSustainable activated carbons 0aSiloxanes adsorption 0aBiogas upgrading 0aValorization industrial wastes1 aRuiz, B.1 aGil, R.R.1 aPopartan, Lucia Alexandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2308-40621 aSantos-Clotas, Eric1 aMartín, Maria J.1 aFuente, E.0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Feb., v. 21 p.101229-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2020.1012293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001100149245009100160300001800251520093100269592002801200650002101228650002701249650002101276650001501297650001201312650001601324700002601340700002001366700002801386700001901414700002301433700001901456700002201475773010301497856008501600852000901685655001201694IND60583288920221118092630.0171010e20171010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058328892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.7b006572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Le10aPeriplasmic Binding Protein Dimer Has a Second Allosteric Event Tied to Ligand Binding  ap. 5328-5337.  aThe ligand-induced conformational changes of periplasmic binding proteins (PBP) play a key role in the acquisition of metabolites in ATP binding cassette (ABC) transport systems. This conformational change allows for differential recognition of the ligand occupancy of the PBP by the ABC transporter. This minimizes futile ATP hydrolysis in the transporter, a phenomenon in which ATP hydrolysis is not coupled to metabolite transport. In many systems, the PBP conformational change is insufficient at eliminating futile ATP hydrolysis. Here we identify an additional state of the PBP that is also allosterically regulated by the ligand. Ligand binding to the homodimeric apo PBP leads to a tightening of the interface α-helices so that the hydrogen bonding pattern shifts to that of a 3₁₀ helix, in-turn altering the contacts and the dynamics of the protein interface so that the monomer exists in the presence of ligand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysis 3aligands 3ametabolites1 aGhimire-Rijal, Sudipa1 aLucas, Sarah L.1 aStanley, Christopher B.1 aWright, Edward1 aAgarwal, Pratul K.1 aMyles, Dean A.1 aCuneo, Matthew J.0 tBiochemistry.g2017 Oct. 10, v. 56, no. 40 p.5328-5337dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.7b006573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006100171300001600232520161700248592002801865650001401893650001101907650002201918650001101940650001301951650001601964650001701980650000901997650001002006650001402016650001402030650001702044650002502061650001902086650001802105650001002123651001102133700002002144700002602164700002402190700002402214700002302238700002202261700002002283700002002303700001502323700002402338700002402362773012502386856008102511852000902592655001202601IND60549124920221120065346.0160906e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054912492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-016-0070-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrawczak, Felipe S.10aEcology of a tick-borne spotted fever in southern Brazil  ap. 219-229.  aRio Grande do Sul is the southernmost state of Brazil, bordering Uruguay. Clinical cases of spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiosis were recently reported in Rio Grande do Sul. None of these cases was lethal, and all were confirmed by seroconversion to R. rickettsii antigens. Because serological cross-reactions are well known to occur between different SFG agents, the SFG agent responsible for the clinical cases remains unknown in Rio Grande do Sul, where no rickettsial agent is known to infect ticks. During 2013–2014, ticks and blood sera samples were collected from domestic dogs and wild small mammals, and from the vegetation in a SFG-endemic area of Rio Grande do Sul. Dogs were infested by Amblyomma ovale adult ticks, whereas small mammals were infested by immature stages of A. ovale, Ixodes loricatus, and adults of I. loricatus. Ticks collected on vegetation were adults of A. ovale, and immature stages of A. ovale, Amblyomma dubitatum, and Amblyomma longirostre. Three Rickettsia species were detected: Rickettsia bellii in I. loricatus, Rickettsia amblyommii in A. longirostre, and a Rickettsia parkeri-like agent (Rickettsia sp. strain Atlantic rainforest) in A. ovale. Seroreactivity to SFG antigens were detected in 19.7 % (27/137) canine and 37.5 % (15/40) small mammal sera, with highest titers to R. parkeri. Results indicate that the R. parkeri-like agent, strain Atlantic rainforest, is circulating between A. ovale ticks, dogs and small mammals in the study area, suggesting that this SFG pathogen could be one of the etiological agents of SFG clinical cases in Rio Grande do Sul.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma 3aIxodes 3aRickettsia bellii 3aadults 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3adog diseases 3adogs 3afever 3aimmatures 3apathogens 3arain forests 3arickettsial diseases 3aseroconversion 3asmall mammals 3aticks 3aBrazil1 aBinder, Lina C.1 aOliveira, Caroline S.1 aCosta, Francisco B.1 aMoraes-Filho, Jonas1 aMartins, Thiago F.1 aSponchiado, Jonas1 aMelo, Geruza L.1 aGregori, Fábio1 aPolo, Gina1 aOliveira, Stefan V.1 aLabruna, Marcelo B.0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2016 Oct., v. 70, no. 2 p.219-229dSpringer International Publishingx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-016-0070-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04514naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003900132024001200171040001800183100002000201245010600221300001600327506017300343520212100516592002802637650001302665650002302678650002302701650002702724650002502751650001902776650001402795650001102809650001702820650001902837650002202856650001502878650002302893650002202916650002602938650001902964650002902983650001703012650002103029650001803050650001503068650002403083650002003107650002103127650003303148653001403181653003703195653002103232653001903253653003303272700002203305700002203327773012403349856008603473856011203559956013503671961001303806852000903819655001203828IND60006268120221214223518.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000626812DNAL7 a3266862aris7 a10113/626812hdl7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.06.0042doi8 ans10360  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Chih-Han10aSpecies-specific effects of earthworms on microbial communities and the fate of litter-derived carbon  ap. 129-139.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSoil respiration is frequently measured as a surrogate for biological activities and is important in soil carbon cycling. The heterotrophic component of soil respiration is primarily driven by microbial decomposition of leaf litter and soil organic matter, and is partially controlled by resource availability. In North American temperate deciduous forests, invasive European and Asian earthworms are known to variously affect soil properties and resource availability through their feeding, burrowing, and casting behaviors, and may affect different components of soil respiration through modulating the microbial communities. By tracing litter-derived C from 13C and 15N double-enriched leaf litter into soil and CO2 efflux in a mesocosm experiment, we tested the hypothesis that earthworms inhibit litter C-derived soil respiration by reducing resource availability and microbial biomass, and further examined how species-specific effects of earthworms on soil respiration are mediated by soil microbial community. We showed that while earthworms generally had no effect on total soil respiration, the interaction between Octolasion lacteum and Lumbricus rubellus had a significant negative non-additive effect, presumably through affecting anaerobic microsites in the soil. Moreover, litter C-derived soil respiration was reduced by the Asian Amynthas hilgendorfi, the European L. rubellus, and the North American native species Eisenoides lonnbergi, but not by the European species O. lacteum. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and structural equation modeling indicated that while soil bacteria and fungi abundances were affected by earthworm species identities, the observed reduction of litter C-derived soil respiration could not be fully explained by changes in microbial biomass. We attributed these effects to earthworm-induced aggregate formation, reduction of microbial transformation of labile carbon, and antimicrobial peptide activities, and concluded that the mechanisms through which the four earthworm species affect the fate of litter-derived C and its mineralization are species-specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmynthas 3aLumbricus rubellus 3aOctolasion lacteum 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abioactive properties 3abiodegradation 3aburrowing 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3adeciduous forests 3aearthworms 3aindigenous species 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplant litter 3asoil aggregation 3asoil bacteria 3asoil fungi 3asoil organic matter 3asoil properties 3asoil respiration 3astructural equation modeling 0aEarthworm 0aPhospholipid fatty acid analysis 0aSoil respiration 0aStable isotope 0aStructural equation modeling1 aSzlavecz, Katalin1 aBuyer, Jeffrey S.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2016 Sept., v. 100 p.129-139dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.06.0043Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/626813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/species-specific%20effects%20of%20earthworms%20SBB%202016.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245011900158300002000277520092500297592002801222650001101250650002101261650001301282650001201295650002201307650002301329650001401352650002301366650001801389650002501407700001801432700001501450700002001465700001801485700001201503700001601515773012901531856008201660852000901742655001201751IND60576426020221118050817.0170804e20170622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057642602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b034102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yan10aKCl-Modified Graphite as High Performance Anode Material for Lithium-Ion Batteries with Excellent Rate Performance  ap. 13052-13058.  aElectrochemical properties of a graphite negative electrode of lithium-ion batteries have been enhanced by treating raw graphite with alkali molten salt. Here, the KCl-modified graphite is fabricated via a simple and low-cost technique in which graphite particles and potassium chloride are simply mixed with deionized water and sintered. Compared to the raw material, the rate capability of the graphite modified by potassium is enhanced significantly to 269.7 mAh g–¹ at 1 C after 200 cycles which effectively solves the main problem to limit the application of the graphite anode for Li-ion batteries in the field of hybrid vehicles. First-principle calculations have been done to analyze the effect of K-ions on the lithium storage capacity of the graphite. This study provides a scientific basis for adopting the K-modified technique to enhance the electrochemical properties of the negative electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aphysical chemistry 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3araw materials 3avehicles (equipment)1 aWang, Liying,1 aLi, Yi-Fan1 aZhao, Zhen-Yang1 aYin, Long-Wei1 aLi, Hui1 aBai, Yu-Jun0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 June 22, v. 121, no. 24 p.13052-13058dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b034103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013900157300001800296520125500314592002801569650002101597650002301618650001101641650001701652650001301669650002201682650002201704650002801726650001301754700002401767700001601791700002201807700002001829700002101849773011801870856007501988852000902063655001202072IND60550325420171220000000.0160910e20140307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055032542DNAL7 a10.1021/jo402718e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Xiaoneng10aPerylene-Derived Triplet Acceptors with Optimized Excited State Energy Levels for Triplet–Triplet Annihilation Assisted Upconversion  ap. 2038-2048.  aA series of perylene derivatives are prepared as triplet energy acceptors for triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) assisted upconversion. The aim is to optimize the energy levels of the T₁ and S₁ states of the triplet acceptors, so that the prerequisite for TTA (2ET₁ > ES₁) can be better satisfied, and eventually to increase the upconversion efficiency. Tuning of the energy levels of the excited states of the triplet acceptors is realized either by attaching aryl groups to perylene (via single or triple carbon–carbon bonds), or by assembling a perylene-BODIPY dyad, in which the components present complementary S₁ and T₁ state energy levels. The S₁ state energy levels of the perylene derivatives are generally decreased compared to perylene. The anti-Stokes shift, TTA, and upconversion efficiencies of the new triplet acceptors are improved with respect to the perylene hallmark. For the perylene-BODIPY dyads, the fluorescence emission was substantially quenched in polar solvents. Moreover, we found that extension of the π-conjugation of BODIPY energy donor significantly reduces the energy level of the S₁ state. Low S₁ state energy level and high T₁ state energy level are beneficial for triplet photosensitizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3aphotosensitizing agents 3asolvents1 aCharaf-Eddin, Azzam1 aWang, Junsi1 aLe Guennic, Boris1 aZhao, Jianzhang1 aJacquemin, Denis0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2014 Mar. 07, v. 79, no. 5 p.2038-2048dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo402718e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245017900170520094900349592002801298650001501326650001201341650001601353650001501369650002101384650001101405650001301416650001301429650000701442650004001449650001801489650000901507650001401516650001801530650001601548651001001564653000801574653000801582653000801590653000901598653000801607653000801615653001901623653002601642653001901668653003301687653002201720700002401742700001501766700002101781700001601802700001901818773010601837856008801943852000902031655001202040IND60781827120221116201303.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078182712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1138932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanja, Atanu10aIdentification and determination of optimum growth condition with respect to selected environmental parameters for open sea cultivation of Gracillaria edulis in Andaman water  aGracilaria edulis is one of India's most widely cultivated seaweeds.

Plant genetic engineering by regulating heat shock proteins, RNA-binding proteins, and molecular chaperones is an efficient strategy for maintaining plant productivity under heat stress conditions. Plant performance and tolerance to heat stress are highly dependent on their balance, interactions, structural, and functional diversities. Thus, this review article is undertaken to discuss the effectiveness of these proteins in conferring tolerance to heat stress and to incentivize their coregulation to achieve better results in breeding programs in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aagricultural land 3abreeding programs 3afunctional diversity 3agenetic engineering 3aglobal warming 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aprotective effect 0achaperone 0aheat shock proteins 0aheat tolerance 0ahigh temperature 0aRNA-binding proteins1 aPessarakli, Mohammad0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2019 May 28, v. 42, no. 9 p.1114-1123dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2019.15895013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024002200115024001900137040001800156100001700174245007100191300001300262520195500275592002802230650002202258650001902280650003402299650001902333650002002352650002902372650002002401700001702421700001902438700001602457773014702473856006702620856010102687990002302788852000902811655001202820IND60644643220221118035006.0190517e20080728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064464322DNAL7 a10.3791/8132doi7 aPMC32536122pmcid7 a190665152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, Robert10aAc electrokinetic phenomena generated by microelectrode structures  ap. e813.  aThe field of AC electrokinetics is rapidly growing due to its ability to perform dynamic fluid and particle manipulation on the micro- and nano-scale, which is essential for Lab-on-a-Chip applications. AC electrokinetic phenomena use electric fields to generate forces that act on fluids or suspended particles (including those made of dielectric or biological material) and cause them to move in astonishing ways1, 2. Within a single channel, AC electrokinetics can accomplish many essential on-chip operations such as active micro-mixing, particle separation, particle positioning and micro-pattering. A single device may accomplish several of those operations by simply adjusting operating parameters such as frequency or amplitude of the applied voltage. Suitable electric fields can be readily created by micro-electrodes integrated into microchannels. It is clear from the tremendous growth in this field that AC electrokinetics will likely have a profound effect on healthcare diagnostics3-5, environmental monitoring6 and homeland security7. In general, there are three AC Electrokinetic phenomena (AC electroosmosis, dielectrophoresis and AC electrothermal effect) each with unique dependencies on the operating parameters. A change in these operating parameters can cause one phenomena to become dominant over another, thus changing the particle or fluid behavior. It is difficult to predict the behavior of particles and fluids due to the complicated physics that underlie AC electrokinetics. It is the goal of this publication to explain the physics and elucidate particle and fluid behavior. Our analysis also covers how to fabricate the electrode structures that generate them, and how to interpret a wide number of experimental observations using several popular device designs. This video article will help scientists and engineers understand these phenomena and may encourage them to start using AC Electrokinetics in their research.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectric field 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectroosmosis 3ahealth services 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3amicroelectrodes1 aOh, Jonghyun1 aCapurro, Jorge1 aNoh, Moses,0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2008 July 28, , no. 17 p.e813-e813dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/8133Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/813/ac-electrokinetic-phenomena-generated-by-microelectrode-structures  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245007700159300002000236520127800256592002801534650001901562650001601581650001701597650001701614650001401631653001801645653002501663653001801688653001301706653001001719700001301729700005701742700005401799773015001853856008102003852000902084655001202093IND60754956520221119160800.0211027e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075495652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c051852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lu10aFunctional Hybrid Micro/Nanoentities Promote Agro-Food Safety Inspection  ap. 12402-12417.  aThe rapid development of nanomaterials has provided a good theoretical basis and technical support to solve the problems of food safety inspection.

CAP and CP performed best in a preliminary comparative test. The former was chosen because of its more favourable FDA classification for food contact substances. CAP effectiveness was studied in relation to the reduction in volatile phenols with doses of up to 20g/l and wine contact times of up to 60min. Using 4g/l, reduction of both phenols was, on average, 31–32% in defective red wines. Wine treatment affected neither colour nor total proanthocyanidins and catechins, and wines were judged to be better than the corresponding spoiled controls. CAP fibre can be regenerated by washing with ethanol or aqueous solution (pH 12), without notable changes in depletion efficiency. The technological characteristics of CAP and, to a lesser extent, CP offer interesting prospects for producing filtration beds, pads and membranes for the treatment of wines and beverages affected by “Brett character”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3acolor 3aethanol 3afiltration 3aflavanols 3aoff flavors 3apH 3aproanthocyanidins 3apropionates 3ared wines1 aPuecher, C.1 aRohregger, S.1 aMalacarne, M.1 aNicolini, G.0 tFood chemistry.g2012 June 15, v. 132, no. 4 p.2126-2130dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245017400154300001600328500002000344520083000364592002801194650001501222650002001237650001801257650002001275650001301295650001301308650000901321650003001330650001301360650001201373650003501385651001001420700001401430700001501444700001401459700001701473700002501490773009701515856007301612852000901685655001201694IND60571776120221120192613.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057177612DNAL7 a10.1111/age.124782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdenyo, C.10aGenome‐wide DNA markers to support genetic management for domestication and commercial production in a large rodent, the Ghanaian grasscutter (Thryonomys swinderianus)  ap. 113-115.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDomestication and commercial production of the grasscutter, Thryonomys swinderianus, a large rodent, represents an important opportunity to secure sustainable animal protein for local communities in West Africa. To support production, DNA markers are required for population diversity assessment, pedigree analysis and marker‐assisted selection. This study reports the application of double‐digest RAD sequencing to simultaneously discover and genotype SNP markers in 24 wild and recently domesticated grasscutters. An initial panel of 1209 SNP loci was characterised from a total of more than 21 000 candidate loci containing single SNPs. This genome‐wide resource represents the first application of its type to commercial production of a large rodent for food and advances the use of agricultural genomics in Ghana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThryonomys 3aanimal proteins 3adomestication 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agenotype 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3apedigree 3arodents 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aGhana1 aOgden, R.1 aKayang, B.1 aOnuma, M.1 aNakajima, N.1 aInoue‐Murayama, M.0 tAnimal genetics.g2017 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.113-115dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.124783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003900117024004200156040001800198100001900216245009600235300001600331520197000347592002802317596001002345596000902355596001002364650001502374650001302389650002502402650001202427650003102439650001702470650001102487650001302498650001502511650001602526650000902542650001402551650000902565650001502574650002502589650001502614651001902629651002402648700002202672700001702694700001802711700002302729773015102752856011402903856008503017961000903102852000903111655001203120IND60754464220221121065021.0221002e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075446422DNAL7 a10113/75446422hdl7 a10.1080/15287394.2021.18877832doi7 a10.1080/15287394.2021.18877832chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurger, Joanna10aRole of uncertainties in protecting ecological resources during remediation and restoration  ap. 485-502.  aCleanup of contaminated waste sites is a National priority to protect human health and the environment, while restoring land to productive uses. While there are uncertainties with understanding risk to individuals from exposure, the aim of this study was to focus on uncertainties and complexities for ecological systems, complicated by hundreds of species occupying any remediation site which participate in multiple-interacting food webs. The ability to better predict the effectiveness of remediation in fostering future ecosystems might facilitate remedy selection and improve strategic environmental management. This investigation examined (1) uncertainties in ecosystem processes, (2) uncertainties in exposure from contamination before remediation, and (3) uncertainties during remediation. Two Department of Energy sites Hanford Site and Savannah River Site were used as case studies to illustrate how the uncertainties affect eco-receptors. Several types of ecological, physical, and human dimension uncertainties are defined. Ecological uncertainties include temporal, spatial, individual, developmental, and exogenous types. Physical uncertainties are weather-related, watershed variations, slope/aspect, soil/sediment structure and form, unforeseen events, and temporal patterns. Human dimension uncertainties include current land use, future land use, extractive and non-extractive recreation. The effects of remedial strategies varied between the two sites because Hanford is a primarily arid shrub-steppe ecotype, while Savannah River is a wet forest ecotype. Defining the associated ecological sensitivities and uncertainties and providing examples might help policy-makers, managers, planners, and contractors to be aware of issues to consider throughout planning, remediation, and restoration. Adding ecological uncertainty analysis to risk evaluations and remediation planning is analogous to using safety factors in human health risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDOE  cUSDA  cUSDOE 3aecosystems 3aecotypes 3aenvironmental health 3aforests 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aland use 3arecreation 3aremediation 3arisk 3asediments 3asoil 3atoxicology 3auncertainty analysis 3awatersheds 3aSavannah River 3aSavannah River Site1 aGochfeld, Michael1 aBunn, Amoret1 aLooney, Brian1 aJeitner, Christian0 tJournal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A.g2021 June 18, v. 84, no. 12 p.485-502dInforma UK LimitedwJournal:12324x1528-73947nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/75446423Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15287394.2021.18877833Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01250naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245007200163300001200235520038900247592002800636650001600664650001700680650001200697650001400709700002000723700002300743773010400766856008100870852000900951655001200960IND60561544320221118020729.0180905e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056154432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2016.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivkin, Anna10aMalaria Parasites Distribute Subversive Messages across Enemy Lines  ap. 2-4.  aDuring its life cycle, the malaria parasite must cope with a set of diverse environments and institute strategies to alter its host's responses.

Nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region were used to assess whether these geographical stocks are genetically distinct. Beluga whale samples from 25 sites were collected primarily from aboriginal subsistence hunts across North America from 1984 to 1994. Thirty‐nine mtDNA haplotypes were identified in 628 beluga samples. No differences were found in the distribution of haplotypes between male and female beluga whales at any sampling site. These haplotypes segregated into two distinct assemblages in both a haplotype network and a neighbour‐joining tree. The haplotype assemblages had a geographically disjunct distribution that suggests postglacial recolonization of the North American Arctic from two different refugia. An analysis of molecular variance based on haplotype relationships and frequency indicated genetic heterogeneity among beluga whale summering groups (P≤ 0.001). Sequence divergence estimates between sampling sites also indicated geographical differentiation, particularly between samples taken at east Hudson Bay or St Lawrence River and the western or central Arctic.

We explored the effects of a common herbicide (atrazine and alachlor) and fertilizer (urea) tank mixture on juvenile frog corticosterone stress levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and pesticide bioaccumulation. Single agrochemical or tank mixtures were applied to terrestrial microcosms, and then individual Southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephala) juveniles were added to microcosms for an 8‐h exposure. Afterward, frogs were transferred to aquatic microcosms for 1 h to monitor corticosterone prior to euthanasia, brain tissues were excised to evaluate AChE, and tissue homogenates were analyzed for pesticide bioconcentation with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Atrazine significantly increased corticosterone in frogs, particularly when combined with alachlor and urea. Atrazine increased AChE and urea decreased AChE, although no interactive effects of chemical combinations were discernible. Relative to their individual treatments, the complete tank mixture with all 3 agrochemicals resulted in 64% greater bioconcentration of atrazine and 54% greater bioconcentration of alachlor in frog tissues. Our results suggest that agrochemical mixtures as well as their active ingredients can lead to altered stress levels and impaired physiological responses in amphibians. An improved understanding of the effects of co‐exposure to environmental contaminants in amphibians is important in assessing the ecological risks these compounds pose.

Two short rationally designed peptides K3C6SPD and F20H differing in the presence of a single pH-sensitive histidine residue were studied as the model peptides. The assembly kinetics studies demonstrated that the substitution of phenylalanine in K3C6SPD with histidine (F20H) significantly slowed down the peptide assembly rate at all three tested pHs (pH 9.5, pH 7.4 and pH 5.0). At the same time, this F to H substitution led to the increased pH-responsive assembly kinetics. By treating the peptide sample at the beginning of the assembly process at pH 9.5 for 5 min with the ultrasound power of 2.1 W cm⁻², the assembly rate of peptide F20H was significantly accelerated with the lag phase being shortened from 10 days to 2 days. For the disassembly of F20H peptide nanofibrils preformed at pH 9.5, upon pH adjustment from pH 9.5 to pH 5.0, 5 min ultrasonication of the nanofibrils resulted in the nanofibril disassembly within 6 hours, instead of 5 days in the absence of ultrasound. On the contrary, similar ultrasound treatment of the peptide K3C6SPD did not produce any obvious effect on both assembly and disassembly processes. This study offers an effective strategy to modulate the stimuli-responsiveness of the peptide-based biomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3ahistidine 3amodels 3ananofibers 3apH 3apeptides 3aphenylalanine 3aultrasonic treatment1 aLiu, Jianhui1 aChau, Ying0 tRSC advances.g2018 Aug. 20, v. 8, no. 51 p.29482-29487dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra04391d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245014200173300001600315520116700331592002801498650002901526650001301555650002001568650001301588650001101601650002501612650001401637700001401651700001501665700001901680773010401699856005501803852000901858655001201867IND4406749520221120155556.0120428e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440674952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.01956.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chengsong10aComparative growth performances of diploid and triploid Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis (Osbeck, 1765) under different salinities  ap. 962-969.  aThis study aimed at evaluating the ploidy effects on growth performances of Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis Osbeck, 1765) reared in different salinities under laboratory conditions. In the acute salinity experiment, there was no difference (P>0.05) in tolerance observed in triploid and diploid shrimp due to abrupt salinity changes. The lethal salinity for 50% of the individuals in 96âh at 23â25âÂ°C was about 2âgâLâ1 in both triploids and diploids. While for the chronic salinity experiment, statistical analyses confirmed that the differences in growth performances including the specific growth rate (SGR), the feeding rate (FR), feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and intermoult period (IP) between triploid and diploid were related to salinity. Diploid shrimp reared in 20âgâLâ1 exhibited highest SGR (P<0.05), while triploids performed well in 20 and 30âgâLâ1 salinities (P<0.05). Based on the survival and growth data, the optimal salinity for the culture of diploid F. chinensis should be 20âgâLâ1 and for triploids it should be between 20 and 30âgâLâ1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFenneropenaeus chinensis 3adiploidy 3afeed conversion 3asalinity 3ashrimp 3astatistical analysis 3atriploidy1 aLi, Fuhua1 aYu, Kuijie1 aXiang, Jianhai0 tAquaculture research.g2008 June, v. 39, no. 9 p.962-969dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.01956.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001500285500001500300520105900315592002801374650001701402650001501419650001801434650001401452650001901466650003301485650001001518650001101528650001801539651001001557653000901567653001701576700001901593700001801612700001501630773013701645856004801782852000901830655001201839IND50062216920221116144223.0130321e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006221692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-013-2069-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhongheng10aPhylogenetic analyses of four species of Ulva and Monostroma grevillei using ITS, rbc L and 18S rDNA sequence data  ap. 97-105.  a2019-12-06  aChlorophyta species are common in the southern and northern coastal areas of China. In recent years, frequent green tide incidents in Chinese coastal waters have raised concerns and attracted the attention of scientists. In this paper, we sequenced the 18S rDNA genes, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the rbc L genes in seven organisms and obtained 536–566 bp long ITS sequences, 1 377–1 407 bp long rbc L sequences and 1 718–1 761 bp long partial 18S rDNA sequences. The GC base pair content was highest in the ITS regions and lowest in the rbc L genes. The sequencing results showed that the three Ulva prolifera (or U. pertusa) gene sequences from Qingdao and Nan’ao Island were identical. The ITS, 18S rDNA and rbc L genes in U. prolifera and U. pertusa from different sea areas in China were unchanged by geographic distance. U. flexuosa had the least evolutionary distance from U. californica in both the ITS regions (0.009) and the 18S rDNA (0.002). These data verified that Ulva and Enteromorpha are not separate genera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3aMonostroma 3aribosomal DNA 3aphylogeny 3aUlva prolifera 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3agenes 3acoasts 3acoastal water 3aChina 0aUlva 0aEnteromorpha1 aShen, Songdong1 aChen, Weizhou1 aLi, Huihui0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2013 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.97-105dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-013-2069-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245018400167300001300351520092400364592002801288650001201316650001501328650001501343650001601358650001701374650001401391650001001405650001601415650001801431650002801449650001201477650002301489651001501512653003001527653001201557653001201569653001201581653001301593653001901606653001501625700002501640773012301665856008001788852000901868655001201877IND60477681520221123043505.0160105e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047768152DNAL7 a10.18475/cjos.v43i1.a22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBursey, Charles R.10aNew Species of Hedruris (Nematoda: Hedruridae), Anuracanthorhynchus lutzi (Hamann, 1891) n. comb. and other Helminths in Lithobates warszewitschii (Anura: Ranidae) from Costa Rica  ap. 1-10.  aHedruris heyeri n. sp.

Wild Norwegian (East Atlantic) salmon stocks are thought to be especially susceptible to the parasite due to lack of co-adaptation, contrary to Baltic salmon stocks. This study i) identifies whether time- and density-dependent mechanisms in gyrodactylid population growth exist in G. salaris-Atlantic salmon interactions and ii) based on differences between Norwegian and Baltic stocks, determines whether the ‘Atlantic susceptible, Baltic resistant’ paradigm holds as an example of local adaptation. METHODS: A total of 18 datasets of G. salaris population growth on individually isolated Atlantic salmon (12 different stocks) infected with three parasite strains were re-analysed using a Bayesian approach. Datasets included over 2000 observations of 388 individual fish. RESULTS: The best fitting model of population growth was time-limited; parasite population growth rate declined consistently from the beginning of infection. We found no evidence of exponential population growth in any dataset. In some stocks, a density dependence in the size of the initial inoculum limited the maximum rate of parasite population growth. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that all Norwegian and Scottish Atlantic salmon stocks are equally susceptible to G. salaris, while Baltic stocks control and limit infections due to co-evolution. Northern and Western Norwegian as well as the Scottish Shin stocks, support higher initial parasite population growth rates than Baltic, South-eastern Norwegian, or the Scottish Conon stocks, and several Norwegian stocks tested (Akerselva, Altaelva, Lierelva, Numedalslågen), and the Scottish stocks (i.e. Conon, Shin), were able to limit infections after 40–50 days. No significant differences in performance of the three parasite strains (Batnfjordselva, Figga, and Lierelva), or the two parasite mitochondrial haplotypes (A and F) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a spectrum of growth rates, with some fish of the South-eastern Norwegian stocks sustaining parasite population growth rates overlapping those seen on Baltic Neva and Indalsälv stocks. This observation is inconsistent with the ‘Baltic-resistant, Atlantic-susceptible’ hypothesis, but suggests heterogeneity, perhaps linked to other host resistance genes driven by selection for local disease syndromes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aGyrodactylus salaris 3aSalmo salar 3acoevolution 3adata collection 3aectoparasites 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ainoculum 3amitochondria 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3asalmon1 aBakke, Tor A.1 aHarris, Philip D.0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.392-392dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0981-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245008200211300001600293506007600309520171800385592002802103506003702131650001902168650001102187650001402198650001802212650001302230650001602243650002302259650001002282650001402292650001502306650003302321650001802354650002102372650002602393650002502419650001102444650001602455650001302471650002002484650001802504650002202522650002202544650001102566700001802577700003102595700003002626700002102656700002502677700002002702773009602722856008102818852000902899655001202908IND60585587920221207074457.0171111e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058558792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-017-3968-32doi7 aPMC56816002pmcid7 a290324642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonkersley, Philip10aNutritional composition of honey bee food stores vary with floral composition  ap. 749-761.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSufficiently diverse and abundant resources are essential for generalist consumers, and form an important part of a suite of conservation strategies for pollinators. Honey bees are generalist foragers and are dependent on diverse forage to adequately meet their nutritional needs. Through analysis of stored pollen (bee bread) samples obtained from 26 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) hives across NW-England, we quantified bee bread nutritional content and the plant species that produced these stores from pollen. Protein was the most abundant nutrient by mass (63%), followed by carbohydrates (26%). Protein and lipid content (but not carbohydrate) contributed significantly to ordinations of floral diversity, linking dietary quality with forage composition. DNA sequencing of the ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA gene identified pollen from 89 distinct plant genera, with each bee bread sample containing between 6 and 35 pollen types. Dominant genera included dandelion (Taraxacum), which was positively correlated with bee bread protein content, and cherry (Prunus), which was negatively correlated with the amount of protein. In addition, proportions of amino acids (e.g. histidine and valine) varied as a function of floral species composition. These results also quantify the effects of individual plant genera on the nutrition of honey bees. We conclude that pollens of different plants act synergistically to influence host nutrition; the pollen diversity of bee bread is linked to its nutrient content. Diverse environments compensate for the loss of individual forage plants, and diversity loss may, therefore, destabilize consumer communities due to restricted access to alternative resources.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApis mellifera 3aPrunus 3aTaraxacum 3acarbohydrates 3acherries 3acorrelation 3aforage composition 3agenes 3ahistidine 3ahoney bees 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alipid content 3anutrient content 3anutrient requirements 3anutritional adequacy 3apollen 3apollinators 3apropolis 3aprotein content 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3aspecies diversity 3avaline1 aRhodes, Glenn1 aPickup, R.

High throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed 133 reproducible seed protein mass peaks. Thirty-one seed protein mass peaks were detected in all 15 combinations of cultivar×environment. Twenty mass peaks were influenced by cultivars irrespective of environment. Only six protein mass peaks were influenced by environments. Seventy-six mass peaks were highly variable. Number of mass peaks of lupin seed protein is mostly genetically controlled (P=0.008) with no significant influence of the environment (P=0.131). Environment and cultivar interactions were not significant (P=0.889). Multivariate analyses of mass peak profiles supported the above analysis showing that protein mass peak profile was significantly (P=0.001) influenced by cultivar but not by environment (P=0.053). This result indicates the possibility of breeding new lupin cultivars targeting specific proteins for human food and animal feed without being too concerned about environmental influences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLupinus angustifolius 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3afeeds 3amass spectrometry 3amultivariate analysis 3aprotein sources 3aseed storage proteins 3aseeds 0acultivar 0aMALDI-TOF 0amass peak profile 0aseed protein1 aMa, Wujun1 aBuirchell, Bevan J.1 aAppels, R.1 aYan, Guijun0 tCrop & pasture science.g2012, v. 63, no. 12 p.1066-1074dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP12268  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003900117024004200156040001800198100002000216245005800236506007600294506003100370506002800401506004300429520181600472592002802288596003502316596000802351596000902359506003702368650003102405650002602436650001702462650000902479650002102488650001502509650001002524650001102534650001902545650001902564650003402583650003002617650001702647650001402664650002202678650002202700650001302722700002202735700002002757700002602777700002302803700002102826773005502847856011402902856008603016961000903102852000903111655001203120IND60754464520221215142409.0220901e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075446452DNAL7 a10113/75446452hdl7 a10.1080/19490976.2021.19072712doi7 a10.1080/19490976.2021.19072712chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoden, Heidi L.10aCompletion of the gut microbial epi-bile acid pathway  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aInforma UK Limited License Information  aBile acids are detergent molecules that solubilize dietary lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins. Humans synthesize bile acids with α-orientation hydroxyl groups which can be biotransformed by gut microbiota to toxic, hydrophobic bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA). Gut microbiota can also convert hydroxyl groups from the α-orientation through an oxo-intermediate to the β-orientation, resulting in more hydrophilic, less toxic bile acids. This interconversion is catalyzed by regio- (C-3 vs. C-7) and stereospecific (α vs. β) hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDHs). So far, genes encoding the urso- (7α-HSDH & 7β-HSDH) and iso- (3α-HSDH & 3β-HSDH) bile acid pathways have been described. Recently, multiple human gut clostridia were reported to encode 12α-HSDH, which interconverts DCA and 12-oxolithocholic acid (12-oxoLCA). 12β-HSDH completes the epi-bile acid pathway by converting 12-oxoLCA to the 12β-bile acid denoted epiDCA; however, a gene(s) encoding this enzyme has yet to be identified. We confirmed 12β-HSDH activity in cultures of Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780. From six candidate C. paraputrificum ATCC 25780 oxidoreductase genes, we discovered the first gene (DR024_RS09610) encoding bile acid 12β-HSDH. Phylogenetic analysis revealed unforeseen diversity for 12β-HSDH, leading to validation of two additional bile acid 12β-HSDHs through a synthetic biology approach. By comparison to a previous phylogenetic analysis of 12α-HSDH, we identified the first potential C-12 epimerizing strains: Collinsella tanakaei YIT 12063 and Collinsella stercoris DSM 13279. A Hidden Markov Model search against human gut metagenomes located putative 12β-HSDH genes in about 30% of subjects within the cohorts analyzed, indicating this gene is relevant in the human gut microbiome.  aPublisher supplied data  cIllinois Campus Research Board  cNIH  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium paraputrificum 3aCollinsella stercoris 3aMarkov chain 3abile 3adeoxycholic acid 3adetergents 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametagenomics 3aphylogeny 3astereospecificity 3asynthetic biology 3atoxicity1 aWolf, Patricia G.1 aGaskins, H.

Structural characterization revealed that PSP-2 with a molecular weight of 144.8 kDa was composed of fucose (21.6%), arabinose (2.5%), galactose (22.4%), glucose (2.2%), xylose (18.8%), mannose (1.2%), glucuronic acid (7.7%) and galacturonic acid (23.6%). The backbone chain of PSP-2 was composed of →1)-β-d-Xylp-(3→, →1,3)-β-l-Fucp-(4→, →1)-α-d-Galp-(6→, and →1)-α-d-GlcpNAc-(2→, and the side chains were composed of →1,3,6)-α-d-Galp-(2→, →3)-β-l-Fucp-(1,4→, β-d-GalpNAc-(1→, and α-d-Manp-(1→. In vitro hypoglycemic assays indicated that PSP-2 could significantly enhance glucose consumption, glycogen synthesis, and pyruvate kinase (PK) and hexokinase (HK) activities of insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the underlying mechanistic studies revealed that PSP-2 could ameliorate insulin resistance by up-regulating the expression levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), glycogen synthase (GS), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4). These results suggested that PSP-2 may be a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum 3aarabinose 3afucose 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglucuronic acid 3aglycemic effect 3aglycogen 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3ahexokinase 3ahuman cell lines 3ainsulin receptor substrate proteins 3ainsulin resistance 3amannose 3amolecular weight 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3apyruvate kinase 3axylose1 aZhang, Bin1 aLi, Chao1 aHuang, Qiang1 aFuehrer, Bernhard,1 aLiu, Rui Hai0 tFood & function.g2019 May 22, v. 10, no. 5 p.2828-2838dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8fo02525h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011000157300002000267520165700287592002801944650004401972650001602016650002202032650003702054650001702091650001302108650001402121650002302135650001702158650001302175650001302188650001702201650001502218650001302233650004402246650001402290650001102304650003102315650001302346650001202359650001202371650002002383650001402403650001302417650001302430700001902443700003102462700002002493773012402513856007402637852000902711655001202720IND60640826520221120080144.0190505e20160712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064082652DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra09736g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhimi, Baker10aSynergy between vanadium and molybdenum in bimetallic ZSM-5 supported catalysts for ethylene ammoxidation  ap. 65866-65878.  aAmmoxidation of ethylene to acetonitrile was studied on V/ZSM-5, Mo/ZSM-5 and V–Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by a solid-state ion exchange method. The physico-chemical properties were investigated by means of XRD, N₂ physisorption, ²⁷Al and ²⁹Si MAS NMR, UV-Vis DRS, XPS, pyridine-IR and FT-IR spectroscopies and H₂-TPR/O₂-TPO. Based on the characterization results, M–Oₓ (M = V or Mo) species react with zeolite protons during the exchange process and generate new Lewis acid sites, which act as redox centers. The M–Oₓ species are essentially, monomeric and dimeric/polymeric species or metal oxide crystallites (less than 4 nm) highly dispersed in the channel and/or on the external surface of zeolite. For the Mo/ZSM-5 sample, the formation of Al₂(MoO₄)₃ nano-crystallites was observed. UV-Vis DRS and TPR results showed that V and Mo species in all catalysts are mainly in the highest oxidation states. The V–Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited a more reversible behavior of the M–Oₓ centers throughout the H₂/O₂ redox cycles than those in V/ZSM-5 and Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts. The best catalytic performance was achieved over the bimetallic V–Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst. These results revealed that the partial substitution of molybdenum with vanadium has a positive effect on the activity and the selectivity to acetonitrile. This implies clearly that a synergetic effect between V and Mo species plays an important role in the ammoxidation reaction. This synergetic effect is related to the existence of electronic interaction at short range order between the V and Mo species, which may influence the catalyst redox properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis acids 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetonitrile 3aaluminum 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystallites 3aethylene 3ahydrogen 3aion exchange 3amolybdenum 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3aprotons 3asilicon 3astable isotopes 3asynergism 3avanadium 3azeolites1 aMhamdi, Mourad1 aKalevaru, Venkata Narayana1 aMartin, Andreas0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 12, v. 6, no. 70 p.65866-65878dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra09736g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04332naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016600171300001400337520266300351592002803014650002503042650002003067650001303087650001103100650001203111650002003123650001503143650001903158650001203177650001103189650001403200650001503214650001503229650001303244650001403257650001003271650001703281650001203298650001203310650001403322651001103336653002503347653002103372653001803393653003603411653002303447653002303470700002003493700002103513700002603534773010103560856008403661852000903745655001203754IND60606290420221119174119.0180725e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060629042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2016.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBábek, Ondřej,10aDevonian/Carboniferous boundary glacioeustatic fluctuations in a platform-to-basin direction: A geochemical approach of sequence stratigraphy in pelagic settings  ap. 81-99.  aWe investigated high-resolution stratigraphic distribution of selected major and trace elements and gamma-ray spectra of fourteen Devonian/Carboniferous (D/C) boundary sections of Europe located in the late Palaeozoic Laurussia and Gondwana. The aim was to trace the geochemical signature of a marked forced and normal regressive interval which was associated with rapid progradation of siliciclastics into the marine carbonate systems (Rhenish Massif) and a prominent hiatus in shallow-water ramp settings (Namur–Dinant Basin). This interval represents the late Devonian Hangenberg event (HBE) sensu lato (middle praesulcata conodont zone) as defined by previous authors. This regressive interval (FSST to LST) correlates with thin shale layers (HBE shale) sandwiched between monotonous nodular calcilutite/calcisiltite successions at five pelagic sections of Moravia, Carnic Alps, Montagne Noire, and Pyrenees. In all sections with continuous D/C sedimentation (i.e., except those of the Namur–Dinant Basin), the HBE s.l. interval is accompanied by elevated percentages of detrital proxies (Al, K, Rb, Zr) and changes in their ratios (Zr/Rb, K/Al, Rb/K) which are normally interpreted as indicators of increased siliciclastic input, provenance, and grain size. Zr/Rb and other proxies are traceable even without apparent lithological evidence and can, therefore, facilitate stratigraphic correlation. Paleoredox and productivity proxies (U/Th and Ni/Rb enrichment factors) only rarely show elevated values in the Hangenberg black shale interval, indicating that the associated water dysoxia/anoxia was a local rather than global phenomenon. Global correlations based on the HBE black shales should therefore be dropped in favor of the HBE s.l. interval. Moreover, analysis of sedimentation rates in the upper expansa to kockeli zone interval using the published radiometric ages suggests that the HBE s.l. was a time of significant increase in the rate of siliciclastic supply into the ocean, even in the most distal pelagic sections. Consequently, the previous interpretation of the HBE black shale as a condensed succession deposited during rapid sea-level rise seems unlikely. We interpret the HBE s.l. (i.e., including the HBE black shale) as a marine record of glacioeustatic sea-level drop and increased aeolian transport in connection with late Devonian climatic cooling and glaciation. The set of geochemical markers related to the late Devonian sea-level fluctuation can be used for super-regional to global correlations from platform to basin settings. Moreover, they can facilitate current efforts to determine a new D/C boundary definition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarboniferous period 3aDevonian period 3aaluminum 3abasins 3adysoxia 3agamma radiation 3aglaciation 3aglobal cooling 3ahypoxia 3anickel 3apotassium 3aprovenance 3aradiometry 3arubidium 3asea level 3ashale 3astratigraphy 3athorium 3auranium 3azirconium 3aEurope 0aElement geochemistry 0aHangenberg event 0aGlacioeustasy 0aDevonian/Carboniferous boundary 0aSedimentation rate 0aPelagic carbonates1 aKumpan, Tomáš1 aKalvoda, Jiří,1 aMatys Grygar, Tomáš0 tSedimentary geology.g2016 May 15, v. 337 p.81-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2016.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245012700151300001600278500002000294520147300314592002801787650001901815650002401834650002001858650001401878650001501892650001501907650001301922650003201935650001701967650001201984651001601996700001302012773013302025856007202158852000902230655001202239IND60595584920221119140649.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059558492DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.32742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, C.10aBarriers, challenges, conflicts, and facilitators in environmental decision‐making: A case of An'Yang Stream restoration  ap. 472-480.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this article, we discuss the An'Yang Stream restoration case in South Korea from the time frame of 1999–2015. This restoration has been judged as a successful stream management endeavour led by public–private partnership governance. However, this study found that integration of all interests was not properly achieved. The An'Yang Stream restoration process was designed by stakeholders who valued scientific information rather than non‐scientific factors such as culture, social learning (education), social integrity, and waterfront beautification based on a participatory process. The An'Yang Stream restoration project is important because it is one of the main streams in the metropolitan Seoul and serves as the focal point for the nation culturally, politically, and economically. The researchers conducted semistructured interviews with the 33 key stakeholders who actively participated in the stream restoration project. The axial coding based on Grounded Theory provided a clear way of adopting various codes and coding processes, which reflect the interview transcripts of the specific social phenomenon and power dynamics. This research describes the pros and cons of the An'Yang Stream restoration governance process and participatory decision‐making by applying a qualitative axial coding analysis. Also, this research addresses the contribution of media and professional conflict resolution for potentially participatory governance building.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeautification 3aconflict management 3adecision making 3aeducation 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3alearning 3apublic-private partnerships 3astakeholders 3astreams 3aSouth Korea1 aChun, H.0 tRiver research and applications.g2018 June, v. 34, no. 5 p.472-480dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.32743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012200167300001600289500001500305520079900320592002801119650001901147650002201166650002101188650001401209650001201223650001301235650003401248650000901282650001201291650002301303650002001326650002501346650001801371653002501389653001701414653002001431700001401451700001801465700001501483700001801498773010801516856008601624852000901710655001201719IND60540852620221122075302.0190318e20150306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054085262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Peng10aCharacterization and antioxidant activities of the polysaccharides from mycelium of Phellinus pini and culture medium  ap. 600-604.  a2019-12-06  aTwo polysaccharides isolated and purified from the mycelium (PPM) and its culture medium (PPE) of Phellinus pini using gel filtration were subjected to composition analysis and valuated for the antioxidant activity. The average molecular weights of PPM and PPE were approximately 22.0 and 38.0kDa, respectively. PPM and PPE were both neutral heteropolysaccharides consisting of mannose, galactose, and glucose with molecular ratios of 2.99:1.00:0.34 and 38.40:1.00:1.76, respectively. In vitro antioxidant assay, PPM and PPE could scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and hydroxyl radical, chelate ferrous ion and reduce ferric ion. The antioxidant activities of PPM were stronger than those of PPE, suggesting that PPM has significant potential as a natural antioxidant agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhellinus pini 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amolecular weight 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amycelium 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3airon 3amannose 3agel chromatography 3apolysaccharides 3aantioxidant activity 3aculture media 0aAntioxidant activity 0aantioxidants 0aPolysaccharides1 aYuan, Lei1 aCai, Dongling1 aJiao, Lili1 aZhang, Liping0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Mar. 06, v. 117 p.600-604dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009500165300001600260520159000276592002801866650001201894650001401906650001201920650001601932650001501948650001501963650001801978650001401996650001302010700002202023773011002045856008202155852000902237655001202246IND60085275320221121221930.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008527532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2012.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozi, János10aCatalytic thermal decomposition of polyamides and polyurethanes mixed with acidic zeolites  ap. 189-197.  aThe purpose of this work was to examine the pyrolysis products derived from zeolite–polyamide and zeolite–polyurethane mixtures prepared in different ratios in order to elucidate the chemical reactions taking place under pyrolysis of these polymers in the presence of acidic Y zeolites (ultra stabilized HY (HUSY) and NH₄NaY). Therefore 5:1, 3:1, and 1:1 ratios of zeolite and nitrogen-containing polymer (polyamides and polyurethanes) mixtures were pyrolysed at 500°C in a micro-pyrolyser on-line coupled with GC/MS. The products and product distribution of zeolite–polymer mixtures indicate that the amount of catalysts significantly affects the pyrolysis product distribution. In case of zeolite–PA-6,6 1:1 mixtures hexanedinitrile is the main pyrolysis product indicating that the thermal decomposition of PA-6,6 via cis-elimination is enhanced. Main pyrolysis products of zeolite–PA-6 mixtures of 1:1 ratio are dihydro-azepine isomers that are the dehydrated derivatives of ɛ-caprolactam. Pyrolysis of 1:1 zeolite–PA-12 mixtures leads to the promoted formation of dehydrated cyclic monomer isomers (azacyclotrideca-dienes). For zeolite–PUR 1:1 mixtures it was concluded that MDI decomposition to N-containing aromatics is enhanced, while the polyester and polyether segments degrade to monomer type products and to aromatics. For all zeolite–polymer mixtures increasing ratio of catalysts leads to increased amount of aromatics (benzene and naphthalene compounds) and light unsaturated hydrocarbons, while the amount of main products of 1:1 mixtures decreases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3aisomers 3anaphthalene 3apolyamides 3apolyesters 3apolyurethanes 3apyrolysis 3azeolites1 aBlazsó, Marianne0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2012 Sept., v. 97 p.189-197dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2012.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010700170300001400277520215100291592002802442650002602470650002202496650001402518650002302532650001202555650001102567650001002578650002602588650002402614650001402638650001102652650001002663650001802673650001402691653001402705653004502719653001802764653004302782653002402825700001602849700001502865773011702880856008602997852000903083655001203092IND60606274620221121023046.0180725e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060627462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2015.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunting, M.J.10aApproaches to quantitative reconstruction of woody vegetation in managed woodlands from pollen records  ap. 53-66.  aThere has been increasing interest in developing quantitative methods for reconstructing the dynamics of cultural landscapes over the last 15years. This paper adds to this literature by using various approaches to reconstruct the vegetation of two woodlands subject to rotational coppicing (the periodic cutting of broadleaved trees and shrubs for wood products). Pollen deposition at ground level was determined at both sites using ‘Tauber’ traps placed near to the centre of 14 compartments of differing age in the coppice rotation. For the main woody taxa, Relative Pollen Productivity (RPP) estimates were derived using linear regression for pollen influx data and Extended R-value analysis for percentage data. The vegetation around three ponds was reconstructed by applying four methods (inverting the two RPP estimate approaches, the modern analogue technique and correction for pollen productivity using the linear regression estimated RPP values) to pollen data obtained from the uppermost sample of sediment from the ponds. To determine whether these methods gave better estimates of the vegetation composition than the original pollen proportions, the results were compared with the surveyed vegetation around each pond using the Bray–Curtis Index. Linear regression of pollen influx produced RPP values which are comparable with previous European studies, whilst for some taxa the Extended R-value analysis produced estimates which are orders of magnitude different both from values derived from the linear regression and previous work. No single approach performed equally well at reconstructing the vegetation around the ponds, and at two of the three locations the uncorrected pollen proportions were most similar to the surveyed vegetation. We conclude that applying quantitative reconstruction methods to individual small sites is, currently, not likely to be useful in complex cultural landscapes. In the context of coppiced woodland, deficiencies in our understanding of pollen taphonomy and the impact of the practice on pollen production first need to be rectified, and we identify strategies to address this situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3abroadleaved trees 3acoppicing 3acultural landscape 3acutting 3apollen 3aponds 3aquantitative analysis 3aregression analysis 3asediments 3ashrubs 3atraps 3awood products 3awoodlands 0aCoppicing 0aModern pollen–vegetation relationships 0aPalaeoecology 0aPollen dispersal and deposition models 0aWoodland management1 aGrant, M.J.1 aWaller, M.0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2016 Feb., v. 225 p.53-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2015.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245019000201506007600391520153200467592002801999506003702027650001602064650001202080650001002092650002002102650001002122650002902132650002502161650002702186650001102213650002302224650002602247650001002273650002102283700001802304700002302322700002102345700002702366700002202393700001802415700001702433700002702450700003002477700001902507700003302526700001802559700002102577700002602598700002302624700002302647700002102670773012202691856007402813852000902887655001202896IND60660527520221207050122.0190823e20190726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066052752DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110817322doi7 aPMC67237822pmcid7 a313575342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarràs, Marta 12aA Functional Virgin Olive Oil Enriched with Olive Oil and Thyme Phenolic Compounds Improves the Expression of Cholesterol Efflux-Related Genes: A Randomized, Crossover, Controlled Trial  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe consumption of antioxidant-rich foods such as virgin olive oil (VOO) promotes high-density lipoprotein (HDL) anti-atherogenic capacities. Intake of functional VOOs (enriched with olive/thyme phenolic compounds (PCs)) also improves HDL functions, but the gene expression changes behind these benefits are not fully understood. Our aim was to determine whether these functional VOOs could enhance the expression of cholesterol efflux-related genes. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover, controlled trial, 22 hypercholesterolemic subjects ingested for three weeks 25 mL/day of: (1) a functional VOO enriched with olive oil PCs (500 mg/kg); (2) a functional VOO enriched with olive oil (250 mg/kg) and thyme PCs (250 mg/kg; FVOOT), and; (3) a natural VOO (olive oil PCs: 80 mg/kg, control intervention). We assessed whether these interventions improved the expression of cholesterol efflux-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions. The FVOOT intervention upregulated the expression of CYP27A1 (p = 0.041 and p = 0.053, versus baseline and the control intervention, respectively), CAV1 (p = 0.070, versus the control intervention), and LXR&beta;, RXR&alpha;, and PPAR&beta;/&delta; (p = 0.005, p = 0.005, and p = 0.038, respectively, relative to the baseline). The consumption of a functional VOO enriched with olive oil and thyme PCs enhanced the expression of key cholesterol efflux regulators, such as CYP27A1 and nuclear receptor-related genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acholesterol 3aenzymes 3afoods 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahypercholesterolemia 3amononuclear leukocytes 3aolives 3aphenolic compounds 3areverse transcription 3athyme 3avirgin olive oil1 aArranz, Sara 1 aCarrión, Sílvia 1 aSubirana, Isaac 1 aMuñoz-Aguayo, Daniel 1 aBlanchart, Gemma 1 aKool, Marjon 1 aSolà, Rosa,1 aMotilva, María  José1 aEscolà-Gil, Joan  Carles1 aRubió, Laura 1 aFernández-Castillejo, Sara 1 aPedret, Anna 1 aEstruch, Ramón 1 aCovas, María  Isabel1 aFitó, Montserrat 1 aHernáez, Álvaro 1 aCastañer, Olga 0 tNutrients.g2019 July 26, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110817323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01396naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245008600170300001800256520043600274592002800710650001600738650001100754650002300765650002800788700001700816700001500833700001600848700001800864773010600882856008500988852000901073655001201082IND60578982220221116200001.0170815e20151106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057898222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b025562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiyang, Hai Xiao10aLewis Acid Catalyzed Tandem Polycyclization of Internal Alkynols and Vinyl Azides  ap. 5220-5223.  aA novel Lewis acid catalyzed tandem cyclization reaction of internal alkynols and vinyl azides has been achieved to afford a series of products containing a pyran-based indeno[1,2-c]isochromene scaffold in moderate to high yields.

The morphological and electrochemical properties of the prepared composite were studied by scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The prepared GOx/P-l-Arg/f-MWCNTs film modified electrode shows a well defined reversible redox couple at a formal potential of −0.45 V (vs. AgCl) with significantly enhanced peak currents corresponding to the direct electrochemistry of the GOx. The direct electron transfer process is a surface-controlled electrode process with a high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (kₛ) of 5.16 s⁻¹. Moreover, this modified electrode was demonstrated to be an efficient glucose biosensor by means of the reductive detection of oxygen consumption. The proposed biosensor possesses excellent analytical parameters for a wide linear range of glucose from 4.0 μM to 6 mM (a correlation coefficient of R² = 0.9918) with a 5 s response time. The sensitivity of the biosensor is found to be 48.86 μA cm⁻² mM⁻¹, its experimental detection limit is 0.1 μM (S/N = 3), the apparent Kₘ is calculated to be 2.2 mM and it also exhibits good storage stability for 25 days. The novel biosensor developed in this study exhibits a fast response, high stability and very good reproducibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aarginine 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aglycoproteins 3aoxygen consumption 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver chloride 3astorage quality1 aChen, Shen-Ming0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 13, v. 4, no. 92 p.50771-50781dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra06013j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245011700197300001600314500002000330520121500350592002801565596005601593596005701649596005701706596002701763650002301790650001901813650001401832650002201846650001701868650002701885650002801912650001701940650001301957650001001970700002401980773011302004856007302117852000902190655001202199IND60752111320221119125518.0210929e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075211132DNAL7 a10.1111/wre.124922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeon, Ramon G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1924-333110aPopulation and quantitative genetic analyses of life‐history trait adaptations in Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson  ap. 342-349.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAmaranthus palmeri populations can evolve life‐history traits despite its high levels of genetic diversity and gene flow. However, it was not known whether those differences were due to selection or other evolutionary processes. We used microsatellite markers to quantify genetic differentiation among 10 Amaranthus palmeri populations and determined whether the differences in life‐history traits among the populations could be attributed to selection. Genetic differentiation was small (ΦST = 0.093), indicating that there were high rates of gene flow among populations. AMOVA showed that only 9% of the genetic variability was explained by variation among populations and 90% was found within populations. Using ΦST as a surrogate for FST in the QST−FST analysis, we confirmed that most traits followed the same pattern as neutral markers and were not under selection. However, important traits for weediness such as plant height, dry weight and nitrogen use efficiency were under selection. These results provide evidence that selection forces in agroecosystems can increase weediness in A. palmeri, and that those forces should be identified to develop strategies to counter them when possible.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017‐6505‐26807cU.S. Department of Agriculture  a2018‐70006‐28933cU.S. Department of Agriculture  a2019‐68012‐29818cU.S. Department of Agriculture  aNC02653cHatch Project 3aAmaranthus palmeri 3aagroecosystems 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3alife history 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplant height 3aresearch 3aweeds1 avan der Laat, Rocio0 tWeed research.g2021 Oct., v. 61, no. 5 p.342-349dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44597x0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.124923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01537naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245014300168300001800311520050600329592002800835650001200863650001100875650002300886650002800909650001200937650001400949700001500963700001600978700001700994773010601011856008501117852000901202655001201211IND60578982320221116195655.0170815e20151106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057898232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b025702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Xiaoqiang10aRhodium(II)-Catalyzed Formal [3 + 2] Cycloaddition of N-Sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles with Isoxazoles: Entry to Polysubstituted 3-Aminopyrroles  ap. 5224-5227.  aA novel rhodium(II)-catalyzed formal [3 + 2] cycloaddition of N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles with isoxazoles has been achieved that provides an efficient method for the synthesis of polysubstituted 3-aminopyrrole derivatives.
